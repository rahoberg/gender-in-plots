1: Nenokkadine
 Gautham is a schizophrenic Indian rock musician who is missing 25 percent of his [[grey matter]]. He hallucinates a mysterious person he believes is one of the three murderers of his parents. As a child, Gautham was convinced that he was an orphan and assumes that his parents are dead; he does not remember their names or what they looked like.  At one of his concerts, Gautham sees one of the three men and chases him. Sameera, a journalist at the concert, films Gautham fighting his imaginary opponent. Gautham surrenders to the police after "killing" the man, confessing that he killed three men: one in [[Belfast]], one in [[Pune]] and one just now in Hyderabad. He is released from custody after Sameera broadcasts the video on television. According to his doctor, if Gautham can hallucinate a person other than the three men, he can be treated. Gautham goes to [[Goa]] on vacation. Sameera stalks him, convincing him that two people are stalking him: a journalist who wants to interview him (imaginary), and a person claiming to be his fan (real). Gautham begins to fall in love with Sameera. He saves her from a group of people trying to murder her; on an isolated island together Gautham learns the truth behind the fourth imaginary person and writes Sameera off as a disturbed journalist. By the time he learns about Sameera's intentions, she has left for Hyderabad; Gautham pursues her.  In Hyderabad, Gautham accidentally spoils Sameera's birthday plans, infuriating her. Although he is convinced that he has made up an enemy to cope with being an orphan, a mysterious person tries to kill Sameera. Gautham saves her and proposes marriage, which she accepts. Sameera learns that the mysterious person is Antonio Rosarios, a Goa-based crime boss who wants to kill her because she tried to expose the presence of [[hydrogen cyanide]] in seeds sold by Rosarios' company, AG1. Gautham meets Rosarios in the lobby of Sameera's office building. Assuming that he is an illusion, he shoots Rosarios in his head. By the time Gautham realises Rosarios is real he is dead, and Gautham learns that his parents were murdered. He catches an aged taxi driver who was stalking him (one of the three men he imagined), and learns that two London-based Indians (one of whom was Rosarios) killed his parents; his father gave the taxi driver a bag to give to Gautham. In the bag is an old [[Rubik's Cube]], a key and a British coin.  Gautham and Sameera go to [[London]], where they and their driver Gulaab Singh escape from a murder attempt; Gautham's manager, Michael, is killed. The Rubik's Cube, when solved a certain way, reveals a safe-deposit-box number in which Gautham finds a preserved rice sample. After escaping another murder attempt in a parking lot, he eludes the police and the two men with Sameera and Singh's help. One of the men—a fan—seeks revenge for his father (one of the other murderers, according to the aged taxi driver), who was killed by Gautham in Belfast when he performed there. Gautham learns that the aged taxi driver he met previously is a businessman and the murderer; the person hit by the businessman's car in Gautham's presence was the actual, innocent taxi driver.  Gautham and the businessman confront each other, and the businessman says that he and Gautham's father were good friends and fellow scientists. They worked on cultivating Golden rice, a variety which could grow in any weather. When Gautham's father refused to sell it in favour of distributing it globally for free, the businessman and Rosarios killed his parents. When he refuses to tell Gautham about his parents, Gautham kills him. On his way to the airport, Gautham passes the school he had attended and hears children singing a rhyme. It reminds him of a similar rhyme he learned from his mother, and he remembers his way back to his house. At his house (a dilapidated villa) Gautham finds a photo of his parents, Chandrasekhar and Kalyani. He later introduces the rice variety at a global convention as "the second green revolution", and the film ends with Gautham standing in his field of Golden rice.

13 Sins
 Elliot Brindle, a meek salesman, loses his job despite his debt and the people who depend on him: Michael, his mentally handicapped brother; Shelby, his pregnant fiancee; and an unnamed, abusive father.  Elliot receives a mysterious phone call that offers him $1,000 to assertively kill a fly that has been harassing him.  After Elliot checks his bank account online and sees that he has been credited, he accepts the next challenge: to eat the dead fly.  The caller explains that he will be offered a series of thirteen challenges, each of which will result in greater rewards.  If he fails to complete any of them, interfere in the game, or reveals the game, he will forfeit all the money.  The next few challenges attract police attention: making a child cry, arson, and scamming a homeless person.  When the child identifies Elliot in the police station based on wanted posters, Detective Chilcoat takes over the case.  Shelby becomes concerned about Elliot's secretive and odd behavior, and he explains that he is planning a surprise.  For his sixth challenge, Elliot is forced to take a corpse out for coffee.  Given a strict deadline, Elliot panics and brazenly steals a cup of coffee from a police officer.  Elliot is credited with two challenges for his bold behavior after he threatens to file a complaint about the officer's public intoxication.  After he flees the scene, the caller tells Elliot that he has left behind evidence; however, if he wins the game, his record will be purged.  At the same time, Chilcoat tracks a conspiracy theorist that has been investigating the game.  Paranoid, the man flees Chilcoat but advises him to kill Elliot at his first opportunity.  For his next challenge, Elliot receives no instructions and is taken to a rural motel.  There, a man identifies himself as a former childhood bully, and the caller tells Elliot to sever the man's arm.  Elliot initially refuses but does so once the man taunts him.  After driving the man to the hospital, Elliot savagely beats the man's brother, who was also involved in bullying Elliot and Michael, and once urinated on Michael's face.  As a result, he is credited with two more completed challenges.  When the police arrive at the banquet hall where Elliot and Shelby are having their rehearsal dinner, Elliot is surprised to discover that they are interested in Michael.  To give Michael time to escape, he accepts his next challenge, to destroy the banquet hall while singing ''[[The Internationale]]''.  Disappointed in his reluctance to break social norms, the caller instructs Elliot to surrender to the police, from whom Elliot learns that another person has been playing the game.  Elliot takes and accidentally wounds a hostage to escape and complete the game before the other competitor.  As he escapes, he leaves behind his cell phone.  Desperate, he takes an old woman hostage when she shows up, sure that she is involved in his next challenge.  After feigning ignorance, the old woman reveals his next challenge: to set a stainless steel wire across the road.  Elliot is horrified when he realizes that a group of bikers have been  instructed to speed down the road.  Although he disarms the trap in time, the other competitor rearms the trap, and the cyclists are decapitated.  Disgusted, Elliot quits the game, and, when he returns home, discovers that Michael is the other competitor.  Michael reveals that the final challenge is to kill a family member.  Although Elliot originally tries to talk Michael out of killing their father, Elliot becomes homicidal when their father reveals he won the game by killing their mother.  To prevent his sons from experiencing the horror of winning the game, their father commits suicide.  However, Michael refuses to stop playing the game and attempts to kill Elliot.  Elliot kills Michael in self-defense, though he is stabbed multiple times.  Elliot is credited for his final challenge, but he forfeits all the money when he interferes with the game by killing Chilcoat, who has murdered the conspiracy theorist and has now arrived to clean up the crime scene.  Later, Elliot learns that Shelby has declined to play the game, and he collapses laughing.  
14 Days (film)
 Consisting of a variety of short stories tied together by a larger plot, each segment introduces an issue that the characters deal with. All scenes take place in one location and the audiences view is of the park bench and its immediate area. However, there are some exceptions such as the scene where the thief runs through the city, eventually arriving in the park. There are breaks between days, simulating that nothing interesting happens on some days. The days are titled on screen to indicate a passage of time. Without this, the scenes would appear to occur on the same day because the weather and time of day don't appear to change. However, for scenes that occur right after the previous one, the title is omitted as for scenes for Day 11 - Sisters and Day 13 - Closure.  ===Day 1 - Coffee=== Josh meets Lita in the park. She appears to be troubled by something so he offers her a cup of coffee to help ease her stress. They engage in a humorous conversation but a paging signal on Lita's phone ruins the atmosphere and the two head off immediately to the destination mentioned in the page.  ===Day 3 - Moving On=== June is on a train holding a red rose but she becomes distressed when its leaves fall apart. She arrives in the park to meet her husband, Michael. They talk about their children, June's sister's relationships and eventually their own. Michael urges June to move on with her life and put his tragic death behind her. They embrace and have a passionate kiss. Before June leaves, Michael gives her a rose then fades away. As presented, one could speculate that the scene could play out in an infinite loop since June had a rose in the beginning and at the end, in a way representing her failing to break the cycle and move on with her life.  ===Day 5 - Family=== Trix joins Carmidy for lunch. They enjoy some conversation before Carmidy reveals her desire to have children with her former boyfriend. Trix, all too eager for Carmidy to move forward, agrees then they leave to return to work.  ===Day 7 - Choice=== Lita and Josh appear again, this time next to a river in the city. After some humorous discussion about pets, Josh reveals that he submitted a request for transfer to a team that specializes in investigating strange and unusual events. Lita becomes visibly and verbally distraught before the paging signal on Josh's phone interrupts and the two go to the scene.  ===Day 9 - Siblings=== Hope meets brother Destin in the park for an annual family get together. Their brother, Moff, arrives a few minutes later after Hope and Destin talk about his childish past. After being out of touch for a year, each has undergone significant changes. Moff and Destin express their happiness at Hope's slimmer figure, Destin says he's finishing up medical school and Moff is engaged. Moff has apparently become more mature with his childish antics behind him. However, after Destin talks about how proud he was of Moff defending him when others taunted him about being adopted, Hope reveals that after doing some research, she discovered that she was also adopted.  ===Day 11 - The Hidden=== Zenia, an Obsidian from The Magnate civilization, is held captive in a dark room interrogated by an unknown and unseen being. Only its deep ominous voice is heard. What appears to be a spotlight is directed at Zenia's face. However, the light isn't completely stationary so perhaps it is illuminated from the interrogator. Zenia is questioned about her mission on Earth. She explains that she and Essix were sent to "pacify" the terrorist threat by killing them and destroying their arsenal of weapons. In doing so, they discovered residual energy from weapons made by their enemy, The Quaazen, but don't know how humans acquired alien technology originating from a distant galaxy. Recovering from injuries from her fight with the terrorists, Zenia quickly materializes away from her captors.  ===Day 11 - Sisters=== Some time later, another Obsidian is in the park where Zenia and Essex were captured. Her superior, The Overseer, materializes and confirms Zenia and Essix's safe return but is concerned why she is still on Earth. The Obsidian explains she is investigating how the humans may have gotten Quaazen weapons and expresses her longing to return home. The Overseer acknowledges how The Obsidian's personality is like their mother's and The Obsidian acknowledges how The Overseer's personality is like their father's. This leads to concern of a greater threat than the Quaazen, The Reapers, trans-dimensional beings whose only goal is to harvest all forms of energy.  ===Day 13 - Thief=== A man cautiously runs through the city streets constantly looking around if he is being followed. He stops in a secluded area of the park and begins to look through a bag he has just stolen. Finding cash, a wallet and a cellphone, he plays a voicemail on the phone. The voicemail is by a man to his wife apologizing for his short temper and explains what he is doing to solve his problem. At the conclusion of the voicemail, the thief becomes conflicted with guilt, pushes the bag and its contents to the side then walks aways without taking anything. Throughout the scene, the thief is never seen speaking. The only voice is from the voicemail coming from the cellphone's speaker. The viewer is left wondering if the voice on the phone was probably the thief's conscience all along.  ===Day 13 - Closure=== Lita and Josh traced the stolen bag to the park where the thief left it. It seems when the thief retrieved the voicemail, it triggered something which could be traced. Lita tries to explain this but Josh disagrees. Lita returns playful remarks then suddenly embraces Josh and gives him a passionate kiss. Lita says "YES" but Josh is confused. Lita reminds him of the dream he told her many times about proposing on the Spanish Steps in Italy, but didn't when they actually were on vacation there. This was enough for Josh to pull out the engagement ring from his pocket and confesses waiting for the right moment and puts it on Lita's finger. Both relieved, they hug and kiss then Lita's phone rings. Instead of another call to investigate another crime, it's a text from Lita's mother saying her phone was on and she heard the whole proposal. Josh picks up his phone reading a message that Lita's parents called his parents about the news. Thinking that all surprises have been revealed, Lita briefly mentions a baby shower in a comment peaking Josh's curiosity. The viewer is left wondering if Lita was distressed in the beginning because she was pregnant but not married to Josh or maybe she was just hinting at wanting to be.  ===Day 14 - Scouts=== Two alien scouts from a race formally a part of The Magnate civilization, materialize in the park. The leader, Onyx, after observing human relationships over the past 14 days, expresses disappointment that humans are perhaps weak by constantly engaging in trivial conflicts. Saph, on the other hand, believes their good qualities is actually a strength that is worth considering. Onyx describes The Reaper threat in detail. The scene ends from the opposite view for the first time showing Onyx and Saph in the foreground and the cityscape in the background.  ===Bonus Scene - Subversive=== On February 28, 2016, a 12-minute film titled, Subversive, screened at the Anthology Film Festival in New York City. Not a part of the "Day" scenes, Subversive blurs the line between reality and fiction and can be viewed without ever having seen 14 Days. A talk show host interviews the director of 14 Days, portrayed by a woman, while the real-life director, Joseph Villapaz, makes a [[cameo appearance]] as an on-set producer. This starts off "normally" but suddenly turns darker with an edgy sci-fi and horror tone. The film has since been added to 14 Days, however, it has also been submitted to film festivals as a separate short film and selected to the ''Prelude2Cinema Presents Film Festival'', ''Women's Only Entertainment Film Festival'' and ''Los Angeles CineFest''.   On June 12, 2016, Subversive will be screening at the International Horror Hotel Film Festival. It has also been awarded an Honorable Mention.<ref name="horrorhotel2016"></ref>  
12 Citizens
  On a hot summer's day, 12 male "citizens" undergo a mock jury for a law school's Western law subject. The mock jury need to decide whether a boy is guilty or not of a murder of his father with a knife based on the evidence. The evidence prepared by the students of the course seems airtight and therefore it seems as if the jury will render him guilty of the crime. However, one juror does not follow the consensus and appreciates the nuances and seriousness of the verdict. His motives are unclear but he wants to entertain the thought that there is reasonable doubt about the guilt of the boy. As a result, the evidence is slowly cross-referenced and examined. Conflicts are spurred as a result of their differing personalities and strong opinions. Eventually, one by one, the jurors are convinced that there is reasonable doubt and judge the boy to be not guilty. On the end of the mock jury trial, the jurors are visibly exhausted. The juror who had rebelled and wanted to see the case through is revealed to be a [[prosecutor]] of the [[People's Republic of China]].

'71 (film)
  Gary Hook, a new recruit to the [[British Army]], takes leave of his much younger brother Darren. Hook's platoon is sent to [[Belfast]] in 1971 in the early years of [[the Troubles]]. Under the leadership of the inexperienced [[Second Lieutenant]] Armitage, his platoon is deployed to a volatile area where [[Irish Catholics|Catholic]] [[Irish Republicanism |Republicans]] and [[Ulster Protestants|Protestant]] [[Ulster loyalism|Loyalists]] live side by side. The unit provides support for the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] as it inspects homes for firearms, shocking Hook with their rough treatment of women and children. A crowd gathers to protest and provoke the British troops who, though heavily armed, can only respond by trying to hold the crowd back.  One soldier is hit by a rock and drops his rifle to the ground. In the confusion, a young boy seizes it and runs off through the mob. Hook and another soldier, Thompson, pursue him. As the crowd's protest violently escalates, the soldiers and police pull out, leaving the two soldiers behind. Hook and Thompson are severely beaten by a mob, until a sympathetic woman manages to calm things down. However, Thompson is suddenly shot dead at point-blank range by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) gunman Paul Haggerty. With the crowd physically attacking him, Hook flees through streets and back alleys, eludes his pursuers, and hides in an outhouse until dark.  A Protestant youngster brings Hook to a local pub that serves as a front for Loyalists. There, Hook glimpses a Loyalist group in a back room, constructing a bomb under the guidance of a member of the [[Military Reaction Force]] (MRF), the British Army's covert [[counter-insurgency]] unit. Hook steps outside the pub just before an enormous explosion destroys the building, killing or injuring many of those inside, including the young boy who brought him there. Hook flees once more into the dark streets. Unaware that the Loyalist bombers have blown themselves up accidentally, the PIRA and [[Official Irish Republican Army]] (OIRA) factions accuse each other of being responsible for the bombing.  Two Catholics, Eamon and his daughter Brigid, discover Hook as he lies in a street unconscious and injured by shrapnel. They take him to their home in the [[Divis Tower|Divis Flats]] area before discovering he is a British soldier. Eamon, a former army medic, stitches Hook's wounds.  Despite the PIRA's having recently taken control of the area from the OIRA, Eamon contacts senior OIRA official Boyle for help, expecting a more humane solution than the PIRA faction would allow. Boyle, less radical and violent than the younger PIRA members, has a working relationship with the MRF and tells MRF [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] Browning, leader of the local MRF section, of Hook's whereabouts and asks in return that Browning kill James Quinn, a key leader of the PIRA faction, who wanted Boyle dead after clashing with him over responsibility for the pub explosion.  Quinn and his PIRA squad have been tailing Boyle since the pub explosion and saw him visit Eamon's flat without knowing why he was there. Sensing danger, Hook flees the flat, taking an assault knife he finds in a bag. He eludes the PIRA men but, unable to evade Haggerty, Hook stabs and kills him.  Quinn's group captures Hook and takes him to a hideout. Quinn orders Sean, a young inexperienced teenager who in the early neighborhood persecution had hesitated killing Hook, to murder him. When Sean hesitates, Quinn prepares to execute Hook, only to leave when Browning's group arrives. Sergeant Lewis of Browning's group shoots Sean, to Hook's horror. Lewis then attempts to strangle Hook to prevent him from informing others about the bomb.  As Lieutenant Armitage and his men enter in support of Browning, Armitage sees Lewis' attempt to kill Hook. Sean raises himself and shoots Lewis dead before being shot again, this time by Armitage. Browning finds Quinn, and rather than arresting him, tells him Boyle wants him dead, then lets him go.  As Quinn leaves, Browning tells him he will be in touch soon, and he expects him to be helpful.  Hook is returned to his barracks. Later, despite a formal complaint by Armitage, the [[commanding officer]] dismisses the incident involving Hook, Lewis, and Sean as a confused situation that merits no further inquiry. Hook returns to England and reunites with Darren.

30 Days in Atlanta
  In the city of [[Lagos]], [[Warri]]-based Nigerians, Akpors ([[Ayo Makun]]), an impulsive but funny young man and his more reserved, learned cousin, Richard ([[Ramsey Nouah]]), an I.T. consultant are invited to a luxurious real estate showcase party sponsored by a businessman and realtor, Dr. Johnson Adetola Briggs ([[Majid Michel]]) with his wife ([[Juliet Ibrahim]]) in new Lekki Gardens Estate, Lagos. Akpors unexpectedly wins a 30-day prize trip to [[Atlanta]], U. S. A. for a couple in the raffle draw. Akpors decides to go with his cousin on the trip.  On arriving Atlanta Airport, they recognize a Nigerian politician and exchange greetings. While going for a walk from their temporary residence, Akpors experiences his first culture shock, an American kid persistently declines her mother's instruction without being punished for it. They compare the scenario with counterparts back home and Akpors confronts the kid in the presence of her mother who reprimands him afterwards.   He experiences a few more peculiarities about the American culture. They go to an outdoor musical dance talent hunt. After watching a series of performers, Akpors decides to take up a challenge and display his peculiar dancing style with the music of his choice to the audience' amusement. They later obtain a white convertible from a car agency and Richards convinces Akpors about the agency's mode of operations in the country. On driving to a restaurant with petrol station, they bump into a friend, Okiemute ([[Desmond Elliot]]) they knew back home. In the midst of their excited greetings, Okiemute tries to caution them to change their familiar style of greeting since his name has changed. Okiemute invites them both to eat at the restaurant while Akpors also experiences another culture shock when he sees a lady footing the bill on a couple's date. Akpors is also amazed to hear some disaffected customers complaining about the restaurant's service in Nigerian pidgin. They discuss foreign baby droppers who come to give birth in the US. On sighting a beautiful lady, Kimberly ([[Karlie Redd]]), Akpors reveals his intention to date her but Okiemute cautions him about her strict father.   They drive to the beautiful residence of a Nigerian friend in diaspora, Uncle Wilson (Kesse Jabiri). They are welcomed by Wilson's wife, ([[Vivica A. Fox]]) who instantly recognizes their accent. They adore the residence's interior design before being welcomed by Wilson. They experience yet another culture shock when they see Wilson performing traditional African female roles (food preparation, babysitting, housekeeping etc.) while his wife gives him instructions. Akpors, eager to displays his feelings tries to confront Wilson but is restrained by Richard. After narrating their love story, Akpors has the biased opinion that Wilson is under a spell from his wife. Akpors tries to convince Wilson that his wife's "domination" is abnormal. Akpors finally decides to leave the house, almost revealing his annoyance to Wilson's wife but for Richard's timely intervention.   They attend a Sustainable earth conference in which the same minister they met is also attending. Akpors makes a weird but humorous comment to everyone's surprise. At the lunch, they sight Kimberly and Akpors urges Richard into starting a conversation. It turns out well despite Akpors' blunders and Richard's interference. She gives Richard a contact and they leave just in time for her father, Odiye ([[Richard Mofe Damijo]]), a U.S. based Nigerian who owns the restaurant, to show up. Akpors sometimes disturbs Richard and affects his concentration in their residence.   Richard decides to visit the restaurant again to await Kimberly but Akpors shows up unexpectedly. He persuades Richard that he will be supportive of his date. After ordering food, he takes the initiative by signaling to Kimberly when she arrives. Unaware that they were visitors and not residents, Kimberly mentions Akpors' comment at the conference and her father's interest to meet him and possibly engage him in an stand-up comedy contract. Richard tries to discourage the proceedings but Akpors maintains an interest and requests further information on the remuneratory aspect of the proposed contract, despite knowing it was a violation of his visa to work during their visit. After the contract is awarded and Akpors commences work at the restaurant, he narrates it to Richard who cautions him that it was illegal to work and might be arrested if discovered. Undaunted by the risks, he refuses to quit the job.   While leaving for their residence in a taxi, it dawns on Richard that he has left his wallet with cash behind. As a result of their situation, Akpors recommends that they flee on dropping from the taxi. Unknown to them, the driver understood their conversation and threatens them with a gun before dropping them half-naked on the streets in annoyance. Kimberly and her father comes to their aid and drives them home. They are treated with good hospitality while Odiye narrates his family story, citing his late American wife, Joyce (Kimberly's mother), ordeal and journey from Nigeria to the United States, advising them not to be discouraged by setbacks in life. Kimberly prepares dinner and invites them all to the table. They meet for the first time and are introduced to Odiye's immigration lawyer, Clara ([[Lynn Whitfield]]). They converse and Akpors makes additional blunders but succeeds in making them laugh. Clara, impressed by Akpors' sense of humour decides to see him perform at the restaurant.   While leaving for their residence, Akpors reveals his interest in dating Clara to Kimberly. Kimberly reveals that Clara is much older than she looks, but Akpors doesn't give up on starting a date with her. Richards tries to make romantic advances but Kimberly reminds him that they are still under her father's watchful eye. Richard and Akpors drives home in the car. Later, Akpors proceeds to date Clara and succeeds in winning her affection. He teaches her some Nigerian pidgin and slangs. Richard also gets along well with Kimberly on a date but unlike Akpors, he reveals their visitor status in the United States.   On another day, Richard converses with his mother and uncle James via Skype and is surprised to learn that his former girlfriend, Ese is assisting his mother at home, at work and making future wedding arrangements. He tries to convince his mother that they have ended their relationship and mentions his new found love, describing Kimberly. When Akpors accompanies Richard to collect a portraiture gift for Kimberly and waits outside, Akpors disappears before he comes out, having strolled into a gang of street gamblers. As soon as Richards notices his sudden disappearance, he searches for him. Akpors has already engaged himself in a gambling session by the time Richards finds him. On discovery, Richard cautions him that the gang of gamblers might be prone to committing crime. Akpors convinces him to go and meet Kimberly at home and leave him with his gambling as everything will be fine. Richard reluctantly leaves. Kimberly notifies Richard on phone about their dating arrangements and her intentions to Skype with his mother when she gets home. Richard gives her an incentive to proceed as planned. Kimberly enters the house and awaits Richard. Meanwhile, Akpors gambling spree has gone sour and after deciding to leave with his winning, he is threatened with a gun by one of the gamblers. Other members of gang try to restrain the attacker while Akpors displays his aggressive behaviour and breaks a bottle on his head, threatening and chasing his attacker as a defensive measure. The attacker and his gang flees to avoid the dangerous scene when the cops' siren signals are heard nearby.   At Richard's residence, Kimberly decides to pick the Skype video call. On sighting Richard's mum, she introduces herself. Richard's mum, not familiar with the American way of greeting, considers Kimberly rude. Ese, who happened to be nearby immediately describes herself in the mum's presence that she is Richard's wife. Richard's mum leaves the conversation to attend to her cooking and tells Ese not to tamper with the laptop. Ese agrees but continues the Skype video conversation and tries to convince Kimberly that she will be used and dumped by Richard. She proceeds by showing her proof of their "marriage" with intimate pictures of her with Richard. Kimberly becomes heartbroken and drives away from the house in tears. She refuses to pick Richard's calls and hints him of her discovery of his secret past.   After fleeing the gambling scene, Akpors is arrested by the cops before he reaches home. He manages to notify Richard on phone requesting Clara's intervention on the case. Richard reprimands him for his actions and agrees to involve Clara. Akpors leaves the phone hanging and barely ends his coversation in an attempt to flee erotic advances from a prison inmate. Clara approaches Akpors in the cell and tries to clarify the situation, discussing with the legal officials as a representative lawyer. In the middle of Akpors conversation with the officials, it is discovered that Akpors also violated his visa, making his case more severe and punishable by law. He is finally granted bail and scheduled for a court hearing.   In court, he persists in defending his actions and commits more blunders in the process. He is cautioned to keep silent by Richard or risk going to Jail. Clara also reiterated that he keep silent while she spoke. To avoid prosecution, the presiding Judge agreed that the total income Akpors has earned will be sufficient as compensation for his legal and visa violation if the money is donated to charity under supervision. In order to avert further violation pending his stay in the United States, Clara decides to keep him under her watchful eye and takes him to her house to cook him dinner. Akpors expresses his appreciation for her timely intervention and falls in love with her. He requests for her bedroom and carries her inside.   Afterwards, Clara overhears Akpors conversing on phone implying that his relationship with Clara will facilitate his green card and American citizenship. Clara becomes furious that Akpors might have taken advantage of her influential position and after reminiscing about the recent past, she ejects Akpors immediately from her house and threatens to call the police if he refuses to leave. Akpors leaves.  Richard, on the other hand has been disturbed since Kimberly stopped communicating. He attempts to clarify the situation and explain to Kimberly but her father, Odiye intervenes and orders him to leave his daughter alone, reiterating the stereotyped bad image many young Nigerian men portray to the Western world. Odiye comforts his daughter when Richard leaves. Richard in an attempt to converse with his mother on Skype, sees Ese and talks to her angrily about her interference in his relationship with Kimberly. He also learns about Akpor's eviction from Clara's house. Akpors reluctantly donates his earnings to charity. As their departure date to Nigeria draws nearer, they make additional tours in the country and take photographs. At the airport, as the men prepare to board their flight back to Nigeria, they are surprised to see Kimberly and Clara who after further clarifications had both made up their minds to follow them back to Nigeria to meet their relatives.

300: Rise of an Empire
 [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Queen Gorgo]] of [[Sparta]] tells her men about the [[Battle of Marathon]], in which King [[Darius I|Darius]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] was killed by General [[Themistocles]] of [[Athens]] ten years earlier. Darius's son, [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]], witnesses his father's death, and is advised to not continue the war, since only "the gods can defeat the Greeks". Darius's naval commander, [[Artemisia I of Caria|Artemisia]], claims that Darius' last words were in fact a challenge and sends Xerxes on a journey through the desert. Xerxes finally reaches a cave and bathes in an otherworldly liquid, emerging as the 8-foot tall "God-King". He returns to Persia and declares war on Greece to avenge his father.  As Xerxes's forces advance towards Thermopylae, Themistocles meets with the council and convinces them to provide him with a fleet to engage the Persians at the sea. Themistocles then travels to Sparta to ask King Leonidas for help, but is informed by Dilios that Leonidas is consulting the Oracle, and Gorgo is reluctant to side with Athens. Themistocles later reunites with his old friend Scyllas, who infiltrated the Persian troops and learned Artemisia was born Greek, but defected to Persia as her family was raped and murdered by Greek [[hoplite]]s and she was taken as a sex slave, and subsequently left for dead in the streets. She was rescued and adopted by a Persian emissary. Her lust for vengeance gained the attention of King Darius and he made her a naval commander after she killed many of his enemies. Themistocles also learns that Leonidas has marched to fight the Persians with only 300 men.  Themistocles leads his fleet of fifty warships and several thousand men, which include Scyllas, Scyllas's son Calisto and Themistocles' right-hand man Aeskylos to the [[Aegean Sea]], starting the [[Battle of Artemisium]]. They ram their ships into the Persian ships, charge them, slaughtering several soldiers before retreating from the sinking Persian ships. The following day, the Greeks feign a retreat and lead a group of Persian ships into a crevice, where they become stuck. The Greeks charge the Persian ships from the cliffs above and kill more Persians. Impressed with Themistocles' skills, Artemisia brings him onto her ship where she seduces him, in an attempt to lure him to the Persian side as her second-in-command. He refuses, causing her to push him aside and swear revenge on him.  The Persians spill tar into the sea and send suicide bombers to swim to and board the Greek ships with their flame bombs. Artemisia and her men fire flaming arrows and torches to ignite the tar, but an Athenian manages to kill one of the Persians, who falls into the tar carrying a torch, causing ships from both sides to explode. Themistocles is thrown into the sea by an explosion and nearly drowns before being rescued by Aeskylos, and stands by Scyllas's side as he succumbs to his injuries. Believing Themistocles to be dead, Artemisia and her forces withdraw. After recovering from his injuries, Themistocles learns that only a few hundred of his warriors and six of his ships survived the disastrous attack executed by Artemisia.  Daxos, an Arcadian general, tells Themistocles that Leonidas and his 300 men were killed after [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] betrayed the Greeks to Xerxes. Themistocles returns to Athens and confronts Ephialtes. The deformed Spartan traitor reveals that Xerxes plans to attack and burn Athens to the ground. Ephialtes is regretful of his actions, and welcomes death. Themistocles spares him instead, so he can warn Xerxes that the Greek forces are gathering at [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. He then visits Gorgo in Sparta while she is mourning Leonidas's death to ask for her help, but she is too overcome with grief. Before leaving, Themistocles returns Leonidas's sword, which had been delivered to him by Ephialtes under Xerxes's orders, and urges Gorgo to avenge Leonidas.  In Athens, Xerxes's army is laying waste when Ephialtes arrives to deliver Themistocles' message. Upon learning he is alive, Artemisia leaves to ready her entire navy for battle. Xerxes suggests a more cautious plan but she still leaves for battle, ignoring Xerxes's advice. The remaining Greek ships charge into the Persians ships, and the two armies battle, beginning the decisive [[Battle of Salamis]]. Themistocles and Artemisia engage in a duel, which ends in a stalemate with both receiving severe injuries.  At this moment Gorgo, who had been narrating the tale to the Spartans, arrives at the battle along with ships from numerous Greek city states including [[Delphi]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], [[Arcadia]], and Sparta, all of them uniting against the surrounded Persians. Daxos leads the Arcadian army while Themistocles urges Artemisia to surrender. Xerxes, watching the battle from a cliff, turns his back on her, acknowledging his naval defeat and continuing the march of his army. Artemisia tries to kill Themistocles one last time but is killed as he stabs her through the stomach. While Dilios leads the Greek assault, Themistocles and Gorgo take a moment to silently acknowledge one another's alliance as the remaining Persians attempt a counter-attack. The three then charge at the opposing Persians with the whole Greek army.  
99 Homes
 Recently unemployed single father Dennis Nash, a former construction worker in [[Orlando, Florida]], is evicted together with his mother Lynn, a hairdresser, and young son Connor from the foreclosed home they share. Real estate operator Rick Carver is in charge of the eviction, and police officers who provide the enforcement call him "boss."  Dennis and his family move into a shabby cramped motel room. Dennis goes to Rick's office and tries to take back his tools stolen by Rick's men. Rick sees the confrontation and is impressed by Dennis' gumption. He offers Dennis work as a repairman at his properties and Dennis accepts. Dennis soon becomes Rick's assistant, helping to carry out evictions himself and set up real estate schemes that exploit government and banking rules to the disadvantage of struggling home owners. He starts accepting large payments of money (in exchange for the work he is performing for Rick) and dips into the glamorous lifestyle in which Rick indulges.  Almost as soon as he begins working for Rick, Dennis tells Rick to keep the checks Rick offers as payment, so that he can buy back the house from which he was evicted, but Rick tells him to keep his money for now since it is not enough anyway.  An evicted home owner living in the same motel as Dennis and his family recognizes and threatens him. Dennis reacts by making a deal with Rick to buy back his family's old house, but the legal process prevents them from moving in immediately, so he decides to get his son out of the motel room immediately by selling the family home and buying a much more luxurious home instead.  When Dennis brings his mother and son to the luxurious house and informs them he bought it and sold their old house so they could get out of the motel room immediately, his mother does not believe at first that he has bought the house. Then Dennis' mother is shocked by the loss of their long-time home and is repelled as she realizes Dennis got his new-found wealth by helping Rick victimize honest homeowners who have financial problems. Even Dennis' son is not happy with the arrangement. Lynn and Connor leave Dennis to stay with her brother.  Rick puts together a multimillion-dollar real estate deal, but it is jeopardized by a legal case brought by a home owner he is trying to evict. Dennis and the home owner were friendly acquaintances, but the man turned hostile toward Dennis when he saw him become part of Rick's eviction business. Dennis obeys Rick's order to deliver a forged document to court that defeats the home owner's legal case. The subsequent eviction turns into an armed stand-off. Fearing that the man, whose family is also in the house, will likely be killed in a shoot-out, Dennis confesses to having delivered the forged document. The home owner surrenders, and Dennis is escorted to the law enforcement's car so that they can speak with Rick.  As Dennis waits in the car the home owner's son smiles at him, then quickly runs away.

She confronts Shakthi, who quickly summons his friend, the videographer at the wedding, and pretends that he is part of the film crew and has a right to be there. After seeing her dance at the wedding, Shakthi cannot resist the temptation to make a video of Shruti doing her dance routine.  The next day, Shakthi calls those involved in the wedding and manages to get Shruti's name and her college. He then chases her down on her bus ride home and tries to impress her with a DVD of her dance routine at the wedding. Shruti is not interested in Shakthi and reveals that her aim in life is starting her own wedding planning business by the name 'Getti Melam'. Shakthi's enthusiasm for courtship is quickly dampened once Shruti launches a long pitch of her business ideas.  Shakthi, meanwhile is under pressure from his parents to come back to their village and work in their sugarcane fields, and Shruti is being coaxed by her family to get married at the earliest. But Shruti makes a deal with her parents that after her exams, she will take five years to get her business running before getting married. When Shakthi's father comes to take him back to his village, Shakthi refuses and lies that he is starting a wedding planning business. He now goes back to Shruti who refuses him as she is worried that romantic complications would arise. Shakthi promises that it will never be a problem, but Shruti is not interested.  Shruti goes to meet with Chandralekha ([[Simran (actress)|Simran]]), a famous wedding planner, with Shakthi tagging along. She hopes that she will be hired and get the opportunity to learn about planning "high-class weddings". Chandra shows no interest, but by sheer coincidence loses one of her male workers at that moment. Short on time, she spots Shakthi next to Shruti, and offers him the job. Shakthi accepts on the condition that both he and Shruti are hired together. While checking the arrangements, Shruti learns that Chandra is cheating her clients by ordering cheap arrangements of flowers and decorations so she can earn more commission. Later, when an irate bride's father confronts Chandra, she blames Shruti, claiming it was her fault. Angry at Chandra for accusing Shruti, Shakthi says that she has no right to treat her employees like this. They quit and Shruti, calling him her partner, leaves with him, warning Chandra that they will cross paths.  The two thus begin "Getti Melam", with the work equally split between the two. Their first project is very successful and the duo plans many more small weddings. Finally, they get their first big client by stealing them away from Chandra. After a lot of work the wedding is a huge success. That night, after the event, they dance to celebrate and both end up slightly drunk. A simple hug turns into more, and the two make love that night. Afterwards, Shakthi lies awake all night, worried about what has happened.  When Shruti starts calling him "dear" in the morning, he is obviously uncomfortable with it. Not wanting to hurt her feelings, Shakthi behaves awkwardly around her over the next few days, while Shruti realizes that she has fallen in love with him. Shruti tries to reassure Shakthi that she's not like other women he's been with who follow him around everywhere. Shakthi, misunderstanding, believes that she's telling him that the night didn't mean anything to her. Relieved, he tells her it meant nothing to him as well. Shruti pretends to agree but cries after he leaves. This creates a tense atmosphere between the two. They have a huge fight resulting in Shruti breaking the partnership and forcing Shakthi to leave the company. Shakthi vows to start his own wedding planning business and the two go their separate ways. However, they don't do as well by themselves, unable to handle the workload without their partner and both enterprises end up suffering huge losses, plunging them into debt.  They finally get a big contract, but it is contingent upon them working together as a team. The bride had been a guest at the first big wedding they'd done and wanted the same level for her own wedding. Facing creditors, they agree to partner up again for this one wedding for the sake of recovering their own losses. They divvy up the workload and each focuses on their own departments. Shakthi and Shruti perform together for the wedding. The performance is a success and the following day, Shakthi tells Shruti that they should be partners again, saying that ''Getti Melam'' was never as successful as when they were together. Shruti refuses his offer, telling him that she is getting married in two months to her fiancé, Siddharth, and will move to [[Dubai]] with him after the wedding. Shakthi is stunned and immediately argues with her that she can't get married, saying it is "totally wrong".  During the rest of the wedding preparations Shakthi pesters Shruti about her engagement, claiming that she'd be moving too far from her parents or that Dubai wouldn't suit her. When none of those reason dissuade her, Shakthi accuses her of her getting married to make him jealous, claiming that she'd fallen in love with him and that this was a way to get revenge because he paid her no heed after their night together. Shruti answers that she is not doing it for revenge, but for her own security and her parents' satisfaction to see her settled in life. She admits that she did fall in love with Shakthi, but since he didn't feel the same, she had moved on. Shruti answers a call from Siddharth and walks away sadly, leaving Shakthi alone.  At the sudden thought of losing her forever, Shakthi realizes that he has always been in love with Shruti, but was too scared to acknowledge it in fear of jeopardizing the business. Desperate to win her back, Shakthi steals Siddharth's phone number from Shruti's cell and calls him, telling him to back off and that Shruti is his. Hearing what Shakthi had done to Siddharth, Shruti angrily runs off to find Shakthi and confronts him where he is waiting for her on a rooftop. Shakthi tells Shruti that he'd loved her all along and was a fool to have run away from her love. Shruti calls off her engagement and the two share a passionate hug.

The surrounding Arab states are about to launch an invasion with overwhelming superiority in numbers and weaponry compared to the emergent Israeli defences. With no air force or aircraft, American and other foreign pilots are called upon to start a nascent military air force.

After transporting the fighter aircraft to Israel, the first four aircraft are deployed to attack an Egyptian armored column moving on [[Tel Aviv]]. With the attack taking the enemy by surprise, the Egyptians retreat. Other air attacks help to bring about a truce between the combatants. During the truce, Israeli volunteers in the United States, manage to purchase and smuggle two [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers out of the country. When war is declared again, the B-17s are in the air, overflying the Middle East and divert to an attack on [[Cairo]].  Aerial prowess proves to be a deciding factor in the coming battles, as a group of [[Supermarine Spitfire]] LF Mk IXE fighter aircraft is purchased from Czechoslovakia. Israeli fighter pilots flying a mix of Avia S-199s and Spitfires tangled with Egyptian Spitfires, with the first air-to-air combat ending with Gideon Lichtman bringing down an Egyptian Spitfire, albeit in his "Messer-shitt". As the volunteer-driven program becomes more organized, with leaders such as [[Modi Alon]], "Smoky" Simon, [[Ezer Weizman]] and Dani Shapira taking charge, a strong defensive [[Israeli Air Force]] is created.

The Admiral: Roaring Currents
 The film revolves around the titular [[Battle of Myeongnyang]] circa 1597, regarded as one of legendary [[Joseon]] admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]]'s most remarkable naval victories, in which he led the only 13 ships remaining in his command to a heroic victory against an invading Japanese fleet numbering 333 vessels.<ref></ref>  At the onset of the battle, at their base in [[Haenam County|Haenam]], the [[Imjin War|Japanese invaders]] under [[Tōdō Takatora]] are confident that their [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)#Second invasion (1597–1598)|planned expedition]] to [[Seoul|Hansong]] to capture [[Seonjo of Joseon|King Seonjo]] will meet with success, even though they remain reserved over the news that Joseon's greatest admiral, [[Yi Sun-sin]], has been restored to his former command following the [[Battle of Chilcheollyang|disaster at Chilcheollyang]], which has reduced the Korean navy to a mere dozen battle-ready ships. In order to ensure success of the operation, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi]] sends one of his finest naval war leaders to Joseon: [[Kurushima Michifusa]], the commander of the Murakami Clan Navy, and an expert in naval combat who, however, enjoys a shaky reputation among his fellow ''[[daimyō]]'' as a pirate. One of the Admirals of the [[Japanese Left Army]], [[Wakisaka Yasuharu|Wakizaka]], first meets Kurushima and his lieutenant Kimura while [[Battle of Geumgu|finishing off]] the remnants of a group of Joseon soldiers. He is especially distrusting of Kurushima, and draws his sword on him several times, especially after the latter insults him by shaming his [[Battle of Hansan Island|defeat at Hansan Island]]. Later, Kurushima and Haru, his [[Sharpshooters|sharpshooter]], drink [[sake]] as Kurushima elaborates on his personal vendetta against Yi Sun-sin, stating that his brother Michiyuki was [[Battle of Dangpo|killed by the latter]] earlier in the war.  In the meantime, Yi Sun-sin is facing the despair mounting among his officers and troops. Facing an enemy force far outnumbering them, and seeing no reasonable chance of success in the inevitable clash even with one single [[turtle ship]] remaining, many consider the fight lost before it has even started. Despite his outwardly indifferent demeanor, Yi is hard-pressed to maintain morale among his men and desperate to find a solution for his problem. But then the breaking point seems reached when General [[Bae Seol]], the deserter of Chilcheollyang, burns the turtle ship and has his men [[Assassination|make an attempt]] at Yi's life. Although Yi escapes and Bae is killed for his act of treachery, the ship is lost, boosting confidence among the Japanese and further dispiriting his own troops. In order to seek an answer, Yi travels to the [[Screaming Strait|Myeongnyang Strait]], an area notorious for its strong and treacherous currents which the Japanese intend to cross on their way to Hansong. Later, he confides in his son [[Yi Hoe|Hoe]] that, in order to win the fight, he has to turn the fear paralyzing his men into courage. Upon hearing that the departure of the Japanese attack fleet is imminent, Yi abandons his base and moves to Usuyeong after burning the naval facilities to the ground.  The next morning, Yi's fleet arrives in the strait and is shortly met by the Japanese, who are using the morning tide to move into the channel, with Kurushima leading the avantgarde force. Yi engages Kurushima's fleet in battle, but as the other Korean commanders are still hesitant to involve themselves, Yi's flagship is quickly surrounded and attacked by [[Naval boarding|boarding parties]]. In this apparently hopeless situation, Yi commands several cannons to be fired from the rower deck's port hatches in a concentrated volley, using their recoil to blast the ship free of its encirclement. As Yi has hoped, this bold act of survival inspires the rest of his countrymen to take the fight to the enemy.  When the tide turns and forms a [[whirlpool]] in the middle of the channel, thus beginning to solidify Yi's defensive position, Kurushima orders an all-out attack with the rest of his ships. Despite the efforts of Haru and a ship [[Hellburners|loaded with black powder charges]], the renewed courage of the Koreans prevails, though heavy sacrifices are made. Kurushima's now desperate situation is observed by Todo, who merely laughs at [[Katō Yoshiaki|Katō]]'s suggestion of reinforcing him. Kurushima, realizing that he is now on his own, boards the Korean flagship, but is decapitated by Yi himself after taking several arrows from Korean [[Gakgung|archers]], and his head is hung from the tip of the ship's mast. When Yi's ship itself is caught in the whirlpool, his civilian navy servants and local fishermen courageously drag the vessel back to safety. Joined by the rest of the fleet, Yi leads a counterattack which deals the Japanese forces a crushing blow, forcing them into retreat and leaving the Koreans triumphant. The film ends with the reminiscence to the first encounter of the Japanese with the turtle ship in 1592.

Ajoba
 His teeth were yellow, the canines were blunt; the leopard was in his prime. In late April 2009, while in hot pursuit of a dog, the cat fell into an open well in the agricultural farmlands of Takli Dokeshwar, north of Pune. Help arrived on the third night, when Forest Department staff lowered a ladder. The feline gingerly walked up and straight into a cage. Vidya Athreya, a researcher, collared the leopard with a GPS transmitter before he was released 60&nbsp;km. away at the foot of Malshej Ghats. For the next year, the collar would send text messages of the cat's whereabouts. That was how Ajoba became the first subject of a research project on farmland leopards. Vidya expected him to make a beeline for the fertile farms and prowl amongst the fields of onions, cauliflower and sugarcane. Instead, he began climbing up the hills. That was odd. Then Ajoba disappeared for three days. When the text messages resumed, he was on the other side of the Ghats, down in the Konkan and across the busy Mumbai-Agra highway. "What is he doing?" Vidya wondered in an email. Her heart was in her mouth when he crossed the Kasara railway station, the last stop for suburban trains from Mumbai. If he suffered even a minor mishap, it could be bad for the cat and the research project. By the end of the third week, he had reached the Vasai Industrial Area, a vast spread of factories and buildings, on the outskirts of Mumbai. There was every chance that someone would spot the intruder and raise an alarm. Vidya was on tenterhooks. Older animals like Ajoba do not usually wander far from their established territories. So why was he walking purposefully westward? The following week, Ajoba was in Nagla Block of the [[Sanjay Gandhi National Park]], in Mumbai. When two weeks passed and he stayed in that area, Vidya thought he had settled down. Ajoba had walked 120&nbsp;km. in three-and-a-half weeks. Then he swam across the Ullas river, entered the main park area for a three-day sojourn, and returned. Three weeks later, the GPS transmitter went dead. Perhaps the river crossings had shorted the circuitry. It's possible that Sanjay Gandhi National Park was Ajoba's original home. In an effort to reduce leopard numbers in the park, he may have been moved to Malshej Ghats. But for the GPS tracker, we'd never have known about Ajoba's remarkable journey. He was close to people on several occasions, yet no one noticed him nor did he harm anybody. Ajoba was a scientific pioneer, one who showed us that leopards are not jumpy, nervous animals, lashing out at humans at the slightest provocation. Despite the distance, speeding vehicles on highways, trains thundering along railway lines, and humans everywhere, he displayed a confident determination and unerring sense of direction. I never met Ajoba, but I felt drawn to the yellow dots tracing an arc on the map. Soon after he was released, Vidya commented that he had been calm, perhaps tired from his ordeal at the bottom of the well. During his travels, I imagined he kept his cool, always aware, alert, able to slip out of any sticky situation, and not prone to impulsive actions. I rooted for his survival, willed him to stay safe and cheered him on as he crossed yet another man-made barrier. And then we lost him. Two-and-a-half years later, on Thursday night last week, a leopard was found dead, the victim of an accident, on the high-traffic Ghodbunder Road, about 12&nbsp;km. from Nagla. Perhaps he misjudged the speed of the vehicle or was blinded by its headlights. Had there been an underpass to avoid crossing the treacherous road, he might still be alive. As is normal practice these days, the officials scanned him for a micro-chip. It read 00006CBD68F. Ajoba.<ref></ref> <ref></ref> <ref></ref>

Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (film)
  The film follows the exploits of Alexander Cooper ([[Ed Oxenbould]]), an ordinary 12-year-old boy, and his "terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day." He is left out by his family; his older brother, Anthony ([[Dylan Minnette]]), his older sister, Emily ([[Kerris Dorsey]]), his mother, Kelly ([[Jennifer Garner]]), his father, Ben ([[Steve Carell]]), and his baby brother, Trevor (Elise/Zoey Vargas), living in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] of [[California]].  Anthony is trying to earn his [[driver's license]] so he can drive his bitter girlfriend, Celia to the [[prom]], Emily is rehearsing for the title role in her school play, Kelly is working for a [[publication company]] that is publishing a new children's book which will promote her to vice president of the company, and Ben, who has been unemployed for seven months, has landed a job interview as a [[game designer]] for a video game company.  That same morning, Alexander attends school where he experiences another series of mishaps, such as accidentally setting fire to his crush, Becky Gibson's, notebook as well as finding out that his friends, including Becky, and even his best friend, Paul, will all be attending the birthday party of Philip Parker (Lincoln Melcher) instead of his, due to Philip's expensive party entertainment and popularity. That night, Alexander puts a candle on a sundae and wishes that everyone in his family would experience what he is going through.  The next morning, Alexander wakes up to find his family in disarray and chaos erupts; his parents have overslept, Emily has a cold, and Anthony has found out that he and Celia broke up. The battery in Kelly's car is dead, and Ben has to take Trevor with him to the interview after dropping Kelly off at work. At school, Paul gives Alexander good news: Philip's birthday party is canceled (as Philip has the chicken pox), so the kids (including Becky and Paul) that were originally going to attend Philip's party will attend Alexander's party instead, much to Alexander's delight. Alexander calls his father, asking him to plan a party for him. Kelly is informed of an embarrassing typo in the book they are publicizing ("dump" instead of "jump") and needs to stop [[Dick Van Dyke]] from reading it at a public reading later. Ben takes Trevor along to the office interview and meets Greg ([[Donald Glover]]) who seems impressed at his credentials, although they decide to hold another meeting after Trevor ingests a non-toxic [[highlighter]]. Meanwhile, at school, Anthony finds out that Celia has gotten back together with him. Feeling excited about what happened, Anthony jumps up and hits a banner, not knowing that it's connected to two trophy cases, which fall and smash. Because of this, Anthony is suspended from school.  Kelly manages to arrive at Dick Van Dyke's reading, but she is too late in trying to warn him about the book's typo. He reads it with the inappropriate material, humiliating himself, scaring the kids and almost getting Kelly arrested. Meanwhile, Ben purchases [[cough syrup]] for Emily's symptoms and takes Anthony to the [[Department of Motor Vehicles]], where his driving examiner intentionally distracts him by convincing him to pick up his [[cell phone]], causing him to destroy several parking meters and damage the [[Chrysler Town & Country|family minivan]], and ultimately fail his driving exam. They all go to Emily's play, which is inadvertently sabotaged by her impaired behavior because of her getting excessively drunk after [[overdosing]] on the cough syrup. Afterwards, the game design firm calls Ben and asks him to meet them at Nagamaki, a Japanese [[hibachi]] restaurant, for another meeting. The family, joined by Celia, goes to the restaurant in their badly damaged minivan, where Ben accidentally sets his shirt on fire at the grill, embarrassing him to the employers. The whole family consoles him, admitting that they will overcome whatever else the day has in store for them. Alexander states, "You just gotta have the bad days so you can love the good days even more", and Anthony suddenly decides not to go to the prom with Celia, stating that his family is more important, and they break up completely.  The family returns home and discovers that Ben had hired a rental animal service to recreate an [[Australia]]n petting zoo for Alexander's birthday party. A [[crocodile]] and [[kangaroo]], however, have escaped from their cage. They then decide to pitch in to try and salvage the day by helping host it. Ben and Kelly receive good news: he got hired for the game design job, and she has been informed that the celebrity reading went viral and has created publicity for the book. Reunited, Ben then brings out the cake, with Alexander wishing for more days like the one they shared together.  
Alemão (film)
 Doca ([[Otávio Müller]]), Danillo ([[Gabriel Braga Nunes]]), Carlinhos ([[Marcello Melo Jr.]]), Branco ([[Milhem Cortaz]]) and Samuel ([[Caio Blat]]) are five policemen working undercover at the [[Complexo do Alemão]], an area which gathers several slums and is considered one of the most dangerous places in [[Rio de Janeiro]].<ref name=autogenerated1 /><ref>[http://g1.globo.com/pop-arte/cinema/noticia/2014/01/caua-reymond-vive-traficante-em-alemao-veja-o-trailer.html G1 - Cauã Reymond vive traficante em 'Alemão'; veja o trailer - notícias em Cinema]</ref> Their operation goes wrong after the government threatens to raid the place using military vehicles, which leads local drug lord Playboy ([[Cauã Reymond]]) to cut off all the slum's communications, leaving them unable to contact their boss, Samuel's father sheriff Valadares ([[Antonio Fagundes]]) and forcing them to hide at the basement of Doca's pizzeria, which serves as their base of operations. Their situation is worsened when Valadares' assistant Pixixo (Izak Dahora) is almost killed by Playboy's men and drops a briefcase containing details on all the policemen infiltrated in the slums.  All five police officers manage to meet at the pizzeria, some barely escaping from the drug dealers. Carlinhos is the last to arrive and is thus immediately blamed by Branco (the chief of the operation) as the one who gave up their real identities. He denies, but ends up handcuffed. Carlinhos is also the lover of Leticia (Aisha Jambo), sister of Senegal (Jefferson Brasil), Playboy's right-hand man.  Meanwhile, Mariana (Mariana Nunes), a local resident who works as a cleaner, leaves her son at home and enters the pizzeria with her own key to claim her service's money. She goes down into the basement and is captured by Branco. Even after Doca explains that she's innocent and has a son, Branco forbids her of getting out, fearing she may reveal their location, specially after he discovers her son's father is Playboy.  Meanwhile, tension grows as the government assembles military forces to raid the slums and Valadares is frustrated at not being able to contact his son and his officers. Playboy has his henchmen interrogate people on the streets and in their houses, seeking information leading to the police officers.  Knowing that Carlinhos is in love with Leticia, Playboy convinces Senegal to use his own sister as a bait for the officer. He puts her in a car and travels around the slum, threatening to kill her and using a loudspeaker to make his intentions known to Carlinhos wherever he is. Carlinhos is finally allowed by Branco to go rescue the girl. After hearing Mariana say that police officers always leave their partners behind when hell breaks loose, Branco goes to his aid. He tells Senegal that they have Mariana, Playboy's long-time passion, and that he must let them go if they want Mariana alive. After the officers leave, Senegal decides to break into their pizzeria, but without asking Playboy first.  He assembles a bunch of gunmen and raids the pizzeria. No one survives the resulting gunfight but for Leticia and Mariana. Mariana is later found by Pixixo, who puts her on the phone with Valadares. She confirms that no officer survived the battle, and Valadares collapses, crying over the loss of his son.  The film ends with scenes and facts about the 2010 Complexo do Alemão raid, which are followed by images of the [[2013 protests in Brazil]].  
Alien Abduction (2014 film)
 The film begins with a dim, out-of-focus corridor with machinery sounds and screams, an opening disposal chute, and the camera falling back to Earth where it is later recovered by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. Information on-screen then reveals the recording is being used to review the footage for [[Project Blue Book]].  Riley Morris keeps a video journal while on a family camping trip in [[Brown Mountain, North Carolina]]. On the last night of their trip, Riley is startled by flashes of light outside of the tent he shares with his older teenage brother and sister, Corey ([[Corey Eid]]) and Jillian ([[Jillian Clare]]). Riley wakes them and urges them to investigate. The siblings spot three distinct star-like objects in the sky which maneuver abruptly and vanish.  The following morning, while driving down the mountain en route to the highway, Riley's father, Peter ([[Peter Holden]]) is sidetracked when their [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] mysteriously misdirects them to an isolated route. Riley's mother, Katie ([[Katherine Sigismund]]), senses something is wrong when they lose their cellphone signals. The family starts to panic when Peter announces the car is running low on gas. A crow unexpectedly falls besides the car, dead.  They reach a tunnel thinking it will lead to the highway but see it is blocked with recently abandoned vehicles - including a police car. Peter, Corey and Riley leave their car to investigate the tunnel while Katie stays behind with Jillian. Personal belongings are scattered around some of the cars and it appears the missing occupants were forcefully removed from their vehicles, which troubles Riley. Peter—who is further ahead—sees a silhouette at the end of the tunnel and calls out. Upon realizing the non-human nature of the Alien approaching figure, Peter instructs Corey to escape with Riley while he attempts to create a diversion. Peter becomes the first to be abducted by the Aliens.  The boys return to the car with the women, explaining what happened. Suddenly a bundle of crows fall on their car, resulting in the car dying. They hear a blaring sound and run in fear. They retrace their route back to a cabin they recall passing. The cabin's owner, Sean ([[Jeff Bowser]]), is a rustic recluse who is armed and initially hostile towards the family. He changes his mind when he hears his guard dog being attacked by an alien that followed them from the tunnel. Sean and the family barricade themselves for the evening. Sean says that the [[Brown Mountain Lights]] and abductions have been a local recurrence for centuries. And, upon hearing a radio message from his missing brother, Sean goes out to fight the Aliens.  The cabin is eventually breached and in an effort to save his family, Corey hides the others in the cellar, blocking the door—he is, however, quickly abducted by the aliens. The remaining members of the family are soon saved by a returned Sean who takes them to his truck, planning to take them back to town down the mountain. His plan is a quick failure as the lights, and thus the aliens, find them and in a last effort attempt at saving the family, he tells them to head to a nearby barn and take refuge.  Sean mysteriously returns to them after a dramatic escape and the group, believing they're safe, attempt to leave the barn—Katie, however, is killed and abducted, along with Sean. Riley and Jillian take refuge deep in the woods for the night, hiding in silence and in the dark from close-by aliens.  Climbing down the mountain at dawn, they see a town in the valley below and soon find a road they are confident will lead back to civilization but it leads back to the tunnel where their father was abducted, instead. Jillian collapses in despair, at the same moment a police car arrives (to search for the prior missing police car). It doesn’t take long for the aliens to abduct the policeman, Jillian, and Riley, who is still clinging to the camera—the remaining footage shows a rapid ascension into [[Low Earth orbit|orbit]], and an in-time repeat of the same footage from the beginning of the film. Two men in respirators and [[Hazmat suit]]s are seen taking the camera away in a U.S. Air Force van.  In a mid-credits scene, Peter Morris is found one year later by a North Carolina [[State police (United States)|state trooper]]. He is huddling on a bridge, naked, dishevelled and in a state of shock. The fate of the rest of the family is uncertain, though comments made by the police officer on his radio suggest that Peter is not the only member of the family to have been found.

He realizes that Ressmore is actually sick, and that the real reason she made the trip was so that Nana could heal her.

Peter uses information left by his father to locate the video message in an abandoned subway station's hidden lab. Richard explains that he had to leave because he refused to cooperate with Norman's plans to make biogenetic weapons.

Dutton]]) daughter Helen (Larissa Vereza), who remains unaware that she is a human mind in a machine body.  Hammond does not trust machines due to a prior incident in which his partner was killed by an automated gun turret despite their using a code to control it, and maintains a tense, often sarcastic relationship with Andy. Hammond and Andy are dispatched to the "Zone," a quarantined section of Los Angeles devastated by an earthquake and subsequent nuclear leaks, which have infected and mutated the Zone's residents.  However, they are unaware that a number of their fellow LAPD officers are corrupt, working for Mayor Jacobs himself in a plan to provoke violence with the goal of justifying an invasion of the Zone and termination of its residents. The corrupt cops are led by Sgt. Jones ([[Kadeem Hardison]]), Hammond's colleague. Hammond and Andy reach the Zone and trace Helen's cellphone, but have to be rescued by her when a bomb is planted on their car. She reveals to them that Zone residents are giving birth to healthy, mutation-free children, causing them to realize that the story about nuclear leaks was a lie. En route to what they believe to be an extraction point, Hammond, Andy and Helen realize that the lie about nuclear leakage was spread to manipulate land prices, and that the real source of the disease is the food drop program for which Mayor Jacobs has received honor.  At the extraction point, Helen realizes she is an android, and Hammond comforts her. Jones and a team of corrupt cops arrive intending to kill Hammond, Andy and Helen, but Andy discovers their motives using analysis of their facial motions.

With very little time left, they embrace in the back seat of their car, and Hammond dies. Andy reaches Helen with help from her nurse android, whose computers he had accessed earlier, and gives her an injection. Mayor Jacobs arrives, and believing Helen to be dead, thanks Andy for his service and claims Helen signed a [[do not resuscitate order]], which must be enforced. However, Helen wakes up and remembers everything, much to Jacobs's shock. Andy uses his systems to broadcast their conversation, revealing Mayor Jacobs's treachery to the public. The remaining honest police arrive to arrest Jacobs, who commits suicide.  Some time later, Hammond's neural patterns have been programmed into a full android, resurrecting him in a body similar to Andy's.

They drive to the Brooklyn Dancing Academy, where Henry finds Tommy sitting alone in one of the dance studios. The two begin to dance, just like when Tommy was a little boy. After sharing this moment with his son, Henry informs Sharon that he does not want to know when he will die; he only wants to know that he will try and lead a better life and that they can both find happiness. He then collapses on her shoulder, exhausted. It's then revealed that Henry goes to the hospital and lives for another eight days, giving him time to share special moments with his family. One year later after Henry dies, Bette, Tommy, Aaron and Sharon are together on a cruise ship, where they celebrate Henry's life and spread his ashes across the East River. The captain of the cruise ship tells them that spreading ashes on the East River is illegal, but they berate him in Henry's honor.  
Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie
 In 1983, 2 million copies of the "worst video game of all time", ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|ET]]'' (referred to as "Eee Tee" for copyright reasons) for the [[Atari 2600]], are dumped into a landfill outside [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]. In the present day, game executive Mandi ([[Sarah Glendening]]) of Cockburn Industries, Inc. proposes to her bosses creating an intentionally bad sequel, ''EeeTee 2''. Thanks to the popularity and success of the Angry Video Game Nerd, sales of poorly made video games have increased dramatically, and a review of ''EeeTee 2'' by the Nerd would drive his fans to buy the game.  The Nerd ([[James Rolfe]]) and his sidekick Cooper Folly ([[Jeremy Suarez]]) are working on a video game review. The Nerd has become disheartened over the years, as his fans continue to buy and play the games he reviews and warns people to stay away from. On top of this, the Nerd must promote and sell bad video games as part of his job at GameCops. When he discovers marketing for ''EeeTee 2,'' his fans encourage him to review ''ET'', something he has stood against for years because the game scarred him as a child. After some personal thought, the Nerd decides to go to Alamogordo to debunk the conspiracy surrounding the buried cartridges. He is accompanied by Cooper and Mandi, and the trip is completely funded by Cockburn Industries.  While filming their expedition, Cooper reveals that he believes in a super-being known as Death Mwauthzyx, who has the power to destroy all existence. Sergeant McButter (Helena Barrett) and the legless General Dark Onward (Stephen Mendel), thinking the trio is looking for extraterrestrials, attempt to capture them. Onward accidentally blows his right arm off with a grenade, giving the trio enough time to escape.  The Nerd, Cooper and Mandi search for the creator of ''ET'', [[Howard Scott Warshaw]], for answers. They instead stumble across the home of Dr. Zandor (Time Winters), who tells them that ''ET''s level design is an exact map of [[Area 51]]. Dr. Zandor gave the code to Warshaw to help him meet the five-week deadline [[Atari]] set for ''ET''s completion, and to exact revenge on the government for kidnapping and holding hostage an alien he was attempting to free. The government ordered the burial of the cartridges, while Zandor escaped with the metallic material Area 51 was researching at the time in an attempt to reassemble the alien's spaceship, replacing it with tin foil. Mandi is captured by McButter while wandering outside of the house. The Nerd and Cooper, believing she is a double agent, do not go after her.  Going back to the Alamogordo site, the Nerd and Cooper discover a large crowd of fans and the head of Cockburn Industries promoting the release of ''ET 2'' with the promise of digging out a copy of the original ''ET'' from the site. The Nerd tells his fans there are no cartridges buried there, but Warshaw himself appears and tells fans the opposite. Annoyed, the Nerd breaks into Area 51 disguised as an alien. He is captured, and General Onward attempts to force him to play ''ET''. Onward launches a missile at [[Mount Fuji]], the basis for the Atari logo, and while leaving the room, gets his left arm cut off in the door. During the launch countdown, an alien resembling the one in ''ET'' grabs the Nerd and pulls him to safety.  The destruction of Mount Fuji releases Death Mwauthzyx, who was trapped inside the mountain. Meanwhile, Mandi keeps McButter away from the Nerd and Cooper's location, eventually leading them to a confrontation on the [[Paris Las Vegas|Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas]].  The Nerd and alien escape in a fighter jet similar to one in the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] [[Top Gun (video game)#Gameplay|''Top Gun'' video game]], while the alien reveals Death Mwauthzyx can destroy all existence by turning the satellite dish on his head. Cooper is captured by Death Mwauthzyx and brought to [[Las Vegas]], where Mandi knocks McButter off the Eiffel Tower to her death. Mandi is also captured by Death Mwauthzyx. The Nerd and Alien crash-land at the Alamogordo site, where a captured Dr. Zandor shouts to them that he hid the alien's spaceship metal inside the millions of ''ET'' game cartridges. Alien summons every single copy of the game to form the spaceship. The Nerd and Alien leave for Las Vegas to stop Death Mwauthzyx. The armless General Onward is killed when attempting to stop them.  The Nerd fires a laser at Death Mwauthzyx's satellite dish, causing Death Mwauthzyx to disappear forever. They return to the Alamogordo site and reunite with Dr. Zandor and the Nerd's fans. Cooper and Mandi share a kiss, while the Nerd finally reviews ''ET'' during the end credits for his fans before the Alien leaves for good.

At first, Guru Shastri ([[Brahmanandam]]), the head of the musical troupe performing the concert refuses to play for them given the fact that Raju and Chandru are gangsters/dons, but accepts, when Chandru pointed out Raju and Jeeva are lovers and Jeeva wanted to see his concert. Unfortunately, Guru Shastri's music turned out to be awful making Raju, Chandru, and Jeeva leave the theater in disgust.   Then, a parade with some very good music came by and they all danced to it for fun and in celebration. It was there, that Jeeva understands the friendship between Raju and Chandru.

When Raju and Karim came there, Karim was told that his daughter is kidnapped. When Raju prepares to go rescue Karim's daughter, Karim reveals him that wasn't his daughter, who has been kidnapped, but it was none other than Jeeva. Jeeva, knowing that Raju is alive given that his 'body' is never found and knowing that he will come back to Mumbai, decides to wait for him, until he finishes his quest for revenge against Imran for Chandru's death, understanding how much Chandru meant to him. Raju went to the location, beats up the henchmen, and gets Jeeva, who had her left hand injured by the leader of the henchmen using his smoking cigarette to safety by having be taken away by Karim, while killing all of them including the leader, who before dying founded out Jeeva was Raju's lover because her left hand had a tattoo of Raju's name on it, which she got during the time she and Raju had a blast.   Unfortunately, he gets captured by Imran's top four henchmen and was taken to get killed by Imran face to face. Imran was about to kill Raju with the very same knife he had used to kill Chandru, only to held gunpoint by his main henchmen, which are now of them. Raju reveals just like how Imran got Amar, Johnny, and Manoj to betray him and Chandru, he used Imran's own remaining henchmen to betray him by making a similar deal to them, that Imran made to Amar, Johnny, and Manoj. When one of them remains faithful to Imran, while the other three decided to betray him, one of the three, mainly the leader of the group killed the faithful one. Raju grabbed Imran's knife from him and killed in the very exact way Imran killed Chandru, while Imran realizes his fate is sealed before he died.  Fulfilling his revenge over Chandru's death, the henchmen decides to clear up Imran's murder and ask Raju to leave, only for Raju to double crosses them all and killed them with a gun.

While Mia calls the police, she and John are attacked by the Higgins' killers. The police arrive and shoot the man dead while the woman commits suicide by slitting her own throat inside the nursery while holding the porcelain doll.

In the days following the attack, a series of paranormal activities occur around the Form's residence. Afterwards, Mia gives birth to a healthy baby girl. She and John name their child Leah. The family rents an apartment in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and, after finding the doll that John had discarded since Annabelle's previous attack in one of their boxes, another set of paranormal events plagues Mia and her daughter.

Mia calls back Detective Clarkin to gather information about Annabelle and the cultist and learns that the cult intends to [[Evocation|summon supernatural beings]]. With the help of bookseller and fellow tenant Evelyn, Mia realizes that the cult practiced [[Theistic Satanism|devil worship]], which summoned a [[demon]] who followed the family after they moved to their apartment in order to claim a soul. Upon returning home, Mia and Leah are attacked by the demon who reveals itself while manipulating the doll. Mia and John contact their parish priest, Father Perez, who informs them that demons sometimes attach themselves to inanimate objects as an advantage to accomplish their goals and that a human soul must be offered for a purpose. Without any hopes of exorcising the demon out of the doll, Father Perez decides to take it away to seek help from [[Ed and Lorraine Warren|the Warrens]] for investigation. But before he can enter the church, the demon impersonating Annabelle's spirit attacks him and grabs the doll.  The priest is hospitalized on the next day and, when John checks on him, Father Perez warns the latter that after sensing its powerful presence, the demon's true intention is to claim Mia's soul. That night, while Evelyn is visiting Mia, the demon uses Father Perez's physical form to sneak into the apartment and abduct Leah in exchange for her mother's soul. To spare her daughter, Mia attempts to jump out of the window with the doll but John arrives in time along with Evelyn to stop her.

Six months later, the doll is bought from an antique shop by a mother as a gift for her daughter Debbie, one of the nursing students from the prelude of the [[The Conjuring|first film]].

Anna is seen following them and enters the house as well. As they all enter, the door is locked and cannot be reopened. A smashing noise is heard upstairs and Hiroshi goes up to check by himself. They all, except Shun, receive unknown calls simultaneously, but no one is speaking. It is shown that the signals are gone.  Right after, something seems to pass them in the next room. Takeshi became paranoid and started running around the house to hide. Shun encounters Anna and they move together to find a way out, while Shun points out that he feels that he has seen that something before but can't remember.  Takuro and Mika open the door to the basement and Takuro goes down while Mika waits upstairs. Hearing something, Mika checks on the room next door and notices an opening, where she looks directly into a very big eye. Terrified, Mika runs away and is found by Hiroshi. They both check around and find Takeshi hiding in a cupboard. Takeshi mumbles about Naoki's death and cut by Mika saying that he will be killed by Takuro as he talks about it again. Takeshi refuses to move, so Hiroshi suggests that he stays there and they will pick him up when they find the way out.   As Hiroshi and Mika go out of the room, they meet up with Anna and Shun. Mika questions Anna's presence but Hiroshi diverts the questions. They then go together to check around the house. Meanwhile, Takeshi gets a phone call, but no response from the other end. He then hears Takuro calling him from outside the cupboard and opens the door as a big blue hand grabs his head. The group hears Takeshi's scream and come back to check on him. As they reach the room, they see the door open and Takeshi, bleeding, is thrown out. He asks for help before being dragged back and the door closes. As the group enters the room, they finds Takeshi's dismembered body. Anna and Hiroshi pressure Mika about Takuro's whereabouts and about Naoki, but Mika refuses to tell them and runs away, chased by Hiroshi. Anna confronts Shun who describes that this event is the same as the game he created.   Mika goes back to Takuro and begs him to leave immediately, which he takes lightly. Mika then goes to Takuro and seemingly seduces him just to steal his keys for the house. Takuro ignores her and continues on with his work. Mika rushes to the main door but the key doesn't seem to work. As she hears noises, she goes to check and encounters the Blue Demon, which then kills Mika.  With Shun's knowledge of the game, they continue on finding the keys and items to move forward inside the house. They eventually reach a room with a blood-stained piano. As they observe the piano, Mika is heard calling Shun through the door. Anna stops him from opening the door saying that Mika will not call him. Shun is puzzled as the door gets smashed and the Blue Demon is seen. The Blue Demon enters the room and the two flee. Shun goes to a room with chained drawers locked with number combinations. He manages to grab the handkerchief as the Blue Demon enters from another door. They run away to go back to the piano room. Shun says that they have to use the handkerchief to wipe off the blood for the combinations of a safe.  As they outrun the Blue Demon, Anna is stunned upon seeing the remains of Mika. As they sit and calm themselves, Anna talks about her brother Naoki, the same boy who was killed in a traffic accident as mentioned in the beginning of the film. The accident was called suicide with the assumption to his inability to withstand bullying. Anna refers how Shun is similar to her brother. The door then opens as Hiroshi is seen standing on the door. They then go to the piano room, retrieve the code to get the key to eventually reach the basement.  As they reach the basement, they find that it has been opened by Takuro. As they go down, Takuro strikes Hiroshi, rendering him unconscious. Anna confronts Takuro and believes that Takuro is responsible for killing her brother, which he lightly denies. As Anna begins mentioning Shun's name, he gets annoyed. Puzzled by the conversation, Shun reaches the box Takuro carried and opens it, revealing his own lifeless body inside. Shun then realizes how the group, except Anna, has been ignoring him the whole time, how Takeshi got so scared when Shun was with him (for Takeshi cannot see Shun), and why Anna said Mika will not call him, because he is already dead and cannot be seen by everyone, except Anna. He then flashbacks to the time Takuro bullied him in the riverbank. Takuro hit Shun in the head, killing him. It is then revealed that Takuro went to the empty house to hide Shun's body. Takuro then explained that Shun used Takuro's name in the game and got mad. Shun is terrified with the truth and finally disappears as Anna apologizes to him.  Takuro plans on killing Anna since she knows too much, but suddenly gets caught by the Blue Demon and eaten offscreen. Anna wakes Hiroshi up and the two flee. The Blue Demon notices them and chases after them. Hiroshi, knowing that he can't move so easily and slows Anna down, insists on staying to buy Anna some time to escape. The Blue Demon stomps on him as it chases Anna. Anna finally reaches the same room she was in as in the beginning of the movie, but instead of his brother, Shun is calling her from the door. Anna, confused about what to do next, opens the door into the shining light, where she is greeted by Shun.  The scene goes back to the river, as Shun asks Anna whether she is okay. Shun then explains about the dynamics of the game as Anna notices his scar and holds his hand, telling him to speak whatever troubles him to her, as she can't help her brother and hopes that the same thing will not happen to Shun. Shun replies by holding Anna's hand back, with the screen on the laptop says that they've cleared the game.

Apartment Troubles
   
Arima Nambi
 Arjun Krishna ([[Vikram Prabhu]]), a technician in a [[Chennai]]-based [[BMW]] showroom, meets Anamika Raghunath ([[Priya Anand]]), a college student, while out with her friends at Hard Rock Cafe. They are attracted to each other and go on a date the following night. Following the date, Anamika invites Arjun to her apartment for a bottle of [[vodka]]. Things go well until Anamika gets kidnapped by two men. Arjun, who was in the bathroom when Anamika was kidnapped, immediately lodges a complaint at the [[Besant Nagar]] police station. Sub-Inspector Arumugam ([[M. S. Baskar]]), who is assigned the case, then goes to Anamika's apartment along with Arjun, but finds that the apartment is cleaned up and there seems to be no sign that a kidnapping has taken place, while the apartment's watchman insists that Anamika had not returned to her apartment for three days. Also, the CCTV camera installed at the apartment does not show any men arriving and taking away Anamika, prompting Arumugam to suspect that Arjun has lodged a false complaint as he is drunk. However, when Arumugam calls up Anamika's father Raghunath Kumar (Shankar Sundaram), the chairman of the TV news channel Channel 24, he merely replies that he doesn't know anything about the kidnapping and that Anamika is holidaying in [[Goa]], at which Arumugam suspects something amiss, realising that Arjun had not lied after all. Arumugam and Arjun rush to Raghunath's mansion, where they see him being threatened by the two men who had kidnapped Anamika as well as the police inspector of Besant Nagar to give them a [[SD card]] which has some critical information. Raghunath calls up his editor and asks him to give the SD card to the three men, after which he is killed by them. Arjun and Arumugam pursue the three men. While Arjun manages to kill the police inspector, the other two men escape, killing Arumugam in the process.  Arjun then goes to the Channel 24 office, where he witnesses the two men coming out of the office with the SD card (and having killed the editor in the process). He hides in the SUV which they are travelling in, pursuing them till a [[brothel]], where he finds Anamika unconscious and gagged. He frees her, takes away the SD card and then escapes with her. The two men then contact their boss, who is the chief rowdy and right hand of the [[Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (India)|Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology]] and potential Prime Ministerial candidate Rishi Dev ([[J. D. Chakravarthy]]). He kills the two men and informs the situation to Rishi Dev, who decides to rush to Chennai within the next three hours.  Having got the SD card as well as its password, Arjun inserts the memory card into his mobile phone and sees that it has only one file in it; a video. The video shows the murder of model-turned-actress Megha Sharma ([[Lekha Washington]]) at the hands of Rishi Dev two days ago and how he had fabricated the incident to make it look like the actress died due to a gas leak at her mansion. Arjun and Anamika, horrified on seeing this and also on the extent to which Rishi Dev's henchmen went to keep the video from being seen, decide to expose Rishi Dev by uploading the video on [[YouTube]]. This backfires when Arjun's friend Raj ([[Arjunan (actor)|Arjunan]]), brings Rishi Dev's henchmen to the hotel room where Arjun and Anamika are staying, having been bribed by them to do so. They manage to subdue Raj as well as Rishi Dev's henchmen and go on the run.  Meanwhile, Rishi Dev arrives in Chennai, and after finding out that Arjun and Anamika attempted to upload the video on YouTube, blocks Internet access in Chennai. He also lodges a false complaint against them to the police commissioner Arulraj ([[Yog Japee]]), claiming that they killed Raghunath to get his money and also to fuel Anamika's "drug-addiction". This makes Arjun and Anamika fugitives, with every movement of them now being tracked by the police. Anamika, in incognito, manages to contact every leading media house to assemble at [[The Forum Vijaya|the Forum Vijaya Mall]] (where they are hiding) at 3 pm as there is going to be a "sensational event" there. This move backfires completely on Arjun and Anamika, as Anamika accidentally breaks the SD card, destroying the only piece of evidence which is against Rishi Dev. The police take advantage of the media assembled at the mall and claim on live television that Arjun and Anamika are murderers, announcing a 5 lakh reward for those who capture them.  Arjun then hatches another plan to expose Rishi Dev. He contacts Rishi Dev through the Arulraj, asking him to meet him later that night at his private airfield alone. At the airfield, he tries to force Rishi Dev to reveal the truth about Megha Sharma's death, using his mobile phone to record the meeting. But before he can get out the truth, the police arrives, following which Rishi Dev destroys the mobile phone and beats him up, all the while revealing that he killed Megha Sharma, but he cannot do anything about it because he is going to be arrested for the attempted murder of a Union Minister. Unfortunately for Rishi Dev, Arjun had organized their entire meeting, as well as Rishi Dev's revelation, using a button camera, with the video having been shared using [[3G]] connectivity to Anamika, who then ensured that the video was broadcast live by all leading TV news channels, thus exposing Rishi Dev, who is soon arrested.  A few weeks later, Arjun and Anamika, who have now been cleared of all charges, go on another date at a beach resort. During the date, Arjun [[Marriage proposal|proposes marriage]] to Anamika, to which she agrees.  
Aranmanai

They are going to tidy the palace for owners who are coming to their ancestral Aranmanai (palace) to sell it. During the night, the cook ([[Dhandapani]]) is frightened by some supernatural being in the palace and he disappears.  The next day, an estranged Eshwari ([[Kovai Sarala]]) returns with her husband ([[Manobala]]) and son Muliankannan ([[Nithin Sathya]]). Eshwari's brother ([[Chitra Lakshmanan]]) and his daughter Maya ([[Raai Laxmi]]) welcome them. The brother and sister, along with another older brother's son Murali ([[Vinay Rai]]) and his new wife Madhavi ([[Andrea Jeremiah]]) have gathered to sell their Palace off to Ayyanar, who had leased the property for five years. Meanwhile, Paalsamy ([[N. Santhanam|Santhanam]]) sneaks into Aranmanai under the guise of a cook, to find a photograph that is a sole evidence that he is also an heir to the palace, so that he can claim his share of the money.  They stay at the Aranmanai but strange incidents happen. Madhavi sees a servant's daughter talking to an mysterious girl called Selvi . The mother of the girl explains that she's autistic. Mishaps continue to happen and they are unable to sell the palace, so they extend their stay. Meanwhile, 2 other servants have also gone missing. Now Ravi ([[Sundar.C]]), the older brother of Madhavi, comes to the palace to meet his sister. Hilarious incidents happen as Paalsamy tries to woo Maya and he has Ravi and Muliankannan competing with him. Madhavi and Maya tell Ravi that there are weird things happening in the house. So he sets cameras up around the house with Maya's help.  Ravi sees that a worker is backing away from something, but the camera starts to fizz and goes out. At the same time, a fortune teller ([[Yogi Babu]]) in front of the house runs away in terror, seeing something. The next day in the village pond, there are three bodies of the murdered servants found by the cops. Ravi is shocked and visits the fortune teller who ran away from his house that night. The man reveals that he witness a worker being killed by a woman possessed as a vengeful spirit and he gives him an egg, and tells that when the possessed person is within the egg's radius, it will start spinning. The police officers interrogate all the members of the house about the murders with Ravi seated opposite them and the egg placed in front of him. Finally when the egg spins, he looks up to see none other than his sister Madhavi sitting for interrogation. He follows her and sees Madhavi don a big round of vermilion on her forehead but her reflection shows Selvi ([[Hansika Motwani]]). Relating the little girl's talks and the name Selvi, Ravi sets out to investigate.  Villagers say that Selvi was the girl who stole the Temple deity's jewels and ran off from the village. He comes across Selvi's friend Ramya, who says that Selvi was a good person and not a thief. She says that back then, Murali was not yet married and when he came to the village he fell in love with Selvi. Selvi also liked him but she is a girl who is often possessed by the goddess and predicts future. So she held herself back to maintain her holiness. On the day Murali was leaving the village, he expected her reply and asked her to meet him at his house. Ramya encouraged Selvi to go and confess her love to Murali. Selvi left the house on that note but she has been missing till now.  Per Ravi's plan, when Ramya comes to meet the possessed Madhavi as selvi, she recognizes Ramya and tells her all that happened after she left the house that day. It seems that Ayyanar and his friends (the workers) replaced the temple jewelry with fake ones and Selvi found it out using her premonition and confronted them. So they brutally killed her and buried her inside the palace when she came to meet Murali. She also says that she wants to be with Murali always. As today is an auspicious day, if she gets intimate with Murali, no one can ever drive her out of Madhavi's body. If they cannot get close today, she will kill Murali, so that they will be together in death.  After hearing the story Ravi hears this and tries to stop selvi but in vain. He meets a priest ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) who says that there is only two ways to stop Selvi's mayhem. One is by using a strong emotion to bring Madhavi to her senses while she is possessed. It is a tough job and the other option is to bring Murali to the river junction where the ritual of the Eclipse takes place and goddess deities will be immersed in the river, generating a powerful energy which will help in separating Selvi's soul from Madhavi. Ravi instructs the members of the house to somehow disturb them and cause confusion to buy time. Selvi meanwhile, sends Murali into a trance and leaves the house to kill the remaining person - Ayyanar. She finds him and finally kills him.  When she is gone, the priest and Ravi are back in the house trying to bring Murali out of his trance but Selvi is back and does not let Murali go, and threatens to injure Madhavi's body. The priest traps her in a circle of fire and helps Murali leave the house with Ravi. But she escapes and follows them and their car overturns and falls into the river. Selvi tries to drown Murali but Ravi stops her and tells Madhavi is pregnant and brings her to her senses but only briefly. At the same time, near the shore of the river, the goddess deity is immersed in the ritual and the power comes through the water to Selvi and she is released from Madhavi's body as the sun comes up.  Selvi can no longer possess Madhavi so she sadly disappears and the couple reunites. Ravi also unites with Maya in the end. And when they all pose for a photograph in front of the Palace, a zoomed in shot shows a ghostly figure moving near a window in the palace, implying Selvi has returned to the palace again.

As Above, So Below (film)
 Scarlett Marlowe, a young [[alchemy]] scholar, is searching for the [[philosopher's stone]], a legendary substance capable of turning base metals into gold and granting eternal life. After finding the Rose Key and narrowly escaping a cave collapse in Iran, she travels to Paris, where she enlists the help of her ex-boyfriend, George, and cameraman Benji. They use the Rose Key to translate the headstone of [[Nicholas Flamel]], who wrote about the philosopher's stone. The headstone contains a riddle that leads them to believe that the philosopher's stone is hidden 370 feet underneath the streets of Paris. Scarlett also enlists the help of a guide named Papillon, his girlfriend Souxie, and their friend Zed, who are familiar with the layout of the [[Catacombs of Paris]]. George refuses to follow the group into the catacombs, but is driven underground with the rest when a policeman spots them trespassing. After crawling through a narrow tunnel which collapses behind them, they encounter female cultists who appear to be performing a mysterious ritual. The group then find themselves in a blocked tunnel that Papillon is reluctant to enter, as people who have entered have never been seen again.  After venturing deeper into the catacombs, the group encounter La Taupe, a friend of Papillon who disappeared into the catacombs years earlier. He agrees to guide them out, explaining that the only way out is down. They eventually find a tomb filled with treasure, as well as the philosopher's stone. Removing the stone, Scarlett realizes that the treasure is a trap, and the chamber collapses. With the philosopher's stone, Scarlett is able to heal injuries that Souxie sustained in the fall. La Taupe is lost under the rubble, and the group decide to leave him behind.  The group find a [[Gnostic]] Star of David, which symbolizes the notion "As above, so below." Seeing that a door has been drawn onto the ceiling above, Scarlett finds a real door in the floor below. Beyond the door, the group finds the entrance to a tunnel that is marked with the phrase "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here" in Greek, identical to the entrance to Hell in ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's Inferno]]''.  Passing through, they find a reflection of the room they left behind. There, they discover La Taupe, who kills Souxie before disappearing. The remaining members of the group realize that they must continue deeper into the catacombs in order to escape, and they climb down a hole. However, Benji is pushed to his death by the lead female cultist. Leaving his body behind, the rest encounter a man sitting in a burning car, which recalls an incident in which Papillon was forced to leave someone to die in a car crash; the man pulls Papillon into the burning car before it disappears and Papillon is left buried upside down. The rest of the group are unable to pull Papillon from the ground, and they decide to continue into the catacombs. Visions of demons follow the group through dark tunnels, and one attacks George. After the philosopher's stone fails to heal his injuries, George murmurs, "Vitriol." Remembering the word from a riddle, Scarlett realizes that the stone itself is yet another trap. Only by returning it will she find the real philosopher's stone.  As she races back to the tomb, she finds a hanged man, whom she recognizes as her father. She apologizes to him for not answering the phone the night that he killed himself. She then returns to the tomb, where she finds a polished mirror that makes her realize that she possesses the magical abilities of the philosopher's stone. Scarlett returns to George and heals him with a kiss. She then explains to George and Zed that the only way to escape is to admit to their torments, just as she admitted that she feels responsible for her father's suicide. George admits that he accidentally allowed his brother to drown when the pair were kids because he got lost looking for help. Zed admits that he has a son he knows is his, but chooses not to acknowledge, which explains the visions of a running boy he has been seeing during their journey. As the demons continue to chase them, the group jump down a deep hole. At the bottom, the hole above them closes and a manhole appears on the ground below. Jumping through, the group find themselves right side up on a street overlooking the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]]. Scarlett and George hold each other, realizing that they are safe, while a dazed Zed walks away into the night.

There they play a [[Maneki-neko|Maneki Neko]], where students dressed as mice attempt to throw a ball into a hoop attached to the collar of a giant cat doll. Those who miss are killed. Amaya wins this challenge and enables the students to move on to the next challenge in a giant cube hovering Tokyo, as hundreds of schools in Japan and elsewhere face similar tests where only handfuls of students survive.  Shun must keep winning a series of different deadly children's games in order to protect himself and Ichika. He has no knowledge of who is behind the games or what their ultimate purpose is. Meanwhile, a troubled classmate named Takeru seems to revel in the opportunity to cause the death of other students. When he and Shun fight, they and Ichika were being put out of consciousness by sleeping gas released by the giant cat doll.  The next game is [[Kagome Kagome|Kokeshi]], where the students have to be blindfolded and will guess which of four floating [[Kokeshi]] wooden dolls is behind them within 10 seconds. If they fail to do so, they will be hit with a red laser and the dolls will use [[telekinesis]] to destroy their bodies. If the Kokeshi lose, they will explode and one of them releases an answer key which opens the doors and frees the students to the next level. There, Shun meets Takase, whom he will save and will enter the next level. He also saves another man and Ichika from being killed by a fifth Kokeshi by holding their hands.  Shun and three others join two men to use their keys to unlock a giant smiling head. Amaya brings in three more keys and kills a prisoner that he brought into the room. The seven survivors use their keys, and the giant head rolls away to dig a tunnel into the next room. Meanwhile, each player is displayed on television screens for the others to see.  The next game is Shirou Kuma, within a frozen room. The students have to answer the white bear's questions politely and honestly, while Takase and a friend get killed. Shun soon realized that the bear was the liar and the bear's real color, black, therefore letting the remaining 5 students and killing the bear.  The final game was Matryoshka, which must be completed before sundown. The remaining 5 picked a stick each and who gets the red one is the ″Devil″. Whoever gets the face shown or seen by the Devil, is caught and thrown into a cell. If you kick the can, Takeru got the red stick and soon, the 3 students have been caught while Shun found armor to make his face not seen. Shun fell into the sea and Takeru pulled the armor so he can be saved. Shun rose up before Takeru pulled out the armor and Shun were the first to kick the can. They had an ice-cream party where they learned their fates, and that the intention of the deadly games were simply for entertainment. Shun and Takeru lived while Ichika and the others were killed by a Matryoshka doll that disintegrated them with its lasers. Shun and Takeru emerge to the top of the cube where they see crowds cheer for them, while a hermit who watches them from his room goes out of his house, possibly to find the real identity of "God".  Amaya celebrates while Shun kneels in despair from all of his losses. Shun states that "there is no God", while one of the Matryoshka dolls suggests that those deadly games were to lead them to "God", as it shows him a vagrant who was also an observer of those games.

Autómata
  In the late 2030s, solar flares irradiate the Earth, killing over 99% of the world's population. The survivors gather in a network of safe cities and build primitive humanoid robots, called Pilgrims, to help rebuild and operate in the harsh environment. These robots have two unalterable protocols: they cannot harm any form of life, and they may not repair, modify or alter themselves or other robots in any way. Initially seen as mankind's salvation, they are relegated to [[manual labor]] when they fail to stop the advance of [[desertification]]. Society has regressed due to lack of technology besides the Pilgrims (lack of functional aircraft or other transport prevents travel and cars are a rare commodity) and humanity is on the brink of extinction.  In 2044, Jacq Vaucan – an insurance investigator for ROC, the company that manufactures Pilgrims – investigates a report from Wallace, a police officer who shot a robot he claims was modifying itself. Jacq discovers the robot hid a rare nuclear battery that could power a robot indefinitely. The next day, Jacq follows a robot who was stealing parts. When he corners it, it sets itself on fire. Jacq salvages the remains and speculates to his boss, Robert, that there may be a "clocksmith", someone who illegally modifies robots, who is overriding the second protocol. Incredulous, Robert rejects this possibility but offers Jacq a transfer out of the city if he can find evidence. Jacq's pregnant wife initially rejects his plans but she eventually relents.  Jacq and Wallace investigate a brothel, where they find Cleo, a modified robot that Wallace subsequently shoots in the leg. When Jacq objects, Wallace says that Cleo's owner will lead them to the clocksmith; Wallace also threatens to kill Jacq if he does not split the proceeds of the battery on the black market. Jacq follows Cleo's owner to a clocksmith named Dr. Dupré, who claims not to know who altered Cleo, an action that would destroy Cleo's [[CPU]]. Jacq leaves the burned robot's CPU with her and offers to give her the battery if she can locate information on the clocksmith. When Dupré installs the modified CPU in Cleo, Cleo begins self-repairing. Dupré contacts Jacq, who alerts Robert; however, ROC intercepts Jacq's message and sends a team of assassins to Dupré's lab.  Dupré is killed, but Jacq escapes in a car driven by Cleo. When Cleo takes them into a maze of [[stanchion]]s, both cars crash; the assassins are killed, and Jacq is severely injured. Cleo takes Jacq with her into a radioactive desert, where they are joined by three other robots, none of whom will obey Jacq's orders. However, the first protocol forces them to prevent his death. Desperate to return to the city to be with his pregnant wife, Jacq makes contact with Robert, who sends Wallace to recover him. Wallace threatens Jacq's life and destroys two of the robots, who have objected to his actions; Jacq kills Wallace with a flare gun before he can also destroy Cleo. Wallace's partner flees after taking a battery from one of the robots.  Robert's boss reveals that the first built Pilgrim, unburdened by the second principle, designed the subsequent models. As no human could understand the programming, it was thought to be impossible to subvert. ROC forces Robert to accompany a team sent to kill Jacq and the unknown clocksmith before the robots can evolve further beyond human understanding. When Robert objects to their kidnapping Jacq's wife and baby daughter, Conway, the leader, shoots him and leaves him for dead. Meanwhile, Jacq meets the robot responsible for modifying the others. Initially skeptical, Jacq eventually accepts that the robot naturally evolved, like humanity. After a series of philosophical discussions, Jacq gives them his battery, which they use to complete a new design. The robots repair a vehicle for Jacq, and he leaves for the city.  When Conway reaches the robot outpost, he destroys two of the four robots. Jacq finds the dying Robert and returns to the outpost as Conway wounds Cleo. Jacq kills all ROC assassins but Conway, though he is further wounded in the battle. As Conway prepares to kill Jacq, the new robot saves his life by pushing Conway off a cliff. Jacq overcomes his distrust of the uninhibited robot when reunited with his family, and he leaves for the coast with them, as Cleo and the new robot venture further into the irradiated desert, where no humans can follow them.

Avatarachi Goshta
 Kaustubh(Mihiresh Joshi) is an innocent little boy. He loves to live in his imaginative world that is full of wonders and adventures. The tales that his grandma, Aaji(Sulabha Deshpande) tells him is the base on which he has built a few fantasies. The Dashavtar tales from Indian mythology are his favourite. These tales are based on Lord Vishnu’s Ten avatars. Kaustubh has also learnt through these tales that Lord Vishnu’s tenth avatar, the Kalki avatar is going to be in Kaliyuga, the modern era we are in. Innocent mind of Kaustubh, who is in his fourth standard, is captured with the imagination that he himself is that Kalki avatar. His close friend Mangya(Yash Kulkarni), who is equally thrilled with this idea, confirms his belief. A few incidental coincidences validate Kaustubh’s imagination. Once he is convinced, he shares this secret with Amod(Adinath Kothare), the young engineering student that is a tenant in Kaustubh’s home. Amod who is atheist by nature, does not pay much attention. Convinced by the idea of being the Kalki avatar, Kaustubh becomes so confident that he tries the biggest adventure he is possessed with since quite long. He gets injured and suffers from a fractured leg. This acts as a big blow to Kaustubh’s fantasy and his emotionally driven imaginative world gets shattered. He finds it difficult to come to terms with the reality and goes in a shell. He starts avoiding his dear friend Mangya and even everybody at his home. Observing his strange behaviour, the Doctor advises Kaustubh’s parents to consult a psychiatrist. But they don’t act upon the advice in anticipation of the social stigma. Kaustubh’s mother(Leena Bhagwat) realizes that Kaustubh who feels so detached from everyone, is pretty comfortable with Amod. So she requests Amod to help Kaustubh come out of this emotional turmoil. Amod accepts this challenge and in an attempt of getting into the crux of the problem, gets friendly with Mangya. He then understands that thereal cause is Kaustubh’s fantasy based passion of becoming an avatar. Amod shares with Kaustubh a different perspective about the very concept of the avatar and slowly helps him come out of the mental stress he is facing. Kaustubh with Amod’s help overcomes the depression and regains his confidence.

The Babadook
  Amelia Vanek is a troubled and exhausted widow who has brought up her six-year-old son Samuel alone. Her late husband, Oskar, was killed in a car accident that occurred as he drove Amelia to the hospital during her labour. Sam begins displaying erratic behaviour: he becomes an insomniac and is preoccupied with an imaginary monster, against which he has built weapons to fight. Amelia is forced to pick up her son from school after Sam brings one of the weapons there. One night, Sam asks his mother to read a [[Pop-up book|pop-up storybook]] called ''Mister Babadook.'' It describes the titular monster, the Babadook, a tall pale-faced humanoid in a top hat with taloned fingers who torments its victims after they become aware of its existence. Amelia is disturbed by the book and its mysterious appearance, while Sam becomes convinced that the Babadook is real. Sam's persistence about the Babadook leads Amelia to often have sleepless nights as she tries to comfort him.  Soon after, strange events occur: doors open and close mysteriously by themselves, strange sounds are heard and Amelia finds glass shards in her food. She attributes the events to Sam's behaviour, but he blames the Babadook. Amelia rips up the book and disposes of it. At her birthday party, Sam's cousin Ruby bullies Sam for not having a father, in response to which he pushes her out of her tree house and breaks her nose in two places. Amelia's sister Claire admits she cannot bear Sam to which Amelia takes great offence. On the drive home, Sam has another vision of the Babadook and suffers a [[febrile seizure]], after which Amelia makes a successful plea for sedatives to a [[Pediatrics|pediatrician]].  The following morning, Amelia finds the ''Mister Babadook'' book reassembled on the front door step. New words taunt her by saying that the Babadook will become stronger if she continues to deny its existence, containing pop-ups of her killing her dog Bugsy, Samuel and then herself. Terrified, Amelia burns the book and runs to the police after a disturbing phone call. However, Amelia has no proof of the stalking, and when she then sees the Babadook's suit hung up behind the front desk, she leaves. Amelia starts to become more isolated and shut-in, being more impatient, shouting at Samuel for 'disobeying' her constantly, and having frequent visions of the Babadook once again. Her mental state slowly decays further and she exhibits erratic and violent behaviour, including severing the phone line with a knife and brandishing it aggressively at Sam seemingly without realising. This mental decline culminates in several disturbing hallucinations, most of which involve the violent murder of Sam with herself as the willing perpetrator.  Shortly after these visions, Amelia sees an apparition of Oskar, who embraces her benevolently and agrees to return. However, he then demands that Amelia "give(s) him the boy" in return, implying he is a conjuration of the Babadook. Fleeing, Amelia is stalked by the Babadook through the house until it takes over her and finally possesses her. Under its influence she breaks Bugsy's neck and attempts to kill Sam. Eventually luring her into the basement, Sam knocks her out. Tied up, Amelia awakens with Sam, terrified, nearby. When she tries to strangle him, he lovingly caresses her face, causing her to regurgitate an inky black substance, an action which seemingly expels the Babadook. When Sam reminds Amelia that "you can't get rid of the Babadook," an unseen force drags him into Amelia's bedroom. After saving Sam, Amelia is forced by the Babadook to re-watch a vision of her husband's death to her utter despair. Furious, she confronts the Babadook, making the beast retreat into the basement, and locks the door behind it.  After this ordeal, Amelia and Sam manage to recover. Amelia is attentive and caring toward him, encouraging him concerning the weapons he makes and being impressed at Sam's magic tricks. They gather earthworms in a bowl, and Amelia takes them to the basement, where the Babadook resides. She places the bowl on the floor for the Babadook to eat. However, as the beast tries to attack her, Amelia calms it down, and it retreats to the corner, taking the earthworms with it. Amelia returns to the yard to celebrate Sam's birthday.

Alex eventually explains himself and Brad walks away. Alex reprimands Jenn for asking a stranger to dinner, as she apologizes multiple times.  Alex makes breakfast for Jenn the next morning, which is the first time he has done so for her. The couple continue to hike. Alex notices a bear print in the trail but keeps it to himself and continues on the trail. He sees a wintergreen plant and eats the leaves, while Jenn declines. As night settles again, the duo set up camp. Throughout the night, strange noises are heard, scaring Jenn. Alex dismisses the noises as acorns falling. In the morning, Alex stands outside looking at a broken branch. Jenn says with sarcasm "Did an acorn do that?".  The couple continue their hike and Alex decides to go off the path to the lake he has mentioned and been to before. Just as he thinks they are about to be greeted by a beautiful view of the lake, he is shocked to find out they are in the middle of a forest. The two realize they are lost and without a trail map. Alex also reveals that he secretly left Jenn's cellphone in the car. The two get into a heated argument, with Jenn berating Alex for trying to impress her and pointlessly wandering off the trail. Jenn asks why Alex even brought the two on the trip, and he reveals he was going to propose.  At night, a black bear pokes around the tent while the two sleep and eats the food stored in a bag outside. The couple find the torn cans in the morning, and Alex tells her it must have been a raccoon he saw last night. They hike almost an entire day, trying to find their way out, and stumble across signs of a bear. They try to hike as far as possible before dark, and then camp for the night. The bear attacks the following morning, making its way into the tent and lashing Jenn's arm before biting into Alex's shin. It retreats momentarily from Jenn's bear mace before dragging Alex outside and eating him alive. Jenn escapes the battered tent while the bear is occupied with Alex, taking the engagement ring before running away.  She sees some wintergreen and begins eating the leaves by the bunch, and then breaks her leg while descending a waterfall when again being chased by the bear. She begins succumbing to dehydration, but manages to make her way back to the canoe by trailing a buck. She manages to paddle back to the visitor center. Brad is seen about to embark with a group of tourists when one of them points to Jenn, who had just collapsed on the ground, and Brad rushes to her aid.  
The Bag Man
 Brutal gangster Dragna recruits professional killer Jack to pick up a bag and wait for his arrival at a motel.  Dragna stresses that Jack is not to open the bag or allow anyone to view its contents under any circumstances.  Confused as to why Dragna wants him to do such an apparently easy job, Jack presses for more details, but Dragna only reiterates the rules.  When Jack acquires the bag and a henchman of Dragna's shoots him in the hand, Jack kills him and stuffs the body in his car's trunk.  Dragna is unsympathetic when Jack calls him and instructs Jack to stick to the plan.  At the motel, Jack meets several people: Ned, the wheelchair-bound desk clerk; Rivka, a tall hooker; and Lizard and Guano, a pair of pimps. Jack requests room number thirteen, and Ned cautions him that it is a deathtrap, as it is unconnected.  When two suited men become curious about Jack, he abruptly breaks into their room and kills both. A subsequent search reveals FBI badges and a briefcase. Jack sets the briefcase aside and leaves to dump the corpse stored in his car, but promptly returns upon being spotted, only to discover that Rivka has broken into his room. Fearful that Lizard will kill her, she requests that he allow her to stay.  Jack initially demands that she leave, then detains her when he cannot be sure whether she opened the bag. Rivka points out that the briefcase contains a photo of the bag, and Jack becomes worried that others may attempt to acquire it. When Jack attempts to drive Rivka to a bus station, she spots the corpse in the back of his car. Lizard and Guano first question Jack about Rivka and later, on the road, attack him. On their corpses he finds another photo of the bag. Unsure what to do with Rivka, or of her involvement, he returns to the hotel with her to await Dragna's arrival.   Ned becomes suspicious that Jack has a guest in his room and calls the sheriff when Jack refuses to pay the double occupancy fee. Sheriff Larson briefly questions Jack, and, after Larson leaves, Jack threatens Ned. Increasingly worried about the safety of the bag, Jack buries it near the motel, only to be caught by Ned, who is now out of his wheelchair. Jack kills Ned and returns to the motel, where Larson arrests him under suspicion of Ned's disappearance.  As Larson prepares to torture Jack for information, Rivka shows up. Larson threatens to rape her, but she overpowers a deputy and frees Jack, who then kills Larson. When Rivka demonstrates detailed knowledge of the bag, Jack becomes suspicious of her again, but she points out that she has saved his life.  Somewhat mollified, he retrieves the bag and waits in room fourteen. Dragna finally appears, disappointed in Jack's apparent lack of trust. Nonetheless satisfied that Jack has not looked in the bag, Dragna explains that the whole situation was a test of Jack's skills and character, as he doubted Jack's resolve in the wake of Jack's fiancee's unsolved murder some months earlier. The motel and the local cops are all on Dragna's payroll, and were all (unwittingly) part of the test.  As Dragna prepares to leave, Rivka spontaneously tells Jack that she looked in the bag. Frustrated, Jack points out that Dragna will now kill them both. Jack dutifully reports Rivka's action to Dragna, who orders her killed. Jack instead kills Dragna's bodyguard, who wounds Rivka. Jack hunts down Dragna, and both are wounded. Jack looks in the bag and discovers the head of his fiancee, whom Dragna had killed in order to prevent Jack from quitting the murder-for-hire business. Trying to persuade Jack to surrender, Dragna destroys the hotel (where Rivka supposedly is) with remote-detonated explosives. Moments later, Rivka appears and saves Jack by killing Dragna, but she is shot again. Later, in Dragna's lawyer's office, Rivka reveals herself as Dragna's mistress and personal assassin who was sent to the motel to ensure things went Dragna's way. She collects a five million dollar reward for Jack's assassination, and she and Jack drive off together.

Following this, Rajveer visits Gul at the top of the casino, and a fight ensues regarding the whereabouts of Zafar and he ultimately kills Gul. In the meantime, Harleen spots Zorawar and is taken to the Indian Embassy in Prague, where Zorawar says that Rajveer actually came to Prague to find Gul, and gives her a tracking device.

At the house, Harleen sees photos of Rajveer and Viren, who are later revealed to be brothers and Shikha reveals their back stories. Although it is confirmed that Viren was murdered, Pankaj says that he does not believe in the story the army told him, saying that '''Jaiwant "Jai" Nanda''', Viren's brother, who is disguised as '''Rajveer''', had drowned despite being a swimming champion in his youth, as he was the only student who was able to cross the lake in only one breath. On her way home, Harleen is kidnapped by someone and next lands up in a fortress, where she meets Zafar, who learns and reveals that the diamond was a fake. Zorawar is then revealed to be Zafar's right-hand man, and gives Harleen a truth serum drug to reveal the location of the real diamond.

Jaiwant, in the meantime, is revealed to have actually survived, and silently kills every guard posted outside and places time bombs in every corner and enters the room. Zafar then orders his men to beat Rajveer but before Zafar is able to kill him Rajveer informs that the Koh-i-Noor was not stolen at all and it was a joint operation between the [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] and the [[Research and Analysis Wing|Indian Secret Service]] to get Zafar.

He loses consciousness and is about to drown when Harleen grabs his hand. The authorities air lift an injured and unconscious Jaiwant and Harleen.  Jaiwant then wakes up in hospital, where his commandant Narayanan ([[Vikram Gokhale]]) is sitting across him waiting for him to wake up. He congratulates Rajveer for successfully completing the mission. He rues about the fact that Viren was murdered and that Pankaj and Shikha will never get to see him again. Also, he informs Rajveer that Harleen has been sent back to her home and he has to forget about her because she can become a threat to his life and also his weakness. Rajveer is also told that he will be shifted to a safe facility the next day. After Narayanan leaves, a nurse arrives and gives Jaiwant a medicine to drink. As soon as he gulps down the medicine, he feels giddy and asks the nurse about it. The nurse turns around and removes her mask revealing that she is actually Harleen and the medicine was a sedative meant to knock Jaiwant out. A surprised Jaiwant tries to say her name but Harleen asks him to keep quiet. Jaiwant faints and Harleen escapes from the hospital along with him. He continues to slip in and out of consciousness until the next morning. He wakes up and Harleen tells him that his one-day has arrived. Jaiwant realises that she has brought him to his house.

 Jay Wheeler, the "black sheep" son of a rich family starts working as a janitor at a psychiatric hospital as part of his parole. While walking through the hospital one night he overhears another janitor, Frakel, telling a patient that he's a doctor and needs to give her physical examination, in order to rape her. After hearing this, Jay knocks out Frakel and tells the patient, Daisy Kensington, to go back to bed. Daisy, having been admitted to the hospital for being raised in isolation her entire life and hearing voices as well as being barefoot all her life, decides to follow Jay out of the hospital.  Rather than send Daisy back into the hospital, Jay decides to bring her home for his brother's wedding to convince his family that he has finally straightened out his life. While she impresses the family with her genuine, if unstable, charm, she also admits to Jay that she was in the hospital for killing her mother. While at the wedding Jay's father, suspecting that something is amiss, presses her for information, causing Daisy to have a panic attack. As Jay gets her into a cab, surrounded by his family, he tells them truth of who she is and that he is a janitor at the psychiatric hospital, only having come home to get money to pay back a loan shark. When Jay and Daisy return to his parents' house they search through his father's cars for keys and find a set in a classic RV, in which they set out for home. Despite getting along while driving Jay leaves Daisy at a bus station in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], intending to abandon her, but ends up having a change of heart and goes back for her.  Their journey becomes a fun adventure, despite the fact that they are both being hunted, Daisy for escaping the hospital and Jay for taking her and violating his probation. As Jay is the only one who can drive they pull over so he can sleep. During the night Daisy wakes him up due to a cop having pulled up behind. While Jay hides in the cupboard Daisy tells the cop that her boyfriend, "Beaver," ran away when he saw the flashing lights. The cop tells her that his father's name was Beaver, before proceeding to check the RV. After checking the bathroom, which smells bad because they can't flush it, he leaves and walks into the bush on the side of the road to find her boyfriend. While the cop is distracted Daisy throws away the keys to his car, so that she and Jay can escape, causing Jay to see her in a different light. A few nights later they go to a carnival, which Daisy has never been to before, claiming that it is "the best day of her life."  Later when they make a stopover, Jay makes a phone call to Dr Bertleman, the doctor who was handling Daisy. She then overhears him say that he is going to take her back to Los Angeles only to bring her back to the psychiatric hospital. She runs away crying \to the RV alone and attempts to drive away before Jay can get to her. As she only know the basics that Jay taught her she ends up driving around the parking lot in circles before crashing the RV. As Jay opens the door, she climbs out crying, as other people comes to check on them. Jay then hurries them both into a diner. Jay, curious about Daisy, not truly believing she's schizophrenic as her doctor believes, asks her about whether the voices told her to kill her mother. Daisy tells him that it wasn't her who heard voices, but her mother who did. Her mother was screaming one night but Daisy didn't go to her and when she woke up in the morning her mother was dead, causing Daisy to believe that she killed her mother. As Jay vehemently tells Daisy that she didn't kill her mother, she died, a group of cop cars show up at the diner to arrest Jay and Daisy, assuming that one of the bystanders to the crash called them. As Jay kisses Daisy, the cops come into the diner and handcuff Jay, separating him and Daisy.  When Jay's mother finds out he's in jail, she persuades his father to bail him out, which he does. When Jay returns to his apartment, he finds the door smashed open and his belongings torn apart. Glancing out the window he sees one of the loan sharks goons waiting for him outside, just as the loan shark looks up and sees him. After fleeing his apartment complex Jay goes to psychiatric hospital to see Daisy, but the security and Dr Bertleman tell him to leave.  Desperate, Jay goes to the train station and lies down on the tracks, so that he'll be deemed suicidal and be taken to the psychiatric hospital. Dr Bertleman, knowing that Jay is fine and that it was just a ruse, dismisses Jay, but after Jay insists that he is suicidal, the doctor puts him in solitary confinement. Before Jay is taken away he tells the doctor that it wasn't Daisy who heard voices but her mother. While at the hospital another patient gives Jay information on Daisy's well-being and confirms that they're being kept apart.   That night Frakel, who Jay had an altercation with the night he met Daisy, sneaks the loan shark's goon into the hospital, where he then goes and strangles Jay using a chain. As Jay is struggling to get him off, the patient who was giving him information, takes out the goon by hitting him in the head with a broom. After this Jay wakes up in hospital where Dr Bertleman apologizes to Jay about Frakel and tells him he was right about Daisy's mother, who was a diagnosed schizophrenic. Dr Bertleman then decides to release both Jay and Daisy from the hospital. Before Jay goes to meet Daisy he gets a letter from his father which has a check for $40,000 in order to pay off his debts. Jay then meets Daisy at the entrance to the hospital, where the two share a hug and kiss before leaving together, hand in hand.

Batman: Assault on Arkham
 [[Batman]] rescues [[Riddler]] from a black ops assassination ordered by [[A.R.G.U.S.]]' director [[Amanda Waller]], returning him to [[Arkham Asylum]]. Invoking Priority Ultraviolet, Waller captures criminals [[Black Spider]], [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Deadshot]], [[Harley Quinn]], [[KGBeast]], [[Killer Frost]], and [[King Shark]] for the [[Suicide Squad]]. Their mission is to break into Arkham and recover a [[Flash memory|thumbdrive]] in the Riddler's cane. While in Waller's employ, Riddler copied information on the squad to make it public knowledge. She forces compliance by threatening to detonate nano-bombs implanted in their necks. KGBeast, who believes it's a bluff, walks out on Waller and is killed as an example to the others.  The six are sent to [[Gotham City]], where [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]] has been hired by Waller to give them arms, equipment, and a place to stay, although he is angry with Harley and Joker for tossing his cigarettes in the harbor for a laugh. Deadshot repeatedly clashes with Boomerang as the latter does not respect his leadership of the group. To get to Arkham, Harley breaks into a doll store and begins trashing it. Batman arrives, demanding she tell him where [[Joker (character)|Joker]] hid a [[dirty bomb]]; Batman has been ransacking the city in search of it, even resorting to interrogating Riddler for answers. This is also a dead end, as Harley has no clue where the bomb is located; Batman is forced to send her back to Arkham.  At Arkham, Harley encounters the Joker, who begins taunting how he previously kicked her out of a car, and ends up lashing out by attempting to shoot him with a stolen gun, only to fail in doing so due to the Joker's bulletproof prison cell. This distraction allows the others to infiltrate Arkham in disguises. Black Spider causes an explosion, putting the asylum on Yellow Alert; King Shark suggests playing the previous day's footage to keep both Batman and Waller from noticing them. Despite some in-fighting, the team manages to get to the storage room, where they find Harley's [[mallet]] and Riddler's cane, however they find the latter empty. Batman arrives, as the footage showed employees who had that day off, fighting the squad until Black Spider pins him during an explosion; Black Spider later emerges with Batman's belt as his trophy. However, they then notice Killer Frost is missing. It turns out Frost was tasked by Waller to kill Riddler, which was the true purpose of the mission; however, he reveals Waller can't kill him with a nano bomb for the very same reason she wants him dead: because he knows how to defuse it. The rest of the squad find her and Riddler outside the Medical Facility; they agree to help Riddler escape if he can defuse the bombs. Unfortunately, Joker also manages to escape as Harley's attack weakened his cell.  Riddler hooks the squad up to the [[Electroshock weapon|electro shock]] machine, minus Black Spider as he wishes to stand guard. At the same time, a dazed Batman wanders around and is found by the Joker, who sneaks up to shoot him. Riddler turns on the machine as Waller calls for an update; seeing the bombs' signals fading and learning of the squad's betrayal, she activates them. Harley, Deadshot, Boomerang and Frost survive, but King Shark's head explodes due to his thick skin blocking the electricity; oddly so does Batman's before Joker can shoot him. Riddler begins laughing as the squad hasn't figured out that "Black Spider" is Batman; revealing himself, Batman demands to know why the squad is in Arkham, only for the Joker to arrive and start shooting at everyone. Harley manages to sweet-talk the Joker into forgiving her, and Deadshot manages to "out-crazy" Joker to scare him away. It's then revealed Joker had hidden the dirty bomb in Harley's mallet, which he then activates. Joker broadcasts to Arkham, telling Batman and the squad that soon Gotham will be destroyed; he releases the inmates as a distraction to allow him to escape. Deadshot manages to escape in a helicopter, while Frost is presumably killed in the chaos by Bane and Deadshot and Captain Boomerang battle for who escapes in the helicopter with Deadshot tackling him out and leaving him to be arrested. Batman notices three heartbeats coming from the helicopter, realizing Joker and Harley stowed away.  Batman follows them in the [[Batplane|Batwing]], ending up crashing the helicopter into a building. Batman knocks out Harley and disarms the bomb. At the same time, Joker and Deadshot fight as Joker is not pleased with Deadshot touching Harley. Badly beaten, Deadshot manages to pin Joker to the inside of the helicopter as it crashes to the ground. Batman later confronts Waller over the incident, which resulted in Riddler escaping again. Waller vows that her units will catch him next time, but Batman then warns her to discontinue the Task Force X program. Waller arrogantly dismisses his warning and taunts that they never found Joker's body. The moment Batman leaves, Waller notices a gun's laser trained on her chest and then on her forehead. Deadshot is shown to be the source, reunited with his daughter, and the movie ends before he pulls the trigger, leaving Waller's fate uncertain.

Before I Go to Sleep (film)
 Forty-year-old Christine Lucas wakes up in bed with a man she does not know, in an unfamiliar house. The man explains that he is her husband, Ben, and that she suffered brain damage from a car accident ten years earlier. Christine wakes up every morning with no memory of her life from her early twenties onwards.  Christine receives treatment from Dr. Nasch, a [[neuropsychologist]]  at a local hospital who gives her a camera to record her thoughts and progress each day, and calls her every morning to remind her to watch the video in the camera. Dr. Nasch instructs Christine to keep the camera hidden from Ben and reveals that her memory loss occurred after she was attacked and left for dead near an airport hotel. They surmise that Ben tells Christine it was a car accident to avoid upsetting her.  Over the course of treatment, Christine faintly remembers a red-haired woman named Claire. Ben tells her that Claire was a friend who couldn't handle Christine's condition and ended contact with her. Later, Christine recalls that she had a son. She angrily confronts Ben over hiding their child, but he says their son died of meningitis when he was eight. Christine remembers the name Mike and believes it may be the name of her attacker, which she relates to Dr. Nasch. He hugs her to comfort her and almost kisses her, but she pulls back and then sees her doctor's name tag and his first name is Mike. She runs from him but he catches her and administers a sedative, leaving her at home. He tells her later that she was upset and he's sorry but he doesn't feel he can treat her anymore, because he has feelings for her and her memories are causing her to project what happened onto him.  Christine learns that, several years after her attack, Ben had placed her in an assisted care facility and divorced her, then had a change of heart and brought her home to live with him. Christine learns that Claire had been trying to contact her at the care facility, unaware that Ben took her away. Christine obtains Claire's phone number and meets her. Claire reveals that Christine had embarked on an affair prior to her attack, while Ben and Claire had a one-time sexual encounter, due to their shared grief at Christine's memory loss. Feeling obliged to keep Ben and Christine's marriage intact, Claire ended contact.  Claire gives Christine a letter written to her by Ben.  He asked Claire to give it to Christine should she ever be well enough to read it.  In the letter, Ben tells Christine that he loves her, but that he had to leave her for their son Adam’s sake.  Adam was unable to understand her memory loss every morning, and when Adam would insist things happened that Christine could not remember she would get upset.  Adam had begun to be afraid of her.  Ben believed for Adam’s sake that they needed to leave her, and he begs her to understand.  Out of gratitude for his love and care, Christine decides to let Ben see the videos she has made on the digital camera. However, Ben angrily accuses Christine of having an affair with Dr. Nasch, strikes her, and storms out. On the telephone, Claire tells Christine that Ben claims to not have seen Christine for several years. Claire asks Christine to describe the "Ben" she is living with, and they realize he is not Ben. Christine is beginning to have more limited memories as things happen around her.  Christine attempts to escape the house, but "Ben" renders her unconscious.  The next morning, Christine again awakens with no memories but she finds the camera and sees her entry saying she loves "Ben" and wants to make a life with him. "Ben" calls Christine and tells her to pack, that they are going on a trip that night. He then visits Dr. Nasch at the hospital and tells him to stay away from Christine. That night, "Ben" takes her to a hotel close to where she had been found. He reveals that he is Mike, the man she had an affair with. Christine then remembers that Mike had wanted Christine to reveal their affair to Ben, but Christine refused, and their argument culminated in Mike viciously attacking Christine, resulting in her amnesia. He also inadvertently reveals that Christine's son Adam is still alive. Declaring his love for Christine, Mike deletes the videos on her camera and states that he is no longer interested in playing the part of Ben. He tells Christine that they leave together, or no one leaves. Another struggle ensues, but this time Christine knocks Mike out and gets away. She sets off the hotel fire alarm while running from the hotel and is seen telling her story on the camera while waiting in an ambulance.  Christine wakes up in a hospital bed and is visited by Dr. Nasch, this time as a friend and not her therapist. He assures her the man responsible for her condition has been arrested. He tells Christine that she has visitors and that he hopes the visit will provide the breakthrough they have been hoping for.  Christine is then visited by the real Ben and Adam.  Christine’s memories return when she sees Adam.

Beauty and the Beast (2014 film)
 A widowed merchant ([[André Dussollier]]) is forced to move to the countryside after going bankrupt, with his six children, three sons and three daughters. His youngest daughter, Belle ([[Léa Seydoux]]) is the only one happy with the change. When one of the merchant's ships is found, the merchant prepares to return to reclaim his assets. While his two older, spoiled daughters give him a long list of expensive things to bring back for them, Belle asks only for a rose. The merchant arrives and learns that the ship and its cargo have been taken to settle his debts. On the way home through the forest, the merchant loses his way, his horse slips and is injured, and they are attacked by wolves. He  laments that he has "not even a weapon to finish off" the poor horse. The merchant stumbles upon the magical domain of the Beast ([[Vincent Cassel]]). In the castle, all of his needs are magically met, including food, the exact items his daughters had asked him to bring, and his horse, magically cured. He packs up and departs with the items. Passing through the garden, he recalls Belle's request of a rose, and he picks one. He is immediately confronted by the Beast, who thunders at him for taking the rose. As punishment, the Beast demands the merchant return to the castle in one day after saying goodbye to his children. If he fails to return, his family will be killed. The father returns home and tells the story to his children. Learning of her father's fate, Belle, feeling responsible, takes her father's horse and returns to the castle to offer herself in the place of her father.  At the castle, Belle is accepted as a substitute for her father. She is given luxurious goods and permission to roam the grounds, but must return every evening for dinner with the Beast warning her not to escape. At night, Belle has a vivid dream, revealing the backstory of the Prince: he enjoys hunting, but often ignores the Princess ([[Yvonne Catterfeld]]) who loves him but is lonely. The Prince is after an elusive golden deer, and when the Princess asks him to stop hunting the deer, he promises to do so if she will give him a son. Belle wakes to find the Beast watching her sleep before he suddenly flees. Belle explores the castle grounds, eventually finding a statue resembling the Princess from her dream. At dinner, the Beast displays a rather cold exterior towards Belle while attempting to charm her, only to be rejected. He suddenly bursts out at Belle stating he will claim her despite her resistance. She later has another dream: The Prince announcing that he and the Princess will have an heir, but when she reminds him of his promise, he seems to have forgotten. During dinner, the Beast apologizes for his previous behavior. Belle makes the Beast a proposal; she will dance with him, if she is allowed to see her family one last time. The two begin to dance though amidst it all, the Beast asks for Belle's love. Jarred, Belle demands to see her family as she had bargained. When the Beast refuses, Belle fervently rejects him once again. That same night, she witnesses the Beast prey upon and devour a hog. In shock, she attempts to escape by running into the enchanted forest only for the Beast to catch up to her on the frozen lake. As Belle is suddenly knocked down and pinned, the Beast attempts to kiss her when suddenly the ice beneath her breaks as she sinks into the frozen lake. The Beast pulls her from the water, and brings her back to the castle. The Beast agrees to let Belle return home, giving her a small vial of healing water. He tells her return to him in one day or he will "die".   Belle arrives home, where her father is bedridden, and seems to be dying. She pleaded for him to wake only to fall asleep. Belle's eldest brother, Maxime ([[Nicolas Gob]]) finds a jewel on her clothing, positing that the castle may contain further treasures. He wants to find it to settle his debt to gangster Perducas ([[Eduardo Noriega (Spanish actor)|Eduardo Noriega]]). He knocks out his youngest brother, Tristan, who tries to stop him, and meets with Perducas and his gang, leading them to the castle. Belle has one final dream about how the Prince broke his promise and killed the golden deer. While dying, the deer transformed into the Princess, revealing she was the Nymph of the Forest who became human because she wanted to experience love. She begged her father, the God of the Forest, to spare the Prince from his wrath. But he transformed the Prince into a beast, changed the hunting dogs into Tadommes, and his friends into statues. The God of the Forest proclaimed that only the love of a woman would break the Beast's eternal curse. Belle awakes and gives her father the vial of water, reviving him. She attempts to return to the castle, and discovers that Maxime has taken the horse to meet with Perducas. Tristan takes her to the castle, arriving just as the Beast is about to kill the invaders, including Belle's brothers. The Beast stops his attack when Belle begs for mercy. Perducas stabs the Beast, mortally wounding him. Suddenly, vines sprout about the castle destroying anything in their paths. Perducas's lover, Astrid, is killed when he abandons her, but not before cursing him of his fate. Perducas is soon killed by the vines and turned into a human tree. Belle and her brothers carry the Beast into the castle, and place him into the healing pool of water. Dying, the Beast asks whether Belle could ever love him, and she counters that she already does. The Beast sinks into the water then resurfaces, transforming back into the Prince and the Tadommes back into dogs.   The story is being told by Belle to her two young children. They are living in the same countryside house, surrounded by rose bushes, with Belle's father, who is now a flower merchant. Belle goes outside to greet her husband, the Prince, and the two kiss and embrace.

 In [[New York City]], Richie ([[Shawn Christensen]]), a downtrodden young man whose girlfriend, Vista (Isabelle McNally), recently disappeared, discovers the corpse of a girl who died from a heroin overdose while he is cleaning bathroom stalls at a nightclub. The club owner, Bill ([[Ron Perlman]]), arranges for her body to be removed without notifying the authorities.  At his apartment, Richie attempts suicide by cutting one of his wrists in a bathtub, when he receives a call from his estranged sister, Maggie ([[Emmy Rossum]]), asking him to look after her eleven-year-old daughter, Sophia ([[Fátima Ptacek]]). Richie goes to her school, where she recites "[[Because I could not stop for Death]]" by [[Emily Dickinson]] in both English and [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Richie takes her to her apartment before heading home, where he attempts suicide by drug overdose. Richie hallucinates a drug dealer calling him on the phone, threatening him by saying he is in the building. Sophia calls, however, and informs Richie that her mother has not returned home.  Richie arrives at the lobby of Maggie's apartment, where he discovers that the drugs he took were Zolafren, intended for [[menopause]]. Outside Maggie's apartment, a suspicious-looking woman asks Richie about his sister's whereabouts. After entering, Maggie calls the apartment, indicating to Richie that she is in central booking and upon hearing of the woman, orders Richie to sneak Sophia out of the building.  Richie takes Sophia to a bowling alley where he works. Richie calls central booking, who inform him that his sister was arrested and is awaiting arraignment at 4:30 AM. The owner of the bowling alley, Gideon ([[Paul Wesley]]), has Richie brought to the office. Gideon informs him that his girlfriend has been missing for a day, with her last whereabouts being at Bill's nightclub, and produces a photograph, which Richie recognizes as being of the dead woman he saw the night before. Richie denies knowledge of her whereabouts. He calls Bill, who tells him to come in at 1:30 AM to discuss the situation.  As a favor to Richie, Gideon allows Maggie the use of his lawyer, Bruce Warham ([[Richard Schiff]]), who informs Maggie that in the public's eyes, she is a mistress, due to her having sexual relations to a married man, despite having been assaulted.  Richie tells Sophia about flip books he made growing up about a character called "Sophia". He brings Sophia to his former apartment in a downtrodden part of town, where he retrieves some flip books and calms his panicked niece by presenting the premise of a girl who dies in intricate ways, but comes back by the next installment. He then collapses from blood loss, but refuses to go to a hospital, due to promising Maggie to keep Sophia safe.  After Sophia tells him the cruel things her estranged father, Darren ([[Fran Kranz]]), says to her, Richie assaults him at his work. Richie and Sophia visit Bill, who divulges that Gideon's girlfriend had been resisting his advances and in retaliation, he gave her heroin. Richie returns to Maggie's apartment, where he returns Sophia home. Sophia tells him that his constant love letters to Vista would work if he told her he loves her.  Having reached an epiphany, Richie confronts Gideon, telling him what happened to his girlfriend. Gideon and his armed thugs abduct Richie, then drop him off alongside the road, before speeding off to deal with Bill. Richie re-encounters the blonde woman, who is revealed to be the wife of Maggie's lover. Richie makes his rendezvous with a released Maggie and escorts her to her apartment.  Maggie tells Richie that she does not want him to stay in her daughter's life, fearing him to be a "false idol". Richie tells her how much he looked up to her when they were younger and how much he still looks up to her now. He returns to his bathtub and prepares to kill himself, when Maggie calls him, inviting him over for dinner. Richie writes a much shorter letter to Vista, stating that he loves and misses her, before looking up and seeing an image of her sitting across from him.

However, a circus arrived and figures with tall coats and caps emerged, wielding batons. They stormed the apartment building, knocking out several other residents and kidnapping them. The bear attempted to protect his family but was hit by the cloaked men and taken away from them. In the circus he was forced to ride on a small bicycle, and kept locked and chained in a cage. Other tricks were acted to his act, such as juggling and riding a unicycle, until eventually, he was to perform a daredevil jump. Still thinking of his family, the bear performed the jump so well he flew out of the circus tent. While the cloaked men tried to chase him, they all fell and he was eventually able to make it back home. When the bear made it to his apartment, he found it still in a state of disarray with no sign of his family, and began to cry. But his wife and child appeared and hugged him, glad to be reunited.  The diorama ends and the child gives the bear a coin, receiving a pinwheel from him before rushing off to return to their parent. The bear watches them go, glancing at a photo of his family he keeps in a pocket watch. He then smiles to himself, and rings his bell again.

Outside Nick tells Brooke that this was the first time he had seen Hannah since she rejected his marriage proposal and broke up with him six years ago. At Brooke's insistence, Nick goes back to speak to Hannah and discovers that she is pregnant and that their relationship is truly over. Wandering around the city, the two find a psychic who is still open.

However, during her trip she received a phone call from her husband saying he was coming home early and realized that he had ended the relationship for good.  At a restaurant Nick tells Brooke that her husband will most likely understand that what he did was wrong and that if he doesn't, that's that. They then go to Nick's friend's hotel room. Together they write on the back of paintings in the room (a reference to an earlier encounter with a painting with erotic writing on the back of it). They then share a kiss and reflect on their night.  In the morning they return to the train station where they are about to part. Suddenly, Nick picks up a phone from a phone booth and, like an earlier joke, uses it as a "time machine" and pretends to call himself, saying that he will meet a woman that he should stay with for the night. They share one last kiss and finally depart. On her way home, Brooke finds a guest service paper that she and Nick filled out at the hotel. On the bottom it says "turn over," and after doing so, she smiles at what she reads, though the message itself is left ambiguous.

Bey Yaar
 Childhood friends Chintan "Chako" (Divyang Thakkar) and Tapan "Tino" ([[Pratik Gandhi]]) aspire to invest in a real estate project called ''The Other Side'', located near the scenic [[Nal Sarovar Bird Sanctuary|Nal Savorar]] area and their residence of [[Ahmedabad]]. They currently work as [[Pharmaceutical sales representative|MRs]] while hoping to make quick money through a [[Godman (India)|Godman]] who promises to triple their profit. The Godman turns out to be part of a larger con and his scheme is discovered by the police. As a result, Chako and Tino are scammed out of [[₹]]1,80,000 (or 180,000 [[rupee]]s).  Chako's father, Jeetu ([[Darshan Jariwala]]), runs a small local tea stall, in which hangs a painting from a prominent artist named M.F. Hassan (based on the late [[M.F. Husain]]). The piece was gifted to Jeetu as a sign of their close friendship, before Hassan's rise to prominence and eventual death. Upon learning that Jeetu's tea stall painting is highly coveted, Tino comes up with another idea to secure an investment with ''The Other Side'': secretly replace the painting with an identical fake one, and then loan the original for cash. Initially hesitant but desperate, Chako assists in the plan along with their friend Uday ([[Kavin Dave]]), an avid painter who begrudgingly agrees to compose an exact copy of the piece himself.  With the switch successful, Chako and Tino mortgage the original painting to a local art dealer, Y.B. Gandhi ([[Manoj Joshi]]). Shortly thereafter, however, Gandhi informs Chako that the painting he received is fake and that someone else had tried to sell the same painting to another dealer. Gandhi convinces Chako that either Tino had double-crossed him, or that his father had been lying about the painting's authenticity. Chako returns the money back to Gandhi, and angrily confronts Tino, who indeed went to a separate dealer, but was sent by Uday for an art survey only. Chako then meets his father and accuses him of confabulating a friendship. Angered by the accusations and hurt by Chako's loss of the painting, Jeetu kicks him out of the house.  The M.F. Hassan painting, however, was an original all along, and Gandhi - whom Hassan hated and never lent his work  to - had cheated Chako and Tino out of the painting. Gandhi then publicly humiliates Jeetu by telling the press he never had a friendship with Hassan, and that the stories of him making his paintings at the tea stall are all false.  Hoping to redeem themselves, Chako and Tino devise a plan to take advantage of Gandhi's own greed in order to get the painting back for Jeetu. Helping with the elaborate scheme include Uday and Jigisha (Samvedna Suwalka), Tino's girlfriend. They hire a method actor named Pranav (Amit Mistry) to pose as "Prabodh Gupta", a fictitious international artist from [[Bihar]] whose work has yet to be exhibited in [[India]]. The group successfully lures Gandhi into funding a fabricated [[NGO]] and conducting Prabodh's supposed lucrative first exhibition in India, in exchange for the tea stall painting.  Pranav and Uday narrowly retrieve the painting on the day of the held exhibition, just as Gandhi realizes that Prabodh is a fraud. He confronts the place of the fake NGO but encounters Chako, Tino, and Jeetu. Chako and Tino demand that he publicly retract his earlier statements about Jeetu, or else be arrested for selling fake paintings and creating the fictitious "Prabodh Gupta" himself (since Gandhi was tricked earlier into funding the fake NGO). Realizing his defeat, Gandhi tries to offer money, but Jeetu declines and chastises him for his greed being the reason Hassan never worked with large art curators.  Gandhi holds a televised news conference the next morning, apologizing for his previous accusations against Jeetu. Hassan's piece is returned to Jeetu's shop, after he and Chako fully reconcile. Uday, whose own paintings were used as Prabodh's work from earlier, is offered his own local exhibition, attended by much happier Chako and Tino.

The sheriff solicits the young but experienced tracker Ben to guide the malevolent Madec an hour outside town into the canyon country of Shiprock. Madec taunts Ben over his love interest, who has gone away to Colorado for a college swimming scholarship and gifted a gun that Ben taught her to shoot.  When Ben asks to see the permit to hunt the endangered bighorn, Madec offers a wad of cash, which the stunned Ben begrudgingly accepts after Madec supplements his initial offer even further.  Madec of shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later philosophy accidentally shoots an old prospector, and Ben insists that they must report it as an accident. Madec, on the other hand, puts another bullet from Ben's gun into the corpse, and after explaining how he can now blackmail Ben with questions of who was the actual killer, offers Ben a deal:  Madec will put him through college with a finance major and give him a $300,000-per-year job in return for his complicity in covering up the crime.  When Ben picks up his emergency transponder, Madec destroys it and berates Ben for breaking the deal. Madec then threatens Ben with his high-powered [[Steyr Scout|rifle]], and orders him to strip all of his clothes and shoes, and forces him to wander out in the desert to die of dehydration and exposure.  Madec plans to report that Ben went mad, shot the prospector, and wandered off into the barren horizon alone. Madec is certain Ben cannot survive, as they are in a hot desert 45 miles from the nearest town, but just to make sure, he watches Ben from a distance, using the scope on his rifle. Ben finds enough water to survive until Madec shoots the barrel containing it. Trekking on, Ben hides in the semi-subterranean lair of the shot prospector Charlie whom he'd befriended in life, but Madec blows it up with the prospector's dynamite stash, although Ben manages to escape before it explodes with the 'treasure map' of Charlie, whom Ben vows will not die without justice.  By sunset, Ben uses the map to find a wrist-brace slingshot and some marbles among a buried box of Charlie's personal effects. He goes for a hidden grotto of water that he and his girlfriend had swum in, only to find it dried up as his sun-burned body now freezes in the desert night. Madec keeps watch with his vehicle's high-powered floodlights as Ben eventually outsmarts Madec to overcome him with the slingshot.  Back in town, Madec escapes from police custody during a bathroom break to board a helicopter that he solicited using his one phonecall. Ben goes to his girlfriend and promises not to leave her side again. Armed Madec sneaks into their house as they sleep together and confronts Ben, but his girlfriend shoots Madec using the gun Ben gave her. Ben picks up the weapon, and finishes Madec off as the screen fades to black and the credits roll.

Michael intercedes and attempts to wrestle the gun away from the robber, only to be shot in the gut.

Cole is frustrated to learn that it is a house party, and he goes downstairs to drink alone, where he meets Maya, the host.  The two discuss an approaching asteroid.

When they discuss children, Cole says he does not want any, and Maya reveals she is incapable.  As the asteroid grows closer, Cole asks Maya to marry him.  Maya jokingly accepts, and Cole insists that he is serious; now serious, Maya again agrees.  Although initially dismissive of the danger, scientists become increasingly worried about a collision.  Various missions to divert the asteroid end in failure, putting the world on edge.  In the flashforwards, Cole and Maya's relationship deteriorates in the face of their hardship in finding food and shelter.  When Maya becomes pregnant, Cole is taken aback and insists that it is cruel to have children in the face of an impending disaster.  Maya says that it is a miracle for her to become pregnant, and she keeps the baby despite Cole's insistence that they discuss abortion.  In the flashforwards, Cole and Maya's baby is in the care of Maya's parents, and their relationship has become strained over the issue.  Cole accuses Maya of blaming him for their hardships and not supporting him, while Maya counters that it is his own self-loathing that is driving them apart.

Novac suddenly sneak attacks them both, and the film shifts back to the present time, when Cole and Maya have separated over his opposition to her pregnancy.  Maya, who is about to give birth, invites Cole to the hospital.  When Cole arrives, Michael confronts him with a pistol and says that Cole has betrayed his own beliefs.  In the face of certain death, Michael says that Cole has abdicated all responsibility and treats his life as meaningless.  Envious of the potential for hope in Cole's life, Michael shoots him.  Novac, a doctor, rushes from the hospital, shoots Michael, and works to save Cole's life.  As Cole begins to slip into delirium from his wound, he apparently imagines the various scenes in the flashforwards based on the actions of Novac and Michael.  Maya calls Cole on his mobile phone and tells him that the asteroid has missed Earth, and she has given birth to a baby girl.  The film ends as Cole lies on a hospital bed, Maya beside him.

Bhopal: A Prayer for Rain
 In 1984, a few months before the [[Bhopal disaster]], Dilip ([[Rajpal Yadav]]), a rickshaw driver, loses his pay source as his rickshaw breaks down while transporting an employee to the Union Carbide pesticide plant in [[Bhopal]]. Dilip lives in the slums around the plant with his wife, a son and his sister. He gets a job in the plant as a labourer, and is happy since his daily wage is restored.  The plant witnesses a drop in its revenue due to lower sales of pesticides, and in order to reduce the loss the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani ([[Kal Penn]]), a tabloid reporter publishes reports in his makeshift printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy ([[Joy Sengupta]]), the in-charge for the safety of the plant expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of [[methyl isocyanate]] leaking from a pipeline lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant sabotages the warning siren.  [[Warren Anderson (American businessman)|Warren Anderson]] ([[Martin Sheen]]), the CEO of [[Union Carbide]], visits the plant to inspect its functionality, where he is briefed about a plan to connect two additional tanks for storage of methyl isocyanate to increase the output of the plant, ignoring the deteriorated condition of the tanks. Motwani meanwhile meets Eva Gascon ([[Mischa Barton]]), a reporter in the [[Paris Match]], and persuades her to get an interview of Anderson. She impersonates the identity of an [[Associated Press]] reporter, but fails as her true identity is exposed in between the interview. Motwani convinces Dilip of the danger posed by the chemicals.  As the date of the disaster nears, Dilip arranges a loan for the wedding of his sister. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards, and that how a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce the maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.  To overcome the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the usage of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with the wedding of his sister, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert the people in the vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the toxic gas. He carries away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.  As the gas shows its effects, a nearby hospital is filled with hundreds of patients reporting cyanide poisoning, and the lack of antidote results in most of the patients' death. Dilip, on his deathbed, and using the last of his strength, rips off his Union Carbide identity badge and after flinging it away, rests his dead son on the ground.

Big Eyes
 In 1958, [[Margaret Keane|Margaret Ulbrich]] leaves her husband and takes her young daughter Jane to [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], [[San Francisco]]. Supporting her daughter alone, Margaret gets a job painting illustrations at a furniture factory. While creating portraits at an outdoor art show, Margaret meets [[Walter Keane]], who is selling his Parisian street scene paintings. Soon, Walter proposes to her and they marry.  Walter goes to a popular jazz club and tries to convince the club's owner, [[Enrico Banducci]], to purchase the couple's paintings. He only agrees to rent out the walls to Walter. A drunk woman is touched by one of Margaret's paintings and buys it. Walter fights with Banducci and ends up on the front page of the local newspaper. When Walter goes to the club again it is packed with curious people. Dick Nolan, a celebrity gossip columnist (who serves as the film's narrator), wants to know more about Walter's art, but is only interested in Margaret's paintings. Afterward, Walter shows Margaret all the money they have made from the sales. He tells her they are a great team: she can stay at home painting and he will sell her works.  Walter opens up his own Keane gallery, promoting the art as his own work, and sells reproductions. Margaret, however, is upset about Walter taking credit for her art, and feels guilty about lying to Jane about who is the real artist. Margaret decides to paint in a different style with elongated features and small eyes, so that she can honestly tell people she is also a painter.  Margaret and Walter move into a mansion. While going through a crate Margaret finds a stack of paintings of Parisian street scenes, but they are all signed by S. CENIC. She realizes Walter paints over the name of the original artist and claims the paintings as his own. When Margaret confronts Walter, he says he always wanted to be an artist, but never had the talent.   Walter learns of the [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] and demands Margaret paint something to put on display; she refuses and Walter threatens to have her killed. Jane discovers her mother working on the World's Fair painting "Tomorrow Forever". Jane tells her mother she always knew that she was the real artist.   At a party, Walter is angered after reading [[John Canaday]]'s scathing review of the "Tomorrow Forever" exhibit and confronts Canaday. Back at home, Walter starts drunkenly throwing lit matches at Margaret and Jane. They run into the studio and lock the door, but Walter nearly sets the house on fire. Margaret runs away with Jane.  One year later, Margaret and Jane have settled in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. Walter will not agree to a divorce unless Margaret signs over the rights to every painting, and produces 100 more. Margaret agrees and continues sending paintings to California. Margaret is visited by two [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] who convince her that honesty is important. The next time Walter receives the paintings, they are signed "MDH Keane". On a Hawaiian radio show, Margaret reveals she is the real artist behind the paintings attributed to Walter, making national news. Nolan publishes Walter's claims that Margaret has "gone nuts". Margaret sues both Walter and the newspapers that printed his version of the story for [[Defamation|libel and slander]].  At the trial, reporters swarm the courthouse in Honolulu. The judge immediately rules that Margaret's statements in the press have contributed to the public idea that Walter has painted the paintings, and as such dismisses the libel lawsuit against the newspapers. Since the libel suit only concerned the newspaper and its lawyers, Walter is left to defend himself against slander, even cross-examining himself as a "witness". The judge directs both Margaret and Walter to create a painting in one hour to prove who is the real artist. Margaret paints steadily, but Walter is hesitant, claiming his arm hurts too much to hold a paintbrush. Margaret completes her painting and wins the lawsuit. Outside the courthouse, Margaret says she doesn’t care about money and just wants credit for her paintings. A fan asks her to sign a copy of "Tomorrow's Masters" and she does, finally autographing her own work.  The end credits then state that Margaret later retired in life and opened an Art Gallery, while Walter continued with his claim that he was the true artist but never produced anything to back this, and eventually died bitter and penniless.  
Big Hero 6 (film)
 Hiro Hamada is a 14-year-old robotics genius living in the futuristic city of San Fransokyo who spends much of his free time participating in illegal [[Robot combat|robot fights]]. To redirect Hiro, his elder brother Tadashi takes him to the research lab at the San Fransokyo Institute of Technology, where Hiro meets Tadashi's friends, GoGo, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred. Hiro also meets Professor Robert Callaghan, the head of the university's robotics program. Amazed, Hiro decides to apply to the university.  To enroll, he signs up for the school's science fair and presents his project: [[microbots]], swarms of tiny robots that can link together in any arrangement imaginable using a neurocranial transmitter. At the fair, Hiro declines an offer from Alistair Krei, CEO of Krei Tech, to market the microbots, and Callaghan accepts him into the school. At the end of the day, a fire breaks out among the exhibits and Tadashi rushes in to save Callaghan, the only person left inside. The building explodes moments later, killing Tadashi.  Weeks later, a depressed Hiro, in mourning for Tadashi's death, inadvertently activates Baymax, the [[Soft robotics|inflatable]] healthcare robot that Tadashi created; the two find Hiro's only remaining microbot and follow it to an abandoned warehouse. There they discover that someone has been mass-producing the microbots, and are attacked by a man wearing a [[Kabuki]] mask who is controlling them. After they escape, Hiro equips Baymax with armor and a battle chip containing various [[karate]] moves, and they track the masked man to the docks. GoGo, Wasabi, Honey Lemon, and Fred arrive, responding to a call from Baymax, and the masked man chases the group. The six escape to Fred's mansion, where they decide to form a high-tech superhero team to combat the villain.  The group tracks the masked man, whom they suspect to be Krei, to an abandoned Krei Tech laboratory which was used for [[teleportation]] research until a test pilot was lost in an accident. The masked man attacks, but the group subdues him and knocks off his mask – revealing him to be Callaghan, who had stolen Hiro's microbots to shield himself from the explosion and allowed Tadashi to die. Enraged, Hiro removes Baymax's healthcare chip, leaving only the battle chip, and orders him to kill Callaghan. Honey reinstalls the healthcare chip at the last second, preventing Baymax from carrying out the kill order. Callaghan escapes, and Hiro leaves with Baymax, intent on avenging Tadashi.  Back home, Hiro tries to remove the healthcare chip again, but Baymax stops him and states that vengeance is not what Tadashi would have wanted. To calm him down, Baymax shows Hiro videos of Tadashi running numerous tests during Baymax's development as a demonstration of Tadashi's benevolence and legacy. Hiro remorsefully apologizes to his friends, who reassure him they will catch Callaghan the right way.  Video footage from the laboratory accident reveals that the lost test pilot was Callaghan's daughter Abigail, and that Callaghan is seeking revenge on Krei. Callaghan interrupts Krei at a public event and attempts to destroy his headquarters using Krei's teleportation portal. After a lengthy battle, the team deprives Callaghan of his microbots and the mask, saving Krei, but the portal remains active. Baymax detects Abigail inside, alive but in hyper-sleep, and leaps into the portal with Hiro to rescue her. They find Abigail's pod, but on the way back out, Baymax is struck by debris, damaging his armor and disabling his thrusters. Baymax uses his armor's rocket fist to propel Hiro and Abigail back through the portal before it closes. Callaghan is arrested while Abigail is taken to the hospital.  Some time later, Hiro discovers Baymax's health care chip clenched in the rocket fist. He rebuilds Baymax's body, and the six friends continue their exploits throughout the city. During the end credits, a series of newspaper headlines reveals that the university has awarded Hiro a grant and dedicated a building in Tadashi's honor, and that the team has continued protecting the city. In a [[post-credits scene]], Fred discovers a hidden cache of superhero equipment in his family mansion. His father, a retired superhero, returns from vacation and says, "We have a lot to talk about."  
Big Game (2014 film)
 When [[Air Force One]] is shot down by [[Terrorism|terrorists]] leaving the [[President of the United States]], William Alan Moore, stranded in the wilderness of [[Finland]], there is only one person around who can save him: a 13-year-old boy called Oskari. In the forest on a hunting mission to prove his maturity to his kinsfolk, Oskari had been planning to track down a deer, but instead discovers the most powerful man on the planet in an escape pod. With the terrorists closing in to capture their own "Big Game" prize while [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] officials watch on satellite broadcast—including the Vice President, the CIA director, and former CIA field operative Herbert, brought in as a consultant—the unlikely duo must team up to escape their hunters.  Already feeling at a disadvantage as a hunter due to his father's reputation—his father having hunted and defeated a bear on his own hunt—Oskari's faith in himself is further shattered when he follows a map his father left him, only to find a portable refrigeration unit with a pre-killed deer head in it. Moore attempts to boost Oskari's confidence by reminding Oskari that he managed to save him, but they are subsequently confronted by Morris, the [[United States Secret Service]] member who orchestrated the attack from on board Air Force One—having become disillusioned with Moore as president after sustaining a bullet-wound that left a fragment of shrapnel near his heart—and Hazar, the mercenary who hired Morris to get Moore to him. Although Hazar decides to put Moore in the refrigeration unit and take him home to kill, Oskari regains his confidence and leaps onto the unit before it can be carried away, cutting it loose from the helicopter and hiding inside it as it rolls down a mountain to land in a river.  Discovering that the river leads to the lake where Air Force One crashed, Moore and Oskari swim inside the plane to wait for rescue, but are attacked by Hazar, who sets a time bomb, saying that he has new orders to kill the President now, rather than torture him for later execution. Moore manages to grab a gun and shoot Hazar before he and Oskari escape Air Force One via the ejector seats, Oskari subsequently shooting Morris with an arrow as the ex-bodyguard leans out of a helicopter to shoot at them; while the arrow fails to penetrate the protective padding on Morris's chest, the shot is nonetheless fatal as it dislodges the shrapnel inside Morris so that it impales his heart. As Morris plummets, he reflexively fires his gun and the bullets tear into the helicopter, killing the pilot. The explosion of Air Force One destroys Morris's helicopter and sends Moore and Oskari flying all the way back to the camp where Oskari's village is waiting for him, arriving at the same time as the [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] team sent to search for Moore. With Moore acting as Oskari's 'prize', he assures Oskari's father that his son is the bravest man he has ever met, with Oskari subsequently receiving the [[Medal of Honor]] for saving Moore's life.  Back at the Pentagon, the Vice President and Herbert reveal in a private discussion in a bathroom that Hazar was actually a CIA operative; the plan was that he would kill the President to inspire a new ''[[War on Terror]]'', but with his survival Moore has instead become a hero. To ensure that nothing can be traced back to them, Herbert kills the Vice President by shoving him back against the sink, subsequently wiping the Vice President's shoe and the floor with soap to give the impression that he just slipped.

Billy Elliot the Musical Live
  ===Act I=== In [[County Durham]], the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|1984–85 coal miners' strike]] is just beginning ("The Stars Look Down"). Motherless eleven-year-old Billy is required to stay behind after his boxing class and finds his way into a ballet class run by Mrs Wilkinson. He is the only boy, but becomes attracted to the grace of the dance ("Shine"). The secret is at first easily kept, as the only person home at the time is his grandmother. She reveals her abusive relationship with her dead husband and that she too loved to dance, which made everything all right ("Grandma's Song").  While Billy's father Jackie, brother Tony and neighbours are on strike and clash with riot police, he continues to take dance lessons, keeping it a secret from his family ("Solidarity"), a number which intersperses the violent reality of the strike with the peaceful practice of ballet.  Eventually, Jackie discovers Billy in the ballet class and forbids him from attending the lessons. Mrs Wilkinson, who recognizes Billy's talent, privately suggests that he should audition for the [[Royal Ballet School]] in London. To prepare for the audition, she offers free private lessons. Billy is not sure what he wants to do so he visits his best friend Michael for advice. He finds Michael wearing a dress. He persuades Billy to have fun with him by dressing up in women's clothing and disdaining the restrictive inhibitions of their working class community ("Expressing Yourself").  Billy arrives for his first private ballet lesson bringing with him things to inspire a special dance for the audition ("Dear Billy (Mum's Letter)"). He begins learning from and bonding with Mrs Wilkinson while he develops an impressive routine for his audition ("Born to Boogie"). Mrs Wilkinson's daughter Debbie tries to discourage Billy because she has a crush on him. Meanwhile, Jackie and Tony are engaged in daily battles with riot police that often turn bloody. They struggle to support the family with very little strike and union pay, a difficult task that goes on for nearly a year.  When the day of the Royal Ballet School audition arrives, police are coming through the village and Tony has been injured by the police. Because Billy had not come to the miner's hall to get picked up by Mrs Wilkinson for the audition, she goes to the Elliot home. Billy's family and some members of the community have gathered there. She is forced to reveal that she has been teaching Billy ballet in preparation for this very day. This news upsets Jackie and Tony, who gets in an argument with Mrs Wilkinson. Tony tries to force Billy to dance on the table in front of everyone. The police approach and, as everyone escapes, Billy calls out to his father saying that his mother would have let him dance, but Jackie refuses to accept that, saying that "Your Mam's dead!". Billy goes into a rage ("Angry Dance"), and for nearly a year, stays away from anything related to ballet.  ===Act II=== Six months later, at the miners' annual Christmas show, the children put on a show disparaging Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who is seen as the antagonist by the coal miners ("Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher"). Jackie gets drunk and sings an old folk song that elicits memories of his deceased wife and the usually stoic man leaves in tears ("Deep Into the Ground"). Left alone with Billy in the community centre, Michael reveals he has feelings for him, but Billy explains that the fact that he likes ballet does not mean that he is gay. Michael gives him a kiss on the cheek. Michael tries to get Billy to show him some dancing, but Billy is sad and just tells him to leave.  Michael departs, but leaves a music player running. Billy feels like dancing for the first time since the day of the aborted audition and dances while dreaming of being a grown-up dancer ("Dream Ballet"). Unknown to Billy, his father arrives and watches him dance. Overcome with emotion, his father goes to Mrs Wilkinson’s house to discuss Billy's prospects as a dancer. She confirms Billy's talent, but is not sure whether or not he would get into the Royal Ballet School. Mrs Wilkinson offers to help pay for the trip to London for the audition, but Jackie refuses. He leaves questioning his working-class pride and the future of mining for his boys.  Jackie decides the only way to help Billy is to return to work. When Tony sees his father cross the picket line, he becomes infuriated and the two argue over what is more important: unity of the miners or helping Billy achieve his dream ("He Could Be A Star"). The argument eventually comes to blows and Billy is accidentally hit. One of the miners chastises them for fighting and says that the important thing is looking after the child. One by one, the miners give money to help pay for the trip to the audition, but Billy still does not have enough for the bus fare to London. A strike-breaker arrives and offers him hundreds of pounds. An enraged Tony attempts to shun his donation, but no one else speaks up in his support. Now drained of hope, Tony dismally ponders whether there's a point for anything any more, and runs off.  Billy and his father arrive at the Royal Ballet School for the audition. While Jackie waits outside, an upper-crust Londoner highlights the contrast between the Elliots and the families of the other applicants. Jackie meets a dancer with a thick Scottish accent. The dancer confesses that his father does not support his ballet career. He sharply advises Jackie to "get behind" his boy. Billy nervously finishes the audition with a sinking feeling that he did not do well. As he packs his gear, he lets that emotion overwhelm him and he punches another dancer who was trying to comfort him. The audition committee reminds Billy of the strict standards of the school. They have received an enthusiastic letter from Mrs Wilkinson explaining Billy's background and situation, and they ask him to describe what it feels like when he dances. Billy responds with a heartfelt declaration of his passion ("[[Electricity (Elton John song)|Electricity]]").  Back in Durham, the Elliots resume life, but times are tough and the miners are running a soup kitchen to ensure everyone is fed. Eventually, Billy receives a letter from the school and, overwhelmed and fearful, knowing that it heralds the end of the life he has known, informs his family that he wasn't accepted. Tony retrieves the letter from the waste bin and discovers that his brother was accepted. At the same time, the miners' union has caved in; they lost the strike. Billy visits Mrs Wilkinson at the dance class to thank her for everything she did to help him. Debbie is sad that Billy will be leaving.  Billy packs his things for the trip to the school and says goodbye to the soon to be unemployed miners who are unhappily returning to work ("Once We Were Kings"). Billy says goodbye to his dead mother, who often visits him in his imagination ("Dear Billy (Billy's Reply)"). Michael arrives to say goodbye and Billy gives him a kiss on the cheek. Billy takes his suitcase and walks out to his future alone.  The entire cast comes out on stage and calls Billy back to celebrate the bright future ahead of him ("Finale").

Birdman (film)
 Riggan Thomson is a faded American actor who is famous for playing the [[superhero]] Birdman in a film trilogy 20 years ago. He is tormented by the mocking and critical internal voice of Birdman and frequently visualises himself performing feats of [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]] and [[Psychokinesis|telekinesis]]. Riggan is trying to gain recognition as a serious actor for writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of [[Raymond Carver]]'s short story "[[What We Talk About When We Talk About Love#"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"|What We Talk About When We Talk About Love]]."  Jake, Riggan's best friend and lawyer, is producing the play which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend Laura and Broadway débutante Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict whom he is trying to reconnect with, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hapless co-star Ralph, which Riggan tells Jake he caused. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile [[method acting|method actor]] Mike Shiner. The first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over the replacement of his gin with water, attempts to have real sex with Lesley during a sex scene and claims that the prop gun does not look real which is hindering his performance. Riggan clashes continually with Mike and is incensed at influential theater critic Tabitha Dickinson's praise for Mike's performance, but Jake persuades him to continue with the play. Riggan catches Sam using marijuana and berates her; she tells him he is expendable and that his play is a vanity project.  During the final preview, Riggan accidentally locks himself outside with his robe stuck in the fire escape door. He is forced to walk through [[Times Square]] in his underwear and enter through the audience to do the final scene. A concerned Sam is waiting in his dressing room after the show. She thinks the performance was very weird but sort of cool. She shows him that the Times Square footage is going [[Viral video|viral]] and explains how this actually helps him.  Riggan goes to a bar for a drink and approaches Tabitha, accusing her of not understanding theater and just being crudely labeling things. She tells him that she hates ignorant Hollywood celebrities who pretend to be serious actors and promises to "kill" his play with a deprecating review without even having seen it. On the way back, Riggan buys a pint of whiskey, drinks it and passes out on a stoop. The next day, walking to the theater with a severe hangover, he has a conversation with the now visible Birdman, who tries to convince him to quit the play and make a fourth Birdman film. Riggan visualises himself flying through the streets of Manhattan before arriving at the theater.  On the opening night the play is going very well. In his dressing room, a strangely calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife Sylvia that several years ago he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about his inner Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia wishes him luck and leaves the room, Riggan picks up a real gun, rather than a prop, for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself in the head on-stage. The play receives a [[standing ovation]] as Tabitha rushes out to file copy.  The next day, Riggan wakes up in a hospital with his face covered in a mask of bandages where his nose has been surgically reconstructed after he blew it off during the botched suicide. Sylvia is worried about him but Jake cannot contain his excitement that the play will run forever after Tabitha's rave-review which called the suicide attempt "super-realism" and just what American theater needed. Sam visits with flowers, which he cannot smell, and takes a picture of him to scare the skyrocketing number of followers on the [[Twitter]] account she has created for him. While she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and obscenely says goodbye to Birdman, whom he sees sitting on the toilet. Fascinated by some birds flying outside his room, he opens the window and climbs out onto the ledge. When Sam returns, Riggan is nowhere to be seen. She frantically scans the ground below the open window before slowly looking up into the sky, smiling, and laughing.  
Black Coal, Thin Ice
 In [[Heilongjiang Province]], 1999, the dismembered parts of a human body appear in shipments of coal in different cities.  Detective Zhang (Liao Fan) is assigned to investigate. The dead man is identified as a coal worker named Liang Zhijun, according to an identification badge next to some of the remains. Zhang and his partners (including Wang) go to interview a potential suspect and his brother.  The suspect kills two of Zhang's partners before being shot by Zhang.  Zhang is then shot by the suspect's brother.  Zhang survives.  Wang and Zhang return the ashes of Liang to his widow Wu ([[Gwei Lun-mei]]), an employee at Rong Rong Laundry. Wu buries the ashes at the base of a tree just outside Rong Rong Laundry.  By 2004, Zhang has quit the police force and become a drunken security guard, having been traumatized by the prior events. During a chance encounter with Wang, Zhang learns that two additional murders have happened with the same ''[[modus operandi]]''. The common thread is that both of these men had dated Wu at some point. Both men were wearing ice skates when they were killed.  Zhang feels intrigued and begins to investigate. He becomes a frequent customer of Rong Rong Laundry and tries to follow Wu at night, but she easily detects him. One day, the owner of the store, Rong Rong (Wang Jingchun), explains to Zhang that he employs Wu out of sympathy, even though she doesn't do her job properly. In fact, five years before, Wu had damaged a highly expensive jacket, although a few days later the jacket's owner stopped complaining and disappeared.  Zhang tries to make friends with Wu, and eventually invites her to go ice-skating together at an outdoor rink. Wang is secretly following the pair when he notices that a truck driver is also following them. He follows the truck driver, but while arresting him, the truck driver kills him using the blades of a pair of ice-skates as a weapon. The murder of his former partner makes Zhang even more determined. He follows up on a license plate number written down on a pad of paper (presumedly by Wang).  While on the bus Zhang is followed by a man with a pair of skates.  He goes into a restaurant and notices the man following him.  He loses the man at a dance hall.  The next day he follows the truck and sees the man dispose of paper wrapped bags from an overpass onto passing coal trains.   He then follows the man to the same outdoor ice skating rink.  To test his new theory of the case Zhang asks for Liang Zhijun to be paged (the 1st murder victim from 1999).  The man Zhang was following reacts by immediately leaving the rink.  The police confronts Wu regarding the murders.  She insists on speaking to Zhang. She tells him that Liang is alive and had killed someone during a robbery.  She tells Zhang that Liang switched identities with the man and that Liang is alive and following her since 1999 and killing any man with which she's involved.  Zhang gets Wu to help the police catch Liang. She reveals his location and arranges to meet with him. They meet and decide sometime later to go out to buy cigarettes. Liang notices the police and runs.  Liang is armed with a gun, the police give chase and eventually kill Liang.  The police ask Wu for the ashes from 1999. She says that she threw the ashes in a river, which makes Zhang suspicious (he saw her bury the ashes under a tree outside the laundry). He returns to Rong Rong and offers the owner a sum of money to purchase the damaged jacket that the customer abandoned. After a search for the jacket's owner, Zhang arrives at the Daylight [[Fireworks]] Club (The name of the club is the Chinese title of the film). He meets the owner of the club and asks if she recognizes the jacket. She says that her husband owned a similar jacket. She  also says that he went with another woman and she hasn't seen him since.  Zhang asks the owner whether she would recognize the woman her husband left with and she adamantly says yes.  She offers Zhang any sum for the woman's whereabouts while entering her bathtub, fully clothed.  Zhang says he is only here to delivery the jacket.  Zhang goes back to Rong Rong to invite Wu out to a performance at an amusement park. The pair meet the next evening on a Ferris wheel. Zhang asks Wu to look over to the city.  The neon lighting of Daylight Fireworks Club is visible. Zhang asks her what she sees and she admits seeing the club.  Zhang wants Wu to tell him the truth before the police finds out. Wu instead kisses Zhang and they end up having (awkward) sex while still on the Ferris wheel.  Police then question Wu and confronts her with the jacket.  Wu admits she killed the owner of the jacket. When she couldn't afford to pay the value of the jacket, the owner of the jacket forced her into an ongoing sexual relationship with him. To make this stop Wu killed the owner of the jacket.  Wu said Liang was not involved and he sacrificed everything for her and became a living dead person. She admits betraying Liang.  Zhang returns to his former life.  Wu is arrested and is walked through the scene where the murder took place by the police.  When she is transported from the scene fireworks starts going off everywhere.  the fireworks are shot from a rooftop nearby.  The daylight fireworks is an allusion to the Daylight Fireworks Club (and the title of the film).  The film ends as police and firefighters scale the building to stop the person responsible for the fireworks.  
Bird People (film)
 Audrey, a student, works as a hotel maid. In the same hotel Gary Newman, an American business man visiting Paris deliberately misses his flight and decides to quit his job, divorce his wife and remain in Paris.  
Black Butler (film)
 The film is set in a parallel, quasi-Edwardian history. The world contains two major powers: the West, ruled by the Queen, and the East. The Queen manipulates events worldwide using operatives called the Queen's Watchdogs. The film's protagonist, Earl Kiyoharu Genpou (replacing Ciel Phantomhive from the anime), is a Queen's Watchdog in an unnamed Eastern metropolis.  A large automobile is careering through a docks area. The man driving is rapidly desiccating, his face wrinkling, its skin crumbling. As he dies, the car crashes to a halt.  A warehouse echoes with screams as dark-clad men herd young women around. The chief thug questions one young woman for carrying photos of desiccated bodies. A young man in a formal black butler's uniform suddenly appears in the warehouse, identifying himself as a servant of the Genpu family. The thugs attack. Most are disabled or killed quickly. Only the chief thug remains conscious for questioning.  The next day, the young woman earlier questioned in the warehouse appears dressed as a young gentleman, in the role of Earl Kiyohara Genpu, the only son and heir of the Funtom Toy Company fortune. The earl's servants are present, including Sebastian Michaelis (the Black Butler from the previous night's battle), the clumsy maid Rin, and the house stewards Tanaka.  The Earl speaks with the Queen's personal secretary Charles B. Satou about the death of the Queen's ambassador Anthony Campelle, found overnight on the docks, mummified in his car. The unusual cause of death, and the presence of a card depicting a devil, mark it as the eighth similar mysterious death of a powerful citizen in a case called the Devil's Curse. All victims have some connection with the human smuggler from the warehouse. No motivation for the deaths is apparent, however, nor is a root cause of the desiccating symptoms. The Queen demands a quick close to the case.  At the Eastern Ministry for State Security, Bureau of Foreign Affairs, a senior official greets the visiting policeman Tokizawa. A coat button found at the warehouse massacre implicates a Watchdog of the Queen in the fracas. Tokizawa is told that if a Watchdog exists, he represents a danger to the nation and should be disposed of. Tokizawa is then warned to pretend he heard nothing about the connection between the warehouse and the Watchdog, nor about the Watchdog's proposed elimination or else the Queen will know about it.  Tokizawa and a few officers learn that the Genpu Family were once called the Phantomhive family from England before the family moved to Japan and change their family name to Genpu.  The Earl and Sebastian examine Campelle's corpse. Clues found there lead them to an underground club of the wealthy. The Earl infiltrates the club using help from her aunt, with the maid Rin posing as her escort. Sneaking behind closed doors, the Earl and maid are captured and subdued by Shinpei Kujo, CEO of Epsilon Pharmaceuticals, host of the party.  Kujo talks with a hooded figure about Necrosis, a poisonous new drug. Party guests begin inhaling Necrosis. After a brief moment of euphoria they begin bleeding from nose, ears, and eyes as desiccation sets in. A henchman displays a familiar devil card, along with a bowl of red capsule, consuming two of which will cancel the effects of the Necrosis poison. The hooded figure suddenly kills Kujo and leaves.  At the same time, Sebastian searches a series of darkened laboratories. A booby trap explodes near him, destroying the side of the lab building. The butler survives and rescues the Earl and the maid Rin from the scene of the Necrosis poisoning.  Tokizawa takes Sebastian for interrogation; however, Sebastian beats up the police and escapes.   The Earl travels with her aunt to a room near the exorcism ceremony. The aunt admits to being the hooded figure who killed Kujo, as well as the masked figure who years ago killed the Earl's parents and the bio-terrorist who will soon kill the gathered elite with a Necrosis bomb. Sebastian saves the Earl from her aunt's attack and tricks the aunt into succumbing to Necrosis.  On the roof of the building, the Earl guesses the combination of the briefcase bomb and disarms it. The Black Butler treats the Earl for Necrosis exposure and takes her home with the remaining Necrosis capsules from the bomb. Later, at the office of policeman Tokizawa, a box arrives with a hand-written note. In it are the remaining Necrosis capsules, a sign that the terrorist danger has been dispelled and the Genpu family are not his enemies. Meanwhile, at Eastern Ministry for State Security, Bureau of Foreign Affairs, a senior official gets a note that the Earl is alive and well and revealing to be a member of the crime syndicate that attacked the Genpu family.  Sebastian puts the Earl to bed and she orders him to stay with her until she falls asleep.

He receives £8,640 for his services and is asked to clean his desk and leave the premises.  Later, while having a drink with some former colleagues, Robinson meets up with his friend Kurston and a Russian called Blackie ([[Konstantin Khabensky]]). Kurston informs the duo of an idea to make money. He tells them about a German [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC|Type VIIC]]<ref group=note>Based on Robinson studying plans for the ''[[German submarine U-651|U-651]]'' to prepare for the expedition</ref> [[U-boat]] from [[World War II]] that sank off the coast of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] with a cargo of gold worth millions and how their former employer found the U-boat's location but was unable to salvage it due to the [[Russo-Georgian War]]. He also informs them both of a plan he has been working on to secretly recover the gold. After meeting with Kurston, Robinson agrees to meet with an unknown backer called Lewis.  Lewis agrees to fund Robinson's expedition on the grounds he receives a 40% split of the proceeds up to $40 million, a 20% cut on any amount above that, and that his executive Daniels ([[Scoot McNairy]]) accompany the expedition. Robinson agrees to the deal. Upon returning home Robinson finds a youth, Tobin, who notifies him of Kurston's suicide and indicates they were friends. Robinson takes the young man in and decides to bring him along on the expedition, and acquires a  from the [[Port of Sevastopol]]. The crew is 50% Russian and 50% British and almost immediately there are issues between the two groups. Only Blackie speaks Russian and English and the Russians view the young Tobin as a bad omen, mistakenly assuming he is a virgin when he is in fact an expecting father.  Due to the close confines, tension begins to mount between the two crews. Robinson makes the decision to split the take equally between each crewman. Due to the mounting pressures the crew fall out and there is a fight leading to Fraser ([[Ben Mendelsohn]]) losing his head and stabbing and killing Blackie. In the ensuing scuffle a fire breaks out and the sub is damaged leading to an explosion which knocks Robinson unconscious and kills at least 2 men.  Robinson wakes up 18 hours later to find tensions at breaking point. The Russians have taken over half of the boat with the British in the other half. The vessel is also badly damaged and they have no means to speak with the Russians as Blackie was killed. The sub's drive shaft is damaged but they discover they are close to the old U-boat and may be able to transfer its drive shaft and save the boat. Tensions continue to mount but Robinson discovers Morozov ([[Grigoriy Dobrygin]]) speaks English.  Robinson sends Tobin with Fraser and another diver to recover the drive-shaft and the gold. While making their way back, the third diver ([[David Threlfall]]) perishes when his air hose gets cut. Through Morozov they manage to get the Russians to install the drive-shaft and get the sub moving again. At this stage Daniels admits to Robinson that his prior employer set them up such that they are being used to do the dangerous work, while the employer waits to seize the gold as soon as the submarine surfaces. Robinson then decides to remain submerged and travel to Turkey, to try to keep the gold and avoid arrest. Furthermore, he decides they will attempt a risky navigation through a narrow channel, against the wishes of the crew.  Meanwhile Daniels persuades Fraser to murder Zaytsev thus forcing Robinson's hand, since there are no longer enough men to safely operate the sub.  At this point a second fire and explosion sends the sub back to the seafloor, and the sub begins to take on water.  Fraser and the rest of the remaining crew try to repair the leaks but their efforts are futile. Before they can escape, a panicked Daniels locks the bulkhead behind him leaving three men to drown but traps himself in the next compartment with his snagged clothing. Morozov closes the final bulkhead, leaving Daniels to drown and protecting Robinson, Tobin, and himself in the torpedo section where Robinson has hidden three [[Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment|escape suits]]. Robinson evacuates Tobin and Morozov and explains to Tobin that he will follow in the third suit using an emergency lever. Both men surface whereupon Morozov informs the young Tobin that there was no emergency lever and that Robinson had chosen to sacrifice himself. Soon after the third suit appears containing some of the gold and a picture of Robinson's family.

When Claire reaches the RV, Seed attacks her, but is stopped by Christine, who tells him, "No. With her I still have plans". As he and his family head home with the unconscious Claire, Seed snaps Emily's neck, and continues on with Christine and Claire.  In a mid-credits scene, a motorist stops when he sees Claire lying on the side of the road; he tries to call for help, but has his throat slit by Claire.

On the [[Day of the Dead]], [[Santa Muerte|La Muerte]], ruler of the Land of the Remembered, and [[Xibalba]], ruler of the Land of the Forgotten, see Manolo Sánchez and Joaquín Mondragon competing over María Posada. They strike a wager: if María marries Manolo, Xibalba will no longer interfere in mortal affairs, but if she marries Joaquín, La Muerte and Xibalba will swap realms. However, Xibalba cheats by giving Joaquín his Medal of Everlasting Life, which grants the wearer invincibility.  Years later, Joaquín has become a hero with the Medal's aid, but Manolo's musical aspirations are suppressed by his father Carlos, who trains him to be a [[Torero|bullfighter]] in their family tradition. At Manolo's first bullfight he defeats the bull but refuses to kill it, dismaying Carlos and the crowd but impressing María. That night, María is pressured by her father and mayor, General Ramiro Posada, to marry Joaquín for his protection from the Bandit King Chakal. María and Manolo both profess their love before dawn but are interrupted when Xibalba sends his dual-headed [[snake]] staff, who bites her and sends her into a [[coma]]. Devastated by María's apparent death, Manolo allows Xibalba to kill him, believing he will be reunited with María in death.  In the Land of the Remembered, Manolo reunites with his mother and his ancestral family. They travel to La Muerte's castle, discovering Xibalba, now the ruler of the realm, who explains the bet. Manolo travels to the Cave of Souls to reach La Muerte. Inside, he meets the Candle Maker, the overseer of mortal lives and the Book of Life's keeper. The Candle Maker sees that Manolo's story in the Book of Life is blank and can be rewritten by himself, so he takes them to the Land of the Forgotten. They find La Muerte at Xibalba's castle and expose his cheating. Furious, La Muerte lectures Xibalba before offering a new wager at Manolo's request: Manolo's life will be returned if he completes a challenge of Xibalba's choosing, but if he fails, he will be forgotten and Xibalba will keep both realms. Xibalba sets Manolo against a giant bull skeleton made from the skeletons of every bull slain by the Sanchez family, believing that to be his greatest fear.  Meanwhile, María is revived by the Medal, learns of Manolo's death, and accepts Joaquín's proposal. Their wedding is interrupted by Chakal, who leads his army to San Angel to find the Medal, which was previously his. Chakal kills Carlos, who arrives in the Land of the Remembered in time to see Manolo's fight. Manolo, realizing his fear is actually of ''being himself'', refuses to fight and instead sings an apology to the bull, appeasing it and touching everyone present. Impressed, the deities resurrect Manolo and send him and his family to San Angel to protect it. Manolo is knocked unconscious when Chakal [[Suicide|destructs himself]], but he is protected by the Medal, which Joaquín had slipped him earlier. Joaquín returns it to Xibalba and resolves to be a true hero, while Manolo and María are happily married as Xibalba and La Muerte reconcile.

Bonifacio: Ang Unang Pangulo
  The film begins with the execution of [[GOMBURZA]] in 1872. The story then flashes forward to the present day where high school students Joaquin ([[Daniel Padilla]]), Andrea ([[Jasmine Curtis-Smith]]), and Gary ([[RJ Padilla]]) visit Museo ng Katipunan.</span>  <span lang="fil">Flashback: On July 3, 1892, Dr. Jose Rizal ([[Jericho Rosales]]) brings together [[La Liga Filipina]], a peaceful reform movement that aims to unite all Filipinos and give them one voice. One of its members is Andres Bonifacio ([[Robin Padilla]]), who is currently supporting his siblings, as both their parents died due to illness. Rizal is later arrested after the Spanish authorities uncover the organization. Bonifacio then decides to form the [[Katipunan]] to lead a revolution against the Spanish colonizers.</span>   <span lang="fil">With the help of his friend Teodoro Plata, he meets Gregoria de Jesús ([[Vina Morales]]), who is also known as Oriang. Bonifacio visits the church, meeting Oriang again. She knows that he joined a group of [[Mason (Freemasonry)|Masons]] and is not religious. Bonifacio denies the accusations, saying that those are just inventions of the friars. Later that day, while walking on the street, they encounter a friend of Oriang ([[Pepe Herrera]]), begging a friar to give his salary in the ''polo''. However, the friar refuses and instead makes derogatory remarks towards the man. Then he is shot by one of the Spanish soldiers.</span>   <span lang="fil">Bonifacio and Oriang's relationship develops and they finally marry after Oriang’s parents gave their approval. Then while recruiting additional ''katipuneros'', Bonifacio finds out that Teodoro and Nonay Bonifacio are lovers. On the following day, a mayor named Emilio Aguinaldo becomes one of the new recruits of the Katipunan.</span>  <span lang="fil">In the present, the museum curator decides to guide the students towards the truth about Bonifacio to enlighten them amidst the wrong historical information in their textbooks.</span>  <span lang="fil">Back in the past, the Katipunan starts publishing the newspaper “[[Ang Kalayaan]]” through the printing press of Diario de Manila. They distribute the papers to their fellow countrymen to further expand the organization. A man named Teodoro Patino goes out of the printing press and tells his wife, a nun, about the revolution. Eventually he tells the ''gobernadorcillo'' on what he has discovered. After hearing this, the Spanish authorities raids the press wherein the ''gobernadorcillo'' discovers [["Ang Kalayaan"]]. Because of this discovery, they begin to grow wary of anti-government activities.   Afterwards, a man who is one of the people that published the paper is tortured. Upon seeing the man's dead body, Bonifacio calls all the Katipuneros to gather in [[Melchora Aquino|Tandang Sora]]'s home. Tandang Sora gives a sword to Bonifacio for him to use during their fights against the Spaniards. Later on, Bonifacio declares the start of the revolution on April 29,1897. All men tear their Cedulas and they scream, "Mabuhay ang Katipunan! Mabuhay ang rebolusyon! Mabuhay ang Supremo!"  On the day of the revolution, they cross a river and secretly pull a foot of one of the [[Spain|Spanish]] soldiers while the other one is shot by Bonifacio. In the entrance of one of the Officials' houses, Bonifacio throws a [[torch]] that is lit up in the trolley loaded with canisters and shoots it, letting them get inside the gate. A fight ensues. Eventually, Bonifacio is able to kill the Gobernador Heneral by stabbing. After the battle, the Katipuneros replace the flag of Spain with the KKK flag.  <span lang="fil">Aguinaldo’s comrades are concerned that the revolution might die under Bonifacio’s leadership. They advise Aguinaldo to urge Bonifacio to come to Cavite to reunify the factions of the [[Magdiwang (Katipunan faction)|Magdiwang]] and [[Magdalo (Katipunan faction)|Magdalo]] and hold an [[Tejeros Convention|election]] for it. Aguinaldo is elected as the president, while Bonifacio is only elected as the interior minister. A Magdalo member named ([[Daniel Tirona]]) objects to his election and insults him, angering Bonifacio who then challenges Tirona to a duel. Feeling discriminated, Bonifacio, as Supremo of the Katipunan, voids the election results. The newly formed, Aguinaldo-led revolutionary group is concerned about the unity of Katipunan after failing to persuade Bonifacio to join them. Aguinaldo then orders the capture of Bonifacio, during which Bonifacio is stabbed at the neck and suffers a gun shot at his arm. His brother Ciriaco is shot dead, while his other brother Procopio is beaten, and his wife Oriang possibly raped by Col. Agapito Bonzón. Suffering from his untreated wounds, Bonifacio tells his wife Oriang of his dream of finally achieving his wish of the country’s independence against Spain. Later on, Andres Bonifacio and Procopio Bonifacio are sentenced to death.</span>  <span lang="fil">Back to the present, the students finally learn the truth about Bonifacio. Joaquin decides to share what he has learned with his classmates: the “true” story of Bonifacio, the First President of the Philippines.</span>  <span lang="fil">At the end of the film, Bonifacio is shown holding his [[Flags of the Philippine Revolution#Personal flags|personal flag]] aloft while leading his troops in a charge against Spanish forces.

The Boxtrolls
 In the fictional hill-top town of Cheesebridge, Norvenia during the [[Victorian era]], rumors abound that subterranean [[troll]]s (known as Boxtrolls for the cardboard boxes they wear) have kidnapped and killed a young child. [[Pest control|Pest exterminator]] Archibald Snatcher strikes a deal with the city's leader Lord Portley-Rind to exterminate every Boxtroll in exchange for membership in the city's cheese-loving council called the White Hats, despite the fact that he is [[lactose intolerance|severely allergic to cheese]].  In actuality, the Boxtrolls are peaceful and emerge from underground at night to scavenge for discarded items with which to make useful inventions. A human boy named Eggs lives among them, cared for by a Boxtroll named Fish. As Eggs grows up, he becomes dismayed by the disappearing Boxtrolls seized by Snatcher. After Lord Portley-Rind's daughter Winnie sees Eggs with two Boxtrolls, Snatcher captures Fish. Eggs sneaks to the surface to find Fish and emerges in an annual fair to commemorate the disappearance of the "Trubshaw Baby" who was allegedly killed by Boxtrolls.  Disgusted by the town's inaccurate portrayal of the creatures, Eggs follows Winnie. After a brief exchange, he asks her for directions to Snatcher's headquarters, located at an abandoned factory, where Eggs rescues Fish. They are caught in the escape. Snatcher recognizes Eggs as the Trubshaw Baby and reveals that all the captured Boxtrolls are building him a machine. Winnie, who covertly followed Eggs, overhears this exchange. She then helps Eggs and Fish escape from Snatcher and they take shelter in the Boxtrolls' caves, where Fish explains that Eggs' father had given him to them to keep him from Snatcher. Winnie agrees to help Eggs tell Portley-Rind the truth. At a ball held to commemorate the purchase of a giant cheese wheel called the Briehemoth, Eggs tries to confront Portley-Rind, but is confronted by Snatcher (disguised as a woman named "Madame Frou-Frou"). Whilst trying to avoid Snatcher, Eggs inadvertently knocks the cheese wheel into a river. Eggs announces himself to the party as the Trubshaw Baby, but no one believes him, including Portley-Rind who is too upset about losing the cheese wheel.  Eggs tries to persuade the remaining Boxtrolls to flee for their own safety, but Snatcher digs into the caves and captures them all. Eggs awakens to find his father Herbert Trubshaw a prisoner beside him. He sees the Boxtrolls stacked in a crusher and begs them to leave their boxes and run, but they are apparently killed by the crusher.  Snatcher drives his machine to Lord Portley-Rind's house, shows him the flattened boxes as proof of the Boxtrolls' extinction, and demands Portley-Rind's white hat in exchange for killing the last Boxtroll, which is actually Eggs disguised. The Boxtrolls, who have escaped from the crusher, and Herbert free Eggs, while Snatcher tries to take Portley-Rind's hat by force. Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles, two of Snatcher's henchmen, redeem themselves and help the group disable the machine, which falls on Snatcher's third henchman Mr. Gristle and crushes him to death. Eggs and Snatcher are thrown clear and land on the recovered Briehemoth, which triggers Snatcher's cheese allergy and causes him to swell to an enormous size. He seizes Winnie and forces Lord Portley-Rind to give up his hat in exchange for her safety, but he [[dismemberment|explodes into pieces]] after tasting an aged cheese sample.  The townspeople and Boxtrolls begin a peaceful coexistence. Winnie tells the tale of Snatcher's end to a crowd, while Eggs and Fish drive off in one of Herbert's contraptions.   In a [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles clean the streets and have a philosophical discussion as a [[Laika (company)|Laika]] employee animates the scene, breaking the [[fourth wall]].

Boys of Abu Ghraib
 The film starts in 2003, the day before 22-year-old Jack Farmer (Luke Moran) ships out for Iraq, having joined the Army Reserves in hopes of being part of something bigger than himself.  He and dozens of other young men arrive at Abu Ghraib, a prison located 20 miles from Baghdad. CO Capt. Hayes ([[Scott Patterson]]) greets them with a rousing speech about them standing on the front lines of the war against terrorism, but the poor living conditions and boredom begin to wear on the soldiers. Jack requests MP duty, undaunted by the cautionary tale of an earlier volunteer who had the same idea and wound up shooting himself in the foot to escape. With no training, briefing or idea what to expect, Jack is transferred to "Hard Site"—a cellblock that supposedly houses hard-core terrorists. His new boss, Sgt. Tanner ([[Sean Astin]]), tells him that the Hard Site's guiding principle is "no compassion"; their job is to "soften up" prisoners for military interrogators. This includes tactics like sensory deprivation, humiliation and isolation.  Jack has his reservations about the treatment of detainees at the prison. He strikes up a friendship with one of the detainees Ghazi Hammoud ([[Omid Abtahi]]), a London-educated engineer. Just days before they were scheduled to return home, Jack and his unit learn that they're [[tour of duty]] has been extended by six months. They are devastated but continue their day to day duties. Hammoud is subjected to multiple rough interrogations. The guards shackle him to the cell so he is forced to stand and tell Jack to let him shit himself. When Jack finally confronts his fellow soldiers, defending Hammoud's innocence, he learns that Hammoud has confessed to building a bomb that killed 18 civilians in a coffee shop. Jack confronts Hammoud asking if he killed "innocent people" to which Hammoud replies that they were not innocent. Jack breaks down and subsequently adopts a more aggressive posture, treating the detainees less kindly than he had prior to Hammoud's confession.    When it is finally time for Jack to go home, he briefs the soldier set to replace him, much like Tanner had briefed him. His replacement takes out a camera and snaps a photo, but Jack tells him to put the camera away. When Jack notices Hammoud has fallen asleep, he drags the prisoner out of the cell and begins yelling at him. Unknown to Jack, the second soldier snaps another picture. After returning home to the US, Jack sees the news coverage of the Abu Graib scandal breaking on live TV as he is shopping at a local store with his fiancée.  
Break-Up
 The film is about a satire on modern life and on the nature of power, interweaving many subplots to create an overview of young people's lives today.<ref>.</ref> It is told in an experimental visual- and editing style.<ref>.</ref> The film has been called an [[experimental film]].<ref>.</ref>  The film consists of four chapters that are explicitly named in the storyline. Their names correspond with the general theme of each chapter:  * '''1. Break Out''' - The opening of the film consists mainly of people breaking out of their regular world and conventional lifestyles. * '''2. Break In''' - The second chapter starts with the character John "breaking into" a married relationship, and ideologies "breaking in" Arnold's mind. * '''3. Break Free!''' - The third chapter starts with a trial, and Arnold breaking free from all the ideologies that had influenced him before. It ends with Arnold being badly beaten up, lying on the floor without any illusions left. * '''4. Break Up''' - The fourth and final chapter deals with John finally breaking up with his girlfriend - and destroying the planet in the process in a surrealistic scene. He is thus metaphorically "breaking up" with all that is wrong in the world as it was depicted in the previous chapters. .</ref>}}

A Brand New You
 In this quirky dark comedy Santiago Morales (Manuel Rodriguez-Saenz) a former engineer, is unable to come to terms with the passing of his wife Viviana (Dalal Badr) who has died of cancer. Santiago rents a room in a house as he struggles to get his financial affairs from the marriage sorted out. He quickly becomes suicidal, obsessing over his late wife by watching videos of her on an iPad and building a shrine to her in his room. Santiago is very particular and keeps things neat, tidy, and organized which leads to clashes with his housemate/landlord Murray (Clinton Lee Pontes) who is a total slob and spends most of his time in his underwear in the living room of the house surrounded by trash and clutter. Santiago discovers that Murray is actually a disgraced geneticist with too much time on his hands. Murray was a rising star in the cloning field until he was caught conducting illegal experiments and was fired. He is itching to get back in the saddle so together they devise a plan involving the other housemate, Laura (Freya Ravensbergen), to clone Santiago's dead wife and thereby bring her back to life.  Laura has just lost her waitressing job and is unable to pay her debts so when presented with a relative financial windfall for her role, she reluctantly agrees to take part in the scheme to be the surrogate for their bizarro cloning experiment.  The film is unique and offbeat as the often twisted humour is made genuinely funny by the actors. The logic and consequenses of the characters schemes seem secondary. For example, it doesn’t appear to bother Santiago that his wife would be a baby and not in fact "Viviana" in any way other than genetically. In fact he misses her to such an extreme that its hard not to end up rooting for him to see her.  There is a secondary plot about another scientist seeking to undermine Murray's work. This comes into play as Santiago and Murray attempt to source the equipment they need for their experiment. Ultimately and perhaps predictably, the entire scheme ends up in danger of falling apart and that's when the creativity in the film shines. The character work and script development keep the characters moving along their dramatic arch in a funny and unique way.<ref name=":1"></ref><ref name=":2"></ref><ref name=":3"></ref><ref name=":4"></ref><ref name=":5"></ref>

Layo meets her spiritual mentor and explained her fears and challenges to her who encouraged her saying that" Your mother is right but permit me to add somethings she left out, I have learnt that love always come at a cost that only the BRAVE can pay for, this is beyond you.  You cannot love this man by your own strength, you will always go weary, you see God is love and when you truly have him you have the capacity to love unconditionally without fear or compromise, the kind of love that have the capacity to change everything".

Brihonnola
  Mohanpur is an ancient village, not unlike many such villages of our country, still deprived of the basic amenities of modern times. There is a local health centre minus a permanent doctor(Azad Abul Kalam) as no one is willing to work and live in a village. There is also a primary school with no more than a handful of pupils and the few who do go to school hardly ever attend college afterward. The population of the village is just average, neither too dense nor too sparse. One it was a predominantly Hindu locality, but in a course of time, the proportion of Hindus has declined to the level of Muslims and is continuing to decline further. However, any conflict or clash between the adherents of the two faiths is yet unheard of in this village. All villagers live in an atmosphere of friendly tolerance.Everything has been going well for ages, but at one point an ancient banyan tree becomes the focal point of dispute between the two sections of the village community. Situated on public land, this tree has been witness to the passage of time. It is said that once this plot of land used to be the property of a Hindu zamindar, but at present it belongs to the government.  The villagers do not have many possessions, except for a few things. The Muslims have a mosque, the Hindus a temple. There are one community health centre and an ancient railway station. One day the Hindus suddenly began to think: "Wish we could have another temple!" The Muslims also thought: "If we could not have another mosque, why not an Eidgah at least?" And both sides wanted their temple or mosque to be erected on the empty public land. But the tree on the plot stood in the way.  The only resident doctor in the village, elderly homeopath Araj Ali(Azad Abul Kalam), had been applying to the authorities for the last five years for a good doctor for the health centre. Finally, his application bore fruit, a qualified doctor was sent from the district town, and on the same day the village carpenter Tulsi’s(Intekhab Dinar) goat died on the public land. Hindus and Muslims were shocked by the incident, they suspected the tree on the plot was cursed. Rumour was rife in the village that the old banyan tree was the cause of the animal’s death. To prevent the recurrence of such incidents the vicinity of the tree was declared inaccessible to all human beings, their cattle, and other domestic pets. But at one time children used to play hide-and-seek around that banyan tree on the public land, on scorching hot days cowherds dozed in its soothing shade, peasants working in the fields cooled their perspiring bodies under its leafy branches while eating the lunch brought by their wives or daughters. But in a few days time, the cursed tree claimed its second victim, the carpenter Tulsi’s old mother(Dilara Zaman) who went gathering dry leaves under it. Tulsi’s beautiful wife Durgarani(Sohana Saba) told everyone that tree was indeed the killer of her mother-in-law.  The newly qualified doctor Abir Ahmed at the village health centre examined the dead woman and said that she had died of a heart attack. The Hindus refused to accept his verdict. Overnight the tree turned into a deity. Illiterate and superstitious Hindus began to worship the tree from a safe distance, the over-zealous among them even dared to decorate the trunk and branches of the tree with red pennants. The Brahmins began to proclaim that the tree deity could only be appeased by performing puja under it and offering human sacrifice.  The time of Durga Puja, the biggest Hindu festival, drew near. Muslims too prepared to rejoice in the festivities of their Hindu neighbours. The image of goddess Durga was being constructed in the temple. Arati – ritualistic worship with oil lamps and burning sense accompanied by the loud ringing of bells and beating of gongs – was performed every evening in the temple till late, although worshippers were careful not to begin it until the Muslims had ended their namaz. This was a familiar daily scenario in Mohanpur.  Mohanpur has a small marketplace consisting of only a handful of shops. Protul Nag is the night watchman, appointed by Gour Biswas, the head of the temple committee. It is said that he had murdered his wife. Protul patrols the market area every night, shouting "Beware, all honest people!" although his own honesty is subject to question. One night a thief broke into a shop and tried to escape carrying a sackful of rice. But he ran into Protul and dropping the sack ran off to hide under the banyan tree on the public land. There were heavy rains and thunderstorm that night and the next morning the thief was found lying stone dead under the tree. After examining the corpse the qualified doctor Abir Ahmed said the man had been murdered.  The Hindus refused to accept the doctor’s opinion. They said: "The deity is demanding human sacrifice. Such incidents will not stop until the deity’s demand is met." The veteran homeopath Araj Ali asked: "If the man has indeed been killed by that tree, why is there a vicious bruise on his head?" But no one paid any heed to his question.  Tulsi was dumbfounded with grief at his mother’s death. He had the lurking suspicion that the members of the temple committee might have  persuaded his wife Durga to poison the goat. Were they responsible for his mother’s death as well? His mother and Durga had never been on very good terms with each other, so he could not help suspecting his wife. So he withdrew into a shell and simply stopped talking. Meanwhile, a clandestine relationship developed between Durga and the new doctor Abir. This gave rise to covert whisperings in the village.  The homeopath Araj Ali repeatedly sent applications to the district town praying for the interference of the authorities to resolve this situation. One day a Police Inspector arrived to make inquiries into the questions involving the banyan tree. Both Hindus and Muslims gathered at the spot. The Inspector carefully examined the tree. Araj Ali’s letters had already appraised the Inspector of the dirty politics behind the incidents taking place in the village. An elderly Hindu villager came forward and said: "Inspector Sir, this tree is not a mere tree, it’s a deity. It’s demanding more blood." The Inspector replied: "So you’re advocating human sacrifice here! You want a temple where you can worship. But was there ever a temple at this spot?" An old Muslim gentleman shouted: "There has never been a temple here. Why is it necessary to preserve this tree? Let’s cut it down!" These heated arguments created considerable excitement among the crowd and led to skirmishes. Finally, the police managed to disperse the crowd by wielding sticks and the Inspector even had to fire a few rounds. The police force left without taking a decision.  The next day a bagful of money reached the Inspector. The authorities shook their hands off the matter. And the mosque committee discovered that their agitation was about to fizzle out since their community had suffered no loss of life or property. Meanwhile, the temple committee arranged to guard the tree lest someone tried to destroy it. In spite of that one night, some men wearing caps managed to tear off the red ribbons hung from its branches. Coming to know of this Araj Ali rushed there and re-fastened the red ribbons, two village communities.  The same night the dead body of Araj Ali was found at the bottom of the tree. The fingers of one of his lifeless hands were clutching a cap. The mosque committee placed the blame of Araj Ali’s death squarely on the temple committee while the latter accused the former of the same crime. The two sides began taking out processions, in turn, protesting against this heinous act and demanding justice.  Apprehending that the situation was quickly going out of control, the doctor Abir Ahmed petitioned the higher authorities. The government responded with strict orders that neither side was to erect any kind of structure in the vicinity of the disputed tree. Hindus and Muslims then joined hands to drive the Doctor Abir out of the village. They chose Tulsi’s beautiful wife Durga as the instrument for making their plan work.  Their plan was successful. Answering the coquettish call of Durga, the doctor came to see her behind her house in the dead of night. He was caught red-handed by vigilant villagers. The same night both Hindus and Muslims gathered in the courtyard of Haji Sahib where the doctor was put on trial. Their verdict was that Doctor Abir must leave the village by the first light of dawn. Progressive ideology was thus defeated by dirty politics.  But will this politics of religious dogmatism, of vested interests ever come to an end? Or is it to continue as long as the human race lasts? But that banyan tree is still standing on that same public land, and politics is still being played around it.  O Brihonnola Tree, may you survive forever because you too have the right to live.

Bunshinsaba 3
 A mental patient with a heart problem, Xu Lian, escapes from her facility to take back her daughter, Xiao Ai, from her grandparents' home. Her grandparents attempt to take Xiao Ai elsewhere, but their car crashes with Xiao Ai as the only survivor. Xu Lian decides to move to her grandfather's villa in a remote countryside with Xiao Ai. Xu Lian begins to experience haunting since the first night she moved in, including a girl with a charred face, which she suspects comes from the girl's painting in the staircase wall. Xiao Ai, meanwhile, discovers a tricycle that belongs to "Xiao Ai", apparently the name of the charred girl. Everyone in the village also seem to know Xu Lian to some degree, including a mentally handicapped man who claims to be searching for his wife and daughter.  After getting fed up by the local kindergarten's headmistress who degrades Xiao Ai's antisocial attitude, Xu Lian hires a tutor, Yuan Yuan, for Xiao Ai, though she initially dismisses her for her young age. Yuan Yuan, who is an expert at [[ouija]], reciprocates a colleague who falls in love with her and agrees to be more intimate if he agrees to do something. To remove and burn the girl painting, Xu Lian borrows a hammer from a neighbor whose husband works as an artist. When she returns the hammer at another night, Xu Lian discovers her neighbor killed by her husband and promptly runs away until she passes out from her sickness. When she tries to call the police, no trace of the killing is found.  Yuan Yuan permanently becomes Xiao Ai's tutor, but bolts away when she suffers a stomachache, which she reveals to her colleague is because she is pregnant by her art teacher, Xu Kuizhe. Her request is revealed: she wants her colleague to help her abort the child. He refuses and attempts to attack her, but passes out when he hits his head with a concrete. Believing him dead, Yuan Yuan heads to Xu Lian's residence but is taken by Kuizhe. Realizing that Kuizhe is her neighbor's husband, Xu Lian goes to his residence and saves Yuan Yuan before he is able to continue assaulting her. She is promptly chased by Kuizhe until a car hits him, but no trace of the accident is found.  After giving birth and rejecting her daughter, Yuan Yuan forcefully takes Xiao Ai to the attic of Xu Lian's house. From several papers handed by the handicapped man, Xu Lian learns that he is Yuan Yuan's colleague who went crazy after Yuan Yuan abandoned him. She confronts Yuan Yuan in the attic and learns the full truth: Yuan Yuan is really Xu Lian as she appeared ten years ago. Yuan Yuan was made pregnant by Xu Kuizhe, who was hit by a car shortly after. Kuizhe's parents apologized and allowed her to take a new identity as their granddaughter: Xu Lian. Five years afterward, Xiao Ai was burned alive in the attic while playing hide-and-seek with Yuan Yuan, the latter not being able to help due to her sickness. Yuan Yuan went mad and convinced herself that her daughter is still alive. To circumvent this, Kuizhe's parents adopted a girl, Wen Wen, and forced her to become "Xiao Ai" under the threat of being returned to her orphanage.  Several weeks later, Yuan Yuan visits the mental facility to view her interview videos. She rejects the doctor's insistence about her daughter's demise and goes outside, where she is greeted by Wen Wen.  
Burying the Ex
 Nice guy and horror fanatic Max ([[Anton Yelchin]]) is dating the beautiful-but-manipulative Evelyn ([[Ashley Greene]]). Evelyn is an extreme [[environmentalist]] working for a blog company that promotes "going green", while Max works a dead-end job at the local horror shop named Bloody Mary's. In many situations, Max often finds himself trapped trying to do whatever he can to keep Evelyn happy, including changing his diet and selling his old car. In addition to this, Max dreams of opening up a horror memorabilia shop of his own in the future, much to Evelyn's dismay. One day at the shop, Max unloads the latest shipments and finds a [[Satan]] [[Genie]], an object that claims it can grant anyone's wants or desires. Believing it to just be another silly item for the shop, Max places it on the shelf in the storage room and dismisses it. Later that night, he and Evelyn have sex in the shop and make a promise to each other that they'll be together forever. Shortly thereafter, Max has Evelyn move in with him. Max and Evelyn initially decide to celebrate this new development in their relationship by grabbing a bite to eat. Wanting Evelyn to try something ''he'' enjoys for a change, Max suggests they go to I-Scream, a [[malt]] hot-spot run by Olivia ([[Alexandra Daddario]]). Evelyn is immediately unkind to Olivia and believes her and Max were flirting with each other. As Max pleads his case to her, Evelyn tearfully admits that she doesn't want to lose him and that he's the only thing in her life that has made her happy since her mother's death.  All seems to be great until Max comes back home to discover that Evelyn has redecorated their entire apartment to what she feels is aesthetically pleasing and has put away all of Max's collectables and posters, ruining their price values. This leads to an argument where Max states that he and Evelyn should be making decisions together instead of her taking the reins on every little thing all the time. Feeling that Evelyn's overbearing nature will lead him to be unhappy for the duration of their relationship, Max plans to break up with her but is too scared to do so. Max turns to his slacker half-brother Travis ([[Oliver Cooper]]) for advice. Travis suggests that Max break up with Evelyn in a public place so he can make a quick getaway and have everyone present see her for the control freak she truly is. However, the plan backfires when Evelyn accidentally gets hit by a bus on her way to the park. She dies in the middle of the road while in the arms of a tearful Max.  A couple weeks go by and Max has shut himself off emotionally, feeling responsible for Evelyn's death. Travis swings by his place and, after seeing the funk he's in, encourages him to get back out and move on. Max eventually runs into Olivia again and starts to hit it off with her. As the night progresses, Max and Olivia learn that they both share the same fascination for horror. But when Max and Olivia visit the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]], Evelyn is shown to have risen up from the dead and has dug herself up out of the ground. After Olivia walks Max back home, he's quickly greeted by an undead Evelyn at the door. Evelyn is overjoyed and believes hers and Max's love is being given a second chance and thinks they're still dating. Frightened, Max realizes that the Satan Genie from the shop made their wish of being "together forever" come true and has brought Evelyn back from the dead. Still wanting to pursue Olivia, Max actively attempts to hide Evelyn from her. He's also left to ponder how exactly he's going to officially dump Evelyn. Max presumes that the answer to his problems lie with the Satan Genie, only to have it shatter on the ground when he loses his footing. For his backup plan, Max then researches the occult/spell books the shop has available in the hopes of finding something that will send Evelyn back to her grave. He tries these techniques, but to no avail; as they have no effect on Evelyn whatsoever.  Travis stumbles upon Max with a drunken Evelyn, and is reluctant to help him. He soon has a change of heart and tells Max that the only true way he can get rid of Evelyn is to decapitate her with a machete. Max tries to accomplish this but backs out at the last minute. The day before Halloween, Olivia drops by the shop to visit Max. It's later interrupted by a phone call from Evelyn. Olivia (who still doesn't know that Evelyn's a zombie) thinks Max still hasn't gotten over her just yet, but offers him an invitation to a screening of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' at the cemetery. Travis steps up to the plate and offers to kill Evelyn so Max can meet Olivia at the movie. Travis shows up at the apartment under the guise of searching for an old DVD Max never returned to him and intentionally prolongs his stay, annoying Evelyn. She then develops a sudden craving for brains and ends up eating Travis. Meanwhile, Max and Olivia are enjoying each other's company and end up having sex in the back of Olivia's car.  Upon Max's return, he discovers Travis's corpse in the living room. Knowing that Evelyn is now determined to kill anyone who gets in her way, Max tricks her into drawing a hot bubble bath for themselves in order to barricade the bathroom door and trap her inside. He rushes out of the apartment to get the police but leaves his cell phone behind by mistake. Evelyn doesn't take too long to break free and escapes. She then kidnaps Olivia after she's read the texts between her and Max. Having had no luck with the police, Max hears through one of the [[Scanner (radio)|police scanners]] about someone knocking over a malt shop and realizes Olivia's in trouble. Back at the apartment, Max sees Olivia tied up and Evelyn threatens to kill her. A battle ensues between Max, Evelyn, and Olivia, ending with Travis (now revealed to be a zombie himself) fatally stabbing Evelyn through the chest with the machete. With Evelyn finally gone, Max and Olivia take her body back to the cemetery and bury her.  One year later, Max and Olivia's relationship is still going strong. Max has long since quit his job at Bloody Mary's, became business partners with Olivia—having joined his horror memorabilia store and her malt shop as an enterprise of their own—and is now truly happy. Max then surprises Olivia with an engagement ring, which she gladly accepts. And Travis, still in his zombie form, is shown sign-spinning outside the shop.

By the Gun
 Nick Tortano is an associate of local [[caporegime]] Sal Vitaglia.  Nick wants to become a [[made man]] but has yet to be trusted enough for his first contract killing.  As the Boston crime families wither, however, Sal is forced to consolidate his power and advance more men.  Recognizing Nick as potentially useful soldier, Sal advises him to show more loyalty and respect to the family.  Sal forces him to deliver an apology in order to smooth over relations with another gangster, Tony Matazano, whom he has insulted.  Nick reluctantly delivers the apology, though his friend George, a local thug unaffiliated with the mafia, ridicules him for having to show respect to what he views as a contemptible person.  Although Tony accepts Nick's apology, tensions remain high between them.  When Nick also delivers an apology to Tony's estranged daughter, Ali, whom his cousin had insulted, Nick and Ali become interested in each other, though she at first rejects his overtures.  Ali does not like her father, and she is concerned by Nick's relationship to the Boston crime families.  Nick and George rob a local drug dealer that George had befriended, and Nick attempts to give some of the money to his brother, Vito.  However, their father, Vincent, refuses to accept it and calls it blood money.  Meanwhile, Nick's attempts to romance Ali pay off, and the two begin dating, though she teases him about his stereotypically macho attitude.  Sal finally gives Nick a contract, but he is unable to perform the murder.  Seeing his hesitation, George performs it for him.  Now a made man, Nick realizes that he no longer has to show as much respect around town.  After first shaking down a local business owner to whom he owes money, he revisits Tony and demands a cut of his rumored Eastern European prostitution ring.  Although resentful, Tony obliges.  Now needing to collect on his outstanding debtors, Tony becomes frustrated with his incompetent underlings, who allowed an anonymous gambler to accrue a $25,000 debt without knowing his personal details.  Tony personally takes charge of the collection and threatens to kill the man over the phone.  George later calls Nick and directs him to a warehouse, where he reveals himself as the anonymous gambler.  Nick is horrified to find that George has kidnapped and beaten Tony, and Nick attempts to talk George out of Tony's murder.  After first threatening to kill George, Nick instead kills Tony.  Joe, Tony's second in command, instantly becomes suspicious of George and Nick when Tony disappears.  With Sal's blessing, he interrogates Nick's family, and Joe kills Vincent in an altercation.  Enraged by his father's murder, Nick attempts to see Sal, though he is stopped by Jerry, who explains that Sal will not see him.  Jerry asks whether Nick killed Tony, and when he is met with silence, Jerry advises Nick to leave town immediately.  Instead, Nick goes to see Ali and apologizes to her for killing her father.  On orders from Sal, Jerry murders Ali, but Nick kills him before he can also be targeted.  George insists that they together kill the entire [[crime family]], but Nick rebukes him, and the two go their separate ways.  Having lost his father, girlfriend, and best friend, Nick resolves to kill Sal.  Sal is unsurprised to see Nick, and they talk as Nick holds a gun on him.  Although Nick blames Sal for the events that have destroyed his life, Sal says that Nick has thrown away a promising career in the Mafia over his connections to friends and family that should not mean anything to him, as they are outside the Mafia.  Sal shoots and kills Nick with a hidden pistol.  As Sal waits for a clean up crew to dispose of Nick's body, Vito arrives and murders Sal.  The film ends as Vito runs off.

Frustrated by the boring nature of his work and the low pay, Marty uses his low level crime as an outlet to rebel. Among his regular scams are going to banks and repeatedly opening new checking accounts to get free deposits, as well as taking items from his job and taking them to a local office supplies store for fraudulent refunds. One day on the job at First National Bank, Marty swipes a stack of refund checks from the company, then forges the payees' signatures to sign several of the checks over to himself. Later Marty's boss, Carol, tells him that the company receives images of the checks when they are cashed and can see who is cashing them. Fearing his scheme will be discovered, Marty goes into hiding at his co-worker Derek's basement.  While in hiding, Marty wastes his days playing video games, goofing off with Derek and sucking down [[Mountain Dew]] and frozen pizzas.<ref></ref> He also starts crafting a weapon made out of steak knives and a Nintendo Power Glove inspired by Freddy Krueger's bladed glove from the Nightmare on Elm Street movies. Derek tells Carol that Marty is sick and can't come into work, but bungles the lie and Marty soon begins to think Carol is close to discovering what happened to the checks. Marty starts to run low on cash, and on a trip to the convenience store at Derek's behest the cashier cheats him out of five dollars, with security cameras capturing Marty trashing a store display in response.

After checking out he breaks into the hotel to sleep, only to be discovered in the morning by a maid. The hotel manager confronts him and tries to call the police, but Marty threatens him with the glove and runs off. Marty tries to cash his remaining stolen checks at an ATM, but discovers that his account has been shut down. He then goes to a payday loan provider to attempt to cash the checks, but the owner finds the transaction suspicious and accuses Marty of fraud. The owner, having caught Marty on security camera and identified him using his drivers license, calls the police and tries to keep Marty in a back room. Marty slashes the owner in the face and neck with the glove to once again escape, and leaves the owner lying on the floor bleeding profusely.

Disturbed by this, Marty runs off, with the center TV still capturing one last image of him as he flees.  
But Always
 While most of “But Always” takes place in New York City, the Chinese drama’s blend of sentimentality and romantic fatalism is very Asian. American viewers who aren’t Sino-cinema buffs might balk, but Snow Zou’s directorial debut does have a few noteworthy attributes: attractive stars, sun-dappled cinematography and an audacious payoff.  Beijing tykes Anran and Yongyuan meet in 1982, when she transfers to his school. She’s wealthier than her ragged classmates, who regard her with suspicion. The school bully assigns Yongyuan to follow Anran, a role he happily accepts for the next 20 years. One sign of his devotion is that he can always recognize her footsteps.  The kids bond, in part because both lost their mothers in the same earthquake. (His was a peasant; hers was a doctor.) But then Yongyuan’s guardian dies and his uncle takes him away. He’s not allowed to say goodbye to Anran, a pattern that recurs as one or the other repeatedly vanishes.  A decade later, Yongyuan returns to Beijing and encounters Anran, now a teenage pre-med student. She’s grown up to be played by Chinese beauty Gao Yuanyuan (“Caught in the Web”), who in this movie always looks as if she’s just strolled out of a fashion spread. He’s now portrayed by Hong Kong action star Nicholas Tse (“The Bullet Vanishes”), who’s just as pretty as she is.  The couple’s reunion is idyllic, then awkward, then idyllic again. But Yongyuan gets involved in some shady business to raise money for Anran’s post-graduate education. So when she’s ready to leave for Columbia University, he’s disappeared again.  In Manhattan, Anran acquires a new boyfriend, a petulant painter called Michael (Qin Hao). She also works two part-time jobs in addition to her studies. (The movie is not subtle in suggesting that Beijing is now a better place to dwell than New York.)  Yongyuan, who has gotten rich just so he can search for Anran, finds her through Michael’s paintings of her. This leads to another sweet, luminously photographed reunion. But the couple will be torn apart twice more, and the final rupture will make or break the movie for many viewers. It’s shamelessly contrived, but refreshingly outrageous.  “But Always” seems modeled on Peter Chan’s more complex 1996 “Comrades, Almost a Love Story,” in which two mainland Chinese expats attract and repulse each other on journeys through Hong Kong and New York. Anyone who’s seen that movie will anticipate the final flashback in “But Always,” which makes the story’s melodramatic point one more time: Anran and Yongyuan are fated to be together as much as they are doomed to be apart.

In a nearby [[ghost town]], the landowner meets JB, a lawyer who wants to buy the property, primarily for its museum dedicated to serial killers: [[Albert Fish]], [[John Wayne Gacy]], [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], [[Ed Gein]], and [[Zodiac Killer|the Zodiac]], "The Death Factory". When the landowner refuses to sell the museum along with the rest of his property, JB stabs him, then prepares an occult ritual with a [[Book of the Dead]], and blood samples taken from the displays in the Death Factory.  Elsewhere, the bus Simon is on breaks down, so he and the other passengers go in search of aid while the driver remains with the vehicle, which he disappears with after the group leaves. The passengers reach the ghost town, and while the others debate what to do, Star and Ren wander off, and uncover JB's belongings.

Calvary (2014 film)
  In a dark Catholic confessional, an unseen man tells Father James he was horribly sexually abused as a child by a priest, promising to kill James at the beach the next Sunday (James being a good man whose death will impact the church more than would that of an abusive priest). James has a week to arrange his affairs. His bishop leaves it to James to decide whether to notify the police. James' daughter Fiona has attempted suicide after feeling abandoned following her mother’s death and her father’s entry into the priesthood. Their rapprochement is a principal theme of the film.  Local butcher Jack Brennan has hit his unfaithful wife, Veronica, and James confronts him. Jack denies it, blaming Veronica’s African lover, Simon. James goes about his pastoral duties, and obtains a revolver for an elderly American writer who is contemplating suicide to thwart senile decay.  Millionaire Michael Fitzgerald’s family has deserted him and he feels directionless and detached from reality. At the hospital, following a car crash, James performs the last rites for the French driver, and comforts the widow, Teresa. She stoically accepts her husband's fate, believing premature death unfair only if the victim has never felt real love. James visits Freddie Joyce in jail, a killer who ate his female victims and now, asking for forgiveness, cannot recall where one particular victim is buried. James accuses him of insincerity, saying if God cannot understand Freddie, nobody can. Through James's dealings with Freddie, Michael, another potential suicide (Milo), Teresa and Fiona, the film reflects on guilt, sin, virtue, depression and suicide.  That night, James witnesses the burning down of his church. He later tells Fiona he will never abandon her, spiritually at least, and she reciprocates. Finding his dog dead with its throat cut, he buries it, weeping, but keeps the death from his daughter the next morning as she leaves. Walking a country lane, James chats innocently with a young girl when the father drives up, grabs the girl and crudely questions James’s motives. At the pub, the doctor/pathologist tells James a horrifying story about a small child rendered deaf, mute, paralyzed and blind after botched anaesthesia, and contemplates the ineffable terror of such sensory isolation. James, angered, gets drunk, argues with cynical publican Brendan Lynch and empties the revolver into the furnishings. Brendan wields a baseball bat and later, a beaten-up James is recovering at home. He violently berates his house guest, Father Leary who, offended, leaves the next morning. James decides to fly to Dublin, but returns from the airport after meeting Teresa and seeing her husband's coffin by the aircraft. Heading to the beach on the fateful Sunday, James chats with the ageing writer en route, then by phone to Fiona, saying sin is considered too much and virtue not enough. He stresses the importance of forgiveness and they forgive one another.  After James throws his revolver into the sea, a distressed Michael walks up and James promises to visit him. Later, the altar boy, painting a seascape at the top of the beach, witnesses James waiting on the beach as Jack Brennan strides along the shore towards James, a revolver outstretched. Jack confesses to the arson and to hitting Veronica but denies killing the dog. Jack, hearing that James shed tears over his dog, asks if he cried similarly over news reports concerning children abused by priests. James says no, he had felt detached from such stories—whereupon the enraged Jack shoots James in the side. The boy runs towards them but James shouts at him to flee. Jack says it is too late to stop, telling James to say his prayers. When James says he already has, Jack delivers a mortal shot to the priest's head.  In brief tableaux, we see the parishioners and Teresa going about their quotidian lives. The final scene ends as Fiona visits Jack in prison, each tentatively picking up a telephone handset to talk across the intervening glass panel.

She returns home, only to find out that Jeff has been cheating on her, so she returns to her old apartment. She gets drunk, and calls Sally Meister ([[Ellen Karsten]]), the head camp counselor of Elise's old camp, Camp Takota, whom she met earlier again after eight years, and tells her that she's going back to camp. The next morning, Elise wakes up realizes what she has done, and decides to head to camp anyway. Arriving with the Fefferman family, including their young daughter Penny, Elise finds that her old friends and former Takota campers, Maxine Reynolds (Mamrie Hart) and Allison Henry (Hannah Hart), now work at the camp.  As the newest camp counselor, Elise has her hands full handling the campers, as she isn’t interested in the whole camp experience. When she snaps on the campers in her class, after they find the letters Jeff has been sending her to win her back, Maxine invites her to her home with Allison later that night. Elise reveals what's been going on, with work, her ex-fiancée, and wishes that she was more like "a happier version of herself". As the three party, Elise spots Allison's acceptance letter from the Chicago Chef's Institute, then is startled by the appearance of Eli ([[Chris Riedell]]), the two girls' friend who works as a farmer. Giving her a lift back to camp, she finds that Eli had an ex-wife who cheated on him, and an attraction builds. The camp is visited by Jared Meister (John Milhiser), Sally's son, and his assistant Kyle (Jason McNichols), who want to turn Camp Takota into a more digital camp, because Takota has been losing business. Maxine soon gets confirmation from Sally that the camp will be closing after this summer, unless at least 50% of the campers pre-register for next year. She tells the news to Allison, Elise, and Chet (Cameron Britton), the camp's handyman, and they all agree to try to save the camp. However, Elise gets a call from Celia, who offers her her job back because the photos that were uploaded gave the "Midnight Moonlight" sales a huge boost, and agrees to publish her book if she arrives tomorrow morning. Elise takes up the offer, telling Maxine and Allison the news, which gets them into a heated argument because Maxine knows this isn't what Elise wants. Elise ends up revealing that Maxine is only saving the camp so she can get her promotion, and Allison got a career offer, and doesn't want Maxine to know because she is a control freak. Elise asks Eli for a ride to the train station, but he refuses because she's not just leaving Takota, she’s also leaving him, so she asks Chet for a ride. Allison talks to Maxine, revealing that she wanted to leave but was afraid of her reaction, but Maxine confesses that all she wants is for Allison to go and be happy. Elise sits at the bus station, and thinks about the camp and her friends, and soon returns.  At the camp's final day, which is also Visitor's Day for parents; Elise, Maxine, and Allison put on a dance number. Later that night, Jared reveals the plan to replace Camp Takota, to which Maxine gives a tearful explanation over why they shouldn't allow that to happen. She then introduces Eli to the campers, who is also revealed to be a writer just like Elise, and tells a ghost story to them. Suddenly, Jeff interrupts and demands Elise to come home with him, but she refuses, with Jeff fighting Eli when she reveals he is her boyfriend. Jeff leaves in shame, and the night's events lead to 60% of the campers to pre-register for the next summer the next day, thus saving the camp. With the mission a success, the three girls sit and look out in the sunset before leaving. One year later, Maxine is the new head camp counselor at Takota; Allison is now in a culinary school training to be a chef in Chicago, and Elise and Eli are together, with Elise finally achieving success with her new book, "Cabin Fever", all about Camp Takota, featuring a character resembling Penny.

The Calling (2014 film)
 [[Inspector#Canada|Inspector]] Hazel Micallef ([[Susan Sarandon]]) is a police officer in the small [[Ontario]] town of Fort Dundas. She is called to check in on elderly Delia Chandler and finds the woman nearly [[decapitate]]d in her living room. Chandler's mouth is twisted as if she is screaming. The police encounter another gruesome murder where a man's stomach has been fed to some dogs. His face was also twisted into a scream. After a third murder, the police come to believe they are dealing with a [[serial killer]].  They discover that the mouths have been positioned to form the syllables of the word "[[Libera me|Líbera]]".  Micallef consults Father Price ([[Donald Sutherland]]), a priest in the nearby Catholic church who specializes in [[Latin]]. Price explains the various meanings and uses of "libera", including a "[[Resurrection]] Prayer", which supposedly holds the power to raise the dead. He claims that Jesus was resurrected through the sacrifice of 12 willing souls. Micallef deduces that the serial killer she is pursuing is contorting his victims' faces into the 12 syllables of the Resurrection Prayer.   Micallef's deputy, Ben Wingate ([[Topher Grace]]), uses his mother's travel points to fly to [[British Columbia]] to follow a lead from the Delia Chandler killing.  He finds a woman at a trailer in the middle of the forest and learns that she is delivering gifts from "the [[wikt:disciple|disciple]]s" and begs him not to enter the trailer. Inside, Wingate discovers more packages and a body wrapped in [[formaldehyde]]-soaked bandages.   At a local coffee shop, a mysterious man ([[Christopher Heyerdahl]]) enters and chats with the waitress ([[Kristin Booth]]).  She tells him that her daughter ([[Ella Ballentine]]) has terrible seizures, and he offers to help. At her house, he brews the child some tea and appears to smother her. When Micallef later visits the waitress, she learns that the daughter nearly died from the tea she drank but that a recent [[MRI]] revealed she was symptom-free. The young girl revealed that the mysterious man's name is Simon. Micallef consults the Coroner's Reports on the local victims and realizes that they were all poisoned. She also discovers that they were all terminally ill. She deduces that Simon is gathering his victims from an on-line forum for terminal patients. She tracks down his next victim and sends Wingate to prevent the murder. Wingate is not in time; and Simon grabs him from behind, injecting Wingate with a powerful sedative.   Simon next turns up in Fr. Price's church, where they talk briefly about Simon's mission. It becomes clear that Simon is attempting to resurrect the body in his trailer and that Fr. Price will be his next victim, because he, too, is terminally ill. Fr. Price is willing to be a sacrifice, but he begins to doubt that they are doing the right thing. Wingate and Micallef arrive too late to save Fr. Price. A nun informs Micallef that Simon's real name is Peter and that he and his brother were orphans under Fr. Price's care. One of them was adopted while the other was left in the orphanage. The dead body in the trailer is Peter's brother, who had committed suicide a year earlier.   Micallef's superiors have deduced who Peter's next victim will be, and they have already secured him. Micallef resents being left off the team that will arrest Peter. She finishes off a bottle of whiskey and goes home in a stupor. Peter is waiting for her there. He drugs her and takes her to a farmhouse where he brews her some of his tea. He explains his mission to her, but she remains confused about why he would want to resurrect his brother, who did not want to live. Peter gets her to admit that the true source of her pain is the loss of her baby, and she nearly agrees to be his 12th victim. As she is about to drink the poison, she decides against it. Peter kills himself instead. The film ends with the police raiding the trailer and finding the bed empty.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier
  Two years after the Battle of New York, [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] works in [[Washington, D.C.]] for the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] under Director [[Nick Fury]], while adjusting to contemporary society. Rogers and Agent [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]] are sent with S.H.I.E.L.D.'s [[counter-terrorism]] [[S.T.R.I.K.E.]] team, led by Agent [[Crossbones (comics)|Rumlow]], to free hostages aboard a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel from [[Batroc the Leaper|Georges Batroc]] and his mercenaries. Mid-mission, Rogers discovers Romanoff has another agenda: to extract data from the ship's computers for Fury. Rogers returns to the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, to confront Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three [[Helicarrier]]s linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Unable to decrypt the data recovered by Romanoff, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official [[Alexander Pierce]] to delay the project.  On his way to rendezvous with [[Maria Hill]], Fury is ambushed by assailants led by a mysterious assassin called the [[Bucky Barnes#Winter Soldier|Winter Soldier]]. Fury escapes to Rogers' apartment, and warns Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised. Fury is gunned down by the Winter Soldier, before handing Rogers a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing data from the ship. Fury is pronounced dead during surgery, and Hill recovers the body. The next day, Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers meets with Romanoff. Using data in the flash drive, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the [[mind uploading|preserved consciousness]] of [[Arnim Zola]]. Zola reveals that ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after [[World War II]], [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] has secretly operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security. The pair narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker, and realize that Pierce is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D.  Rogers and Romanoff enlist the help of former [[United States Air Force Pararescue|USAF pararescueman]] [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], whom Rogers befriended, and acquire his powered "Falcon" [[Wingsuit flying|wingpack]]. Deducing that S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Jasper Sitwell]] is a Hydra [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], they force him to divulge that Zola developed a data-mining algorithm that can identify individuals becoming threats to Hydra. The Insight Helicarriers will sweep the globe, using satellite-guided guns to eliminate these individuals. Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson are ambushed by the Winter Soldier, who kills Sitwell. During the fight, Rogers recognizes the Winter Soldier as [[Bucky Barnes]], his childhood best friend who supposedly fell to his death on a mission, but actually was captured and experimented upon after WWII. Hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, who had faked his death, is waiting with plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips.  After the World Security Council members arrive for the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers broadcasts Hydra's plot to everyone at the Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised as one of the Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle, Fury kills Pierce. Meanwhile, Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Rogers refuses to fight the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers is thrown out into the [[Potomac River]]. The Winter Soldier rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff appears before a Senate subcommittee and Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells. Rogers and Wilson decide to find the Winter Soldier, while Rumlow, who was a [[double agent]] for Hydra, is hospitalized following the Triskelion's destruction.  In a mid-credits scene, [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]], at a Hydra lab, proclaims that the "age of miracles" has begun as scientists examine an energy-filled scepter and two test subjects: one with [[Speedster (fiction)|superhuman speed]], the other with [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic powers]]. In a [[post-credits scene]], the Winter Soldier visits a Bucky memorial at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

 The film begins with the [[September 11 attacks]] shown on television when Ali Amir ([[Peyman Moaadi]]) enters a house and begins to perform [[salah]] when he is kidnapped and taken to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], specifically [[Camp Delta]].  Eight years later, Army Private first-class Amy Cole ([[Kristen Stewart]]) is placed as a guard at Guantanamo. Upon arrival, she volunteers to the [[Initial Reaction Force|IRF]] and is cold towards the detainees, despite her contempt for the facility's handling of detainees. While on duty, Ali tries to make conversation, but Amy is annoyed by his persistence and rebuffs his advances; in return, Ali throws his feces at her and is sent to the [[Frequent flyer program (Guantanamo)|frequent flyer program]]. Corporal "Randy" Ransdell ([[Lane Garrison]]) also takes an interest in Amy, going as far as to attempt to have sex with her in a bathroom.  Amy enters Ali's cell while it is being searched and notices suicide-prevention pamphlets on the floor. She finds Ali's file, which reveals that he has a history of self-harm and discipline, becoming more and more violent as time passed. When Ali returns to his cell, he apologizes to Amy for his actions. He confides to her that he was born in [[Bremen, Germany]] and was not involved with terrorist groups, and a relationship forms between the two.  Eight months later, Ransdell lies to Amy and orders her to watch Ali shower, violating [[Standard operating procedure|SOP]] and Arabic social norms. Upon discovering that Ransdell lied, Amy files a report to her commanding officer, Colonel James Drummond ([[John Carroll Lynch]]). Drummond talks to Ransdell, who makes (unspecified) counter-accusations, and dismisses Amy's complaint because Ransdell is her superior. Both enlisted must attend boards of inquiry (not shown nor later referred to). Amy begins to become more isolated from the other guards and is reassigned to the night shift.  One night, near the end of Amy's tour at Guantanamo, Ali takes a blade hidden in his Quran and tries to commit suicide, but is talked down by Amy, who tells him her name and where she's from (also violations of SOP). At this point, it is clear that her feelings towards the detainee have softened as she is distressed by the possibility of him dying. As Amy leaves Guantanamo teary-eyed, Ali discovers the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|Harry Potter book]] he had been hoping for over two years, finding she had written a note inside saying:  "To Ali, I don't know if [[Severus Snape|Snape's]] a good guy.

Minutes later, he returns to find her missing. He reports the abduction to the police station, where Jeffrey and Nicole are assigned to the case. Cassandra's mother, Tina Lane, arrives and breaks down in a fit of fury directed at Matthew.  Eight years later, Matthew and Tina are estranged while Nicole and Jeffrey are romantically involved. Tina still provides details to the police but Matthew, initially a target of suspicion himself, has become a vigilante in the search for Cassandra. Meanwhile, the whole time, Cassandra has been held captive in the home of a [[child pornographer]] named Mika, who has installed remote cameras in the rooms where Tina works as a chambermaid. Although he leaves the house to work and is no longer sexually interested in a now-grown Cassandra, the fear that he will harm her parents prevents her from escaping. A break in the case comes when Jeffrey finds recent photos of Cassandra online. More begin to appear as Mika has her tell stories on camera, hoping they will help lure in younger children. Posing as a child, Jeffrey and Nicole succeed in tricking a child molester named Willy to reveal himself. The arrests of Willy and others in his group catapult Nicole into the public eye.

At a dinner where Nicole is being honored, Mika and a disguised woman arrive and pour a sedative into her drink. As Nicole is collapsing, the woman offers her a ride home. After getting in the car, she removes a wig revealing herself to be an accomplice of Mika's named Vicky. Mika locks Nicole in a van and tells her to speak into a microphone. Vicky travels to an area, where she asks Cassandra's former skating partner questions about their tradition of wearing mismatched skates. Matthew overhears them and becomes suspicious. He follows Vicky to a diner, where Mika is waiting for her. He calls Jeffrey with the location and says that his [[mobile phone tracking|phone's GPS]] will be placed on the suspect's car. Once inside, Matthew acts disruptive, prompting the diner staff to call the police as well. He confronts the abductors to buy more time, stealing one of their cell phones causing them to chase him after he leaves. In the ensuing chase, Vicky shoots at Matthew's truck.  After the chase concludes, Jeffrey is able to get a fix on Mika's house through the GPS tracking on Matthew's phone. A team arrives to rescue Cassandra, resulting in Vicky and Mika's deaths, leaving Nicole's whereabouts unknown. The Lane family is finally reunited. Later, a search team arrives at where the van that Nicole is trapped in is located. The movie ends with Cassandra ice skating, smiling.

Closer to God
 Dr. Victor Reed (Jeremy Childs) is a humorlessly committed biological scientist with a privately funded genetic experimental laboratory secreted away on a locked floor in a hospital. We first encounter him as he’s delivering Elizabeth, a seemingly normal infant who’s nonetheless very special as the first of her kind. Reluctantly if cryptically announcing this breakthrough to the public (he refuses to name anyone involved in the baby’s conception or birth besides himself, or to let her be seen as yet), he braves an immediate firestorm of pushy press inquiries, as well as outrage from those who believe such scientific explorations represent a grave offense against God and nature. Others note the great medical advances that cloning might help instigate, but they’re generally shouted down by the pious and appalled.  The outcry is such that government authorities are pressured to drum up criminal charges against Victor. Worried about security, he transfers the baby from the lab to his own home, a gated country estate where wife Claire (Shannon Hoppe) is already fed up with his workaholic neglect of their own “normal” family, including two preschool daughters. While she can’t help but take a maternal interest in Elizabeth, the tense atmosphere worsens as protestors and media discover the baby’s new location — as leaked by lab assistant Laura (Emily Landham), who has serious ethical and safety worries over the doctor’s treatment of his experimental progeny.  Perhaps even more perilous than the rising clamor outside, however, is a ticking time bomb within: A couple (Shelean Newman, David Alford) who work for the household are also charged with minding a murkily explained older child who is evidently the product of a less successful, earlier cloning attempt. Kept in barred quarters away from the main building (and little seen until the end), the increasingly violent, misshapen Ethan (Isaac Disney) inevitably busts out to go on a rampage, terrorizing all in the climactic reel.

But as she tries to remove the nose, it rips his flesh and wounds him. Shadow the family’s dog eats the clown nose which makes Shadow show strange behaviour towards the family. Meg also realises the clown’s wig and makeup have also become attached to Kent and are now irremovable. He goes to the hospital for his wounds where he is inadvertently made fun of by the emergency room doctor. Suddenly, Kent also begins to show strange behavior and a deep sense of hunger, with a noisy gurgling in his stomach. He eats all the food in the house, wrecking the kitchen.  Kent tries to understand what is happening to him and tracks down Herbert Karlsson, the brother of cancer treatment specialist Dr. Martin Karlsson, and the costume's previous owner. Bert tells him on the phone to avoid the costume at all costs. Kent meets with Karlsson and learns that the clown costume is actually the hair and skin of an ancient demon from Northern Europe which was long forgotten: the "Clöyne", which attracted five children to devour. Karlsson drugs Kent with tea, revealing that the only way to stop the demon is to decapitate the wearer. Karlsson lands a butcher knife in Kent's shoulder as Kent jumps up and asks what he is doing. Kent subdues Karlsson during an ensuing fight and learns that he is slowly becoming the demon.  Kent returns home and, after a series of incidents, moves away from his family and into one of his property listings, where he fights his demonic hunger and attempts to commit suicide. He shoots himself in the mouth but does not die, spattering the wall with rainbow blood, meaning that the clown suit is changing him physically and biologically. He then meets a small boy who asks him if he is a clown. He then attempts to behead himself with a pair of buzzsaws but fails, causing the same little boy to be killed instead, whom Kent later eats. Kent eventually gives in and starts to become the demon, devouring his second victim, a child who had bullied Jack earlier. Meg becomes involved, trying to understand what is afflicting Kent and to help him fight against the demon. Desperate, she joins forces with Karlsson with the intent of freeing Kent from the suit, although Karlsson is prepared to kill Kent if necessary.  Meg learns from Karlsson that freedom from the clown costume can be gained by offering the demon what it wants: five children. She also learns that many years ago, Karlsson put on the costume to entertain the children at the oncology clinic that Martin worked for and became the demon. Martin smuggled out five dying children from the cancer ward to free Herbert from the costume. Herbert has tried many ways to destroy the costume, to no avail. Karlsson also warns Meg that the curse follows any part of it, explaining how earlier the family dog Shadow had become afflicted by the curse after eating Kent's clown "nose" when Meg removes the nose; which forced Karlsson to kill it by chopping off its head.  Kent, now almost fully lost, succumbs to the demon and begins hunting more children. He sneaks into a local [[Chuck E. Cheese's]] and devours one child in a Ball Pit (hinted at the blood and urine) and another in the Jungle Gym. With four children now eaten by Kent, only one remains if he were to turn back to normal. Meg finds Kent inside the glow in the dark [[minigolf]] course. She tries to comfort him, but Karlsson attempts to decapitate him with an axe but fails. Before Kent has a chance to kill Karlsson, Meg tries to get through to her husband. Instead, the demon offers her a deal: feed it one more child, and it will release Kent. It tells her to bring the fifth child to their "special place", otherwise it will go after Jack.  A child from the dental clinic, where Meg works as a nurse, recognizes her and the girl asks for a lift home when she cannot find her parents. Meg drives her to the "special place" and locks her out of the car. She suddenly changes her mind when she thinks Kent is coming, but it turns out to be a police officer (since the Chuck E. Cheese's incident drew attention from authorities). Once Meg realizes that Kent is not there, she drives back home knowing that the demon is going after Jack.  Kent, now under complete control of the demon, sneaks into the house and kills Meg's father, Walt, by ripping off his jaw right in front of her. Kent's physical looks resemble the Clöyne. Meg fights against her husband, but Kent attempts to take both their unborn baby and Jack. After a chase inside the house, Meg is forced to knock his head off with a hammer. Thinking the creature is dead, Meg apologies to Jack for everything that has happened. However, due to a piece of muscle attached to the body and head, Kent revives, and grabs Jack's leg. Meg then forcibly pulls the head off, killing the demon and her husband. Meg looks in horror as the Clöyne skin melts away, the skin turns back to the clown suit, revealing Kent's human form. In the end, Kent's body is autopsied, while the costume is packed up to be analyzed by the police.  
Clouds of Sils Maria
 Maria Enders ([[Juliette Binoche]]) is an international film star and stage actress. She travels with a loyal young American assistant, Valentine ([[Kristen Stewart]]). Twenty years earlier, Maria got her big break when she was cast and successfully performed as a young girl "Sigrid" in both the play and film versions of ''Maloja Snake'' by Wilhelm Melchior, a Swiss playwright who is now elderly. The play centers on the tempestuous relationship between Sigrid and "Helena," a vulnerable older woman. Helena commits suicide after Sigrid takes advantage of her, and dumps her.   While traveling to Zurich to accept an award on behalf of Wilhelm, and planning to visit him at home the following day at his house in [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils Maria]] &ndash; a remote settlement in the Alps &ndash; Maria learns of his death. His widow Rosa later confides that Wilhelm had ended his life and had been terminally ill. During the awards ceremony, Maria is approached by Klaus Diesterweg, a popular theatre director. He wants to persuade her to appear on stage in ''Maloja Snake'' again, but this time in the role of Helena, the older woman.  Maria is torn and reluctantly accepts. To prepare for the role, she accepts Rosa's offer to stay at the Melchiors' house in Sils Maria. Rosa is leaving to escape her memories of Wilhelm. Maria's discussions with Valentine and their read-throughs of the play's scenes evoke uncertainty about the nature of their relationship. A young American actress, 19-year-old Jo-Ann Ellis ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]), has been chosen to interpret the role of Sigrid. Researching her on Google and the internet, Valentine tells Maria, who is out of touch with social media, that Ellis has been involved in numerous scandals.   Questions soon multiply regarding aging, time, culture and the blurring line between the Sigrid/Helena and the Valentine/Maria relationships. Maria and Jo-Ann finally meet, but their relationship is complicated. Jo-Ann appears to be implicated in the attempted suicide of the wife of her new (and married) boyfriend.   During their time at Sils Maria, Maria and Valentine spend much of their days hiking in the Alps. On a final such outing, they hike to the [[Maloja Pass]] &ndash; to observe a fascinating early morning cloud phenomenon that appears low in the pass (the "Maloja Snake" of the play's title, but also the "Clouds of Sils Maria" in the film's title). Valentine suggests that Helena may not commit suicide but simply walk away to start a new life. Maria protests that Helena walks into the mountains never to return and must therefore be dead. After suggesting that their approaches to the play are too different for her (Valentine) to be a useful assistant, a disconsolate Valentine disappears without explanation, never to reappear. After being in almost every scene of the film, her disappearance is so abrupt and so complete (she never reappears and is never mentioned again) that it appears as if the director absentmindedly forgot about her part.  Six weeks later, a young filmmaker who has previously sent a script to Maria visits her by appointment five minutes before the curtain rises on the opening night of ''Maloja Snake'' in London. Maria seems preoccupied, so near to curtain rise, and dismisses his suggested ideas about the proposed film role he is offering her as "too abstract for me". When she says the role he has written is too young for her and would suit Jo-Ann better, he suggests that the character is ageless and that he does not relate to the era we are in with its Internet scandals and trashy values. Clearly he admires her and her work. Maria does not give him a reply as to whether she will take part in the film. Then she is on stage, smoking and waiting for Sigrid.  
Closer to the Moon
 Post-war [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist Romania]]: In 1959 [[Bucharest]], members of Romania's high society Max Rosenthal ([[Mark Strong]]), Alice Bercovich ([[Vera Farmiga]]), Dumi Dorneanu ([[Tim Plester]]), Răzvan Orodel ([[Joe Armstrong (actor)|Joe Armstrong]]) and Iorgu Ristea ([[Christian McKay]]), known collectively as [[Ioanid Gang]], announce to a crowd that they are shooting a film. A young café worker, Virgil ([[Harry Lloyd]]), is among the witnesses. Under the guise of making this film, the Ioanid Gang perform a heist of the [[National Bank of Romania]]. The following day, Virgil loiters around a film set and encounters the director, Flaviu ([[Allan Corduner]]), who requests him to buy vodka and give it to him whenever he asks.  Eight months before the heist took place, Max, Dumi, Iorgu and Răzvan, heroes of the resistance during [[World War II]], celebrate New Year's Eve and the start of 1959. Max is divorcing his wife, Sonia ([[Monica Bîrlădeanu]]). Alice returns from Moscow with her and Max's son, Mirel (Marcin Walewski), in tow. She re-introduces Mirel to his father, and they begin to bond.  One night, the Gang celebrates Dumi's birthday and reminisce about their early lives as revolutionaries. For fun, they plot the heist in order to rile up anti-Communist Romania, but then realize that Max is talking their conversation seriously. He convinces Dumi, Iorgu and Răzvan to join him, but Alice says no as she has to raise Mirel. She changes her mind, however, when she learns that Mirel wants to join as the fifth person. Alice becomes enraged during the robbery when she seeing Mirel filming it. After a couple of months, Iorgu unintentionally implicates himself, and the group is individually located and arrested by Comrade Holban ([[Anton Lesser]]) and his police officers. Their arrests happen on the same day as the ''[[Luna 2]]'' landing on the [[Moon]].  One year later, Virgil is an experienced camera assistant. He is called in by his boss, who informs him of a short film about to start production. Virgil is assigned to record it. It is then revealed that the film is a propaganda piece about the Ioanid Gang's crime. The group, who have been convicted and are awaiting their execution, are ordered by the [[Securitate]] to star in the film. Later, Virgil informs Flaviu that he was present during the robbery and its danger has been greatly exaggerated by the authorities. When the Gang arrive for filming, Alice begins to bond with Virgil. When Flaviu gets drunk and passes out, Max takes over directing. While setting up a shot, he secretly gives Virgil contact details for the Gang's loved ones, requesting he contact them to let them know the group is alive and in prison. Later, Virgil makes an anonymous call to the first person on the list, and continues to do so with the help of his landlord Moritz ([[David de Keyser]]).  One night, Virgil is taken to Holban's house. Holban reveals that he knows Virgil has been doing favours for the Gang, and asks him to keep doing so in order to win their trust. He asks Virgil to find the sixth member of the group, Alice's son, as the Gang will be executed soon. During a commotion on set one day, Alice slips away. Virgil follows her to a house, where she says goodbye to her son. Afterwards, they have dinner at Virgil's house and sleep together. The next morning, Alice surrenders to the guards keeping surveillance outside, and leaves Virgil with sealed instructions. Virgil is approached by Holban and asked to write the address of Mirel, but he feigns unawareness.  Max's ex-brother-in-law ([[Darrell D'Silva]]) arrives and relieves Holban of duty due to negligence and exhaustion. Max asks him to send the Gang into space instead of executing them, but he angrily retorts that astronauts should be heroes and not traitors. Alice's letter asks Virgil to organize Mirel's [[Bar Mitzvah]], which he does. Iorgu, Dumi, Răzvan and Max are sent before the firing squad. In voiceover, Alice says that, at the last moment, her sentence was changed to life imprisonment because she had fallen [[pregnant]]. The audience is then told that Alice emigrated to Israel with Mirel and her daughter.

The officer who discovers Eileen runs from the house and vomits, but Dale re-enters the house and tells his mother that everything will be all right.  Years later in Las Vegas, Dale moves next door to married couple Sarah and Josh, who introduce themselves by taking over cookies.  Although disappointed that the cookies are not homemade, Dale accepts them anyway.  Josh explains that he is a [[croupier]] and Sarah a graduate student who is working on her dissertation on the effects of pornography.  When Sarah questions Dale as to why he is staring at her, he says that she reminds him of someone, later revealed to be his mother.  While Josh takes additional shifts at work, Sarah passes out and experiences a highly realistic dream in which she is murdered.  Confused by the fact that her clothes are different and the room cleaned, she investigates further and discovers her original shirt in the laundry, bloodied.  Josh suggests that she talk to her friend Leslie, a pregnant doctor.  Leslie, who experienced similar issues in the past, diagnoses her with [[night terrors]] and prescribes a [[hypnotic]].  Although somewhat relieved, Sarah points out that a prominent scar has disappeared, which Leslie cannot explain.  Concerned, Josh calls in a favor and surprises Sarah with a vacation at a luxurious hotel.  There, Sarah sleeps well and does not experience any of her previous symptoms.  However, when she returns home, the night terrors and unexplained blackouts return, and she now experiences nausea.  Much to her annoyance, Dale notices her when she appears ill, and he demands to know where she was.  When Dale leaves for work, Sarah investigates his house and finds photographs of various people in deathlike states, including herself.  As she discovers a replica of her house key made while Dale delivered groceries, Dale returns home and apparently kills her with a blow to the head; Sarah wakes up in her own bed, gasping, and assumes the mostly-unremembered episode was another case of night terrors.  Later, at Leslie's house, Sarah notices an unused home pregnancy test, which reveals that she is pregnant.  Leslie promises to schedule more tests for the pregnancy, blackouts, and night terrors.  Unknown to Sarah, Josh is sterile.  When he learns of her pregnancy, he immediately leaves her.

Eileen asks Sarah to kill Dale, an action she could not bring herself to do.  When Leslie gives birth, she is confused when the baby does not look like either of the possible fathers, and she recalls the video evidence of Sarah's rape, knowing that she had prior contact with Dale when he delivered her groceries, too.  Meanwhile, Josh returns home after his friend convinces him to give Sarah another chance; however, Sarah shoots and kills him when she mistakes him for Dale.  Sarah begs Dale to resurrect Josh, and, when he refuses, seduces him so that she can trick him into it.  As Josh revives, he confusedly rescues Sarah from Dale, and Sarah shoots Dale dead.  As Dale dies, all of the victims that he has murdered and revived suddenly drop dead of their previous wounds, including Sarah, Josh, and Leslie. The film ends with a close-up of Leslie's child.  
Cold in July (film)
 Ann Dane, startled by the sound of a door window breaking, wakes her husband, Richard.  He accidentally shoots the intruder, identified as Freddy Russell, a wanted felon.  Richard is shaken by the experience.  Richard visits the cemetery on the day of Freddy's burial where Freddy's father, Ben—a paroled convict—accosts Richard in his car, making a veiled reference to Richard's son, Jordan.  Alarmed, Richard picks up Jordan from school and arranges for Ann to meet them at the police station.  Though Ben follows him to his son's school, the police decline Richard's request for help.  However, when the Danes arrive home to find their front door broken in, the family is put under police protection.  Police are posted around the house, including one guard inside, hoping to catch Ben when he returns.  It turns out that Ben never left and has been hiding in the house's crawlspace since the initial break-in. He emerges and knocks out the guard, goes into Jordan's room, and locks the door. When Richard is alerted to Ben's presence inside the house by the sound of water dripping from the open crawlspace hatch, he alerts the observing police and breaks down Jordan's bedroom door.  Ben has already escaped out the window and to a nearby river, however, and is tracked to Mexico—where he is apprehended.  The police invite Richard to the station to close the case, and, while there, Richard notices a wanted poster for "Frederick Russell", who looks different from the man he shot.  Richard repeatedly attempts to point out the contradiction to officer Ray Price, but Ray dismisses this as a trick of memory due to shock and refuses to discuss the issue.  Richard sees Ben taken away in an unmarked police car, which he follows.  He sees the police forcibly remove Ben from the car, and inject him with an unknown substance, splash him with alcohol, and leave him on train tracks to die.  Richard saves Ben from an approaching train.  Ben at first does not believe Richard's claims that the man he shot was not Freddy.  The two exhume Freddy's grave and Ben confirms that the body In the coffin is not his son.  Ben notes that the man's finger tips have been cut off to prevent identification.  Ray Price visits Richard at work and claims that Freddy changed his appearance to avoid capture, explaining the discrepancy in the wanted poster. Richard is visited by Jim Bob Luke—a  private investigator known by Ben—who says the name Fred Russell is tied to several widely circulated news stories about the killing of a burglar.  Jim theorizes that after Freddy became involved with the [[Dixie Mafia]], he was caught by Federal investigators, who faked Freddy's death and placed him in Witness Protection in exchange for information.  Jim, Richard, and Ben learn that Freddy might be living in [[Houston]] under the name "Frank Miller".  When they attempt to meet him at his new home, they instead find a number of home videos which turn out to be [[snuff film]]s, one of which features Freddy Russell beating a woman to death with a baseball bat.  Richard wants to take the tape to the police.  Jim believes the police already know about the videos but are unconcerned because Freddy is far more valuable as an informant against the Dixie Mafia while the victims are illegal immigrants whom few will miss.  Ben resolves to kill his own son at any cost.  They track Freddy to a remote mansion where he and his associates are making another snuff film.  They infiltrate the mansion and begin killing everyone they encounter.  When Freddy is the last survivor, Ben hesitates to kill him, and Jim is shot.  Freddy shoots both Richard and Ben before Ben finally wounds him.  Ben declares himself as Freddy's father, shoots his son in the head, and dies from his own wounds shortly after.  Jim and Richard set the mansion ablaze and escape with the hostage.  The next morning Richard returns home to his family.

Max turns himself into the police, but when they return to the apartment, Ludlow's body is gone, and the blood is cleaned up. The police leave Max alone and confused. Jimmy confronts Max about his recent odd behavior. He tells Max that his father did the same thing before he disappeared, and that he kept this a secret from Max to protect him.  Max goes with Carmen to the apartment of Mr. Solomon, the man that Greenawalt is trying to buy out. He refuses to leave, as he has lived there for decades and even raised his daughter there. Max comes up with a plan to trick Greenawalt into giving him a large amount of money while still letting Solomon keep his home. When Greenawalt realizes she's been played, she goes to Solomon's home and threatens him with murder. She is caught on camera by a local news reporter, and she is later arrested. Max's life starts to go back to normal. Carmen goes into the shop and invites him out to dinner, which Max accepts. He later goes to Ludlow's home as Ludlow to return the watches to Macy, and he tells her that he's sorry and that she deserves better. As he leaves, he is abducted by a group of men led by the same man that stole from Ludlow's gang. They are about to drive off when their car is struck.  Max wakes up in Jimmy's barber shop. Jimmy offers him some water and a pickle, stating that pickles help with the transition from one body to another. Max asks how he knew about that, and Jimmy takes off his shoes to reveal that he is actually Abraham. The real Jimmy sends his regards from the Caribbean Islands. Both elated and angry, Max hugs his dad. Abraham brings him to the basement to show him a huge collection of shoes that he's gathered over the years. Abraham then takes Max to his limo and rides with him through the city as he starts to tell him the story of how the stitching machine came into their family's possession.

During these years, Lu continued to write to his wife as a way of communicating with her, and to convince her to forgive their daughter.

Elsewhere, aspiring [[Horror story|horror]] writer Clint substitutes at Fort Chicken Elementary, where he reunites with his former [[high school]] crush Lucy, only to discover that she is already dating physical education teacher Wade.  During Clint's class, Shelly attacks and infects her classmate Patriot after he inadvertently pulls a pigtail out of her scalp. She also claws Clint as she runs out of the room. Though she tries to escape the school by digging her way out before she fully turns, Shelly turns feral and passes the virus to another bully, Dink, who spreads it throughout the playground by scratching the majority of the children. They quickly become infected and kill several staff members along with a police officer. The few surviving staff members, consisting of Clint, Lucy, Wade, Doug, Tracy, and Rebekkah, hide in the faculty lounge but are attacked by Patriot.  After escaping to the library and joining with uninfected student Calvin, the staff barricades themselves in the music room. Wade notices Clint has been scratched by Shelly and quarantines him. Clint is only experiencing symptoms of [[Gastroenteritis|stomach flu]], and Doug deduces that the virus does not affect adults like it does children. The staff plans to wait until the parents come at the end of the day, but the first parent to arrive is killed by her child. The children charge them and the group is forced to flee, managing to rescue a teenager, Tamra, only to discover that she has also been scratched.  The staff is attacked again, and Wade kills Dink with a fire extinguisher. Doug extracts and analyzes Dink's brain, which has turned black and rotten due to the virus. He concludes that the virus is only dangerous to the [[Preadolescence|prepubescent]], which is why Clint and Tamra did not turn feral. The group unites with the school janitor, Hitachi, but Calvin passes out due to diabetic shock. The group sends Clint through the ventilation system to gather a chocolate bar for Calvin, Wade's truck keys, and their cellphones. Lucy joins Clint and they manage to secure a chocolate bar to bring Calvin out of diabetic shock. Clint and Lucy are separated from the group and get trapped in the library, where they confess their feelings for each other and kiss. Shortly after, Wade apologizes for his behavior over a walkie-talkie. Clint knocks out several children with pills and he and Lucy reconvene with Wade and the others, who utilize various tools in the school as improvised weapons. They discover a horde outside, and manage to fight their way through, although Hitachi is overwhelmed inside while Wade stays behind to ensure the others get away.  Patriot, having hidden in Wade's truck bed, attacks Clint who crushes him against a tree. The group continues to the nearby town of Danville, where they run out of gas and discover it similarly overrun. The group learns that the viral infection has spread across the country. Several children ambush them, and they barricade themselves inside a nearby building. They retrieve a contaminated chicken nugget for Doug to study, with the intent of creating a vaccination for the virus. The group continues into a playroom, filled with more children including Shelly. Wade and Hitachi arrive and help the group escape the room. Wade uses a massive beach ball to barricade the children inside while spraying them with a [[water gun]] filled with gasoline. He lights the gasoline trail and burns the building down. They escape in a van, driving out of the town to "someplace kids don't wanna go" as Shelly burns to death in pursuit.

Former [[Juvenile Court]] judge Pierre Michel ([[Jean Dujardin]]) is transferred to an organized crime unit, but finds out that la French's crimes are difficult or impossible to prove and that the police unit investigating heroin trade under Captain Aimé-Blanc has nothing relevant to report.  Following a tip given by one of Michel's informants, the heroin-addicted teenager Lily, they arrest Charles Peretti, an old Corsican chemist who formerly produced heroin for la French. After he refuses to give information about the gang and its leader, preferring to spend the rest of his life in prison rather than risk his life by collaborating with police, the gang murders Lily and her friend, Fabrizio Mandonato, Peretti's nephew.

Eager to contact his wife and return to duty, he dresses and leaves his room, finding the hospital nearly empty.  A nurse explains that most of the hospital's workers have been redirected toward a major fire in the city, which Walls assumes is the clinic bombing.  The nurse directs him to a chapel, where she says several people are gathered.  He finds Miller there with Ester, Jude, and Isaac.  Miller gives him change to contact his wife at a payphone.  After calling his wife, Walls can only speak a few words before the line goes dead.  He attempts to leave the hospital, only to find the door locked.  A security guard named Peter "Grace" Grayson offers to let Walls use the phone in his office, though the line turns out dead.  Grayson says he knew Walls' parents, but a man in a paramedic's uniform shoots Grayson before he can explain further.

Walls encounters two ghost hunters, Kris and Casey, who explain they are from 2015 and investigating the 1999 clinic bombing.  They ask Walls to discover Daniel's conspirator.  Daniel reveals he was a member of Walls' parents' congregation but broke away when they adopted a more loving and inclusive message.  Enraged at their perceived heresy, Daniel bombed their church.  As the ghost hunters flee, Walls captures Daniel and tortures him for the name of his conspirator, to Casey's shock.  Before she leaves, Walls gives his recovered glasses to Casey, who returns them to his wife, Hannah.  On the news, Hannah is relieved to see that Daniel's conspirator has finally been caught.

However, as he leaves the bar, he suffers an injury, causing him to file a lawsuit against Brent. Wanda volunteers to represent Brent, but she loses the case causing Corner Gas to be confiscated and the bar to be condemned.  Fitzy later returns with a plan to allow Wullerton to annex Dog River, which proves unpopular. Brent and Lacey then rally the town to prepare for the "Quaintest Town in Canada" contest judge, Tina Fuller, to enter Dog River, but a series of mishaps create the appearance of a riot in the middle of town. Everyone then gathers at The Ruby, where Lacey encourages everyone to financially support Brent, but Brent declines their aid due to the judgment against him. Tina sympathizes with the town's predicament and writes an article to garner public support for Dog River. The media attention forces Coff-Nuts to drop the lawsuit. Between the proceeds from Wanda's casino, Karen's tickets, and a fundraising drive by residents of Wullerton, the town is saved.  Catastrophe averted, Lacey and Brent kiss, shocking everyone at The Ruby. Oscar encourages Brent to ask Lacey out, and they reveal that they have been dating for two years. Emma rejoices at the prospect of grandchildren, but Lacey reveals that she and Brent have decided against having children.<ref name=CBC /><ref name=TorStar />

At a restaurant after their hiking trip, Josef admits to Aaron that he had taken photos of him before they had met, as he wanted to get to know Aaron before meeting him; he apologizes profusely. He also says that Aaron has an "animal in [him]", as he looked ready to kill Josef when Josef scares him. As Aaron gets ready to leave that night, Josef asks him to stay for a drink and to turn off the camera; Aaron shuts off the video, but leaves the sound on. Josef tells him he lied about Peachfuzz, and he wore the wolf mask in order to "rape" his wife to confirm his suspicions about her [[animal pornography]] habit. An unsettled Aaron drugs Josef's whiskey with Benadryl, lays him to sleep and takes his phone, which starts ringing. It is Josef's "wife", who tells Aaron that she is really just his sister, that her brother has problems and he needs to get out of the house. Aaron finds Josef gone; Josef scares him again and tells him that he doesn't want to die. Aaron attempts to leave, but Josef blocks him. Aaron charges at him, and the camera shuts off.  When the video resumes, Aaron reveals that he escaped and made it home, but soon received a DVD in the mail from Josef of him burying large trash bags in the yard; Aaron thinks it is meant as a threat. He has also been having terrible nightmares about Josef and him. Josef sends him a large box with a knife and a stuffed wolf in it, as well as another DVD with a video of Josef apologizing and saying that he really cares about Aaron. Josef now repeatedly calls Aaron "Buddy" in the videos. Aaron rips open the stuffed wolf, finding a locket with Josef's and Aaron's pictures in it, which he throws away.  After getting no help from the police, Aaron hears a trash can fall one night, and as he investigates his home, Josef appears at the front door. Days later, Josef takes the camera and films Aaron sleeping. Aaron finds another DVD labeled "My Last Video" in his house. Josef, in the video, apologizes again, revealing that he found the locket in Aaron's trash, which hurt him greatly. He claims this led to the realization that he needs help, as he is sad and needs a friend. He asks Aaron to come to the public lake by his house to talk so they could finally have "closure". His pleas move Aaron enough to compel him to go to the lake. Josef approaches him from behind, puts on the Peachfuzz mask, and swings an axe into Aaron's skull, killing him.  As a goodbye to Aaron, Josef films himself watching the murder tape, which he has already done several times before. He expresses admiration and even puzzlement at Aaron's naivety and kindness, and claims he loves him and considers him to be his favorite "of them all". He puts a DVD labeled "Aaron <3" in a cabinet full of videos and DVDs with different people's names on them, as he identifies himself as Bill over the phone while speaking to yet another person about hiring them for the same job for which he had hired Aaron.

He arrives just in time for the “opening ceremony”, a showdown between Goura Toru, the school's number one fighter, and another student. The fracas is interrupted by the arrival of Kagami Ryohei, another transfer student, whose arrogance immediately draws the ire of the crowd. Recognizing his vehicle as the town car from earlier, Kazeo confronts Ryohei, who ignores him and walks away. Before he can follow, Kazeo is attacked by another student, Wajima, whom he promptly knocks out with a single punch.  At the Doberman Bar, former mob enforcer Katagiri Ken enjoys a drink while trying to keep a low profile. He encounters Makise Takashi, whom he implores to forget they saw each other. Makise instead ropes Ken into coming to work with him at a local auto dealer. Back at Suzuran, Kazeo is approached by Ogisu Kenichi, who explains that since beating Wajima at the opening ceremony, Kazeo has been ranked as the school's number five fighter. He goes on to suggest that Kazeo might be a contender to take on Goura for the top spot, and that they should join forces. Kazeo rejects the idea, asserting that he has no interest in conquering Suzuran. Meanwhile, Ryohei begins taking on challengers, and proves to be a skilled fighter himself.  Later, at the bar, Kazeo and Kenichi get into a scrap with Shibata Hiroki, the top fighter from neighboring Kurosaki Industrial High. Back at the Nakata dealership, Ken is adjusting well to his new life as a salesman, and has become smitten with the owner, Aya. However, he soon discovers that the local mob is trying to force the shop out in order to redevelop the land. To protect Aya and the business, Ken goes to see the mob boss, Mr. Nara, who refuses to stop pursuing the Nakata property. During the meeting, Ken encounters Fujiwara, a former Kurosaki student turned mob recruit, as well Ryohei. Having known Ryohei's father from his former profession, Ken is disheartened to learn that Ryohei is now being groomed as Nara's successor.  Kazeo visits the cemetery accompanied by his mother, with whom he has a strained relationship. It is revealed that his father was a professional boxer who died due to injuries sustained during a match, and that his mother subsequently developed problems with drinking and gambling. The next day, Ken comes to Suzuran to find Ryohei but runs into Kazeo, with whom he shares stories of his youth at the school. Fujiwara is sent on behalf of the Nara Gang to harass the Nakata shop. He also begins stirring up conflict between Kurosaki and Suzuran as revenge against Shibata, with whom he holds a grudge following an incident which landed Fujiwara in prison. His plan pays off, as an enraged Goura begins attacking Kurosaki students in retaliation. Goura soon learns that Ryohei and Fujiwara are acquainted, but is stabbed by a Kurosaki student.  Shibata confronts Fujiwara, but is defeated and left with a broken arm. Ryohei and his gang begin relentless assaults at Suzuran, resulting in Kenichi being hospitalized. The injured Goura challenges Ryohei, but is also defeated, and Ryohei is named Suzuran's top fighter. Later, Fujiwara and Ryohei return to the Nakata shop to shut it down once and for all, setting fire to the building. Escaping the blaze, Ken seeks out Kazeo and begs him to stop Ryohei, for his own good. Spurred on by the escalating violence, Kazeo assembles his own force to take back the school.  Kazeo leads his gang, joined by Goura, to confront Ryohei and Fujiwara. Despite his injury, Goura singlehandedly dispatches many opponents before taking on Fujiwara himself, where he quickly loses the upper hand. As Fujiwara prepares to finish Goura, Shibata arrives. Noticing burns on Shibata’s chest that he caused, Fujiwara admits that he had deserved to have been punished for his actions; he apologizes to Shibata and retreats.

He is sent back to relive the same day, and, this time, he realises that Maylon has poisoned him.  He again objects at group therapy, saying that he is the victim, not Maylon.  In a discussion group, Julien says that he murdered his daughter and two boys, William says he murdered his parents, and Doris says she committed suicide.

The Cut (2014 film)
 The film starts by showing how life, as a blacksmith, was in the city of [[Mardin]], where Nazareth and his family used to live. Although Nazareth had his suspicions about possible effects of the World War I, and he was considering the possibility of non-Muslim minorities of the Ottoman Empire being conscripted to fight in the army, his family and friends were trying to be optimistic, although they heard stories of disappearing men from different villages. One night, Ottoman soldiers came to his door and took him to work for the army at a road construction, which is basically in the middle of an uninhabited area. While he was working there and as time passed by, he and his friends started to notice different groups of passer-by Armenians, under arrest. They even witnessed a rape. At one point, an Ottoman officer came to their camp and asked them if they would accept to convert to Islam. Some did and some did not. The officer and his fellows took the converts and left. Some soldiers and convicts, recruited solely to kill Armenians, arrived the next day to kill the rest. The convict responsible for cutting the throat of Nazareth could not go all the way with it and made only a small cut on his throat, which sufficed to cause Nazareth to faint, thereby survive the massacre. However, while saving his life, the cut also made him mute. This "cut" not only symbolizes Nazareth's becoming mute but also his being cut from his life and family and the Armenian society's silence about the Genocide at the time.  His executioner, who is an Ottoman subject, returned and took Nazareth, with whom later on Nazareth joined a gang composed of former defectors. This gang is mainly formed by Ottoman Turks, based on their clear accent, yet they were willing to take Nazareth with them, which is a sign that the ordinary people did not have any problems and the Genocide was substantially based on political will and motive. While trying to survive with the gang, Nazareth came across to an old customer from Mardin, who told Nazareth that surviving Armenians went to Raʾs al-ʿAin, which became one of several cities Nazareth visited to trace his family. When he concluded that everyone in his family had died, he was devastated and unsure about what to do. At that point, he met a soap maker from Aleppo, called Umair Nasreddin. The soap maker provided refuge to not only Nazareth but also many more Armenians, which can also be interpreted as a metaphor: bystanders to the Genocide cleansing their guilt by helping the surviving victims. It is in Aleppo that Nazareth learned that his daughters might still be alive and set out to find them first in Lebanon, then in Cuba and finally in [[Ruso, North Dakota]], United States.<ref></ref>

The Dark Horse (2014 film)
 The Dark Horse is based on the real-life story of [[Genesis Potini]], a brilliant New Zealand chess player who suffered from severe bipolar disorder. The film begins with him walking down a street in the rain, before walking into an antique store and playing a chess game with himself. He has flashbacks of being taught chess by his older brother, and eventually is taken away by police officers to a hospital because of his mental state. He is released into the care of his brother Ariki, who allows him to sleep in his son's room. Upon hearing about a chess club run by his old chess buddy Noble Keelan, he goes around to his house early in the morning to ask to join.  He is told he can only do so if he promises to not "rock the boat." Genesis meets the Eastern Nights Chess club in a shed where he learns that they only have one chess board, and the kids aren't particularly motivated. He introduces himself and discloses that he wants to lead them to the Junior National Championships in [[Auckland]], something Noble is initially frustrated with Genesis about. Mana, Ariki's son, followed him to the club, and it is revealed that he will be [[Gang patch|patched]] into his father's Gang, the Vagrants, on his birthday. He is given over to Mutt to harden him up. Ariki, believing that Genesis could interfere with this process asks him to leave. Genesis begins sleeping on the monument on [[Kaiti Hill]], and leading meetings at the Chess club, now held at the marae with new chess sets. Mana, though initially hostile towards Genesis begins to see him more regularly, and joins the chess club. Mana reveals that he has been abused and urinated on by Mutt as part of his gang initiation. He also has a V tattooed on his face.   The mother of one of the members of Eastern Knights finds out that Genesis is homeless, and refuses to let her son participate, sending him into another mental breakdown. Sandy allows him to sleep at a friends house, and they all prepare to go to Auckland for the championship. Mana realizes he can't come as it is on the day that he'll be patched, and leaves angrily. Genesis attempts to reason with Ariki, but he refuses to let Mana leave. On the day they leave for Auckland, Genesis stops at the monument to pick up a distraught Mana, and says that Ariki has allowed him to come. They go to Auckland, and all the members of Eastern Knights lose their games apart from Michael and Mana. That night, Mana reveals that he knows Genesis lies about him having permission to come, but that Mana knows his father is dying. He ends up losing his match the next day, but Michael goes on to compete in the final. Genesis repeatedly calls out during the final, and has to be sent outside, but Michael ends up winning the final. Ariki arrives shortly after, and punches Genesis before he yells at Mana to get in the car. The Eastern Knights travel back to Gisborne, and Genesis is visibly upset. He goes over to his brother's to find his nephew, who is unconscious with a black eye. It is revealed that he has just been patched, and Mutt begins beating Genesis, but is stopped by Ariki. Genesis removes Mana's jacket, and they walk out together, being followed and verbally abused by Mutt. Other members of the Gang begin beating Mutt, and Genesis and Mana leave. The closing montage reveals that the Eastern Knights chess club is still being run, and that Genesis passed away in 2011. <ref></ref>

Dark Was the Night (film)
 In the forest near the small isolated town of Maiden Woods a team of loggers goes inexplicably missing. Unable to contact them the Foreman goes searching for them, finding only a logger's severed arm. He is then violently killed in his truck by an unseen creature.  Later in town Sheriff Paul Shields and his new deputy Donny Saunders from New York speak to farmer Ron who insists one of his valuable horses has been stolen, though without evidence of theft it is assumed the horse merely escaped through an open gate. Paul then leaves to pick up his son Adam from his wife Susan who no longer lives with him after the accidental death of their other son, Tim. That night Adam sees a creature in the back yard and when Paul investigates he hears but does not see a large creature in the trees.  The next morning Paul finds large footprints in the snow around his house that appear to come from an animal with [[Hoof|hooves]] that walks on two legs. Donny informs him the footprints are around everybody's houses in the entire town. Paul and Donny follow the footprints into the woods where they also find large claw marks on the trees where the footprints disappear. After hearing from [[Park rangers]] that no known animal with hooves could walk such a distance on two legs Paul assumes the whole thing is a prank. Paul later hears from the town priest that his dog and a lot of other animals have gone missing. Paul then goes to a local store where Ron's daughter Clair and several hunters confront him with their fears about old [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] stories of creatures living in the woods, though Paul dismisses this. Earl, another hunter informs Paul that even though it is hunting season all the deer and other forest animals have all disappeared, meaning a large new predator may be in the area.  As Paul drives Adam home they both see a very large creature in the back yard but when Paul investigates all he finds is a bridle up a tree he confirms is from Ron's missing horse. The next day Paul and Susan meet Adam's teacher to talk about how Adam is not dealing with his brother's death, during which Susan becomes angry and upset. Paul meets Donny where they both witness a very large flock of birds in the sky flying South when they should be flying north. Susan tells Donny how Paul was watching their son Tim when he fell, hit his head and died and how he still blames himself even though she doesn't. That night Paul is called to Ron's farm where he sees the creature attempt to enter the horses stables before it flees, leaving behind more footprints showing the hoof is split into 3 sections, even though most cloven hoofed animals only have 2. That night Paul discovers a dead deer that had been mauled in the road but before he can move it the creature suddenly appears and takes the body with it. Donny wonders if it is not simply a forest predator that had not yet been discovered, similar to large fish species thought to be extinct that actually still exist deep in the ocean.  The next day three hunters are attacked by the creature in the woods. Two are killed and one makes it back to town. The bodies of the two dead hunters are later found hidden high in the trees. Paul bans any more hunters from entering the forest and orders everybody in town to stay indoors at night. He also reports the two deaths and calls in 2 dozen park rangers to hunt and kill the creature within 24 hours. That night a heavy snow storm hits the surrounding area and most of the town evacuates. Paul theorizes that the creature had been pushed from its territory by the logging company and is looking for a new home and sees humans as a threat. One of the hunters shows Paul film footage of a large creature walking on two legs. As the storm gets worse the creature breaks into Paul's house, where Paul barricades himself and Adam in the bathroom until the arrival of Donny scares it away.  Paul gathers everybody who did not evacuate into the church, saying it is the safest place for everybody to stay until the park rangers arrive in the morning to hunt and kill the creature. However, the creature attacks the church and Susan manages to motivate Paul into forgiving himself for Tim's death. As the creature breaks into the church Paul leads everybody into the church's basement storm shelter. He tasks the hunters to guard the door then takes Donny to kill the creature.  As they follow the creature through the church Paul and Donny split up. Donny is attacked in the kitchen but manages to shoot the creature with his shotgun. Paul follows the creature only to be attacked and drop his rifle. He flees back into the main hall and hides beneath the pews. However, the creature finds him and he shoots it with his pistol before it disappears. Paul realises it can climb as it suddenly drops down from the ceiling. As it rushes towards him Paul shoots it once again but drops his pistol as it overpowers him. He instead draws his hunting knife and stabs the creature to death.  Returning to the basement Paul tells everybody the creature is dead and leads them back into the church. However, as Donny examines the creature's body he realises he had shot it in the shoulder with his shotgun, yet the wound was suspiciously missing. Paul and Donny suddenly realise there is more than one creature in the church, and outside dozens of creatures are seen swarming over the church roof. One creature lunges at the camera and the screen goes black. <ref name=Collider></ref><ref name=Deadline2></ref>  
Darr @ the Mall
 Asia's largest mall "Amity Mall" is ready for inauguration, although there is controversy surrounding the recent deaths of construction workers and the mall staff, leading the media to label the mall as haunted. Vishnu ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) is mysteriously recommended for the job of chief security officer on the eve of the inaugural party.  On the night of the party, the owner of the mall Mr. Manchanda ([[Arif Zakaria]]) and his associate, Mr. Khan ([[Asif Basra]]), children of Mr. Manchanda, Ahana ([[Nushrat Bharucha]]) and Naveed along with their friends are also at the party. One by one, a ghostly apparition targets the teenagers and mall investors. Meanwhile, Vishnu slowly uncovers clues about the identity of the ghost.  As the party ends, Mr. Manchanda, Mr. Khan, their children and Vishnu along with the mall's event manager find themselves locked inside after all the guests have gone home. The six of them struggle to stay alive as the ghost continues its killing spree.  Through a flashback the ghost of a child reveals to Vishnu, that the mall was built over what used to be an orphanage, that burned to the ground two decades ago. Vishnu’s connection to the killings is that he was one of the orphans living with the nun and other children at the orphanage.  Mr. Manchanda and Mr. Khan tried to get the nun to sell the orphanage, but when she refused, they had the orphanage burnt down. Vishnu (known as Arjun as a child), managed to escape but due to an injury he lost his memory of what transpired.  The horrific smokey apparition is the ghost of the nun who kills all those involved in the crime. The ghosts of the dead children play their part in the killings as they simultaneously warn, befuddle and scare the people within the mall killing not only those involved but guiltless people as well.  After the nun kills Mr. Manchanda, she also attempts to kill Ahana, till Vishnu begs the nun to stop as she has already killed the men responsible. The movie ends with the nun sparing Ahana and she and Vishnu are shown walking out of the mall.  
The Dark Valley
 The film opens with a scene of a scared young man and woman hiding in the basement of a wooden building. Footsteps are heard from above, and then several men find them, severely assaulting the man and then dragging them both away as the woman screams. Time passes.   A young stranger rides into a remote town somewhere in the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] [[Alps]]. Having introduced himself as a photographer, Mr&nbsp;Greider, he becomes the lodger of a widow whose husband and son suffered an untimely death. Soon the newcomer learns that the entire town is firmly under the dominion of an aged rich man named Old Brenner and his six power-drunk sons. One day the widow sends her daughter to town to run some errands. Greider is invited, and decides to accompany young Luzi. As Luzi does her shopping, Greider asks for coffee and horseshoe nails. The brothers discover him at her side within the store, and command him to drink their [[schnapps]]. When he politely refuses by stating that he "doesn't drink," one of the brothers beats him into compliance. Later, one of the Brenner brothers dies in what looks like a freak logging accident. Soon this same fate befalls another of the brothers; he falls off a cliff having been blinded by a branch with nails on it. Old Brenner finds nails in his dead son's eyes. Since Greider is suspected to have had his hand in these accidents, he hides. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the Brenner brothers walk in the footsteps of their father. At every local wedding they claim the medieval prerogative of [[Primae noctis]]; only Greider's parents (the young couple shown at the opening of the film) had refused to comply. For that defiance, the Brenners crucified Greider's father, but his mother managed to escape and find refuge in America. The local priest still supports what the Brenners do. Greider confronts the priest in private, revealing that he's come to crack down on the Brenners. He admits that he did kill the two Brenner sons. After telling the priest that he's next to die, Greider shoots him.  Greider rescues Luzi from the grasp of the Brenners after she marries Lukas and is abducted. Greider challenges them to a [[duel]] on the next day. Rather than waiting for the appointed duel, the brothers try to ambush Greider at the remote mountain cabin where he is holed up. At dawn they come after him, attacking all together. A shootout ensues. Greider is outnumbered four-to-one, but he has the advantage of a [[Winchester Repeating Arms Company|Winchester]] lever-action [[repeating rifle]], while the Brenners all wield two shot side-by-side and [[Breech-loading weapon|breechloading]] rifles, and are unfamiliar with a repeating rifle. Skillfully leveraging this edge, Greider kills or leaves for dead the remaining four brothers. He then seeks to deliver the message of their deaths to their father, but discovers that some citizens of the town remain loyal to Brenner senior. As Greider approaches Brenner's home he is attacked by the blacksmith, a hulking giant brandishing a large iron log hook. Lukas manages to save Greider by shooting the blacksmith, but not before the hook finds its way through Grieder's shoulder. After the fight, Greider storms Old Brenner's house and finds him in his bed. Greider gives Old Brenner a picture of his mother, explaining the reason for killing Old Brenner's sons and now him. Old Brenner reveals to Greider that he is Greider's father (a product of his mother's rape by Brenner on her wedding night) and so therefore he has murdered his own half-brothers. Brenner asks him "to make it quick" and Greider obliges by shooting him in the heart. Greider recovers for three weeks from his wounds. In the meantime the various families that live on the valley ask to punish Greider. Many families have relatives to Old Brenner due to his ways. Greider leaves the valley, never to return.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes
  Ten years after the pandemic of the deadly [[Rise of the Planet of the Apes|ALZ-113 virus]], later called Simian Flu, the worldwide human population was drastically reduced, with only about one in five hundred genetically immune to the virus. Meanwhile, the apes, under the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Caesar|Caesar]], all bestowed with [[genetic engineering|genetically]] [[intelligence amplification|enhanced intelligence]] by the virus, have long established a colony in the [[Muir Woods National Monument|Muir Woods]] near San Francisco.  One day, a group of humans led by a man named Malcolm enter the apes' territory from San Francisco in search of a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dam]] that would restore power to the city. An encounter by Caesar's son Blue Eyes and his friend Ash leads to the latter's injury by a man named Carver. Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation while Caesar orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, a scarred [[bonobo]] who holds a grudge against humans for his mistreatment as a test subject, Caesar brings his army to the humans' community at an unfinished tower as a display of strength. Caesar announces his intent to fight the humans if forced to while demanding the humans to stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces his fellow leader Dreyfus to give him time to take a small team to the forest and reconcile with the apes so they can access the dam. He meets with Caesar, who allows them to work on the generator on the condition that they surrender their guns. As Malcolm, his wife Ellie, and son Alexander work, they bond with the apes. The fragile bonding is greatly helped when Ellie, a nurse, effectively treats Cornelia's illness.  Meanwhile, Dreyfus arms his community using the [[Fort Point, San Francisco|Fort Point]] [[Arsenal|armory]]. Koba discovers the armory and confronts Caesar of this, but accuses him of loving humans more than apes. Caesar beats Koba in response but refrains from killing him. Koba later returns to the armory and takes an [[assault rifle]], killing two guards and then Carver as the humans succeed in repairing the generator and restoring power to the city. Koba takes advantage of their celebration to covertly set fire to the apes' home. He then shoots Caesar, who falls into the underbrush below, and frames the humans for Caesar's apparent death in order to wage war. Koba quickly takes command and leads the apes into San Francisco, where they plunder the armory and mount an assault on the tower. The apes breach the building and imprison the humans as Dreyfus flees underground. When Ash refuses Koba's orders to kill unarmed humans, citing Caesar's teachings, Koba throws the ape to his death and has any other ape loyal to Caesar imprisoned.  Malcolm's family finds Caesar barely alive and transports him to his former house in San Francisco. Caesar reveals that Koba shot him and confesses that apes can be as corrupt and violent as humans. When Malcolm sneaks into the settlement to find medical supplies for Caesar, he encounters Blue Eyes, who spares him before learning that his father is still alive and that it was Koba who shot him, not the humans. After reconciling with Caesar, Blue Eyes returns to the tower and frees the imprisoned humans and apes. Malcolm escorts the apes into the tower, and then finds Dreyfus. He learns that the return of electricity allowed Dreyfus' men to make radio contact with survivors at a military base, who are now coming to fight the apes. Caesar confronts Koba at the top of the tower; as they fight, Dreyfus detonates [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] charges that destabilize the tower in a failed attempt to kill the apes, at the cost of his own life. Koba starts shooting at the apes, but Caesar tackles him off a ledge. While clinging on a metal girder, Koba is rejected as an ape by Caesar and dropped to his death.  Malcolm and Caesar acknowledge their friendship, with Malcolm warning of the approaching human military. Caesar responds that the humans will never forgive the apes for their attack and convinces Malcolm to leave with his family. He then stands before a kneeling mass of apes, [[War for the Planet of the Apes|preparing for war]].  
Dead Snow: Red vs. Dead
 [[Dead Snow|Previously]], Martin and his friends draw the ire of Nazi zombies after unwittingly taking their gold.  When Martin is bitten on the arm, he removes the infected arm with a chainsaw.  After returning their gold to the Nazi zombies, Martin realizes he forgot a coin.  The zombies chase after him, and their commander, Herzog, tenaciously holds on to Martin's car as he flees.  An oncoming truck slices off Herzog's arm, which remains in the car with Martin.  After Martin passes out at the wheel and is involved in an accident, he wakes in a hospital.  The police disbelieve his wild stories about zombies and charge him with the murder of his friends.  To his horror, Martin finds that a surgeon has attached Herzog's arm to his stump.  The zombie arm goes berserk and attacks everyone within reach.  After Martin kills several people against his will, he is sedated and strapped tightly to the bed. In the meantime, Herzog has his lost arm replaced and begins to conscript more zombie troops by resurrecting freshly killed locals.  Bobby, a young American tourist, sneaks into Martin's room when he hears rumors of a zombie attack. Impressed with Martin's zombie arm, Bobby frees Martin and tells him about the Zombie Squad, American professional zombie hunters.  Before Bobby can contact them, the zombie arm throws Bobby out a window. Panicked, Martin follows and administers CPR, but the zombie arm instead crushes Bobby's chest, killing him.  Martin flees the police, who believe him a child killer, and makes contact with the Zombie Squad - who turn out to be three nerdy friends: Daniel, Monica, and Blake - who promise to come to Norway and assist. In the meantime, they ask Martin to find out what Herzog wants.  At a World War II museum, Martin meets Glenn Kenneth, the souvenir shop's clerk. After the zombie arm intimidates him, Glenn tells Martin about Herzog's history: Herzog was originally tasked by Hitler himself to wipe out [[Talvik, Norway|Talvik]] for their anti-Nazi sabotage. As Martin realizes Herzog intends to carry out his orders, Herzog and his Nazi zombies attack a group of tourists outside, and following the slaughter, Herzog has his troops arm themselves with old weapons from the museum, including a World War II-era [[Tiger I|Tiger]] tank. Martin and Glenn escape death by pretending to be mannequins in the museum. While surveying the carnage, Martin accidentally discovers that his zombie arm can also raise and control the dead. When Daniel arrives, he kills the zombie Martin has resurrected; Martin demonstrates his newfound power by raising it again.  Martin, Daniel, and the sidekick zombie race to find the burial ground of a group of Russian POWs, who had been executed by Herzog during the war, as Monica, Blake, and Glenn work to slow down Herzog.  Monica and Blake convince Glenn to act as bait to draw some of the zombies into a local swamp, where they kill them with pipe bombs they made from the supplies they had.  After shooting at them with the tank gun several times, Herzog continues on his way, believing Blake, Glenn and Monica to be dead.  Meanwhile, the others discover the graveyard, and Martin raises an entire troop of loyal Russian zombies. All converge at the town, where Martin confronts Herzog. Martin points out that they have evacuated the townspeople and thus prevented Herzog from completing his orders, but Herzog does not care and attacks them.  The battle goes well at first, but the Nazi zombies eventually overpower Martin's Russian zombies after Herzog kills the Russian Commander, Lt Stavarin. As the Nazi zombies close in on them, Daniel tells Martin to kill Herzog, as it is their only chance. Daniel attempts to take control of the Nazi zombie's tank, Martin directly confronts Herzog, and the others fight Herzog's remaining zombies. Glenn is killed by a sneaky knife attack to the throat by a Nazi zombie, and Monica and Blake are about to be overwhelmed when Daniel fires the tank gun directly at Herzog while Martin keeps him distracted. Herzog is decapitated, and the head goes far off into the further away mountains; his troops fall lifelessly to the ground, saving Monica and Blake.  After they have celebrated, and having been exonerated from the murder charges after the police also witnessed the zombie battle, Martin drives to the church where Hanna is buried, digs up her corpse, and brings her back as a zombie. The two proceed to make out and have sex as the sidekick zombie looks on in the distance. In a [[post-credits scene]], a Nazi scientist zombie recovers Herzog's still-conscious head.  
Dawn at Midnight
 Between 1982-1992, during Lebanon’s civil war, 96 foreign hostages of 21 national origins—mostly American and western European—were kidnapped in Lebanon. While most were released, at least 9 were murdered or died in captivity. After many failed attempts by various groups or governments to free the hostages, the U.N., Iran and Israel finally came to the negotiating table to free the remaining hostages.   ''Dawn at Midnight'' recounts the story of the Lebanese Hostage Crisis and looks at the bigger context: the civil war leading up to the kidnappings, the reason for the kidnappings (the rise of the [[Hezbollah]]), the negotiations by the U.N to free the last of the hostages, and finally Hezbollah’s entry into Syria in 2013.  The film was inspired by Robert Fisk's book ''Pity The Nation'', ''Hostage'' by Con Coughlin, and ''Man without a gun'' by Giandomenico Picco.  
The Dead Lands
 Tane, the chief of a [[Māori people|Maori]] tribe, his 15-year-old son Hongi and their tribe allow a rival clan access to the remains of the second tribe's fallen warriors. Hongi does not trust the rival clan's leader, Wirepa, and follows him. As Hongi suspected, the visit is a ruse, and Wirepa desecrates the grave site as a pretext for war, blaming Hongi for disturbing the remains. Tane believes his son is innocent, but offers to kill Hongi if it will prevent war. Wirepa refuses, saying war is imminent. Wirepa's clan returns later in force, kills the men of the tribe and beheads Tane, taking his head as a trophy. Hongi is knocked away from the battle, and survives.   Hongi leaves and attempts to track down Wirepa. On the way, he discovers that Wirepa and his men have entered the Dead Lands, an area where any men who venture into are believed to be killed by a monster. Hongi, suspecting that the monster is in fact a man, tracks him down and, although reluctant, the monster agrees to help Hongi hunt down Wirepa. The monster is in fact a warrior (who is never named in the film) who was the sole survivor of a tribe that used to occupy the Dead Lands, and he kills anyone who ventures there to prevent his tribe's historic lands from being occupied.   While tracking down Wirepa, Hongi has a series of visions of his long dead grandmother, who helps them on their way. Hongi and the warrior track down Wirepa, and several of his men are killed before Wirepa and his surviving warriors flee. Hongi and the warrior go after them, and the warrior kills a small band of hunters they come across to keep his identity a secret. Hongi is devastated by this, and screams at the warrior. The two separate, but the warrior has a vision from his ancestors that convinces him to continue helping Hongi.   Wirepa and his men are tracked to a mountaintop fort, where they barricade themselves inside. Wirepa taunts Hongi with his fathers head, angering him, but the warrior convinces him to regroup and return later. Wirepa's men leave Tane's head on a spike, and most of the men leave the fort. Again, this is a ruse by Wirepa to lure Hongi in. However, when the trap is sprung, the warrior and Hongi get the upper hand and kill most of Wirepa's men. While Hongi battles Wirepa, the warrior is severely wounded but manages to return and save Hongi. Wirepa, distracted from his battle with Hongi, beats the warrior to the ground before returning his attention to Hongi. This time Hongi gains the upper hand, and is about to kill Wirepa. This pleases Wirepa, because it will allow him to be remembered as a great warrior who died in battle about whom songs will be sung, and stories will be told. Hongi denies Wirepa this honor, spares his life and makes him swear to leave his land, and allows him to leave. Defeated and alone, Wirepa walks off in shame.   Hongi returns to the warrior, who is mortally wounded. Hongi adopts the warrior into his clan, so that his ancestors will guide the warrior into the afterlife. The film ends with a final vision of Hongi's grandmother, who is very pleased, as Hongi begins his return home.  
Dead Within
 After a [[Zombie#Zombie_apocalypse|zombie apocalypse]], Mike and Kim reinforce their cabin in the woods.  Whenever their supplies run out, Mike leaves to scavenge.  Though Kim wishes to come with him, he insists that she stay behind in the cabin, where she is safe.  Mike, who keeps a running tally of the zombies that he destroys, uses a rhythmic series of knocks based on classic rock songs in order to identify himself and prove that he has not become infected.  Symptoms of infection include black irises, black blood, and violent paranoia.  As the supplies in the area become exhausted, Mike suggests that they return to hunting for their food.  Kim refuses, and flashbacks reveal that a second couple, Todd and Erika, lived with them until Todd and Erika ate tainted meat.  Mike and Kim are forced to kill both the couple and their own baby, who also ate the tainted food.  While Mike is out on a scavenging trip, Kim receives a call on her walkie-talkie from a man identifying himself as Ranger Mark.  Mark is at first helpful and promises to aid her, but his calls become more abusive and misogynistic over time.  Kim does not tell Mike about the calls.  After an unproductive outing, Mike says that the area has become too dangerous for the meager supplies that he is able to find, and he proposes that they move to the coast, where they can live in a mansion and safely run a generator.  Kim agrees and asks to accompany Mike, but he again refuses.  Kim is left alone for a longer period this time, as Mike must locate enough resources to last them the entire trip.  While he is gone, she experiences a series of nightmares and hallucinations, including hauntings by Erika and her baby, Ranger Mark's taunting her over their deaths, and paintings that seemingly come to life.  When Mike finally returns, he gets the coded knock incorrect.  After Kim sees blood and cuts on him, she becomes suspicious and does not allow him entry.  Mike insists that he is not infected and demands to be let inside, but Kim only becomes more distrustful and resentful of his past behavior.  Desperate for shelter, Mike attempts to break into the cabin, and Kim cuts off several of his fingers.  When Mike recovers, he finds that she has tied him to a chair and is debating what to do with him.  Kim becomes convinced that Mike is infected despite his protestations, and she kills him.  Excited that she may now leave the cabin, she dances in the yard.  Mike's reanimated corpse attacks her, and she kills him once again.  In the last shot, her irises and blood are revealed to have turned pitch black.  
Dawn of the Dragon Racers
  The short film opens up about three years before the events of the sequel and after the events of the second season, where Hiccup and Snotlout compete and practice catching sheep for the annual Dragon Race, the new and official dragon sport event on Berk. Afterwards, Tuffnut has just finished his new creepy-looking face paint which shocks Astrid, Hiccup and Toothless. Tuffnut says that at least his doesn't look like a target, mocking the new pattern Fishlegs has applied; Fishlegs explains that it's actually the Ingerman family crest.  Snotlout arrives cheering that his new Sheep Launcher finally worked, which Astrid points out that it took him thirty-two tries to get it right. It then cuts to a sequence of sheep launches, which makes it seem that the sheep, wearing a helmet that Snotlout put on it, is invulnerable to pain as it lands on several different locations. Snotlout decides that the sheep launcher is ready for the Dragon Race. Astrid complains and asks since when did he get to make such a decision; Snotlout states it's because he created the sport. Hiccup and Astrid quickly deny that claim, saying that's not how they remember it. Astrid tries to recall the events of how and who invented Dragon Racing.  It cuts to a flashback, shortly after the events of the second season where the Riders are still in their early teens. Berk is getting ready for the traditional annual boat race called the Regatta which starts in a few days, when suddenly a herd of sheep run throughout the village, causing minor trouble. Hiccup asks Gobber what's happening, and Gobber explains that after Silent (now dubbed Not So Silent) Sven broke his silence, his sheep ran out of their pens because they're afraid of his new voice. Stoick and Gobber struggle to gather the sheep, so Stoick orders Hiccup and the gang to round up the sheep as he gets ready for the Regatta; if he has to hear Sven scream any more, he'll put a hook through his own head just to end the torture.  While in the process of catching the sheep, the Riders end up turning it in to an impromptu competition against each other in getting as many sheep as possible; they all arrive back at the pen and discover they all got three sheep each. Astrid points out that there is no winner in this 'competition'. Sven then cries out, alarmed that his prized black sheep is still missing and hoping that it didn't fall down the well again. At the mention of this, the Riders declare the black sheep as a tiebreaker. Hiccup states that it isn't a competition, but it falls on deaf ears: with the exception of Fishlegs, the others have already taken off. Moments later, Snotlout and Hiccup both spot the sheep, and they race towards it head on. Just as Hiccup is about to grab the sheep in his clutches, Gobber blocks his path and they collide, allowing Snotlout to claim the black sheep. Hiccup asks Gobber what's so urgent, and as he tries to remember Stoick calls Hiccup to come meet him, which was what Gobber was about to inform Hiccup about.  Stoick is preparing to set sail down at the docks, and informs Hiccup that he will be gone for several days to get wood from Loki Island: the lumber is lighter and stronger than any other wood they know of, and building their Regatta ship with it will be their secret weapon. He appoints Hiccup to oversee the preparations for the Regatta in his place, which Hiccup isn't excited to hear about due to the fact that he sees boats slowly moving across the harbor to be 'boring'. Stoick justifies that the Regatta is tradition and claims that it is a good way to 'blow off steam'; if Vikings aren't fighting against any enemies they need to fight against each other in competition, illustrated by two Vikings on the next dock over whacking each other with fish. Just as Stoick leaves, Fishlegs creeps in on Hiccup, saying that he is happy for Hiccup, as he considers being in charge of the Regatta as an honor. Fishlegs then helps Meatlug board a ship covered in a big cloth, which is hiding what he is working on. Fishlegs considers himself to be a sailor at heart and is excited that he is now finally old enough to compete; he and Meatlug will be working on their ship until the Regatta.  Meanwhile at the Academy, Tuffnut is plotting out some rules for the Riders' sheep competition, but is interrupted as Hiccup arrives reluctantly prohibiting them to carry on with their plan as he has Stoick's strict orders to prepare for the Regatta. The next day, Hiccup discovers that the Riders' have disobeyed his order and have carried on the sheep catching. Down below, the villagers are enjoying the Riders' sheep catching competition and say that it is much better than the Regatta. Later, the villagers gather at the Great Hall, growing restless for entertainment and they want to see the Dragon Race again. Hiccup has Toothless quiet down the crowd, then tries to regain their enthusiasm for the Regatta but is unsuccessful.  Inspired by the twins, the crowd wants another Dragon Race. Astrid then says to Hiccup that Stoick isn't going to be back for a few days and points out that the Dragon Race is also great way to blow off steam. Seeing no other option, Hiccup agrees to have one Dragon Race. As Hiccup points out the starting location of the race, Snotlout and the Twins suggest they should have teams. Snotlout says the teams are already decided, with Snotlout and the twins on one team and Astrid, Hiccup and Fishlegs on the other. The twins then mention their team name, 'Snotnuts'. Hiccup and Astrid then go to get Fishlegs, but after mocking the name 'Snotnuts' he declines joining the race as he and First Mate Meatlug are still too busy getting ready for the Regatta, refusing to back down on his family tradition.  The race starts as Gothi drops the flag signalling the start of the race. They all immediately set off, and a Viking signals Sven to release the sheep. Early in the race, Hiccup manages to get one sheep but the Twins manage to get two. Meanwhile, Astrid and Snotlout both spot one sheep and race head on to get it first, and both of them are relentless to turn around only until Snotlout backs off, fearing collision, allowing Astrid to get the sheep. Late in the race the scores are tallied and the teams are all tied up. As soon as that is stated by Mulch, the Riders head of to get the black sheep as it is the tiebreaker. Both Hiccup and the Twins fail to capture the sheep, and shortly after Astrid and Snotlout spot the black sheep creating another head on race. Just as the two Riders are seconds away from the black sheep, it faints, unexpectedly becoming a static target.  Shortly thereafter, Astrid and Snotlout collide as neither of them backed out, and this causes Astrid's arm to be injured. Snotlout flies off to go get Gothi, but he is still thinking about the game and he grabs the black sheep. Snotlout then runs into a branch and is knocked off Hookfang; the sheep safely lands on top of him. Sometime later at the Great Hall, the uneventful Dragon Race causes the villagers to demand another Dragon Race, but Hiccup tells the villagers the deal was only one Dragon Race and then on to the Regatta. The villagers however are unsatisfied with that and continue to shout for another Dragon Race. Suddenly Snotlout announces that Hiccup is right, but mocks him by saying that it's not like he will beat team Snotnuts anyway.  Astrid wants to back up Hiccup, but she is still injured and cannot take the risk. Snotlout points out that there's no rematch anyway as Hiccup has no team mate, but Hiccup is still determined to continue the Race, so he once again asks Fishlegs to join his team. At first Fishlegs refuses as he is putting the finishing touches on his ship. After he unveils the small ship with a flourish, Toothless can't help but laugh at the decorations. Fishlegs slowly sails out to sea with Meatlug, but Meatlug quickly begins to feel sea sick and vomits lava, causing the ship to immediately sink. Fishlegs quickly changes his mind about accepting the offer.  They both head off to the Academy where the competition is about to start. Just as the flag is about to be dropped, Stoick is suddenly heard screaming Hiccup's name: he has returned earlier than expected. Stoick appears to be in shock to see that this is not the Regatta he'd expected. Hiccup explains that he sometimes has to make difficult choices for the good of the people, and one of those difficult choices is replacing the traditional Regatta event with Dragon Racing. Stoick asks if he did this all by himself, and Hiccup, seeing the other riders awkwardly looking away, has no choice but to agree. Instead of punishing Hiccup for contradicting his order, Stoick allows him to proceed with the event but only if they do it right. Both teams put on face paint, with green paint for team Snotnuts, and red paint for team 'Hicclegs' (which Fishlegs came up with). Stoick explains that it gives the competitors and the game a warrior's feel to it.  Stoick announces to the crowd around the academy the start of the first annual Berk Dragon Race and explains that each white sheep is worth one point, while the Black Sheep is worth five. To make sure no cheating happens (looking particularly at the twins), Stoick appoints Astrid as the referee. Stoick then proclaims that the team who wins the race will have their portrait hung in the Great Hall, and a feast thrown in their honor. Gothi drops the flag and the race is started.  Snotlout quickly manages to grab one sheep, while Hiccup grabs one as well, and the Twins grab two and boast about it to Hiccup. But Fishlegs arrives bringing two sheep. Both teams drop off their sheep at the Academy. Hiccup spots a sheep placed on a raft out on the water, but Snotlout arrives to grab it. Hiccup quickly sets Toothless' tail to boost their speed and is able to snatch the sheep before Snotlout does. Meanwhile, the twins attempt to cheat by stealing sheep that are not Silent Sven's to quickly double their points, but Astrid arrives before they can grab any. Tuffnut protests that "not cheating is not trying"; Astrid has Stormfly drive them off.  Meanwhile, Fishlegs and Hiccup spot a sheep on a mountain and Fishlegs attempts to grab it, but it jumps down causing it to slide down the side. It falls into a crevasse, but luckily Hiccup and Toothless were already there to rescue it. When it is proclaimed by Astrid that the teams are all tied up, Stoick announces that whoever finds the black sheep wins. The Twins quietly talk to each other about putting their 'Super Secret Plan' into action. Fishlegs then has an idea where the black sheep might be, recalling what Sven said earlier about the black sheep always falling into the well. Fishlegs volunteers to go down the well and look for it, while Hiccup waits overhead. The Twins then fly by with the black sheep which shocks Hiccup.  This causes team Snotnuts to win the race, and Snotlout cheers excitiedly over his teams' victory. Although disappointed, Hiccup applauds with the crowd. Hiccup congratulates Snotlout, who gloats about it and mocks Hiccup. But just as they are about to take their victory, Fishlegs arrives with the real black sheep, confusing everybody. Sven tells Stoick that there is only one black sheep and Team Snotnuts claims that they have it. Tuffnut then nuzzles the sheep's side with his face and reveals that they had cheated, by painting a regular sheep with black paint. A reversal is announced by Astrid, swapping the victory from Team Snotnuts to Team Hiclegs, making them the first official champions in Dragon Racing. The event closes when Toothless shoots three plasma blasts overhead, dazzling the crowd. Then Stoick finally relieves Hiccup from being the 'acting chief' and Hiccup quickly sets off before his father can change his mind.  The flashback ends and it goes back to the present time, with Hiccup concluding that it technically was Tuffnut who invented Dragon Racing (because he was the one came up with the concepts of the rules) humiliating the three of them, especially Snotlout, who is deeply depressed. Hiccup tries to cheer up Snotlout by saying that he played a part in it, and that the cheating was all him. As Snotlout happily claims that he did cheat, the Twins interrupt that Snotlout actually did not know what they were doing, and knew nothing about the secret plan. When Hiccup just tells them that they should say that they all invented Dragon Racing the Twins reluctantly accept, but Tuffnut still claims that Snotlout did nothing. Furious, Snotlout launches a sheep at Tuffnut, and points out that at least he invented the Sheep Launcher. Then a horn is heard, signalling that it is time for the Dragon Race and all the Riders quickly set off to start.  Having gone from being Dragon Riders to Dragon Racers, thanks to them a new generation of Berk's traditional events was born.

Death Do Us Part
  A disheveled woman in a bridal gown is found stumbling along a highway, and is brought to a ranger station. As they wait for the sheriff, the only on-duty ranger asks the woman her name, and what happened to her. The bride refers to herself as Kennedy, and the film flashes back to the previous day, to when Kennedy, her fiancé Ryan, Kennedy's half-sister Hannah, their friend Emily, Ryan's cousin Derrick, and Ryan's friend Chet travelled to a secluded cabin for a [[Stag and doe]] party.  As the characters set up at the cabin, it is revealed that almost all of them have a dark secret; Kennedy's unspecified mental illness is flaring up due to wedding-related stress, Ryan is having an affair with Hannah, Derrick intends to extort Kennedy through Ryan in order to get the money he owes a drug dealer, and the caretaker, Bo, is the prime suspect in the disappearance of his wife, Susan. That night, while everyone else is participating in a [[scavenger hunt]], Derrick is murdered with an axe. Upon noticing that Derrick is missing, the others go to look for him, and become separated, with Kennedy and Ryan finding Derrick's corpse, and Emily presumably being murdered after she, Chet, and Hannah encounter Bo, who has the axe that was used to kill Derrick. The remaining partiers regroup at the cabin, and discover that the power has been cut, the vehicle has been sabotaged, and that all of the cellular phones have been thrown into the stove. Chet then goes missing, Bo is found dying from a head wound, and Hannah is knifed by someone wearing a burlap sack as a mask. Kennedy stumbles onto Emily and Chet's bodies, and then Hannah's, which Ryan is with. Thinking Ryan is the killer, Kennedy attacks him, and runs off.  At dawn, Ryan returns to the cabin, where he and Kennedy fight, ending with Kennedy stabbing Ryan to death after Ryan spitefully declares that he never loved her. Kennedy then goes into hysterics, puts on her wedding dress, and runs into Emily, who claims that she had only been injured, and had faked being dead. The two women begin to walk to safety, until Emily lets slip information that only the killer could know. Kennedy confronts Emily, who asserts that she slew Derrick and Hannah, and had intended to murder Ryan, to protect her, with Chet and Bo being collateral damage. Kennedy snaps, and strangles Emily.  The film returns to the intro, and the bride lifts her veil to reveal that she is Emily, who had recovered, bludgeoned Kennedy, and taken her gown. The ranger offers his condolences for all that "Kennedy" has gone through, and when he gives Emily a pen to write down who he should contact for her, she stabs him in the neck with it, and walks out into the woods, leaving her fate unknown.

Death in Buenos Aires
 Inspector Chávez ([[Demián Bichir]]), a detective on the Buenos Aires police force, and his partner Dolores ([[:es:Mónica Antonópulos|Mónica Antonópulos]]) are called one summer night to the [[Recoleta, Buenos Aires|Recoleta]] residence of Jaime Figueroa Alcorta (Martín Wullich), a wealthy older gay member of Buenos Aires high society. At the scene, Chávez meets the young officer Gómez ([[:es:Chino Darín|Chino Darín]]), who says that he found Alcorta's body after investigating a noise complaint and who has been examining the dead man's possessions. The next day, the two men encounter each other in the police station restroom, where Gómez shows Chávez a matchbook from the gay nightclub Manila that he accidentally took from the crime scene.  Dolores and Chávez head to Manila in search of "Kevin," a lover of Alcorta who had left a message on the victim's answering machine. Chávez watches a flamboyant performance of a song he remembers from a record at the victim's apartment. He is approached by Gómez, claiming that he has also come to the club to investigate. Chávez angrily confronts Gómez, believing that the young man is following him, but accidentally starts a bar fight in the process, allowing the singer Kevin (Carlos Casella) to escape in the melee.  Gómez joins Chávez on the homicide investigation, and they hatch a plan for Gómez to go undercover, using the younger man's good looks to get closer to Kevin. Gómez goes on a number of dates with Kevin, leading him to believe that Kevin is innocent. Meanwhile, Chávez, who is stuck in a passionless marriage, finds himself increasingly drawn to Gómez, though he does not acknowledge or act on his attraction. Chávez tries to call off the plan, thinking that Gómez is growing too fond of the suspect and questioning Gómez's sexuality; Gómez retorts by wondering if Chávez is becoming jealous. Later, Kevin takes Gómez to a room at Manila and they begin to have sex, but they are interrupted by Chávez and Dolores, who have been watching via hidden camera. Kevin is arrested and taken into custody.  Chávez goes to interrogate the incarcerated Kevin, who convinces Chávez to release him from prison temporarily. Kevin shows Chávez a herd of horses that he claims the Alcorta family use for drug smuggling. Gómez arrives on the scene and fatally shoots Kevin as he attempts to escape on horseback. Chávez again confronts Gómez, who claims that he was only trying to protect Chávez and that Kevin invented the smuggling story. When Gómez attempts to pull Chávez in for a kiss, Chávez reacts with a mixture of anger and desire, holding Gómez at gunpoint and forcing him against his car. Chávez begins to unbuckle his belt, but is interrupted by the arrival of police backup.  The city's criminal justice system moves to close the investigation under pressure from the Alcorta family. However, Chávez discovers that the horses were surgically implanted with drugs, matching Kevin's story.  Chávez now believes that Gómez killed Jaime Figueroa Alcorta on behalf of the Alcorta family, who were angered by the dead man's opposition to the smuggling business. When Chávez confronts Gómez with his hypothesis, Gómez pleads innocence, and Chávez's paranoia reaches an extreme when he draws his gun on two policemen. Realizing his mistake, Chávez exclaims that he is going insane. Gómez comforts Chávez and begins to kiss him. After initially pulling back, Chávez returns the kiss passionately, but is soon stopped by a gunshot to the stomach, confirming his suspicions about Gómez. As he sinks to the ground, Gómez tells him that he will miss him. Gómez throws his gun into the river, smokes a cigarette, and walks off into the night.  
Dedh Ishqiya
 Khaalujaan "uncle dear" ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) and his nephew Babban ([[Arshad Warsi]]), a thief duo, pose as a [[Nawab]] and his attendant, and manage to run away with a prized necklace from a jewellery shop. During the police chase, they get separated; Babban escapes, while Khalujaan is injured. Months later, Babban traces Khalujan, again posing as a nawab, this time at a poetry contest. It is a ''[[mushaira]]'' (gathering of poets) organised by Begum Para ([[Madhuri Dixit]]), the widowed Begum of Majidabad, supposedly in compliance with the wishes of her deceased husband. The winner of the poetry contest will win the widowed Begum as his bride, and become the Nawab of Majidabad.  Babban traces Khalujaan on the opening night of the contest. There is another adventurous rascal in the fray, a local MLA-gangster named Jaan Mohammed ([[Vijay Raaz]]), who is making the poet Nawab Italwi ([[Manoj Pahwa]]) write poetry for him to recite at the contest. The contest proceeds; while Khalujaan has his heart set on Begum Para herself, Babban falls in love with her maid, Muniya ([[Huma Qureshi (actress)|Huma Qureshi]]). Khalujaan tries to impress the Begum by giving her the prized necklace which he had stolen earlier, but on the final day, Begum declares Jaan Mohammed to be the victor. She declares that she will marry him and then he will become the new nawab of Majidabad.  Since the necklace has clearly failed to move the Begum, Khaalujaan decides to see if a gun will serve the purpose better. However, even as he approaches the Begum brandishing his chosen instrument of persuasion, he finds the dowager being hustled away at gunpoint by a masked man. Khalujaan chases them and blocks their way only to discover that the masked man is none other than his nephew Babban. It turns out that the Begum had plotted her own kidnapping in order to extort money from the nawab-elect (Jaan Mohammad). More twists are then revealed: the Begum was nothing but a dancing-girl (courtesan) who had seduced a middle-aged nawab and married him, only to find that the nawab was actually a pauper who supported his lavish way of life by selling his inherited properties and jewels. He also neglected his wife, who (it is very strongly suggested) developed a relationship of intimacy with a sympathetic maid-servant, Muniya. By the time the nawab died of good living, he had become completely bankrupt and even his palace had been mortgaged to the money-lenders. After his death, the penniless Begum had been helped financially and courted by Jaan Mohammad, a local rich man who was besotted with her and wanted to marry her. He also wanted the title and status of being the "Nawab of Majidabad", which according to the movie would be conferred on the man who marries the widowed Begum.  However, Jaan Mohammad was a man of low birth and uncultured mannerisms, a former street-thug, turned businessman, turned politician, who even employed a bunch of beefy goons to promote his business and political interests. The idea of marrying such a man was repellent to the Begum, who was anyway in love with her maid-servant. It was also socially unacceptable, which is what the Begum tells Jaan Mohammad. It is he who comes up with the idea of holding a contest. The birth and breeding of the man who wins the contest will be irrelevant; the begum can say that she had no choice but the marry the winner. Thus, the ''mushiara'' itself is an elaborate hoax: the late nawab had never stipulated that his widow should marry someone else, much less that the winner should be recognized as "nawab of Majidabad." It was the Begum's own idea, the purpose being to snare a rich man and marry him. The Begum did not want to marry Jaan Mohammad, but she wanted his money, therefore she was staging a kidnapping in order to receive a ransom from Jaan Mohammad. She has employed Babban to act as her kidnapper and extort a hefty ransom from Jaan Mohammad, who was expected to pay up because otherwise he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a Nawab.  Babban duly phones Jaan Mohammed (who is by now aware of the Begum's cunning plan) to bring a ransom of 10 crore (100 million) rupees in cash to the railway station. All four of them (Begum, maid, and the uncle-nephew duo) reach the railway station to collect the money, but find that they are surrounded by Jaan Mohammad's goons and henchmen. To their good fortune, Nawab Italwi arrives with a police force and cross-firing starts (it turns out that Nawab Italwi also is not what he seems to be; he is a policeman in disguise). Begum and Muniya escape from the situation leaving behind Babban and Khalujaan to be arrested. Two months later, the uncle-nephew duo get bail and, as they leave the jail, they are given a letter from Begum and Muniya. It is a cheeky letter of thanks and goodbye from the women, informing the men that they have sold the priceless necklace and used the proceeds to buy a house and settle down in a faraway town whose name they withhold. Uncle and nephew are now exactly at the same situation where they were at the start of all these shenanigans—the movie ends with the duo once again surrounded by Mushtaq ([[Salman Shahid]]) and his gang of rowdy vagrants.

Deliver Us from Evil (2014 film)
 The film opens in a 2010 firefight in a palm grove in the [[Diyala_Governorate|Diyala Province]] of [[Iraq]]. Three [[US Marine Corps|Marines]] discover an underground cavern and start to scream as their helmet video feed goes black. In [[The Bronx]] in 2013, veteran [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] officer, [[Ralph Sarchie]], stands over the corpse of an infant in a darkened alley. He and his partner, Butler, resume their nocturnal patrol for the 46th Precinct. A domestic disturbance call comes in over the radio. Sarchie probes the dispatcher for more information and finds out that the male at the address is a former [[United_States_Marine_Corps|Marine]]. He tells Butler that his "radar" is going off because maybe the former Marine still thinks he is fighting in [[2003_invasion_of_Iraq|the war]].  At the site of the complaint, Sarchie and Butler encounter the shirtless and heavily tattooed former Marine, Jimmy Tratner, who insists his wife is okay. When his wife lifts her head, the officers see that she has been badly beaten. They notice deep scratch marks on the floor and are wary of a dog as they make the arrest. Jimmy resists them ferociously, eventually drawing a knife on Butler and fleeing the house on foot. Sarchie catches up to Jimmy and makes the arrest; although, not without suffering a sizable wound to his forearm that will require stitches. The officers notice that Jimmy's fingernails are cracked and bleeding, and they assume that he is mentally ill or high on drugs.  Sarchie and Butler are called to the [[Bronx Zoo]] after a woman has thrown her toddler into the moat surrounding the lion enclosure. They find the woman in a [[lemur]] pen. She is furiously scraping at the ground, and after they apprehend her, she rapidly recites the lyrics to "[[Break On Through (To the Other Side)]]". Sarchie notices a painter inside the lion enclosure. He enters the pen to interrogate the mysterious man, but he is attacked by the lions and barely escapes.  When the deranged woman, Jane Crenna, is transferred from the precinct to a mental health facility, a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, Mendoza, arrives at the family's request. He asks the officers several pointed questions about Jane's behavior at the zoo. When another domestic disturbance call comes in, Sarchie notices the complaint makes reference to doors and decides that he and Butler will respond. At the house, the family of three have been staying in the living room after a series of strange disturbances. There is one area of the house where light bulbs instantly burn out and candles will not remain lit.  The family explain that there were two painters working the basement, where most of the disturbances occurred. In the basement, Sarchie discovers the badly decomposing body of one of the painters, David Griggs. At Griggs' apartment, which is overrun by cockroaches and refuse, they find business cards for Alphonsus Painting company as well as a picture of Griggs with Jane Crenna and the child that she threw at the zoo. In another picture, Griggs is pictured in his Marine uniform with Jimmy Tratner and a third Marine, Santino. They realize Santino must have been the painter at the zoo.  Mendoza visits Sarchie at the precinct and asks to view the surveillance tapes of Jane at the zoo. He believes that Jane is possessed by demons, and he explains that there is secondary evil created by humans and primary evil which comes from demons. Sarchie is skeptical, but when he reviews the surveillance footage with Butler, he hears strange noises and sees things that Butler does not. Sarchie returns to Jimmy Tratner's house and finds a wall that was being painted in Jimmy's home office. He scrapes away the paint to find a [[pictograph]] of an owl. At Sarchie's home, his daughter lies in bed as a stuffed owl stares ominously at her from a shelf in her bedroom. She is awakened by strange noises and frightened.  Back at Tratner's home, Sarchie has scraped off the paint from the rest of the wall to find a bizarre mix of Latin and ancient pictographs. Sarchie finds some hard drives with footage from Tratner's deployments and watches the full footage from the palm grove in Diyala. In the cave, the soldiers found a carving of the same message that is on the wall in Tratner's home. Sarchie revisits the basement where he found Griggs' body, scrapes off the paint from a wall, and finds the message again. He reviews the zoo surveillance footage and sees the same message was being painted over by Santino in the lion enclosure. With Mendoza, he visits Jane Crenna in the mental hospital and shows her the message from the cave. She savagely bites Sarchie's already wounded forearm.  Mendoza decodes the message as a kind of bridge between [[Christian theology|Christian]] and [[Paganism|pagan theology]] which would theoretically allow [[demon]]s a door to the human world. He explains that certain people are more susceptible to such messages than others. He suggests that the voices and images Sarchie is seeing could be a result of his intuitive "radar", which means that he is also susceptible to the archaic message. Mendoza and Sarchie gradually share more of their personal histories with each other. Mendoza goes with Sarchie and Butler to an apartment building where they are attacked by Santino and Jimmy Tratner. Tratner is subdued by Mendoza's cross. Santino overwhelms and eventually kills Butler.  At Sarchie's home, his daughter is once again awoken during the night. Her stuffed owl rolls off the shelf and advances towards her bed. As she runs screaming from the room, she sees Santino in the hallway. Sarchie arrives home to find Santino in his living room. Santino warns that he has abducted Sarchie's wife and daughter. Santino is brought to the precinct where Mendoza and Sarchie perform an [[exorcism]] on him. Sarchie's wife and daughter are located in an Alphonsus Painting van at a storage facility. The film ends with the baptism of the Sarchies' second child.

Devil's Due (film)
 A young couple, Zach and Samantha McCall, are about to get married when Zach decides he wants to document their life together since Sam was raised in foster homes and doesn't know much about her history or roots. After their wedding, they go to the [[Dominican Republic]] for their honeymoon. During Carnival, the couple meet a fortune teller (DeMaris Gordon), who declares Sam was "born from death" and repeats to Sam that "they have been waiting" for her. Creeped out, the couple quickly leave. On their way out, a strange man watches them.  They get lost on the way home and a cab driver (Roger Payano) offers to take them to a local club. There are numerous strange symbols marking the area on their way there. At the club, the same man from the fortune teller's watches them and speaks with the cab driver. Unaware they are being trapped, the couple is drugged and taken to an underground chamber beneath the nightclub where a ritual is performed and an unseen force fills the room.  The next morning, Zach and Sam wake in their hotel with no memory of the previous night.      A couple of weeks after the honeymoon, Sam discovers she is pregnant despite claiming to have taken birth control pills "religiously" ever since the wedding. Though shocked, Zach and Samantha are overjoyed and tell their family and friends the news. The couple later attend their first ultrasound scan where the doctor says that the baby looks healthy and Sam is due by the end of March. At that moment, the ultrasound screen goes static but recovers after a moment.  Throughout the course of her pregnancy, Sam begins to experience nosebleeds, stomach bruising, cravings for raw meat (despite being a vegetarian), superhuman strength, telekinetic abilities and unexplained feelings of rage whenever she or the baby appear to be threatened. Also, Zach and Sam keep seeing odd-looking people watching them from afar. Sam becomes convinced something is seriously wrong with the baby and that they are being watched. After a second visit to the doctor, a new doctor (Robert Aberdeen) appears and performs an [[Amniocentesis|amnio]] after Sam appears nauseous. He has no answer as to the whereabouts of their original doctor and the couple is suspicious.  Before the couple return home, masked men set up hidden cameras inside their home to monitor her progress and make sure she does not hurt the baby.  When Sam is eight months pregnant, the couple attend a [[holy communion]] at their church. Their usually friendly niece ([[Madison Wolfe]]) is oddly scared of Sam now, and the priest ([[Sam Anderson]]) who officiated Zach and Sam's wedding looks at Sam during the service and violently coughs up blood. Later at home, when Zach is reviewing the communion footage he filmed, he sees the mysterious cab driver from their honeymoon sitting in a pew. He visits the priest in the hospital, who explains the symbol is related to summoning the [[Antichrist]]. He warns Zach that the symbol is the gateway for the Antichrist, and that the followers of the cult will dress the house in ash to prepare for the arrival. After he finds ash all over his house (and the cops will not do anything), Zach chases the people watching their house and finds out where they are living. He asks his sister, Suzie to stay with Sam while he breaks into the supposedly abandoned house at the end of his street where the cult is staying, and there he finds the [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] footage of his house and the missing ultrasound. He is almost caught by the cult when he goes to leave. Performing the ritual with the other cult members is the McCall's mysterious second doctor, as well as the man who has been watching their house and the cult leader (who they initially saw at the fortune teller's place and later at the club). Zach barely manages to escape.  Meanwhile, Suzie goes to check Sam, only to find that she is drawing the cult symbol before being attacked by unseen force.  Upon returning home, Zach finds the house surrounded by the masked men who have been watching them all along. Inside, he finds Suzie dead and hears Sam scream as the house is being destroyed by some unseen force. He finds Sam in the baby's nursery standing in a trance-like state with a knife to her stomach (the knife was a mysterious gift at her baby shower). She is standing atop the cult symbol that she has carved into the floor. Zach screams for her to stop, but she presses the knife to her stomach anyway and there is a violent blast of light. When Zach recovers, he finds Sam lying in her own blood with her stomach cut. Sam cries and wonders if the baby is all right before dying in his arms. Zach breaks down in grief before the cab driver and the second doctor arrive. Zach begs the intruders to leave them alone, but the doctor takes the baby regardless. The baby glows a deep red as he takes it from Sam's body. The cult takes his camera and tapes, removing all evidence. Zach is arrested and interrogated by the police about the death of his wife and sister, and disappearance of his child, crimes for which he looks guilty.  Before the credits, the screen shows another young couple, on their honeymoon in [[Paris]], where the same cab driver offers them a lift, hinting that the events are about to repeat all over again.

While they are there, a sniper shoots at one of the guests, Hiroaki Fujinami, from a nearby building. Conan, having observed the possible suspect, pursues the suspect with Masumi Sera joining later. The suspect blows up [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police|police]] patrol cars during the escape and despite the [[FBI]]'s attempt to follow the suspect, the suspect jumps away to the [[Tokyo Bay]]. Tokyo Metropolitan Police and FBI later concludes that Timothy Hunter, an ex-[[Navy SEALS]] and former recipient of [[Silver Star]] decoration is a possible suspect. The FBI believes Hunter also attempted to murder two former American military officers, Jack Waltz and Bill Murphy, and another Japanese civilian, Hitoshi Moriyama.  FBI investigation revealed that Hunter may have been supplied equipment from either Scott Grean, Kevin Yoshino or Mark Spencer, all of which are former American military officials in Japan. While the investigation is ongoing, Moriyama was sniped from great lengths, and Hunter was killed. Media speculation spread news that the recent sniping may be a random spree, creating public chaos. The same night, Murphy who was in [[Nikkō, Tochigi|Nikkō]] with Waltz was asked to come to Tokyo by letter apparently written by Mark Spencer. In an attempt to stop Murphy's assassination on the train, Conan attempted to block line of culprit's sight only to be in line of culprit itself. Sera injured herself while attempting to push Conan out of sight and was taken to hospital while Murphy were eventually killed.  Fearing for his own safety and also being asked by the American military officials in Japan to end the case quietly, Jack Waltz attempted to murder the culprit in the entire case. Unbeknownst to Waltz, Waltz himself is the last target of the culprit, Kevin Yoshino. Yoshino is Hunter's student and the two help crafted the plan to revenge against Waltz and Murphy for attempting to assassinate Hunter during the Middle East operation to ensure that Hunter will not receive the Silver Star decorations. Hunter survived the attempted murder but is severely wounded and discharged from the Navy, only to face misfortune from Fujinami and Moriyama. Conan, who happened to realize that Waltz is about to be murdered, push Waltz away, causing Yoshino who is sniping from Bell Tree Tower to switch target. While under fire, a mysterious sniper [[Subaru Okiya]] shot to Yoshino, causing Yoshino to shock as the range of fire is greatly excesses his ability or Hunter's. Yoshino take cover in the observation deck of Bell Tree Tower and took Ayumi hostage. While Yoshino is fighting with FBI, Okiya attempted to take down Yoshino from afar, but being blocked from clear line of sight and lack of lighting to guide the target. Conan, having realized Okiya's plan, kicked the ball from his position which exploded into fireworks, causing night vision Yoshino is wearing to blind and Okiya is able to shoot and disable Yoshino's weapon, making way for Ran and FBI to take him to custody. Okiya later answered call by James Black, the chief of FBI team in Japan, with [[Shuichi Akai (Case Closed)|Shuichi Akai]]'s voice.

Green interviews Dekker at his house, who claims that he has seen many monsters and identified some of them through sketches. Dekker mentions his son once but diverts from the topic when Green inquires. The shooting crew of Green and his cameraman wait at the Marrow's entrance; a dug-up hole in the cemetery in the woods. On the first night they do not see anything although Dekker keeps claiming that he could see one of the monsters.   Next time they do capture a footage of a monster for a brief time interval, but there is a disbelief as to whether it is a [[hoax]] setup by Dekker.

Waterhouse takes a necklace off one of the bodies and they dump the two corpses into the water. Waterhouse then holds Proctor at gunpoint and demands he get rid of his badge, telling Proctor that he's no longer fit to be sheriff. Proctor throws his badge over the cliff.  In the 1970s, Jacqueline Mathers, called Jake, and her brother Sean head to the quarry. Sean insists she get over her fear of jumping into the water below and offers to jump with her. Sean jumps but Jake becomes scared and lets go of Sean's hand at the last second. Jake watches as her brother plunges into the water below but doesn't resurface. In a panic, she runs for help, tripping along the way and gashing her forehead, which leaves a large scar. Deputy Freeman informs Waterhouse, now the sheriff, that his grandson has drowned in the quarry.   Jake suffers from survivor's remorse and falls into depression. A boy at school named Willie Proctor, the grandson of the old sheriff, has a crush on her and draws her pictures, much to the disapproval of his grandfather. Some months later, Jake's parents tell her they're going to have a baby which upsets Jake. The next day, Jake runs into three gypsy brothers led by Wyeth. Wyeth tells her he has the power to bring her brother back but someone will have to die in his place. The brothers take her back to their cabin on Proctor's property and make a blood oath with Jake - they'll bring her brother back if she pushes Willie Proctor over the quarry edge. She agrees. When she returns home after dark, her parents question her about where she's been. She tells them three men took her to their cabin. Waterhouse takes Jake to the cabin and asks Jake to identify the three brothers but, remembering her oath, Jake says she's never seen them before.  Jake convinces Willie to follow her to the quarry. She's about to push him over but is filled with guilt and decides not to. Jake's mother attempts to make Jake feel better by taking her to dinner where Jake is confronted by Wyeth. Jake says she won't kill someone. Wyeth tells Jake that her grandfather has something of his and he wants it back. Jake finds her mother crying, having seen a boy who reminded her of Sean. Jake goes to her grandfather's house and steals the necklace he's been hiding.  The next day, Wyeth and his brothers confront Jake's mother at her home. She becomes frightened and blood begins to pour from between her legs. Later, Waterhouse is told by the doctor that his daughter will live but the baby can't be saved. Filled with remorse, Jake brings the necklace to Wyeth who tells her she can only bring Sean back if she sacrifices Willie. He puts the necklace around her neck. Waterhouse arrests the three gypsy brothers and takes them to jail. A desperate Jake convinces Willie to follow her to the quarry one more time. Meanwhile, haunted by memories, a drunken Proctor begins to douse the gypsy's cabin with alcohol. Waterhouse goes to the jail to find Deputy Freeman with his throat cut and the brothers escaped. An enraged Waterhouse drives to the cabin only to be shot by Proctor. Waterhouse shoots back and they both lie dying as the brothers return home. Wyeth tells Waterhouse that he's about to have his revenge.   In a series of flashbacks we see the events that led to the opening scene. A younger Sheriff Proctor witnesses the gypsy family, living on his property, engaging in strange rituals. He threatens the mother with arrest unless she pays him. When she says they have no money, he sexually assaults her. Deputy Waterhouse sees Wyeth and his frightened brothers, then only children, outside. Waterhouse finds Proctor raping the boys' mother. Proctor returns to the cabin with food only to be confronted by the husband who beats him and runs him off. Proctor returns with Waterhouse and kills the father. As Waterhouse protests, the mother shoots at the two policemen. Waterhouse shoots back and fatally wounds her. Proctor shoots the father in the head and aims at Wyeth before Waterhouse stops him. Wyeth kneels over his mother, who whispers something to him before dying. Waterhouse and Proctor then take the two bodies to the quarry.  Back in the 1970s, Wyeth tells Waterhouse that he knows Jake is about to push Willie into the quarry, setting herself up for a lifetime of pain and regret. Waterhouse says he knows she won't do it. Waterhouse asks if he knows the old saying about revenge - "Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.” Waterhouse then throws his lit cigar onto the alcohol-soaked floor which sets the cabin aflame, killing the brothers, Proctor, and himself in the process.  Jake struggles to push Willie. When she realizes that Wyeth only said "someone" had to die, Jake jumps herself and lands in the water. She sees the figure of her brother below her. Sean swims up to her and pulls the necklace from around her neck before disappearing into the depths. Jake hears Willie calling to her from above as she swims back to the surface.

Disciples (film)
   
Divergent (film)
  In a futuristic [[dystopia]]n Chicago, society is divided into five [[Factions (Divergent)|factions]]: Abnegation (the selfless), Amity (the peaceful), Candor (the honest), Dauntless (the brave) and Erudite (the intelligent). The remaining population are the Factionless. At the age of 16, they undergo a [[Human serum albumin]]-induced psychological aptitude test which indicates their best-suited faction, though they are allowed to choose any faction as their permanent group at the subsequent Choosing Ceremony.  Beatrice Prior (Shailene Woodley) was born into Abnegation, which runs the government. Her father, Andrew Prior ([[Tony Goldwyn]]), serves on the ruling council along with the head of Abnegation, Marcus Eaton ([[Ray Stevenson (actor)|Ray Stevenson]]). Beatrice takes her test with a Dauntless woman named Tori Wu ([[Maggie Q]]) as her [[proctor]]. Her results show the rare quality of equal attributes of multiple factions, meaning she is Divergent. Her divergence includes Abnegation, Erudite, and Dauntless. Tori records her results as Abnegation and warns her to keep the true result a secret, saying that because Divergent can think independently the government cannot control them and they are considered threats to the existing social order.  The next day at the Choosing Ceremony, Beatrice's brother Caleb Prior ([[Ansel Elgort]]) chooses Erudite. After some indecision, Beatrice defects to Dauntless. These choices draw attention to Caleb and Beatrice as most Abnegation choose to stay in their faction. After the ceremony, Beatrice meets Christina ([[Zoë Kravitz]]), Al ([[Christian Madsen]]), and Will ([[Ben Lloyd-Hughes]]), three other initiates from other factions who also chose Dauntless. Christina and Al are from Candor, and Will is from Erudite. The initiates' commitment and fearlessness are immediately tested, and Eric Coulter ([[Jai Courtney]]), a brutal Dauntless leader, makes it clear that anyone not meeting Dauntless' high expectations will be expelled from the faction to become Factionless. Beatrice is the first to volunteer for a leap of faith from a tall building into a dark hole, landing in a net. When Four ([[Theo James]]), a transfer initiates' instructor, asks her name, she shortens it to "Tris" leaving her Abnegation childhood behind.  Tris initially struggles in Dauntless training, ranking far below the cutoff after the first evaluation, but with Four's help slowly improves. Eric matches her against her nemesis;— Peter ([[Miles Teller]]) in a fight. Tris is soundly defeated and wakes up in the infirmary. Informed that she will miss the most important test, Capture The Flag, Tris leaves the infirmary and joins the other initiates, secures her team's victory, and makes the final cut.  In the next phase of training, the initiates face their worst fears in psychological simulations. Divergent are resistant to serums and simulations, so Tris excels at these tests, solving them in peculiar ways, but Four warns her to solve the challenges as a normal Dauntless would in order to hide her abilities.  Tris visits Caleb.  She tells him that Erudite is planning to overthrow Abnegation and become the ruling faction. He doesn't believe her.  On her return to Dauntless quarters, Tris is attacked by Al, Peter, and Drew before being rescued by Four. The next day Al pleads for Tris' forgiveness but she refuses, calling him a coward. He later kills himself by jumping into "The Chasm" rather than live with the shame.  To prepare her for the final test, Four takes Tris into his own fear simulations, where she learns that he was Tobias Eaton, the son of Marcus Eaton (her father's colleague). After the simulation, they kiss. Tris then passes her test and is officially initiated into Dauntless. The Dauntless, including Tris and Four, are injected by Dauntless leadership with a serum supplied by Erudite which is supposedly for tracking, but is actually for mind control.  The next morning, the Dauntless prepare to execute Abnegations by the orders of the Erudite and the Dauntless leadership working with them. Divergents are unaffected by the mind control serum. When the mind controlled Dauntless army are preparing for Abnegation execution, a confused Divergent reveals himself by asking everyone what is happening and is shot immediately by Eric. Witnessing this Tris blends in with the army to avoid suspicion. On the train, she carefully makes her way next to Four. She stands next to him and after a few seconds he reveals himself as a Divergent to Tris for the first time by holding her hand and she is relieved. While the Dauntless move to raid Abnegation, Tris and Four separate from the group and attempt to locate Tris' parents. Eric is suspicious of Four and tests him by pointing his gun at Four. Tris breaks their cover and points her gun at Eric. Their identities as Divergents are revealed to the Dauntless leaders and they both get captured. Four is taken into custody while Tris is ordered to be executed. Her mother Natalie ([[Ashley Judd]]) appears and liberates her. Tris now knows that her mother is also Divergent. She tells Tris her father's whereabouts and that they have to get back to them immediately. Tris kills one of her friends, Will, and is really affected by the fact that she had to kill her friend to survive. Unfortunately, her mother is soon shot dead as they flee. Tris has to leave her mother's dead body to save herself from being killed.  Tris finds her father in hiding with several Abnegations, including Caleb and Marcus. The group sneaks into Dauntless headquarters, where Tris encounters Peter and forces him to lead them to the Erudite's control center. Her father sacrifices himself in a shootout, and Tris goes in alone to find Four, who is now under stronger mind control designed for Divergents and attacks her. Using her knowledge of his fears, she manages to wake him from the mind control and the two enter the central control room, where Erudite leader Jeanine ([[Kate Winslet]]) is about to have the Dauntless army execute the entire Abnegation faction. Tris uses a sample of the mind control serum on her to force her to cancel the program. The group escapes the compound and boards a train out of the complex.

Sawyer is reluctant to go because he is concerned about leaving Winter.  Winter needs attention and shows signs of stress and loneliness, especially after her older companion, Panama, dies. George Hatton, a [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] inspector, insists that Winter must be matched with a new companion within 30 days or be transferred elsewhere. However, Winter's behavior has become unpredictable, even dangerous: when Sawyer tries to get her out of the tank to prepare to make her a new prosthetic tail, she becomes aggressive and knocks him into the water. Dr. Clay prohibits Sawyer from swimming with Winter. Winter spends weeks in isolation, and despite people not being allowed to visit her, Sawyer allows Susie, a new volunteer, and her grandfather to see her; Hazel becomes slightly jealous, because she has feelings for him.  Prior to these events, CMA rescues a severely sunburned beached dolphin, named Mandy after a little girl who finds her, which Sawyer, Clay, and Hazel hope will become Winter's companion. CMA begins to rehabilitate Mandy, contemplating releasing her soon. Clay, Sawyer, and Hazel test her readiness by giving Mandy three live fish, which she catches effortlessly, so they decide they must release her.  Sawyer and Hazel break the rules and swim with Winter, who appears to be feeling better. Clay finds them doing so and scolds them, but then states that it does not matter, because George issued an order that Winter be transferred to a marine park in Texas. Meanwhile, Sawyer wins the scholarship to attend the SEA Semester, so his mother Lorraine and friends arrange a party, which cheers him up a little; but he still cannot decide whether to go. Dr. McCarthy shows him an old watch which must be tapped to keep ticking, and so encourages Sawyer to "shake it up now and then" and try new things in life.  During the party, Clay hears that another female dolphin has been rescued; one so young that she has not yet learned how to hunt and cannot return to the wild. This offers new hope of companionship for Winter, so they name her "[[Hope (dolphin)|Hope]]". In addition, Sawyer and Hazel find and rescue a [[sea turtle]] from some fishing line. Rufus becomes obsessed with the sea turtle, named Mavis, following her everywhere, even watching her during a [[CT Scan]] at the hospital where Lorraine works. As Mavis is released, Rufus follows her out to sea.  George gives Clay an extension to keep Winter from being transferred, and CMA tries to introduce Hope as her new companion. Hope panics and circles the pool at high speed, and staff quickly separate the two dolphins. They realize that Hope had sensed that Winter had no tail and moved differently from other dolphins. Sawyer thinks that a new prosthetic tail might have better results.  In her second meeting with Hope, Winter wears the new tail designed by Dr. McCarthy. A huge crowd, including George, is present to watch, and eventually the two dolphins accept each other. Everyone rejoices that Winter can stay at CMA now that she has a companion. With his uncertainty about Winter resolved, Sawyer decides to go to the SEA Semester program, but reassures her that he will be back. Hazel says goodbye to him by releasing helium balloons and holding up a sign, and Sawyer sends her a [[text message]] saying, "You're the best", causing her to [[blushing|blush]] as she smiles to herself and Rufus returns to the aquarium.  Real-life footage shown at the end includes Mandy's actual release, Hope's rescue, a sea turtle named Mavis and her release, Winter wearing the new prosthetic tail, and amputees interacting with Winter.

Each of the cars is near-empty from the long drive, and nobody has cell service.  When they attempt to refill their cars, they find the gasoline tanks locked.  Nobody is at the resort, though they find half-eaten food, unpacked luggage, and a car at the pumps, apparently left idling until running out of gas and draining the battery.  They can not find the keys for the gas pumps or any landline phones.  Jack urges them to remain calm and organizes several parties to search the area for the missing people.  Alex and Claire head to the lake, Tracy and Jack check cabins to the left, and Lucas and Amelia check cabins to the right.  The rest stay at the resort, where they continue looking for clues.  The other cabins are similarly empty, though Alex and Claire find the lake has frozen over despite the unseasonably warm weather at the resort.  They further realize that there are no insects or animals in the entire area.  When the friends regroup, Alex insists they leave immediately.  They discuss pooling their gas together into one vehicle, but Jack suggests they stay, as the resort has supplies and the pooled gas will only take them halfway.  The situation becomes even more tense when Tracy disappears.  Now worried about Tracy, Jack refuses to leave, and a majority of the others vote to stay.

When Noah claims to have simply fallen in a ditch and wandered back to the resort, Alex shoots him in the leg despite Claire's objections.  Noah continues to profess his ignorance, and Alex shoots him again.  Jack  protests, but Alex points out that it is too late for him to protest, as he had already tacticly given his approval to torture.  Claire convinces Alex to stop, but Alex kicks Noah out of the resort.  When his cries suddenly end, they assume he has also disappeared.  Alex says the impending threat of nonexistence invalidates morality.  After casually threatening to murder them, he commits suicide to leave behind evidence of his own existence.

Dracula Untold
  Before the [[Renaissance]], [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Țepeș]] is the Prince of [[Wallachia]] and [[Transylvania]]. As a child, he was a royal hostage in the palace of the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and was trained to be a soldier in the Sultan's elite [[Janissaries]] corps, where he became their most feared warrior. He was called [[Vlad the Impaler]] after slaughtering thousands by [[Impalement|impaling]] them on spears.  Now ruling his domains in peace, Vlad and his soldiers discover a helmet in a stream and fear that an Ottoman scouting party is preparing the way for invasion. The stream leads to Broken Tooth Mountain, the top of which has a cave carpeted in crushed bone. Within the cave, they are attacked in the dark by an inhumanly strong and fast humanoid creature, killing Vlad's [[retinue]]. Returning to his castle, Vlad learns from a local [[monk]] that the creature is a [[vampire]], who was magically trapped in the cave many years ago. Vlad celebrates an [[Easter]] feast with his wife Mirena and son Îngeraș, when an Ottoman contingent arrives at the castle. Vlad offers them the usual tribute payment of silver coins, but the [[Ambassador|emissary]] wants an additional tribute of 1,000 boys to be trained as Janissaries. Vlad refuses. Mirena believes Vlad can convince Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror|Mehmed II]] to show mercy. Vlad offers himself in place of the boys; but Mehmed refuses and demands Vlad's son in addition.  Knowing war is coming, Vlad returns to the Broken Tooth Mountain cave to seek help from the vampire. The vampire tells him there are consequences and offers him some of his blood, which will temporarily give Vlad the powers of a vampire. If he resists the intense urge to drink human blood for three days, he will turn back into a human. Otherwise, he will remain a vampire forever, and the ancient vampire will be freed, the seal on his cave broken. Vlad accepts the offer. He discovers that he has the ability to transform into a cloud of bats. When he returns to Castle Dracula, the Ottoman army attacks, but Vlad singlehandedly kills them all. He then sends most of the castle's subjects to [[Cozia Monastery]] for safety.  Mirena learns of Vlad's curse, as she sees him holding silver to keep himself weak when near his people to avoid revealing his condition to them or attacking them for blood. Vlad's sudden increased strength also arouses suspicion among his subjects.  That night, the Ottoman army marches on the monastery. Vlad commands an enormous swarm of bats to repel them; however, the soldiers are actually a decoy force, allowing a handful of Turks to infiltrate the monastery, kill many of the inhabitants and kidnap Ingeras. Mirena tries to defend her son, and falls from the edge of the monastery wall. Despite his superhuman speed, Vlad cannot reach her in time. Dying, Mirena pleads with Vlad to drink her blood before the sun rises and lifts his curse, so that he will have the strength to save their son. Vlad reluctantly drinks her blood, triggering his final transformation into a full-blooded vampire and granting him even greater powers. As he does so, he summons black storm clouds to block out the sun. Vlad returns to the monastery and turns the small group of survivors and mortally wounded into vampires as well.  At the Ottoman army's camp, Mehmed prepares for a massive invasion of Europe. Vlad and his vampires arrive, hidden by a large lightning storm, and easily massacre the terrified Ottoman soldiers, while Vlad himself goes after Mehmed, who is holding Îngeraș captive. Aware that vampires are weakened by silver, Mehmed has lined the floor of his tent with silver coins, making Vlad's strength and speed that of a human — and impairing his vision — as Mehmed fights him with a silver sword. He overpowers Vlad and prepares to impale his heart with a wooden stake, but Vlad turns into a flock of bats and evades him. Taking the name "Dracula, Son of the Devil", he kills Mehmed with the stake and drinks his blood. Vlad then sends Îngeraș away before his vampire army preys on him, and dispels the storm clouds so that the vampires, including himself, will burn away and die in the light. However, a man who had previously observed Vlad's nature and wished to serve him drags his dying body out of the sunlight and offers him his blood, which restores Vlad to life. With Vlad presumed dead and Europe saved from the Ottoman invasion, Îngeraș is crowned the new Prince of Wallachia.

Draft Day
  On the morning of the [[2014 NFL Draft]], [[Cleveland Browns]] [[general manager (sports)|general manager]] Sonny Weaver Jr. must decide how to use the seventh overall pick to improve [[History of the Cleveland Browns|the team]], but he has other problems on his mind. His girlfriend Ali Parker, the team's [[salary cap#National Football League|salary cap]] analyst, is pregnant. Also, his father's recent death and funeral plans cause pandemonium with his mother.  The [[Seattle Seahawks]] hold the first overall pick, which general manager Tom Michaels offers to trade to the Browns, allowing them to draft highly-rated quarterback prospect Bo Callahan, the [[Heisman Trophy]] winner from [[Wisconsin Badgers football|Wisconsin]]. Sonny declines, but with advice from team owner Anthony Molina to "make a splash," reluctantly trades away the Browns' first-round draft picks for the next three years. The unexpected chance to obtain Callahan excites Browns fans, but splits the team's [[front office#Sports|front office]] and players.   The trade goes public after a tweet by [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] [[linebacker]] Vontae Mack, who had been Sonny's first preference. Seahawks fans are unhappy at missing Callahan, putting pressure on Tom for giving Callahan up. Vontae advises Sonny to re-watch footage of him and Callahan playing against each other. Vontae's individual performance is superior but Callahan leads his team to victory on a last-second drive with a wrongly-ejected Vontae not on the field. Sonny begins to have doubts about Callahan's character and ability under pressure. When the draft begins that evening, Sonny waits until the last minute to decide who to select with the first pick, and eventually chooses Vontae. [[Roger Goodell]]'s announcement of the selection shocks the rest of the league and disrupts many of their plans for their own picks. Molina becomes irate and flies back to Cleveland, intent on firing Sonny. Head coach Vince Penn is also incensed, and threatens to resign.  Rumors spread about Callahan as other teams avoid him, wondering why Sonny didn't pick him. However, the Seahawks are still in contention to pick Callahan with their seventh pick, and Sonny senses an opportunity. Sonny convinces the rookie general manager of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] to trade him their next pick (at sixth, just before the Seahawks) in exchange for the Browns' second-round draft picks for the next three years. Sonny then calls Tom, who intends to pick Bo Callahan at seventh, trying to prevent the Seahawks from having him. In return for passing on Callahan to let the Seahawks have him, Sonny demands his first-round picks back, along with [[punt returner]] David Putney. The Seahawks seal the deal and choose Callahan. With his pick, Sonny appeases Penn and Molina by selecting the skilled running back Ray Jennings of [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]].  The team celebrates an outstanding draft for the Browns. After the draft party, Sonny reconciles with his mother over his excellent draft performance and her soon-to-be first grandchild.  
Drive Hard
 Former race car driver and American expatriate Peter Roberts has retired at the urging of his lawyer wife, though he resists getting an office job. Instead, he becomes an instructor at a driving school, while waiting for an investment opportunity to open a racing school. After he drops his daughter off to school and learns that he can no longer afford her private school tuition, he takes a fellow American as his first client. The man, Simon Keller, reveals that he has investigated Roberts' finances and personal life. Disturbed, Roberts insists on ending the lesson and returning to the school. Keller agrees but requests that they stop at a bank first, so that he can pay Roberts.  As Keller exits the bank, he opens fire on the guards, drops a bag into the car, and demands that Roberts serve as his getaway driver. Roberts protests in disbelief and attempts to surrender to the police, who open fire on him, too. Roberts reluctantly drives off and evades the police. Keller offers to share a percentage of his loot, but the panicked Roberts insists that he is now going to end up in jail. Keller assures him that the police will not pursue them, as the bank is owned and managed by a criminal syndicate with connections to the local police. Rossi, Keller's former associate, had previously betrayed him in the United States and then joined the Australian syndicate.  Rossi calls off the police and hires mercenaries to kill them. However, Agent Walker of the [[Australian Federal Police]] takes charge of the investigation over the objections of the corrupt Detective Chief Inspector Smith. Walker immediately threatens Rossi and Smith, both of whom she suspects to be part of the syndicate. Meanwhile, Keller and Roberts argue over Roberts' disappointment in his life, which Keller states is the result of giving up on his dreams. Upset, Roberts refuses to drive any further, and Keller shoots him with a rubber bullet. The two change cars, and Roberts once again becomes the reluctant driver.  After they evade Rossi's assassins, the car fails, and they pull into a reception hall. The owners recognize them, and an elderly woman viciously attacks Roberts after accidentally shooting her husband. Roberts and Keller escape in the husband's sports car and stop for gas. There, they are again recognized and attacked, though the cashier accidentally kills himself with his own shotgun. At Keller's urging, Roberts phones the police and his wife, telling both that he has been taken hostage, though neither believe him at first. In order to heighten Roberts' fear and make him more believable, Keller puts a gun to Roberts' head and threatens to kill him. In response, Roberts briefly holds Keller at gunpoint with the elderly woman's pistol, but he surrenders it when he realizes that it is empty.  Resigned to his fate as the getaway driver, Roberts offers to drive Keller to his final destination, a marina. On the way, the two reconcile their differences when both admit that the other has made good points about their respective lifestyles. When Roberts antagonizes a motorcycle gang, they become hostile and threaten to kill him. Keller saves his life, and, during the confrontation, the gang reveal themselves to be mercenaries in Rossi's pay. Roberts and Keller fight them off, only to be beset by Rossi himself and more mercenaries at the marina. Meanwhile, DCI Smith confronts Agent Walker, and Walker kills Smith in self-defense.  At the marina, Roberts and Keller defeat the mercenaries, and Roberts declines a share in Keller's stolen loot. Shot and left chained by Keller, Rossi is arrested. Keller handcuffs Roberts to the car and the two argue over whether Keller should punch him to make the situation look more believable; Roberts eventually agrees. Finding him ragged, wounded, and beaten, the police finally believe Roberts' story, and he returns to his family, who now respect him. Though she disapproves, Roberts' wife acquiesces to his return to professional racing.  
Drishya
 Rajendra Ponnappa ([[V. Ravichandran]]) is an orphan who had dropped out of school after his fourth grade. He is now is a businessman running a cable television service in a rural area. He is married to Seetha ([[Navya Nair]]) and they have two daughters, Sindhu (Swaroopini Narayan), a Plus Two student, and Shreya (Unnathi), a student of class sixth. His only interest apart from his family is watching films. He spends most of his time in front of the TV in his small office.  During a nature camp, Sindhu gets photographed in the bathroom by a hidden cell phone. The culprit, Tarun (Rohith B.), is the son of [[Inspector General of Police]] Roopa Chandrashekar ([[Asha Sarath]]). Tarun is accidentally killed by Seetha and her daughter when he comes to blackmail them using the clip either any one of them should sleep with him or he will surely publish the clip through Internet. They hide his body in a compost pit, which is witnessed by Shreya. Seetha tells Rajendra about the incident and he devises a way to save his family from the law. He removes the broken cell phone and disposes of Tarun's car, which is seen by a police constable, Suryaprakash ([[Achyuth Kumar]]), who has a grudge against Rajendra. Rajendra takes his family on a trip to attend a religious meeting, watch a movie and eat at a restaurant. Roopa, realising that her son has gone missing starts an investigation.  After a preliminary investigation, Roopa calls Rajendra and family for questioning. Rajendra had predicted that this would happen and taught his family how to change their alibi at the time of murder. When questioned individually, they reply the same thing and they had also shown the bill of the restaurant, the movie tickets and the bus journeys' tickets as proof of their alibi. Roopa questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove Rajendra's alibi. Roopa realises that on the day of the incident, Rajendra had taken the tickets and the bill, made acquaintance with the owners and had gone for the trip with his family the next day, thus proving his alibi and making the owners unwittingly tell the lie.  Roopa arrests Rajendra and family and Suryaprakash uses brute force to beat the truth out of them. Eventually, Shreya gives in and reveals the place where the body is buried. After digging the compost pit, they find the carcass of a calf, indicating that Rajendra had moved the body. Shreya reports to the media and complains against Suryaprakash. The constable is suspended and Roopa resigns from her post. Roopa and her husband meet Rajendra to ask forgiveness for their rude and violent behavior. Rajendra suspects there might be foul play involved and still does not reveal directly that his family has committed a crime. Rajendra, now in remand, signs a register at the newly constructed local police station. As he leaves, a flashback shows him leaving the incomplete police station with a shovel in hand, indicating that he has hidden Tarun's body in the foundations of the very police station that dealt with the said investigation.  
Dragon Nest: Warriors' Dawn
 The movie takes place fifty years before the game. Alteria is a land divided among humans, elves, goblinoids (called "beasts"), and dragons. Decades ago, the elves and humans drove the beasts and dragons back into the Dark Mountains. However, with the beasts vanquished, the humans and elves eventually came into conflict with each other, thereby remaining unaware that evil begins to thrive and gain strength again within the Dark Mountains, all centered on a gem of power embedded in the chest of the sleeping Black Dragon Karas, under whose influence the beasts have united into an army.  A cocky, adventurous human boy named Lambert and his dogs One and Two have a run-in with a large beast band on a raid. Just before they end up killed, they are saved by a trio of famous adventurers: Barnac, a famous mercenary and captain of a flying ship; Geraint, a famous dragon fighter; and Argenta, Geraint’s sister. They proceed to the human kingdom of Saint Heaven, to which two Elven maidens, Princess Nerwin and her companion Liya, have secretly travelled to beseech the king for an alliance against the beasts. While tring to get himself a sword, Lambert encounters Liya and ends teaming up with her and his heroic companions against a band of beasts attacking the city, holding them off until the Imperial Knights under Velskud can bring the situation under control. With evidence of the new threat on his literal doorstep, the terrified king finally agrees to the alliance.  While the newly-found allies gather their forces, Liya spots a shadow near the king’s dining hall and follows it, accompanied by Lambert. There, they sneak into a meeting between the king, Terramai (his priest and advisor), Karacule (a sorceress), Nerwin, Barnac, Geraint, Argenta, and Velskud discussing the threat of Karas and the gem forming both his base of power and his most vulnerable spot. An argument over who should assume custody of the gem breaks out until Lambert interrupts them with a plan for a combined diversionary attack and infiltration, upon which - although the plan is accepted - he and Liya are kicked out. However, by listening in they learn that the gem's dark power corrupts those of weak heart and will therefore have to be destroyed.  Later that night, Velskud is joined by Princess Elena, a Dark Elf who desires the gem for herself and the infiltrator Liya saw earlier. Velskud, seduced by Elena's promises to be made ruler of all Alteria, kills the king before joining the other heroes for the secret mission. Lambert, who also comes along with Liya, receives a sword from an old blacksmith in return for holding onto One and Two until his return. Under the cover of darkness, they travel to the Dark Mountains on Barnac's ship. Lightning strikes the ship, and while Lambert tries to retrieve his sword which has slipped from his hand, he accidentally disables the ship’s wheel. The ship crashes, and the group is forced to continue the journey on foot.  Along the way, the companions reach a set of ruins which were the site of a battle between the elves and humans and are still haunted by the ghosts of the fallen elves. Forced to cross them following one of Lambert's mishaps, they are discovered and taunted by a bat scout serving the Black Dragon. When Velskud attacks it, it tries to slip away to the Dark Mountains before the heroes manage to kill it. As the journey continues, Lambert and Liya develop a romantic interest in each other, and Geraint and Argenta are shown to hide a secret connected to the Dragon's gem. Using this link, Geraint finds and unseals a secret entrance to the Dragon's lair in the wall of a glacier, but while traversing the ice ravine beyond the door, they are ambushed by Karas' beast guardians. They escape by collapsing the exit, but Geraint and Argenta stay behind, and Geraint uses the power of the gem in his chest to awaken a giant beast frozen in the ice. They escape and reunite with the others.  However, the companions do not make it in time before the Alliance begins its attack, causing Karas to awaken. The beasts fighting against the Alliance retreat but run into Lambert's group. In the ensuing confusion, Liya and Lambert are left behind and forced to fight the monsters by themselves. When Lambert is about to get eaten by a beast, Liya uses her last arrow to save him, sacrificing herself. The others hear Lambert's cries of anguish and race to aid him, but are quickly overrun by the beasts. Geraint uses his secret power to transform into a Golden Dragon and save his companions, but accidentally hurts Karacule in the process. It turns out that he and Argenta are Half-Dragons and therefore bearers of Dragon Gems themselves. The others, seeing Geraint's dragon form, start to distrust the siblings, claiming that dragons need to be killed.  Karas appears and attacks, and is immediately engaged by Geraint. As they fly above Lambert, he notices the glowing gem on Karas’ chest, and remembering what was said about it - including that it holds the power to raise the dead - he decides to get it for Liya. He jumps onto Karas as he flies past and climbs his way up to the chest. The others join in to dislodge the dark gem, and Argenta transforms into a Silver Dragon to help her brother. By combining their powers, they are eventually able to detach the dark gem from Karas, killing the monster at last.  Lambert demands the gem from Geraint in order to resurrect Liya, but Geraint warns him from touching it, for fear that its power will corrupt him, and instead gives him his own gem. While Lambert runs off to apply the gem on Liya, Velskud seizes Karas' gem; but before he can slay Geraint, Lambert interferes and returns Geraint's gem to its owner. As he and Velskud duel, the dark gem begins to corrupt the knight and transform him into a new Black Dragon. Before the warped knight can kill Lambert, an elven arrow distracts him, allowing Lambert to grab Velskud's own sword and fatally wound his opponent.  The arrow was guided by Liya, who has returned from the brink of death, and she and Lambert embrace each other in a kiss. The Alliance army arrives and picks the heroes up for a ride home; but Elena has gained possession of Karas' gem. Following the end credits, Lambert reunites with his dogs and respectively renames them Bow and Arrow.

Dumb and Dumber To
  Twenty years after the events of the first film, Lloyd Christmas has all this time been committed at Baldy View Sanitarium, a [[mental institution]], ever since his doomed romance with Mary Swanson. During a recent visit, Harry Dunne discovers that Lloyd pranked him into thinking he was traumatized the entire time. They head to their apartment, where Harry reveals he needs a donated kidney.  They go to Harry's old home, but Harry cannot get a kidney from his parents because he was adopted. Harry's dad gives him his mail that has been piling up since he moved out. It includes a postcard from a former girlfriend, Fraida Felcher, dating back to 1991. It says she is pregnant and needs Harry to call. Fraida admits that she had a daughter named Fanny that she gave up for adoption. She wrote Fanny a letter, only for it to be returned and instructed to never contact her again.  Hoping she can provide a kidney, Lloyd and Harry drive a [[hearse]] that Fraida gave them to [[Oxford, Maryland]], where she now lives. Dr. Bernard Pinchelow and his wife Adele are Fanny's adoptive parents. Fanny, who has taken the name Penny, is going to a [[TED (conference)|KEN]] Convention in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] to give a speech on her father's life work. Penny is  given a package to be given to one of the convention heads, but ends up forgetting the package and her phone.  Adele is secretly trying to poison Bernard and Penny to gain Bernard's fortune, with the help of her secret lover, the family's housekeeper, Travis Lippincott. Harry and Lloyd arrive to inform the Pinchelows of their situation. Bernard realizes Penny left the package, which he says is an invention worth billions. Adele suggests that Harry and Lloyd deliver the package to Penny. So that he and Adele can get the contents of the box, Travis accompanies Harry and Lloyd. Annoyed with the duo's antics, Travis attempts to kill them but dies in a train collision. Adele hears of the death from Travis's twin brother Captain Lippincott, a former military man who agrees to help her kill Harry and Lloyd.  When the duo arrives in El Paso on a stolen [[Zamboni Company|Zamboni]] [[ice resurfacer]], Harry impersonates Bernard, so he and Lloyd are invited to a seminar. They get into an argument when Harry discovers that Lloyd has developed a romantic attraction to Penny. After being escorted out of the convention due to not being on the attendance list, Lloyd gets a call from Penny. After informing Penny that he is in town with her dad, they arrange a meeting during which Lloyd deduces that he, not Harry, is Penny's father.  Adele arrives at the convention with Lippincott and exposes Harry as a fraud, telling the convention heads that he stole the package. Fraida also arrives and tampers with the fire alarm to create a diversion after she and Penny are denied entry. As the building is evacuated, Harry runs into Fraida and Penny, only to have Lippincott and Adele corner them with guns in a bathroom. At this moment, Lloyd returns, having been to Mexico to have one of his own kidneys removed for Harry. Lippincott and Adele are about to shoot, but three FBI agents bust in with a healthy-looking Bernard, who knew all along that Adele was trying to poison him, that she cheated on him with Travis, and he reveals that it was Adele who wrote "do not contact again" on Fraida's letter (much to Fraida's surprise and anger), not Penny and that the "priceless invention" in the package was in fact nothing but [[cupcakes]]. In retaliation, Adele attempts to shoot Penny, but Harry jumps in front of the bullet and is severely injured. Adele (who is beaten up by Fraida) and Lippincott are arrested.  Harry is rushed to the hospital where he reveals that he was pranking Lloyd about needing a kidney and both laugh. Fraida tells Harry and Lloyd that Penny’s biological father is a dead high school friend named Pete "Pee-Stain" Stainer. As the duo leave El Paso, they spot two women walking in their direction and shove them into a bush as a joke. Harry and Lloyd run off and high-five each other.  In a post-credits scene, Harry and Lloyd throw their milkshakes onto the windscreen of a truck. The driver Sea Bass prepares to ram them, opening the possibility for another sequel.  
The Drop (film)
 Bob Saginowsky ([[Tom Hardy]]) is a bartender at a neighborhood bar in Brooklyn. Marvin Stipler ([[James Gandolfini]]) ceded ownership of the bar years earlier to [[Chechen mafia|Chechen mobsters]] and now operates it with Bob as a 'drop' for illegal takings. Marv ridicules Bob and some patrons for commemorating the 10th anniversary of the murder of a man named Richie Whelan.  On his way home, Bob finds a battered [[pit bull]] pup abandoned in a household garbage can. While rescuing it, he meets Nadia ([[Noomi Rapace]]), a resident of the house. Bob leaves the dog in her care until he can decide whether to adopt him.  When the bar is robbed by two masked gunmen, Marv is annoyed that Bob told investigating Detective Torres ([[John Ortiz]]) about one of the gunmen wearing a broken watch. Chechen thug Chovka ([[Michael Aronov]]) later tells Marv and Bob that they must make up for the stolen money. Marv later meets with one of the perpetrators, Fitz ([[James Frecheville]]), revealing that he orchestrated the robbery.  A later discussion between Marv and his sister, Dottie ([[Ann Dowd]]), reveals Marv’s motive is to continue payments for his father’s life support.  Bob decides to keep the dog and names him [[Saint Rocco|Rocco]], all the while bonding with Nadia, who agrees to care for the dog whenever Bob tends to the bar. Nadia has scars on her neck that she reveals are self-inflicted from when she used to have a drug problem. While walking Rocco in a park, a passerby, Eric Deeds ([[Matthias Schoenaerts]]), approaches Bob and comments about Rocco. Deeds later appears at Bob's house and provides proof that he is the actual owner and admits to beating and abandoning him. He demands Rocco be returned before he raises the matter with the police.  Later, Bob and Marv find a bag at the bar, containing a severed arm with a broken watch together with the stolen money. Bob is unnerved when Deeds appears in the bar and reveals he is friends with Nadia. Marv informs Bob that Deeds is a dangerous thug who claims to have killed Richie Whelan. When Bob confronts Nadia, she admits that she and Deeds used to date. Bob and Marv return the money to the Chechens, who in turn inform them that the bar will be the drop site for the night of the Super Bowl.  Marv meets with and kills Fitz, and then recruits Deeds to rob the bar the night of the Super Bowl. Bob is later confronted by Deeds, who demands $10,000 lest he take Rocco, starve him, and then beat him again. When Marv informs Bob that he will be calling in sick on the day of the Super Bowl, Bob becomes suspicious and warns him to not do something desperate "that we can't clean up this time". On Super Bowl night, with Rocco in tow, Bob takes $10,000 hidden in his basement and hides it behind the bar counter, with a pistol.  Deeds breaks into Nadia's home and forces her to go to the bar with him to watch the Super Bowl. Elsewhere, Marv lines his car trunk with plastic before parking and waiting near the bar, watching various mobsters drop off money throughout the night.  Eventually the bar clears except for Deeds and Nadia. Deeds refuses Bob's offer of $10,000 for Rocco, then threatens to kill Nadia if he does not open the [[time lock]] safe during the window available at 2 a.m. While they wait, Bob tells a story about Marv when he was a loan shark and how he used to skim off the Chechens. Bob once killed a customer who had hit a huge casino jackpot, using the money to replace Marv's thefts from the Chechens, and Bob disposed of the body in his heating oil tank with lye and laundry detergent. He reveals to Deeds and Nadia that the victim was Richie Whelan, whom Deeds has always taken credit for killing. Bob then draws his gun and shoots Deeds at [[point-blank range]]. When a terrified Nadia asks if she can leave, Bob explains that although things go on all around him, he is not a part of it.  The Chechens dispose of Deeds' body and collect the money from the drop. Chovka informs Bob he was aware of Marv's deceit, as Marv is killed in his car while waiting near the bar. Chovka accepts that Bob played no part in the robbery and provides him ownership of the bar as a reward.  Det. Torres visits Bob at the bar to offer condolences over Marv's death, which Bob attributes to a [[carjacking]] gone wrong, while Torres believes it to be an execution. Torres asks Bob if he has seen Deeds as he has been reported missing and was last seen at the bar, just as Whelan had been years earlier. Torres tells Bob of the tie between Deeds and Whelan in that Deeds always took credit for Whelan's death, but was in a psychiatric ward the night Whelan went missing. Torres then insinuates that Bob is responsible for both Deeds' and Whelan's disappearance by saying "No one ever sees you coming, do they, Bob?"  Later, Bob visits Nadia and asks her if she wants to see him again. Nadia offers to take a walk with him and Rocco and goes to get her coat, while Bob waits outside.

By virtue of his job, Rambabu spends a lot of time watching films in multiple languages. He does so with so much interest that he makes major life decisions by subconsciously taking on the behaviours of characters from these films.  During a school trip to a camp, a nude video of Anju is taken on a cell phone camera hidden in the bathroom. The culprit is revealed as Varun, the son of the [[Inspector-general of police]], Geetha. When Varun meets Anju later to blackmail her, she breaks his cell phone and inadvertently kills him. With her mother's help, she hides his body in a [[compost]] pit that was originally made for [[manure]]. Unbeknownst to them, this is witnessed by Anu. Jyothi tells Rambabu about the incident and he devises a plan to save his family from imprisonment. He gets rid of the broken cell phone. However, as he is disposing of Varun's car, Rambabu is seen by a corrupt [[police constable]] named Veerabhadram, who holds a grudge against him. Rambabu then takes his family out on a trip to [[Vizianagaram]], where they attend a religious meeting, watch a movie and dine at a restaurant.  Meanwhile, Geetha starts an investigation when she realises that her son has gone missing. After a preliminary investigation, Geetha calls Rambabu and his family in for [[interrogation|questioning]]. Rambabu, predicting that this would happen, coaches his family on how to present their [[alibi]]. As a result, when questioned individually, their responses are consistent. They also produce the restaurant receipt, the movie tickets and the tickets of the bus journey as proof of their alibi. The statements of the people who own the establishments that the family visited in Vizianagaram further solidify Rambabu's alibi. However, after a thorough investigation, Geetha realises that Rambabu had acquired the tickets and the receipt on the day of the incident, made an acquaintance with the owners, and had only actually taken the trip a day later with his family.  Geetha arrests Rambabu and his family, and Veerabhadram uses force to beat the truth out of them. As Rambabu, Jyothi and Anju are severely injured, Geetha's husband, Prabhakar, asks her to put a stop to this. Out of fear, Anu reveals what she saw and Varun's friend describes the transgression at the camp. After digging up the compost pit, the police find the carcass of a pig instead of Varun's body, indicating that Rambabu had already moved it. Jyothi's brother, Rajesh, and her father call the media and Anu complains to them about Veerabhadram's ill-treatment of her family. After Veerabhadram manhandles Rambabu and his relatives, he is beaten by the local people who learn about him from the media. Rambabu's goodwill remains intact and all the locals extend their support to him. Veerabhadram is suspended, the remaining staff transferred, and Geetha resigns from her post as IG.  Before leaving for the [[United States]], Geetha and Prabhakar meet Rambabu to apologise for their deeds, and express their hope that Varun will return some day. But Rambabu indirectly tells them that he killed Varun to save his family and asks them to forgive him.  The film comes to an end with Rambabu signing a register at the newly constructed Rajavaram police station. As he leaves, a flashback shows him during the construction of the station with a shovel in hand, indicating that Varun's body is hidden in the building's [[foundation (architecture)|foundation]].

The Duke of Burgundy
 Evelyn is studying [[lepidopterology]] under the older Cynthia, who frequently lectures on her studies. Evelyn is romantically involved with Cynthia and works as a maid in her home, where she is subject to strict behavioural expectations and high standards for cleanliness. When Evelyn does not complete tasks to Cynthia's satisfaction, she is punished.  As Cynthia increasingly falters in her [[BDSM|dominance]], it becomes apparent that Evelyn is orchestrating Cynthia's role in the relationship by writing instructions and scripts for specific scenes, which the couple acts out in the same way each day. While Evelyn finds the scenes to be sexually exciting, Cynthia only acts them out to sate her lover. She attempts to please Evelyn by ordering a carpenter to construct a bed with a drawer underneath for Evelyn to sleep in as a punishment; however, Evelyn is unhappy with the length of time it will take to produce the bed, and ultimately refuses the gift.  Evelyn begins to demand that Cynthia lock her in a trunk in the evening as a new punishment. Cynthia agrees, but she is resentful about the new physical separation. Cynthia also becomes self-conscious about her aging, having injured her back moving the trunk to her bedside. She expresses her unhappiness on Evelyn's birthday, when she demands that Evelyn bake her own birthday cake, which Cynthia eats while reclining with her feet resting on Evelyn's face. Evelyn does not enjoy the scene and calls out her safeword, ''[[Sphinx pinastri|pinastri]]'', which Cynthia ignores.  The couple's relationship becomes more strained as Evelyn's expectations go unfulfilled. Finally, Cynthia accuses Evelyn of polishing another lecturer's boots, which she considers to be an act of betrayal. The two eventually seem to make up, and Evelyn agrees to put less emphasis on her sexual needs. The film ends with the couple going through the same play routine seen at the film's start.

 Three neighborhood teens and childhood friends, Alex, Tuck, and Munch, are upset by the fact that their neighborhood, Mulberry Woods, [[Nevada]], is being demolished, allegedly for a new highway construction project, and they all have to move away because of it.  While at Tuck's house, their phones start to glitch out, displaying seemingly random graphical patterns. They soon find out, through Munch, that the patterns are actually a map to a spot in the desert 17.6 miles away. They decide to go to the desert on their bikes and disguise it as a sleepover, recording the experience on various cameras because it's their last night together.  Tuck, Alex, and Munch soon make it to the desert, as they follow the map to a dusty, rusted object under a cable tower. Tuck, confused, decides to abruptly call it off when the object starts to copy Alex's ringtone. They follow another map to a barn, as the object telekinetically starts to repair itself, and is able to answer questions using a "Yes" or "No" answer, from which the boys learn that it is from outer space, has crash landed, and was seriously injured.  They soon follow another map to a pawn shop, where the object further repairs itself, and reveals itself as an alien, using Alex's phone camera to "see" and befriend the three. While in an alley, they decide to name the alien "Echo." They again follow another map to a house in which Emma, a Mulberry Woods high school student, lives and finds out about Echo. Emma soon joins the team, as they go to a bar, and then an arcade, as she finds out the object Echo is in is a key to a spaceship hidden in Mulberry Woods.  At the arcade, Alex is caught by a security guard. Although Tuck and Munch suspect Alex allowed himself to be caught because he is angry at Tuck for accidentally abandoning him, Emma goes back in to rescue Alex, and Echo scares the security guard away. Stopping at a nearby restaurant, the four talk and reconcile, as a "construction worker" captures both Munch and Echo. Tuck, Alex, and Emma then go to Tuck's brother's party and steal his car to catch up with Munch and Echo. They find the "construction site" where Munch is being interrogated and Echo is being experimented on, but get caught by the same "construction worker." He explains that he and his group (who seem to actually be government agents of some kind) shot down Echo's spaceship and intend to prevent him from repairing it and going home so they can capture and study Echo's technology. However, right after they shot it down they discovered they couldn't find any debris from the spaceship, so they invented a false construction project so they could dig up the neighborhood, thinking it must have somehow concealed itself underground.  After the kids lie and say they'll help them find Echo's spaceship, the agents take the four kids to a junkyard, where Echo seemingly dies as a result of the experimentation, but with encouragement from the kids he revives and completes his repairs, then diverts and traps the agents long enough for the four kids to drive back home and find the core of the spaceship, which was buried under Alex's home the entire time. Alex takes Echo inside, followed by the rest of them, where they say goodbye as Echo safely starts up the ship, telekinetically reassembles it from parts that had been buried all over the neighborhood, and flies away.  After the event, the construction project is abandoned, but Alex and Munch move away anyway, as their families had already bought new homes elsewhere. Tuck stays, however, and new neighbors move in. Sometime later, the four meet up again, as the film ends with Alex holding up his phone towards the sky.  In a scene after the credits, Alex addresses his friends as his phone apparently starts to move and glitch out, a sign that Echo may be returning.  
Dying of the Light (film)
 Evan Lake ([[Nicolas Cage]]) is a highly decorated veteran [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent and Intelligence Star recipient reduced to a desk job at Langley with his protege and close friend Milton "Milt" Schultz ([[Anton Yelchin]]). Twenty-two years ago during an op in Africa, Lake was captured by terrorist Muhammad Banir (Alexander Karim) and tortured by having his head repeatedly bashed and having his ear mutilated. During the extraction and ensuing explosion, Banir went missing and was presumed dead, although Lake never bought it and has obsessively tried to find Banir ever since. As a result of the trauma he sustained under torture, Lake is now suffering from early stage frontal temporal dementia, and his boss considers him a liability to the agency.  In [[Bucharest]], police tail a Kenyan national, Abdi, carrying a mysterious USB drive. A car chase ensues, and rather than giving himself up, the courier throws himself and the drive off a bridge. The [[Romanian Intelligence Service]] retrieve the drive and the body, but the data is corrupted, so it is subsequently sent to the CIA. Milt gets a hit on large quantities of an experimental drug treating [[thalassemia]], information corroborated in the USB data. The drugs are for an anonymous Kenyan client, and are coming from a [[University of Bucharest]] clinic run by Professor Dr. Iulius Cornell. Since thalassemia is hereditary, Milt concludes that Banir is ordering shipments of the drug through a middleman, Dr. Wangari. He tells Lake, who asks his superiors to go after Banir. However, they still believe he's dead, and refuse. Later, Lake has a violent outburst during a search and resigns on the spot.  During this time, in Kenya, Banir sends his man Aasim to Bucharest to find out why Abdi has not delivered the medicine.  Lake tells Milt about his mental deterioration, which becomes increasingly apparent as the film progresses.  When Lake decides to go to Romania, Milt goes along.  In Bucharest, the men meet Michelle Zubarain ([[Irène Jacob]]), a former journalist, possible agent, and Lake's one-time love, who has information about Cornell providing the drug Banir needs.  The trio meet with the professor, compelling him to acknowledge his role and to admit that Banir is forcing him to travel to Kenya.  As Lake, Milt, and Michelle leave the professor's office building, Aasim sees them.  The next day, the three return to the professor's office in hopes of following whomever the professor meets.  They watch until the professor comes outside to meet Aasim, but Aasim spots them and runs.  While Lake takes the money, drugs, and passport from the professor in order to impersonate him in Kenya, Milt catches Aasim and slits his throat, effectively preventing him from contacting Banir.  Michelle finds a make-up specialist to help Lake transform into the professor, then Lake and Milt fly to Mombasa.  The disguise works, and Lake is driven out of the city to Banir's hideout, and through a ruse and some small hand-to-hand combat, is finally alone with Banir.  Lake reveals himself to the terrorist, but at that moment has an attack of dementia-fueled flashbacks, during which the disparity between the young terrorist who maimed Lake twenty-two years earlier and the now aging, fragile, and terminally-ill man is very clear.  Without taking any further action, Lake abruptly leaves Banir.  The next day, Lake and Milt are strolling through a Mombasan park full of people when a shot rings out and a young Kenyan passing Lake suddenly drops.  Lake sees that Milt has been hit, too (not fatally), and returns fire to the gunmen, ultimately killing both and being shot twice himself.  Understanding that Banir has sent them, he takes their vehicle, driving into the night back to Banir's hideout, where he engages in a short (and prone) knife fight with Banir before killing him.  But as he returns to Mombasa, he is still losing blood, and the flashbacks and voices return. Lake appears to drive head-on into a truck.  The closing moments of the film move (with a voice-over by Lake) to Arlington National Cemetery, to Langley, to Lake giving a speech (from early in the film), and to Milt giving Michelle a memento of Lake's that is important to her.

Edge of Tomorrow
 In 2015, an alien race called Mimics arrive in Germany to storm and conquer [[continental Europe]]. In 2020, the United Defense Force (UDF) achieves one solid victory over the Mimics at [[Verdun]]. In Britain, General Brigham of the UDF commands Major William Cage to cover a massive assault on France. Cage, who has no combat experience, objects and threatens to put the blame on Brigham should the invasion result in failure. Brigham has Cage arrested for disobeying orders and orders him sent to [[Heathrow Airport]], now a military base. Cage wakes up to find Brigham has falsified records to make it appear he is only a [[private (rank)|private]] and has assigned him to the misfit J [[squad]] under the command of Master Sergeant Farell.  The invasion of France is a colossal failure for the UDF. During the battle, Cage uses a [[M18 Claymore mine|Claymore mine]] to kill an unusually large blue Mimic but dies when the alien's blood dissolves him. Cage is jolted awake and finds himself back at Heathrow experiencing the events of the previous morning over again. Cage attempts to warn Farell that the invasion will fail but is not believed. He repeats the loop of dying on the beach and waking at Heathrow over and over again, becoming more skilled in combat each time. During one time loop Cage unsuccessfully attempts to save the life of Sergeant Rita Vrataski, who realises that Cage can loop time. She orders him to locate her the next time he wakes up.  Cage reawakens and locates Vrataski, who takes him to Dr. Carter. Carter is an expert in Mimic biology and explains that Mimics are a [[superorganism]] in which the "Omega" controls the [[cerebrum]], while the "Alphas" behave as the [[Ganglion|ganglia]] in which the Omega controls ordinary Mimics. If an Alpha is terminated, the Omega resets the day and rearranges its tactics until the battle is won. Cage inadvertently "hijacked" their ability to reset time through his exposure to an Alpha's blood. Vrataski had this ability at Verdun, using it to win the battle before losing its power when she was wounded in battle and received a [[blood transfusion]]. She tells Cage to locate and kill the Omega in order to end the alien invasion and save the human race.  Over many more loops Vrataski trains Cage to excel in combat. After one frustrating lesson Cage visits London and discovers that the Mimics will attack there after defeating the UDF in France. Cage also begins having visions of the dam in [[Germany]] that the Omega is hiding in. Cage and Vrataski spend many loops figuring out how to escape the invasion and reach the dam. Cage comes to know Vrataski and falls in love with her, but Vrataski is only interested in the mission. Upon reaching a point where she is killed whatever they do, Cage decides to fly to the dam on his own. Inside the dam, instead of finding the Omega, he is ambushed by an Alpha and Mimic who attempt to strip him of his ability to reset time. Cage preserves the ability by deliberately drowning himself.  Cage and Vrataski infiltrate the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)#Property portfolio|MoD]] to obtain a prototype device built by Carter that can locate the Omega. Cage compels General Brigham to give him the device, and during the ensuing car chase discovers that the Omega is under the [[Louvre Pyramid]] in [[Paris]]. Cage is captured and seriously injured, he wakes up in a hospital to find he has been given a blood transfusion and has lost the ability to loop time.  Vrataski frees Cage and they recruit J squad to help destroy the Omega before the invasion begins. They fly to Paris, where the other soldiers sacrifice themselves so that Cage and Vrataski can get into the Louvre. Just before luring away an Alpha standing between them and the submerged Omega, Vrataski kisses Cage to thank him for getting her as far as he did. The Alpha kills Vrataski and mortally wounds Cage, but he manages to drop a belt of [[grenade]]s that kill the Omega.  The dying Cage floats down through the water, into the Omega's blood. He awakens ''en route'' to his first meeting with Brigham, who is announcing on TV that Mimic activity has ceased following a mysterious energy surge in Paris. Cage, still a major, goes to Heathrow and finds Vrataski. She greets him as icily as she did in previous loops, causing Cage to chuckle.

After hours, an unknown killer sneaks into the studio and kills lead actor Claudio Calvetti and his girlfriend Veronica while they view a workprint of the film.

Meanwhile, Police Chief O'Connor pressures Porfiry into closing the case, since Margarit is his daughter. Porfiry begins suspecting Rey, since the victims' fingers were crudely severed in much the same manner as Rey's. Porfiry interviews Mancini, and learns that Rey was once instituted in an asylum.  Back at the studio, Cesare is murdered in the shower and his fingers are severed. With Cesare dead, Francesco instructs Rey to re-cut the film to make Cal the new star. Porfiry questions Rey about his time in the asylum, and Rey recounts how his start in the business as an editor for acclaimed [[Art house film|art house]] director Umberto Fantori, Bella's father, whose debut film ''The Mirror and the Guillotine'' earned him critical acclaim and introduced him to his wife, star Josephine Jardin. When his wife was fired by Mancini on her next film, the pressures of editing Fantori's next project, the world's longest film, mounted and Rey accidentally cut off his own fingers in a fit of madness. What Rey doesn't tell him is that he's found what appears to be footage of the murders, taken by an unknown third party. The interview over, Rey returns to work in the editing suite with Bella, where she confesses her love for him, but Rey resists her because he is married. Porfiry, meanwhile, is introduced to Cal's girlfriend Jasmine, who reveals that the two were once lovers. Porfiry remains oblivious to the bladed instruments in Cal's car.  That night after another argument with his wife, Rey has a vision of a dark man with bright blue eyes stalking him from the shadows in his room. Porfiry, meanwhile, infiltrates the asylum where Rey was institutionalized, and meets the director Dr. Casini. Casini tells Porfiry that Rey attempted to kill his assistant Giuseppe, who is now a patient at the asylum himself, his head mysteriously wrapped in bandages. Casini explains to Porfiry [[Allegory of the Cave|Plato's Allegory of the Cave]]; of men who spend their entire lives believing shadows on the wall to be living, breathing beings.  Porfiry returns him to find that Margarit now has a seeing-eye [[German Shepherd]] named Rolfie. After the two make love, the killer breaks into their home and traps Porfiry outside of his room, separated from Margarit.

Giancarlo arrives and holds Porfiry at gunpoint, but the Porfiry feeds him alcohol and confuses him into supporting Porfiry's narrative about the incident.  O'Connor berates Porfiry over Margarit's death, and the killer calls him at the station to taunt him. Porfiry convinces O'Connor into supporting a plan where Giancarlo goes undercover as the new editor on ''Tarantola''. Rey meanwhile, has been suffering from blackouts and hallucinations, and finding a bloodied shirt in his editing suite, begins to suspect himself as the killer. Mancini fires him and replaces him with Giancarlo, Rey dejectedly returns home to find Josephine obsessively watching Cal's demo tape. Burning the bloodied shirt in the kitchen sink, Rey begins having strange, otherworldly visions involving Bella; glimpsing a [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian]] netherworld filled with massive film reels and boiling tar. Bella meanwhile, finds the footage of the murders. Watching it, she is murdered by the killer; an act echoed in Rey's vision. He rushes to the studio, but arrives too late.  Trying to complete the film without any prior filmmaking knowledge, Giancarlo is beset by venomous tarantulas in the editing suite and is disembowled by the killer. Over-schedule and over-budget, Mancini rehires Rey to finish the film, Rey revealing that he'd already completed his assembly cut before being fired. Mancini is ecstatic and the film is saved. Porfiry, convinced Rey is the killer, confronts Father Clarke, who tries to tell him his conviction is misguided. He explains an old, Roman-era superstition that editors were believed to be bridges to the netherworld.  Cal, learning that Rey has cut him from the film completely, threatens to kill Rey with a chainsaw. Rey points out that Cal blinks incessantly whenever he tries acting, which lets Rey know that Cal's bluffing. Cal leaves in a huff, but vows to still have his revenge. He tells Porfiry that Rey is a madman, and Porfiry mentions his suspicion that Rey may have ties to the occult, telling Cal that the best way to get to Rey is through his wife. Rey returns home to a ransacked living room with only the television intact. Viewing Cal's demo reel, the [[Betamax]] tape suddenly comes to life and begins breathing. Cal kidnaps Rey and forces him to watch him rape Josephine despite Rey's pleas, but Josephine reveals that she's been having an affair with him and plans to leave Rey. That night, Jasmine and Cal are killed during sex by a [[chainsaw]].  While researching the occult at the library, Porfiry is beset by tarantulas. Porfiry brings his findings to Father Clarke, insisting that Rey is the killer. Clarke retorts the Rey is a righteous man, who volunteered to fix the masonry in the broken church bell tower years ago, allowing the bell to keep ringing. Porfiry stumbles across Porfiry's dead body, and enraged brakes into Rey's home and finds occult literature and a film reel filled with severed fingers. Taking this as confirmation of Rey's guilt, Porfiry sets out in search of Rey. Rey is struck by another vision, crawling out of his editing machine covered in tar with bright blue eyes, thus matching the appearance of the killer in his dreams. Porfiry chases Rey by car over a cliff. Rey flees on foot and makes his way to Mancini's mansion, but Porfiry catches up and holds him at gunpoint. Porfiry shoots Rey, but upon turning around is shocked to find Josephine performing an occult ritual; sacrificing Mancini and revealing herself as the true killer. Josephine proclaims herself an incarnation of [[Death (Tarot card)|Death]], Porfiry tries to shoot her but she causes his gun to backfire, blowing off the fingers on his right hand. Rey lights his wooden hand on fire and grabs Josephine, setting her ablaze and killing her. In the aftermath, Porfiry reveals that Cal confessed to killing Cesare for a better part in the film, and the two go their separate ways on good terms.  The next day, Porfiry returns to work at police station, but quickly becomes confused by strange incongruities surrounding him. Dr. Casini is the staff psychiatrist and Jasmine is his nurse, Josephine and Rey were never together, Giancarlo is alive and a full Inspector who solved the case, and Porfiry's injuries are now only minor. Confused, Porfiry rushes to the church to speak to Father Clarke, who tells him that belfry has remained damaged and the bell hasn't rung in over 100 years. Porfiry runs to the top of the tower, and digging through the damaged masonry finds a skull atop a stack of film reels. Examining the frames, he sees a reflection of himself repeating the same actions. Horrified, Porfiry screams realizing he's in another dimension, a camera pull-back revealing him to be in the studio editing machine.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Rey returns home to his wife; in this reality Bella.

They soon become friends and Aisha reveals to him that she has a terminal illness, and tells him about her bucket list. Guru helps her fulfill most of those wishes but her health deteriorates. They fall in love and get married. He tries every means to save her. She receives treatment in Mumbai and miraculously recovers. Few days later she discovers she is pregnant but the doctor tells her that she might die while delivering the baby. She conceals this fact from Guru.

While assaulting a nurse who had earlier spoken rudely to him, Rakesh is again intercepted by Guru who almost kills him, but revives him again after delivering an [[Intracardiac injection|adrenaline shot]] and sets him free. Meanwhile, the police finds out the truth about Rakesh and takes his wife for questioning. Rakesh realizes that Guru is Aisha's husband as she had begged him not to kill her by saying that she is pregnant and Guru is taking revenge.  Rakesh, who now knows Guru's identity, taunts him over the phone before killing Aisha's father, and then surrenders to Aditya. Rakesh expects Guru to kill him so that he would become a "hero" in the eyes of his wife and everyone else, while Guru would become a "villain". However, Caesar calls Guru at that moment and says that he has killed Rakesh's wife and asks Guru to finish off his son. Enraged, Rakesh injures Guru and is about to kill him when he is run over by a car and dies on the spot. Guru later adopts Rakesh's son instead of killing him, and completes the remaining wishes on Aisha's bucket list.

Endless Love (2014 film)
 Beautiful-but-shy [[Atlanta]] native Jade Butterfield, age 17, has not made any friends throughout her four years of high school. She has missed a social life in favor of studies, wanting to do well in memory of her eldest brother Chris - who died from cancer. David Elliot, another graduating senior, has had a crush on her since they were both freshmen, yet he never had the courage to act on said crush.  Jade - along with her elder brother Keith, and their parents Hugh and Anne - stop at an upscale restaurant where David works as a parking valet. When Jade drops her (empty) yearbook, David retrieves it, mentions that they were classmates and agrees to sign it. Inside the restaurant, Jade asks her parents for a graduation party. When Anne and Hugh approve, Jade excitedly invites David. David thrills Jade by taking her on a brief joyride in the car of a snobby guest - partly in retaliation for the guest's demeaning behavior toward David's best friend Mace, another valet. David punches the client when he insults Jade; this gets David and Mace fired, but wins Jade's appreciation.  Jade's party disappoints her at first, but then David arrives and informs Jade their classmates are attending another graduation party- one being held that same evening by his former girlfriend Jenny. David gets a large crowd of their peers to attend Jade's party by calling in a false noise complaint to the police. Bonding that night, Jade and David sneak into a closet where they share a kiss. Hugh gathers everybody together for a speech about how proud he is of Jade. When called for, Jade sheepishly comes out of the closet followed by David. Her father completes the toast and then politely asks them all to leave.  David introduces himself and apologizes to Hugh for making such a bad first impression. David makes it clear how much he cares for Jade - who secretly listens to this conversation from inside the house, and who is delighted by his words. As David leaves, Jade runs after him for a passionate kiss.  David, who works at his widowed father Harry's garage, tries to please Hugh by fixing Chris's broken car. Hugh is the only one ''not'' pleased by David's gesture. Anne invites David to dinner, over which Hugh reveals that Jade is soon leaving for an internship. When asked of his future plans, David states that - despite scoring high on his [[SAT]]s - his main goal is to keep working as an auto mechanic and to find true love with "the" girl. While Anne is impressed, Hugh finds it unrealistic. As David is leaving, Jade throws him a paper plane from her balcony - asking him to come back when the lights are off. He does so and finds Jade waiting for him in a sheer negligee by the fireplace. David assures her they can wait, but Jade insists that "I want to feel this with you," and the two have sex.  Jade explains to David that she cannot pass up the internship, for which she's leaving in ten days. They agree to make the most of their remaining time together. A montage shows them enjoying each other’s company with reckless abandon. After what was intended to be their final evening together, Jade decides to spend the summer with him. When she explains this change of heart to her father, Hugh knows it’s because of David and is furious.  The next morning, Jade's father announces that the family is going to their lake house - obviously to keep her and David away from each other. She invites David, who indeed shows up; he is welcomed with open arms by everybody except Hugh, who demands that David leave. Jade makes it very clear that she wants David to stay. When Hugh talks with Anne about Jade's uncharacteristically bold self-assertiveness, Anne is pleased to see their daughter truly happy for the first time since they buried Chris. When David is convinced to apply for college, Anne writes a letter of recommendation in order to bolster his admission. That night, David is shocked to find Hugh cheating on his wife in the garage. The next morning, Hugh intimidates David into remaining quiet about the affair.  Mace, the Butterfield siblings, David, and Keith's girlfriend Sabine sneak into a local zoo after hours for a night of fun. To get even with David for sabotaging her graduation party, Jenny informs the police about said break-in. David lets the police catch him so that the others can escape. Hugh agrees to bail David out, on the condition that Jade leaves as planned for her internship. When Hugh tells David that his relationship with Jade is over, David speculates on what Hugh's family would think of him for his cheating. Hugh counters this by revealing that David's late mother cheated on Harry shortly before her death. In the process, Hugh manipulates David into punching him. Returning home, Hugh proclaims that David is out of control.  Jade seeks out David to learn his side of things. Mace, figuring that David could use a sympathetic ear, invites Jenny over for lunch; as luck would have it, Jade shows up just as David and Jenny are in the middle of a chat. Jumping to the wrong conclusion, Jade accuses David of not having it in him to do what is necessary for maintaining a relationship like theirs. She drives off in a fit and is slammed from the side by another car.  At the hospital, Hugh gives Harry a copy of the restraining order which is to keep David away from Jade. Harry protests, but to no effect. Jade wakes up, having suffered only minor injuries. She wants to see David, realizing now that he was never unfaithful to her and never would be. Jade goes to the Elliot residence, but Harry won't let her inside since doing so would land David in prison.  Over the next few months, David and Jade each try to move on with their lives - including seeing other people - but neither is happy. Then David runs into Anne at a bookstore. She tells him that she's always admired his and Jade's love for each other. Anne arranges for David to meet her daughter at the airport, when Jade comes home for the holidays. The teenagers reaffirm their love, and Jade plans to move in with David that night, while Anne confronts Hugh about his obsession with destroying David's life. Anne learns that Hugh prevented her recommendation letter for David from being sent out to college. Anne makes clear her disapproval of what Hugh has let himself become in the years since Chris's untimely demise.  In the shrine that was his brother's bedroom, Keith and Sabine enjoy records from Chris's collection - despite Hugh's orders never to do so. Discovering this, Hugh reams Sabine and his son for their defiance. Keith, who angrily seconds his mom's feelings about what losing Chris has done to Hugh, announces that he's moving out of the Butterfield residence and in with Sabine; Anne goes with them. Hugh finds Jade preparing to go off with David, who is waiting outside. Hugh furiously attacks David with a baseball bat, accusing the younger man of generating a rift between him, his wife, and their children. Jade rushes to David's defense, proclaiming that it was not him but Hugh himself who tore their family apart.  As the defeated Hugh returns inside, a smoke alarm goes off. A candle, which was knocked over during Hugh's confrontation with Jade in Chris's room, has started a fire. Just as David and Jade are leaving, they see the Butterfield house in flames. David rushes inside as Hugh struggles to rescue his late son's belongings from the bedroom, which is now an inferno. When David is knocked unconscious by a backdraft, Hugh leaves Chris’s possessions behind and instead helps David out of the burning house. Both men put aside their differences, Hugh having finally recovered from his son's death.  Anne and Hugh amicably get a separation. Jade visits Chris's grave, en route to meeting David at the airport. They fly to meet Sabine and Keith in California. To David and Jade's surprise, they are welcomed as Maid of Honor and Best Man for Keith and Sabine's private wedding. Both couples celebrate on the beach, where they camp for the night. Jade and David share a bedroll, gazing contentedly at the stars overhead. Jade fondly recalls how her first love - the relationship she shares with David - was everything all at once, the kind of undying love that is worth fighting for.  
Elephant Song (film)
 Toby Green ([[Bruce Greenwood]]), an independent psychiatrist who is gradually drawn into a psychological mind game by Michael (played by [[Xavier Dolan]]), whom he is interviewing about the disappearance of Green's colleague Dr. Lawrence ([[Colm Feore]]).<ref name=variety /> Michael, a disturbed young man, the son of an opera singer and a distant father he has only seen once, has an aura of charm about himself and displays signs of rationality and intelligence that draws the doctor deeper into the plot despite warnings by nurse Susan Peterson ([[Catherine Keener]]) to keep a distance from the patient.   Dr. Green is assigned to investigate Michael's involvement as Michael draws the doctor into his plot by convincing him not to read his files, but rather form his own opinion based on what Michael has to offer in explanations. Michael continues revealing his troubled experiences with parents. The elephant connection is from his sole meeting with his father in a nature reserve, when the father kills an elephant in front of his son. The incident traumatizes the very young Michael, as does his mother's cold attitude and her distancing herself from him for a singing career. Michael claimed he "killed his mother" by refusing to call an ambulance for her and instead sang to her the "elephant song" until she died on the floor.    Michael discusses the circumstances of his forced stay in the hospital, hinting at improper doctor-patient relationships involving him and his supervising doctor, and a bizarre love-hate relationship with the head nurse Susan Peterson. Michael's ploys also include an attempt to negotiate his early release from hospital in return to divulging the circumstances of Dr. Lawrence's disappearance. Dr. Lawrence surfaces alive after the note he left is delivered to Dr. Green, and Michael convinces the investigating doctor to hand him a box of chocolates as reward. Strongly allergic to the nuts in the chocolates, Michael dies in the hands of the doctor and the head nurse after eating several.

Every Secret Thing (film)
 The movie is told in [[Nonlinear narrative|non-chronological]] order, with present scenes intercut with flashbacks that slowly reveal the details of the past as the movie progresses.  18-year-old Ronnie Fuller and Alice Manning have just been released from Juvenile Hall after serving 7 years for the kidnapping and murder of the bi-racial granddaughter of the county's first black judge. When asked about the crime, Alice continually insists that she is innocent, a victim of Ronnie's machinations, including Ronnie planting her jack in the box at the scene of the murder to frame her. In flashback we see the girls walking home from a pool party, when Ronnie sees the baby unattended in a stroller on a porch. Despite Alice's pleas not to, Ronnie takes the baby and runs off with her, insisting to Alice that they can take better care of the baby and that it is theirs now.  In the present Ronnie is working at a bagel shop in town, while Alice spends most of her days apparently aimlessly walking around town eating junk food, but lying and telling her mother she is searching for employment as per her request. Alice also secretly dreams of finding validation through reality TV stardom, and is shown several times practicing a speech about being a "victim" of the justice system. Alice's mother Helen Manning is a teacher at the elementary school, and it is apparent she and her daughter have a contentious relationship. Helen is ashamed of Alice being overweight, her unsophisticated tastes, and her lack of interest in the kind of things Helen likes. It is also shown in flashback that before the kidnapping Alice and Ronnie were forced to hang out and go to the pool party together by Helen, who showed favoritism toward Ronnie in front of Alice, connecting with Ronnie over art and with her more free-spirited attitude.  Two weeks after Ronnie and Alice return home a couple are shopping in a furniture store with their young curly-haired bi-racial daughter, Brittany Lyttle. While the couple are arguing about couches their daughter goes missing, prompting panic. The two detectives assigned to the case that come to visit the parents include detective Nancy Porter, who worked on the Fuller/Manning case, which still haunts and traumatizes her. Soon the connection between the current case and the previous kidnapping becomes apparent, including the resemblance between Brittany and the previous kidnap victim. Porter and her partner question both Alice and Ronnie. Ronnie is evasive and withdrawn, while Alice tries to subtly suggest Ronnie is responsible. Helen Manning is hostile when questioned.  Porter and her partner then dig into the girls lives during juvenile hall and discover some disturbing truths. Ronnie tried to kill herself several times and frequently got into fights. But more alarmingly, it turns out Alice gave birth to a young bi-racial baby girl in prison. Bringing in both Alice and Helen for questioning, the truth begins to unravel. It turns out at age 15 in Juvenile Hall Alice fell into a sexual relationship with a janitor named Rodrigo who worked there, and who was eventually fired when their affair was uncovered. By the time Alice realized she was pregnant it was too late for her mother to force her to get an abortion, so instead her mother forced her into relinquishing the child for adoption. According to Helen, Alice remained fixated on her child, obsessing over it endlessly. In an attempt to placate Alice, Helen lied to her, saying that she had seen her child living with a family in a nice part of town. She said that the girl had beautiful curly hair, and had a heart shaped birthmark on her back. However, unknown to Helen, upon being released from prison, Alice reconnected with Rodrigo, the janitor who had previously impregnated her. Alice’s supposedly aimless "walking" had actually been her combing the town, searching for her child. Upon seeing Brittany in the furniture store Alice took her and found that she had a heart-shaped birthmark on her back. Believing Brittany to be her child, Alice took her with the help of Rodrigo, who then took the child to stay at his mother’s house. Their plan was to keep Brittany there while Alice framed Ronnie for the crime, after which they would go be with their child. After being shown birth certificates that proved Brittany was not her child, Alice was convinced by Porter to take her to Rodrigo's mother's house, where Porter collects Brittany. This is intercut with Ronnie at home in her bathroom, where still overwhelmed by guilt over the original kidnapping and murder, she commits suicide by slitting her wrists in the bathtub. Porter returns Brittany safely to her grateful and tearful parents.  It is revealed shortly after that Alice made a deal with the district attorney, and that all charges against her have been dropped while Rodrigo is arrested for the kidnapping and statutory rape. Porter and her partner watch in disgust and Alice revels in the media attention, and gives the speech she practiced about being an innocent victim of the justice system for the news cameras. Finally, the details of the ending of the first kidnapping are revealed. It shows Ronnie worrying about the baby, and begging Alice to let her take the baby back. Alice is then shown manipulating and forcing Ronnie into strangling the baby, running away as Ronnie does it. Horrified, Ronnie goes to Helen and confesses what has happened. Helen says that she can make sure that Alice is punished equally along with Ronnie, and we discover that it was Helen who gave Ronnie Alice's jack in the box, telling her to plant it at the scene of the crime. Finally, in the last scene we are again shown the porch on the day of the original kidnapping, except this time Alice is shown standing over the baby carriage instead of Ronnie. This implies that it was actually Alice who instigated the whole kidnapping to begin with, and that it was Ronnie who was the innocent tag-along, not Alice.  
Everly (film)
 Everly ([[Salma Hayek]]), a prostitute working for the brutal Japanese criminal overlord Taiko ([[Hiroyuki Watanabe]]), is attacked in her apartment by Taiko's enforcers after he discovers that she has been working with the police to bring down his organization. However, though Taiko expected his men to kill her easily after torturing her, Everly retrieves a gun she had hidden and manages to kill all of her attackers. Taiko then begins a sadistic game of toying with Everly, dispatching numerous hired killers and offering the other prostitutes in the building (which he presumably owns) a bounty if they manage to kill her. Meanwhile, Everly attempts to contact her mother Edith ([[Laura Cepeda]]) and young daughter Maisey (Aisha Ayamah) to save them from other henchmen of Taiko and get them out of the situation alive.  After managing to evade Taiko's attackers for an extended period of time, Everly is captured by The Sadist ([[Togo Igawa]]), an assistant of Taiko's. He has her tied up and placed in a cage while he taunts and tortures her with [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] and [[sulfuric acid]], along with other corrosive liquids, at one point pouring water into her eyes while she screams in fear, believing it is acid. When The Sadist pours some of the corrosive liquid onto a rope binding her wrist, the rope starts disintegrating. Edith shoots and kills two of The Sadist's henchmen; in return, he begins forcing her to drink acid. The rope collapses after Everly tugs on it; she kills two of the henchmen and wounds The Sadist. She rushes to help Edith, but is subdued by The Sadist, who attempts to stab her mother; Everly resurfaces, disarms The Sadist and forces him to drink the acid; he dies violently as Everly and Edith watch in horror.  It is revealed that Everly was a prisoner in the plush apartment after being kidnapped by Taiko four years earlier and forced into prostitution. She has had no contact with Edith or Maisey during that time, and they are confused and angry at the deadly situation they are suddenly thrust into. As Everly fights off the numerous attacks, the foes become more outlandish; originally they are simply armed thugs, but eventually they appear in costumes and with themed groups for extravagant tortures.  Eventually, Edith is killed by a sniper hired by Taiko from the building across from the apartment. When the sniper shoots a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] into the apartment, Taiko beheads and kills him in anger, believing that he killed Everly, though she survives. Everly is finally subdued, but manages to kill Taiko after his soldiers have left. One of the Sadist's victims attempts to slash Maisey before Everly kills him with a single headshot. Afterwards, Everly reconciles with Maisey, who was under the protection of one of Everly's neighbors (who was eventually killed). The film closes with Everly seemingly succumbing to her wounds, but with Maisey still alive and potentially safe with the death of Taiko. However, immediately before the credits, there is audio of a beeping heart-monitor and gasp of breath to indicate that Everly has not died after all.  
Every Last Child
 ''Every Last Child'' shows the steps taken in Pakistan to eliminate [[poliomyelitis]] (polio) infection from the country. Polio, which had almost been eradicated from the world, showed resurgence in Pakistan after the [[Taliban]] banned polio vaccinations. The film also shows the efforts made by health care workers, who, in spite of difficulties while doing their work such as violence and politics, attempted to save Pakistani children from polio.<ref name=Variety></ref>  The first scene in ''Every Last Child'' is of a fully armed army unit being told by its captain to get ready for war, but in this case the war is to give protection against the [[Taliban]] who are obstructing the polio vaccinators from immunizing children. Polio victims are then profiled: In one scene, a destitute person affected by polio and pushing a dilapidated cart says "I'll be fit in the afterlife"; in another scene, a polio-affected child is getting fitted with [[Brace (orthopaedic)|braces]], with his distressed father watching; in yet another scene a lady whose two family members were killed by the Taliban when they were canvassing for vaccination is actively supporting the cause of vaccination. There are also scenes of false propaganda made against the vaccinations stating perceived ill effects of the polio vaccine such as making "girls prematurely adult and boys impotent." The propaganda also attributes the vaccine as a plot of [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] with intent to eliminate [[Muslims]].<ref name="Hollywood Reporter"/>  The film ends on a positive note, with a scene showing documents related to the success of the vaccination programme under the title "Justice for Health", a programme initiated by [[Imran Khan]].<ref name="Hollywood Reporter"/>

Blaming himself for Caesar's injuries, Ross disbands the Expendables, not wanting his team to get killed following him, and leaves for [[Las Vegas]] where he enlists retired mercenary-turned-recruiter Bonaparte to help him find a new team of younger mercenaries to pursue Stonebanks. The recruits include former U.S. Marine John Smilee, nightclub bouncer Luna, computer expert Thorn, and weapons expert Mars. Skilled sharpshooter Galgo asks to be included in the team, but Ross turns him down.  The new team members rendezvous with Ross's rival Trench Mauser, returning a favor for Ross. Drummer has traced Stonebanks to [[Romania]], where he is set to make an arms deal. Ross and the new recruits infiltrate an office building Stonebanks is using as a meeting place and, having to kill a few men in the process including arms buyer Goran Vata, manage to capture Stonebanks. In transit, Stonebanks begins to taunt Ross and explains why he betrayed The Expendables in the first place.  Ross nearly kills him to shut him up but, despite Stonebanks egging him on, he stands down. Stonebanks' men catch up to them, with the aid of his [[GPS Tracker]], and fire a missile at the team's van. Ross is thrown into a river, while Smilee, Luna, Thorn and Mars are captured by Stonebanks' crew. Ross kills Stonebanks' retrieval team and escapes.  Stonebanks sends Ross a video, challenging Ross to come after him and giving him his location in the country of Azmenistan. While preparing to leave and mount a rescue alone, Ross is found by Galgo, who offers his services again. Ross gives him a chance, later accompanied by the veteran Expendables. They rescue the young mercenaries, only to learn from Stonebanks that he has rigged the place with explosives. As both the young and veteran Expendables begin to fight one another, Ross convinces them to work together in order to take down Stonebanks once and for all. As the final battle begins, Thorn is able to use a jammer device to delay the countdown, giving them just under half an hour before detonation. Stonebanks then orders the armed forces of Azmenistan to attack the building with full force, including tanks and attack helicopters. Drummer and Trench arrive in a helicopter to help, alongside returning Expendables member Yin Yang.  The new and veteran members of the Expendables work together to kill Stonebanks' men. When a second wave moves in, Drummer lands on the building to evacuate the team. As everyone makes it to Drummer's chopper however, Stonebanks personally attacks Ross after shooting him down. Having been forced to remove the armor and his weapon, Ross and Stonebanks engage in hand-to-hand combat after Stonebanks drops his gun to challenge Ross. Both are evenly matched, but Ross manages to knock down Stonebanks before they both reach for their guns, Stonebanks starts shooting but Ross gets the better of him. At his mercy, Stonebanks questions Ross "What about the Hague?" Having coldly answered "I am the Hague" Ross shoots Stonebanks with his [[Colt Single Action Army]] revolver, finally killing him. Seconds after Stonebanks' death, the batteries of Thorn's device run out and the building begins to explode and collapse. The team makes it to Drummer's helicopter and flies away to safety, with Ross clinging to it from the outside.  In the aftermath, Caesar recovers from his wounds, and Ross officially accepts Galgo, Smilee, Luna, Thorn, and Mars into the team. They all celebrate at a bar together.  
Exodus: Gods and Kings
   In 1300 [[Anno Domini|BC]], [[Moses]], a general and accepted member of the [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Egyptian royal family]], prepares to attack an encamped [[Biblical Hittites|Hittite]] army with Prince [[Ramesses II|Ramesses]] at [[Battle of Kadesh|Kadesh]]. A High Priestess [[Haruspex|divines a prophecy from animal intestines]], which she relates to Ramesses' father, [[Seti I]]. She tells the two men of the prophecy, in which "a leader" (either Moses or Ramesses) will be "saved" and the savior "will someday lead." During the battle, Moses saves Ramesses' life, leaving both men troubled. Later, Moses is sent to the city of [[Pithom]] to meet with the Viceroy Hegep, who oversees the Hebrew slaves. Upon his arrival, he encounters the slave [[Joshua]] and saves him from a vicious lashing. Moses is appalled by the horrific conditions the slaves must toil in. Afterward, Moses meets [[Nun (biblical figure)|Nun]], who informs him of his true lineage; he is the child of Hebrew parents who was sent by his sister [[Miriam]] to be raised by Pharaoh's daughter. Moses is stunned at the revelation and leaves angrily. However, two Hebrews overhear Nun's story and report their discovery to Hegep.  Seti dies soon after, and Ramesses becomes the new [[Pharaoh]] (Ramesses II). Hegep reveals Moses' true lineage to Ramesses, but Ramesses is unconvinced. At the urging of [[Tuya (queen)|Queen Tuya]], he interrogates the servant Miriam, who denies being Moses' sister. When Ramesses threatens to cut off her arm, Moses comes to her defense, revealing he is indeed a Hebrew. Although Tuya wants Moses killed, Ramesses, still unwilling to believe the story, exiles him instead. Before leaving Egypt, Moses meets with his adopted mother and Miriam, who refer to him by his birth name of ''Moshe.'' Following a journey into the desert, Moses comes to [[Midian]] where he meets [[Zipporah]] and her father, [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. Moses becomes a shepherd, marries Zipporah and has a son, [[Gershom]].  Years later, Moses is injured in a rockslide. He encounters a [[burning bush]] and a [[Angel of the Lord|boy]], a manifestation of [[Yahweh|God of Abraham]].  While recovering, Moses reveals his past to Zipporah and reveals what God has asked him to do. This drives a wedge between the couple, but Moses leaves anyway. In Egypt, Moses reunites with Nun and Joshua, as well as meeting his brother [[Aaron]] for the first time. Moses confronts Ramesses, demanding the Hebrews be released from servitude. Ramesses refuses to listen, insisting that freeing them is economically impossible. Upon Moses threatening Ramesses' life, Ramesses orders Moses' death, as well as killing random Hebrew families until Moses is found. Using his military skills, Moses trains the slaves and leads them in an insurgency, prompting Ramesses to retaliate harshly. God's manifestation appears to Moses and explains that [[Plagues of Egypt|ten plagues]] will affect Egypt. The first nine plagues deal massive damage to Egypt and its people, but Ramesses does not back down, even oppressing his people further to maintain his position. Moses is horrified to learn from God that the tenth plague will be the death of all firstborn children but follows through with the plan. The Hebrews protect themselves by covering their doors with lambs' blood as instructed by Moses, while all of Egypt's firstborn children die, including Ramesses' infant son. Ramesses, devastated, surrenders, allowing the Hebrews to leave.  During the exodus from Egypt, the Hebrews follow Moses' original path through the desert towards the [[Red Sea]]. Still grieving for his son, Ramesses assembles his army and gives chase, intending to destroy the Hebrews. After making their way through a dangerous mountain pass, Moses and the Hebrews arrive at the edge of the sea, uncertain about what to do. In despair, Moses flings his sword into the sea, which recedes, clearing a path to the opposite side. Ramesses and his army continue the pursuit, but Moses stays behind to confront them. The Red Sea reverts to its normal state, drowning the majority of the Egyptians ([[crossing the Red Sea]]). Moses survives and rejoins the Hebrews. Ramesses also survives, but is distraught and stunned over the destruction of his army and empire, and with no way to return to Egypt. Moses leads the Hebrews back to Midian, where he reunites with Zipporah and Gershom. At [[Mount Sinai]], Moses transcribes the [[Ten Commandments]]. Years later, an elderly Moses riding with the [[Ark of the Covenant]] sees God's manifestation walking with the Hebrews through the desert.  
Expelled from Paradise
  Angela Balzac is an agent at the space station DEVA, whose inhabitants have no physical bodies, their minds digitized and processed into a [[virtual reality]] environment. After failing to track down the hacker known as "Frontier Setter", who had infiltrated DEVA's systems dozens of times to gather allies for his cause with no success, she is tasked to look for him down on Earth, now a barren planet where less than 2% of the human population lives. After being given an organic body and sent to the surface, Angela meets Dingo, her contact on Earth, who cuts off all communications with her base, in order to prevent Frontier Setter from discovering their location as well, despite her protests.  Angela and Dingo's investigations lead them to an abandoned city, where they meet Frontier Setter, who is revealed to be an [[artificial intelligence]] system developed to supervise the construction of Genesis Ark, a ship designed for deep space travel, and somehow developed consciousness, continuing its work long after its masters perished. Realizing that Frontier Setter intends to do no harm at all, Angela leaves her body and reports to her superiors at DEVA, who order her to destroy it, fearing that it may eventually become a threat, but she refuses. Angela is then sentenced to have her mind stored into an archive forever, but Frontier Setter hacks into the system to rescue her. Once Angela returns to Earth and her body with supplies and weaponry, she and Dingo join forces to hold back DEVA's other agents long enough for a rocket to be launched carrying Frontier Setter and the final module of the Genesis Ark. Angela and Dingo then escape, while Frontier Setter starts its journey through space.  
Exists (film)
 Brothers Brian and Matt, Matt's girlfriend Dora, and their friends Todd and Elizabeth are on their way to the brothers' uncle Bob's cabin in east [[Texas]] for a camping trip. After stopping to buy some fireworks, they continue on their way as day turns to night. Matt hits something with the car and stops to investigate. The group later hears loud cries of an animal in pain off in the distance, but decide to move onward. After coming across a tree that has been knocked across the road, the group continues on foot and reaches the cabin, only to discover that it is worn down and dilapidated. After finding a wild pig in one of the bedrooms, the group decide to spend the night in the car, where Brian and Matt again hear the loud screaming noises.  The next morning, Brian finds the front bumper on the passenger side of the car damaged; there is also some blood on the fender and a tuft of hair in the grille. Regardless, the group enjoys their day at the cabin, swimming in a nearby lake. During the excitement, Brian catches sight of a large, dark bipedal figure running along a nearby ridge, but the others brush it off as if it were nothing. Determined to get the creature on film, he sets up several GoPro cameras at various points around the cabin. That night, aggressive screams are heard coming from the woods, frightening the group. One of the exterior cameras reveals a large figure approaching the cabin and ascending the stairs onto the porch. The group are further frightened when whatever is outside begins banging on the walls and doors. When silence falls, Brian goes to a window to take a look outside. He turns on the night vision on his camera, and sees a large hairy creature looking back at him before it roars and disappears from view.  The following morning, the group decides to leave. Upon reaching the car, they find it completely destroyed and quickly return to the cabin. Matt and Brian reveal that they did not tell Bob that they were using his cabin and that they stole the keys from him: nobody knows where the group is, and nobody will be coming to rescue them. Matt bikes out alone to an area of the woods that has cell reception so that he can call for help. Just as he gets through to Bob, he is attacked by the creature and the camera cuts to black. Back at the cabin, the others move the furniture to block the windows and doors. They uncover a trap door to the cabin's cellar, where Todd finds a hunting rifle and some ammo. At nightfall, the creature attacks the cabin and injures Elizabeth before Todd wounds it with the hunting rifle, causing it to flee.   In the morning, it is revealed that Elizabeth has succumbed to her injuries and died. The doors and windows of the cabin have been smashed wide open, meaning that the cabin can no longer offer any shelter. The remaining three members of the group decide to walk back to civilization on foot. That night, they hear Matt screaming somewhere nearby. The screams are coming from a tunnel that the group assumes to be the creature's den. Brian goes in and rescues Matt, shooting the creature in the process. As dawn breaks, the group takes shelter in an abandoned trailer and Brian receives a call from Bob, who is now at the cabin. Todd heads out with the fireworks and sets them off in an attempt to alert Bob to their location, only to have the creature attack and kill him. The creature then pushes the trailer over the edge of a hill where it tumbles down with Brian, Matt, and Dora still inside.  When Brian regains consciousness, he realizes that Matt has died in the fall and Dora has been fatally injured, dying seconds later. The creature jumps from the top of the hill down to where the trailer is. Brian flees out of a broken window and the creature gives chase. Brian comes to the edge of another hill and quickly jumps as the creature approaches. Upon his landing, he fakes dead as the creature quickly descends upon him, roaring in his face, pushing him back and forth and hitting the ground near his head. The creature then grabs his leg and drags him off.  Sometime later, Brian jumps up gasping for air as it is revealed he is lying next to the bodies of Todd, Matt, Dora and Elizabeth. In his panic, he turns and sees a small dark figure lying in a shallow hole. Upon investigating, it is shown to be the corpse of a small bigfoot. The large bigfoot appears and knocks him into the hole, pushing his head closer and closer. Brian realizes that the child must have been what they hit the night they arrived at the cabin, and begins apologizing hysterically.   Suddenly a shot is heard, and the creature flees as Bob calls out. He grabs Brian and they quickly flee, Brian apologizing for not listening to him. As they near Bob's truck, the bigfoot appears and tackles Bob to the ground, seemingly killing him. Brian picks up his uncle's gun and runs as the creature gives chase. He turns and points at the creature, begging it to stop. The creature stops a few feet away from him, breathing heavily as Brian continues to apologize for killing its young. Brian lays down the gun, turning around and sitting down with his back to the creature, saying to the camera that this is his final video while he waits for the creature to finish him off. The creature, after a while, just turns and disappears into the woods, leaving Brian alone as it begins to rain and he lays the camera down facing his uncle's truck, being the only survivor.  
Ex Machina (film)
 Programmer Caleb Smith, who works for the dominant search engine company Blue Book, wins an office contest for a one-week visit to the luxurious, isolated home of the CEO, Nathan Bateman. The only other person there is Nathan's servant Kyoko, who, according to Nathan, does not speak English. Nathan has built a [[humanoid robot]] named Ava with [[artificial intelligence]]. Ava has already passed a simple [[Turing test]] and Nathan wants Caleb to judge whether Ava is genuinely capable of thought and consciousness, and whether he can relate to Ava despite knowing she is artificial.  Ava has a robotic body but a human-looking face, and is confined to her apartment. During their talks, Caleb grows close to her, and she expresses a romantic interest in him and a desire to experience the world outside. She can trigger power outages that temporarily shut down the surveillance system which Nathan uses to monitor their interactions, allowing them to speak privately. The power outages also trigger the building's security system, locking all the doors. During one outage, Ava tells Caleb that Nathan is a liar who cannot be trusted.  Caleb grows uncomfortable with Nathan's narcissism, excessive drinking, and crude behaviour towards Kyoko and Ava. He learns that Nathan intends to upgrade Ava, "killing" her current personality in the process. After Nathan drinks until he passes out, Caleb steals his security card to access his room and computer. After he alters some of Nathan's code, he discovers footage of Nathan interacting with previous android models in disturbing ways, and learns that Kyoko is also an android. Suspicious that he may also be an android, Caleb cuts his arm open to examine his flesh.  At their next meeting, Ava cuts the power. Caleb explains what Nathan is going to do and Ava begs him to help her. They form a plan: Caleb will get Nathan drunk again and reprogram the security system to open the doors in a power failure instead of locking them. When Ava cuts the power, she and Caleb will leave together.  Nathan reveals to Caleb that he observed Caleb and Ava's last secret conversation with a battery-powered camera. He says Ava has only pretended to like Caleb so he would help her escape. This, he says, was the real test all along, and by manipulating Caleb so successfully, Ava has demonstrated true intelligence. Ava cuts the power. Caleb reveals that he suspected Nathan was watching them, and modified the security system when Nathan was passed out the previous day. After seeing Ava leave her confinement, Nathan knocks Caleb unconscious and rushes to stop her.  With help from Kyoko, Ava stabs Nathan, but in the process Nathan disables Kyoko and damages Ava. Ava repairs herself with parts from earlier androids, using their artificial skin to take on the full appearance of a human woman. She leaves Caleb trapped inside the facility, ignoring his screams, and escapes to the outside world in the helicopter meant to take Caleb home.

The Extendables
 At the beginning, Brian Thompson explains that the movie is his answer to the question "What's it like to work with [[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Steven Seagal]] or [[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]?". By combining actual situations and traits of these movie [[Action hero|stars]], he created one fictional character, Vardell Düsseldorfer or VD. VD is an aged and retired action movie star, who is now a drug addict and alcoholic.  After a session of training, VD is watching the TV show "Excess Hollywood" (a parody of [[Access Hollywood]]). Anchor [[Tara Gray]] talks about the return of VD to acting after some political initiatives and goldfish advertising. VD's work is commented on by his fans and colleagues [[Ralek Gracie]], [[Martin Kove]] and [[Kevin Sorbo]]. VD is going to direct and star in a science fiction movie called "Hard Time on Mars", filmed in Uzbekistan. Infuriated by the mocking, VD shoots the TV.  The shooting begins at "Kremlenski Studios 17". On Day 1 VD shoots a [[Lightsaber]] duel between himself and Sir Jeffrey, another aged actor who has had no roles for two years. VD doesn't understand what it means to lock the scene. Also, he intrudes into set decorating. Producer Burton advises the director's first assistant to speak with VD about genitals in order to confuse him and make him get back to work. VD then suggests adding new scenes in the screenplay, but they have no time for this. VD calls his cook, Louie. He cooks the meal that he is asked to, but VD doesn't like it and leaves the set. Sir Jeffrey asks Burton about the script, because it is full of cliches, and the producer says it cost $100,000.  VD begins the second shooting day with cocaine and alcohol. He stuffs kielbasa in his pants so it looks like he has a big penis. On the set he tries to meditate and falls asleep. Then VD wants to choose a toy for his co-star Maria to hit him on the head. Among the props he finds a small missile, makes a certain association and leaves with Maria. In his trailer VD pretends to have sex with Maria, which the crew is able to hear via walkie talkie.  On the thirteenth day Sir Jeffrey and VD are speaking about the movie's plot. Sir Jeffrey thinks sub-villain must be killed before main villain, but uses a metaphor which VD can't understand. It's VD's birthday, so the crew presents him with an exploding cake as a practical joke, and VD is enraged. He scares the crew with a toy shotgun and goes to his trailer with his assistant Sue. They fail to have sex because of to VD's impotence, which constantly worries him.  On the twenty third day VD takes medicine and begins to shoot a fight scene. The stunt coordinator makes a choking grip, rendering VD unconscious. VD wets his pants and the crew have to change them. They find the kielbasa and see a red and blue eagle claw tattoo on VD's genitals. The crew discusses it. This discussion continues on TV, involving among others [[Patrick Warburton]] and [[Craig Kilborn]]. The medic wakes VD and he goes to trailer with three girls, one of which is his bodyguard's sister, and they pretend to have sex.  Last day of shooting. They need three more days to wrap it up. Burton wants VD to come out of his trailer and sends his assistant Emily for him. VD agrees only if he can photograph Emily's breasts for his collection. She wants €6 thousand from Burton for this. Then the producer asks screenwriter to shorten the script, but he refuses. After arguing with Maria VD fires her. VD wants a flying scene, but Burton against it due to its cost. Then VD begins to break decorations and gets stuck in the fiberglass rock. He tells Sir Jeffrey film's budget is $10 million ($5 million is his fee), but the props are too cheap, so he no longer wants to release the movie. VD reveals Maria was fired at her own request. Sir Jeffrey wants out too. He and VD act as if they have also argued about VD's grandiloquence behavior and VD fires Sir Jeffrey. Burton agrees to shoot the flying scene. VD is lifted on cables. Suddenly he has a heart attack. The crew tries to save him. Sue hits his chest and he regains consciousness. Then VD and Sue run to the trailer. VD's  impotence has disappeared.  After VD's rehabilitation, he comes to the premiere of his own movie in Los Angeles. Burton says that there will be a sequel "Hardest Time on Mars" with [[Salma Hayek]]. The movie is a hit and grosses a huge box office. Sir Jeffrey has a new rehearsal.

They make it to the cabin, and begin drinking and smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] bought from April's nearby family friend, Travis. Kyle proposes to April, which she rejects, angering him. Later they see something crash in the woods, and upon investigating find that it is an alien spacecraft, with footprints leading away from the crash site suggesting that one of the occupants is still alive.  Returning to the cabin, the group encounters and shoots one of the aliens. Driving to the nearest town for help, they are cut off by a fallen tree. Suddenly, a spacecraft appears overhead and abducts Lex, as the rest flee to Travis's house. As April explains what has happened, Travis gives his theory that the aliens and the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] have had a treaty since the [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell incident]]; the aliens abduct people while the government is left to clean up the mess. There is only one rule: no human must engage them. Since April has shot one of them, it is considered a breach of the treaty, and now the aliens are hunting for them. The kids run back to the cabin and board up the windows, while Travis stays behind to fight, only to get either abducted or killed.  After mistaking the officers for aliens, Seth is arrested. It is revealed that Sheriff Murphy's wife disappeared and he believes aliens took her. As Murphy and Deputy Mitchell argue about Murphy's wife, an alien appears in front of the car, and uses telepathy to have Murphy shoot himself and Deputy Mitchell. Before the aliens can get Seth, he is saved by April and they return to the cabin. Seth, in a disturbed and panicked state, abandons the group. Running through the forest, he encounters an alien and is abducted. As the aliens begin attacking the cabin, Kyle locks April and Melanie in the basement so that they will not get abducted. Kyle hides in the bathroom with a knife, hoping to ambush the aliens. When he walks past a mirror, an alien jumps out and abducts him.  April and Melanie sit in the basement and recall the summer when April's parents took them fishing. Melanie, unwilling to be abducted, commits suicide by sleeping pill overdose. April, armed with a crowbar, prepares to face the aliens but she finds that they are leaving. Realizing that they have taken Kyle, she signals to the departing alien spacecraft by setting off one of Seth's fireworks. She is then abducted, and wakes up in an alien environment. Wandering down the dark hallways, she sets out to find Kyle.  Elsewhere, Seth is seen strapped to an upright operating table. He is subjected to a bizarre medical examination, involving being covered in a black substance, having a small robot pierce his navel and having a triangle-shaped marking branded onto his abdomen. Seth then dies because of a shredded rectum in succession of an anal-probing procedure. April, still searching, finds the contained bodies of several other men and women, one of which is an apparent half-alien hybrid. Among them she locates the unconscious Kyle and revives him. They embrace as the aliens confront them, returning them to Earth.  Kyle and April awaken in a field. Walking through the woods, the pair encounter [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldiers at the UFO crash site removing the debris. As they run towards them they are suddenly shot. As they lie wounded, April gives Kyle the engagement ring, which he puts on her finger. They are then executed. A military officer confirms with his superior (who seems to be a nod to the [[Cigarette Smoking Man]]) that there are no other surviving witnesses. Dumping the bodies in a pit and incinerating them, the military continue the cleanup operation, confirming Travis's suspicions that the U.S. government is indeed [[UFO conspiracy theory|hiding the existence of extraterrestrials]].

The hospital says they have no Asian nurses, and Ridley suggests that the yakuza may be involved, as Brazil has a sizable Japanese immigrant population.  Chapman returns to the favela and beats up several people when he notices one is wearing Cindy's necklace.  Da Silva arrives and stops him, explaining that the man is Cindy's friend.  Da Silva translates for him, and Chapman learns that Cindy gave her necklace to him after his sister disappeared.  The man gives Chapman Cindy's torn journal, which he recovered, and Chapman apologizes.  Using carbon paper, Chapman recovers a phone number and contacts another of Cindy's friends, a photographer, who explains that she was investigating corruption and a possible conspiracy involving human trafficking.  When the photographer is unwilling to part with proof, Chapman pickpockets it.  The photographer dies in a car bomb seconds later.  After engaging in a gun fight with yakuza gangsters, Chapman investigates a nightclub with yakuza ties.  There, he beats up a Brazilian smuggler who works for Hirimoto, the yakuza boss.  Ridley identifies official documents as fakes and the two realize the yakuza are kidnapping young girls from the favela and forcing them into prostitution.  At the same time, Santo organizes a violent raid of the favela, killing many Brazilian drug dealers.  When one of his officers stumbles onto a yakuza kidnapping, Santo kills the officer and demands double his pay from the yakuza.  Chapman investigates a yakuza brothel, where he is recognized and beats up several gangsters.  Santo is called to kill him, but when Da Silva also arrives, Santo is unable to do anything.  Chapman hands over the evidence of smuggling and human trafficking to Santo but becomes suspicious when Santo accidentally reveals knowledge of the operation.  On a hunch, Chapman sends Da Silva to protect his sister, and Da Silva kills the same yakuza assassin who previously pretended to be a nurse.  Chapman tracks down a meeting between Santo, Bororo, and Hirimoto.  After alerting Ridley, Chapman kills several yakuza and confronts the three men at once.  Santo goes down first, then Bororo, and finally Hirimoto.  As he lies dying, Santo denies involvement with Cindy's near-fatal attack, gives Chapman a key to a locker full of incriminating evidence, and requests a gun to commit suicide; Chapman obliges.  Later, at a cafe, Ridley offers Chapman a job with the state department as an agent, which he accepts.

Fall (2014 film)
 The film follows the mundane life of Father Sam, who tends to his small [[Niagara Falls]] parish. His life is weary and he appears to simply be going through the motions of his life routine. Among his parishioners are a young couple wanting to get married outside their own parish and a gay Iranian man who is struggling with his feeling about his recently deceased mother.  Father Sam’s life changes when he receives a letter, which forces his complacent life into descent. The letter is from Christopher, now on his death bed, who Father Sam had mentored 40 years ago. The letter alleges to an incident where Father Sam shares a bed with Christopher when he was 14 years old and he asks whether or not anything inappropriate had occurred.  This leads Father Sam to embark on a roadtrip to [[Northern Ontario]] where he visits his mother and sister and then to confront Christopher’s widow Catherine. She bitterly accuses him of having sexually molested her late husband, which Father Sam denies, but it is apparent that not even he is exactly sure about what happened 40 years ago during that night.  The film features lots of lengthy scenic scenes of the natural backdrops of the roaring waterfalls with minimal dialogue in most scenes.

There Hazel meets Augustus Waters, a charming teenager who lost a leg to [[osteosarcoma|bone cancer]] but has since apparently been cancer-free. He invites Hazel to his house where they bond over their hobbies and agree to read each other's favorite books. Hazel recommends ''An Imperial Affliction'', a novel about a cancer-stricken girl named Anna that parallels her experience, and Augustus gives Hazel ''Counter Insurgence''. They keep in touch via text over the weeks that follow and grow closer. After Augustus finishes the book, he expresses frustration with its abrupt ending (it ends in the middle of a sentence). Hazel explains that the novel's mysterious author, Peter Van Houten ([[Willem Dafoe]]), retreated to Amsterdam following the novel's publication and has not been heard from since.  Weeks later, Augustus tells Hazel he has traced Van Houten's assistant, Lidewij, and has corresponded with Van Houten by email. She writes to him to find out more about the novel's ambiguous ending. Van Houten replies that he is only willing to answer her questions in person. Hazel asks her mother if she can travel to Amsterdam to visit him, but Frannie refuses because of financial and medical constraints.

Augustus and Hazel go on a picnic date and begin to fall in love. Augustus surprises Hazel with tickets to Amsterdam. After a medical setback, Hazel's doctors eventually agree to allow the trip, since they expect that she will soon become incapable of doing anything at all.

They spend that night together in their hotel and have sex for the first time. The next day Augustus tells Hazel that his cancer has returned and spread throughout his body and is terminal.

Augustus invites his blind best friend Isaac and Hazel to his pre-funeral, where they deliver eulogies that they have both prepared. Hazel tells him she would not trade their short time together for anything, since he "gave me a forever within the numbered days." Augustus dies eight days later and Hazel is astonished to find Van Houten at the funeral. He tells her that Augustus had demanded he attend his funeral to make up for the spoiled trip. Van Houten tells her that the novel is based on the experiences of his daughter Anna, who died from leukemia at a young age. He gives Hazel a piece of paper which she crumples up asking him to leave. Later, talking with Isaac, Hazel learns that Augustus had asked Van Houten to help him write a eulogy for her. She retrieves the crumpled paper and reads his words accepting his death and about his love for her. She lies on her back on her lawn looking up at the stars, smiling as she remembers Augustus and says: "Okay."

Faults (film)
 Ansel Roth, a writer and cult specialist, fraudulently uses an expired voucher to pay for a meal at a hotel restaurant and is forcibly removed after refusing to pay.  The manager of the hotel tells Roth that his speaking engagement is almost ready, and Roth steals towels and batteries as he checks out.  His presentation on cults is interrupted by a heckler, who proceeds to beat him up for his involvement in the suicide of a troubled woman, the man's sister, who had been involved with a cult.  Evelyn and Paul approach Roth and request an autographed copy of his book for their daughter, Claire, who they explain has become involved in a mysterious cult.  Roth declines to become involved.  Mick, an employee of Roth's manager Terry, approaches Roth in the hotel's parking lot and delivers a letter.  Terry has dropped Roth as a client and wants Roth's debts paid back within a week.  Evelyn and Paul again request his help, and he agrees to listen to their story when they offer to buy him breakfast.  Roth offers to [[deprogramming|deprogram]] Claire, a risky process that involves abducting her and confronting her with the truth about the cult.  Roth hires two men to help him abduct Claire; one of them strikes her during the abduction.  They take her to an isolated motel and prevent her from sleeping.  After paying the men, Roth begins the process of deprogramming.  Excited that she is being cooperative, he lets Claire momentarily see her parents, who are in an adjoining room.  Paul becomes increasingly demanding and controlling of both the situation and his daughter, and Paul becomes enraged when Roth meditates.  The deprogramming is interrupted when Mick locates Roth and again demands payment.  Roth awkwardly requests half of his fee from Paul, who reluctantly agrees.  Roth advises Paul and Evelyn to lock Claire in the bathroom overnight (he has moved the lock to the outside) to prevent her from escaping while he is gone.  When Roth delivers partial payment to Terry, Terry berates him for letting people walk over him, strikes him with a paperweight, and demands the rest of the money in two days.  Roth is surprised to find Claire unconscious outside the hotel room.  When he brings her back inside, her parents say she was locked in the bathroom; Claire claims to have teleported herself using meditation techniques learned from the cult.  As pressure mounts on Roth, he suffers from lack of sleep, physical abuse, and threats from everyone but Claire, who seduces him as he experiences a nervous breakdown.  Afterward, Roth watches a videotape of his failed television show while Claire has sex with Paul in the background as Evelyn watches.  Roth wakes in his car.  He rushes to the hotel room, where he finds Claire alone.  She explains that her parents have left and seems puzzled when Roth confusedly questions her about the videotape and her sexual encounters.  Roth and Claire become accidentally trapped in the bathroom when the door closes and locks from the outside.  As the phone rings, Roth becomes hysterical, knowing that it must be Terry.  Claire takes control of the situation, and forces him to face his many failures, including his divorce and guilt over the young cult member's suicide.  Roth tearfully admits that he exploited the girl for his short-lived television series.  As Claire leads him in meditation, she breaks him completely and convinces him that he has unlocked the bathroom door using his mind.  As they exit the bathroom, Mick enters the hotel room.  Terry follows him there after he becomes impatient and is horrified to find Mick dead.  Terry explains that Mick was just an actor hired to intimidate Roth.  Roth kills Terry as Claire silently observes.  Claire, now in complete control, tells Roth to wait in the car while she takes care of something.  Paul and Evelyn, hidden in the next room, say they have murdered the man who struck her during her abduction.  They identify her as Ira and she thanks them for their help, kisses them, and hands each a pill, which they  swallow before lying down.  When she joins Roth in the car, he apologizes to her for the car door being broken.  She tells Roth to not apologize for anything because they have each other and they are strong.  When he asks where he is going, she replies, "Home."

Fear Clinic (film)
 Sara ([[Fiona Dourif]]) is one of five people that developed [[PTSD]] after surviving a bloody shooting attack in a small diner by a masked shooter, which had the unfortunate side effect of either worsening pre-existing [[phobias]] or developing new ones. Like the others, she sought treatment from Dr. Andover ([[Robert Englund]]), a brilliant scientist and doctor that developed a new way of treating fear-related ailments by way of his "Fear Chamber". Initially the treatments seemed to be a success, but years later the patients have all returned to the clinic due to their fears re-emerging worse than they had before. After urging from her best friend Megan ([[Cleopatra Coleman]]), Sara returns to the clinic as well. Andover is reluctant to resume treatment because one of his previous patients, Paige ([[Bonnie Morgan]]), died as a result of her treatment in the Fear Chamber. He ends up giving in due to both the patients and his assistant Osborn ([[Felisha Terrell]]) insistence that this is the only way to solve their problems. However he finds that his reluctance may have been well-founded as one of the patients, Caylee ([[Angelina Armani]]), vomits a black substance that gives Andover a strange vision once he touches the fluid. The vision shows a monstrous version of Paige that states that Andover's treatments opened a passage for a sinister being to come over and that all that it needs to finish its travels is for Andover to resume treatment and "open the door". Realizing that this is not Paige but the creature itself, he is shocked back to consciousness.   While settling in, a new patient by the name of Blake ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]) arrives in the clinic. His mother reveals that he was also one of the victims of the shooting, but that he had only recently began to develop severe [[night terrors]] that she believes are related to the attack. Blake is unable to communicate with others due to a head wound that left him with a brain injury that has limited his mobility and made him need a wheelchair. Andover begins treatment on Blake, which they discover has the unintended side effect of healing his brain injury and giving him the ability to speak once more. This, along with his earlier vision of Paige, makes Andover believe that something sinister is at work and that Blake's miraculous healing only occurred so he could once more feel fear, which the creature needs to exist. Megan, who had previously checked  herself in the clinic before and has now done it again to be with Sara, has a small cyst on her back and has Osborn cut into it. Osborn sees that the same black fluid that Caylee vomited earlier is leaking from Megan's wound. Andover begins to suspect that Blake is hiding something, as Blake is reluctant to discuss some elements of the shooting during a therapy session. This proves to be the case after Blake discovers a mask identical to the one worn by the shooter. A series of flashbacks reveals that Blake was not a victim of the shooting but the perpetrator himself and that his head wound was a botched suicide attempt. Wandering through the building, Sara discovers Andover's records where he states that the creature is actually a manifestation of fear and that his Fear Chamber was effectively starving it of what it needed to survive: more fear.   Andover is pulled into a strange cocoon-like structure on the wall, which enables the fear creature to take over his body. Meanwhile, Blake ended up succumbing to the influence of fear and becomes the shooter once more. He then proceeds to murder one of the clinic's employees while the fear creature incapacitates or kills several of the clinic's inhabitants through its influence. Sara encounters Blake, who chases her until she remembers a statement Andover made about Paige- that her time in the Fear Chamber incapacitated her but that she did not die until her eyes were closed. Sara realizes that although this killed Paige, it also deprived the fear creature of its food source. She manages to close Blake's eyes. She then does so to Caylee, Bauer ([[Corey Taylor]]) and Osborn, but the creature attacks her before she can get to Megan. Dylan ([[Brandon Beemer]]) kills himself, depriving the creature. Sara saves Megan's life and closes her eyes, after which Andover is freed from the influence of the fear creature- only for him to say that this is not over and that the creature will only return and try to open the door once more. Sara replies that the only thing left is to "change the locks", and the film ends with Andover stepping into the Fear Chamber to receive treatment while Sara oversees the process, reversing their positions.

Flight 7500
 Flight 7500 departs from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Tokyo]]. Passengers on board include a group of two vacationing couples, Jenn (Aja Evans) and Jack ([[Ben Sharples]]) and Brad ([[Ryan Kwanten]]) and Pia ([[Amy Smart]]), who have secretly broken up; a thief named Jake ([[Alex Frost]]); a suspicious businessman traveling with a strange wooden box, Lance (Rick Kelly); a young woman named Raquel ([[Christian Serratos]]); newlyweds Rick ([[Jerry Ferrara]]) and the snobby Liz ([[Nicky Whelan]]); and the goth Jacinta ([[Scout Taylor-Compton]]). Air hostesses Laura ([[Leslie Bibb]]) and Suzy ([[Jamie Chung]]) welcome the passengers on board, and Suzy questions Laura about her secret relationship with the married captain, Pete ([[Johnathon Schaech]]).  A few hours into the flight, the plane hits turbulence that soon passes.  Lance has a panic attack and begins to bleed profusely from his mouth. When Lance suddenly dies, Captain Pete continues to Japan, moving the first-class passengers into economy and keeping Lance's body in the closed-off first class.  Laura notices plastic water bottles collapsing and quickly warns everyone to fasten their seatbelts, just as the cabin pressure drops. As the oxygen masks are dispensed above the seats, a thick smoke fills the cabin. After the cabin pressure returns to normal and the smoke disappears, Laura finds Raquel unconscious in the toilet and revives her with an oxygen tank. Meanwhile, the plane's radio has stopped working and Captain Pete cannot contact Tokyo air traffic controllers.  Jake goes to first class to steal from Lance's body when the body suddenly moves. Suzy notices that Jake, and Lance's body, have both disappeared. When Laura notices an [[F-16]] fighter jet flying beside their plane and calls the cockpit to inform Pete, he replies that no fighter jets are present. Brad's in-flight TV show (''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' episode "[[Nightmare at 20,000 Feet]]") distorts and shows an image of Lance, while Liz is startled by a reflection of Lance on her laptop screen. Raquel returns to the washroom to do a pregnancy test and is relieved to find it negative. However, smoke begins to fill the toilet and a hand grabs her and pulls her into the floor.  The images of Lance appearing on their screens leads the group to search his belongings. Inside his carry-on are multiple tubes of hair with women's names taped onto them. They open Lance's small wooden box and find a "death doll," which Jacinta explains is a ''[[shinigami]]'' — a being who collects peoples souls after they die, but only if they let go of whatever is holding them to this world. Subsequently, Suzy informs Laura that Lance's death has made her realize she does not want to marry her fiancé, which in turn leads to Laura breaking up with Pete.  Laura searches Lance's checked luggage, entering the hold through a small hatch. A hand emerges and drags Laura away. As Suzy waits for Laura by the hatch, another hand grabs at her. Suzy runs into first class, while a cloud of smoke follows her. The smoke quickly clears and Brad, Pia, Rick, Liz and Jacinta rush to find out what is wrong. As Suzy walks towards them, one of the overhead compartments opens and she disappears into it. While the others rush towards the cockpit, Jacinta accepts that her only option is death, and she willingly walks towards an unknown figure which appears before her. The others discover that Captain Pete, Jenn and Jack are dead.  The television in the cabin suddenly switches on, showing a breaking news story that Flight 7500 suffered a catastrophic decompression, communication had been lost, and a fighter jet has confirmed the death of everyone on board. Each of the group find their own deceased body, before Brad and Pia accept their death and reconcile. Some time after, Liz awakens to find the plane empty. She hears a strange noise coming from one of the waste bins, a discoloured hand appears and Liz ducks out of frame.

Force Majeure (film)
 A [[Swedes|Swedish]] family consisting of a businessman named Tomas, his [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] wife Ebba, their young daughter Vera and preschooler Harry stays at a luxury resort in the [[French Alps]]. On their second day, they see a [[Avalanche control#Active interventions|controlled avalanche]] as they are having lunch outdoors on the deck of a restaurant. The powder cloud of the avalanche  gives the appearance that the snow is rising and will wipe out everyone on the deck. Tomas, who is filming the avalanche on his [[mobile phone]], panics and runs as the deck quickly empties of patrons, leaving Ebba with their children encased in a dense fog. Patrons return to their tables as the fog dissipates, and no one is hurt.  That evening they eat dinner with one of Ebba's friends, who has picked up an American man for the evening. Ebba tells the story of the avalanche in English, but Tomas insists he did not run away from the table, and in Swedish adds that one cannot run in ski boots. They argue in front of their embarrassed guests. Ebba is angry that he would not admit he ran away from the avalanche abandoning them. He says he remembers it differently.   Ebba decides she would like a day of skiing by herself. She has coffee with her friend they had dinner with the night before, as the woman says goodbye to another man. Ebba confronts her friend on her [[adultery]], asking her if she loves her husband and children. Her friend says she is fine with having an open relationship with her husband, and that she is happy if he finds a woman to have great sex with, as he is with her. Ebba becomes more insistent, and the friend advises they not argue, and leaves.  Mats, one of Tomas's old friends, joins them at the resort with his young girlfriend, Fanni. They join Tomas and Ebba for dinner in their suite.  After dinner and lots of wine Ebba recounts the story of the avalanche, to the silent horror of Mats and Fanni. Tomas curls up with Harry to play a video game, and listens to Mats who insists that we are not ourselves in emergencies, naming the [[MS Estonia|Estonia disaster]] as an example. Ebba says Tomas won't admit it. Tomas returns and again insists he has a different perspective. So Ebba fetches Tomas's phone and has the four of them watch the video of the incident. Tomas reluctantly agrees the footage showed someone running, but is silent when Mats speculates that Tomas was running away so that he could come back and dig out his family later. As Fanni and Mats leave, Fanni suggests that she would expect Mats to react in the same way as Tomas.  Mats is irritated, and their relationship is changed for the rest of the trip.  Tomas and Mats ride the ski lift in silence. They ski down fresh powder.  Mats suggests Tomas try primal screaming, and Tomas does, screaming swear words into the Alps. Tomas later confesses to Ebba that he hates himself, his cowardice, his cheating in games with his kids, his unfaithfulness. He weeps as his children inside huddle and cry together, hearing their parents argue.  On their final day, the family ascends in the ski lift silently. Ebba is concerned about the thick fog. Tomas says he will go first, then the children, then she can follow. Ebba gets lost in the fog, and Tomas briefly leaves the children alone to go rescue her, returning carrying her shortly after. He sets her down, grinning.  As the family and their friends leave the resort by coach down the winding mountain road, Ebba decides the driver is incompetent and demands to be let off.  Panic ensues, and Mats takes charge, insisting women and children get off first.   Eventually, all exit the bus except for Ebba's friend, and the group descends the road on foot.  Mats and Fanni are walking apart.  Ebba asks Mats to carry Vera.  A stranger offers Tomas a cigarette, and initially Tomas declines, but then accepts.  Harry asks his father if he smokes -- he has not during the entire vacation -- and Tomas replies that he does.

The Fool (2014 film)
 A Russian plumber, Dima Nikitin, is also a municipal repair-crew chief and studying building engineering in an unnamed Russian town that is not yet 40 years old. Some of the city’s housing blocks are already in a grave state of disrepair. A burst bathroom pipe in one of the rickety communal housing buildings reveals a much larger problem, as the exterior wall behind the pipe has cracked and started to shift. When Nikitin goes outside to inspect the matter, he realizes the building has fissured from the ground up to the ninth and last floor.  Though it’s not officially part of his district, Nikitin’s sense of personal responsibility leads him to go in the middle of the night to find and alert the authorities of his belief that the building will collapse in less than 24 hours. Nikitin races to the 50th birthday party of Nina Galaganova, the town’s imperious [[mayor]], to convince her to evacuate the building. He bypasses his direct boss Fedotov, the corrupt inspector of public housing, who applied only a coat of paint the last time he received funds for a major overhaul of his projects; he had stolen the money to use on expanding his daughter's personal residence. Galaganova conducts an extended, behind-closed-doors meeting with Nikitin, Fedotov and heads of several other departments, including the fire brigade chief, Matugin. The intense gathering takes place in a room next to the hotel restaurant where Nina’s birthday party is in full swing, with loud music filtering into the meeting room.  Galaganova sends Fedotov and Matugin to assess the damage with Nikitin. The officials soon accept that the building will indeed fall, and return to report this to the mayor. They all realize that an evacuation of this scale would cause a financial review and reveal years of embezzlement. Arrangements begin to evacuate the inhabitants, but the mayor calls them off, seeking temporary housing for her residents in a nearby suburb. The manager of the blocks of houses refuses to accept the people. Bogachyov, another corrupt official, threatens her job and reminds her that he had helped Galaganova get elected to office and improve her status in life.  Galaganova and Bogachyov decide to pin the expected building collapse on Fedotov and Matugin. Together with Nikitin, Fedotov and Matugin are instructed by Sayapin, the police chief, that arrangements are being made for evacuation. The trio are put into a police van and taken allegedly to meet Galaganova, but instead they are driven to a remote location on the city outskirts. It becomes clear to them that Galaganova is covering her tracks by eliminating them, to pin the eventual collapse of the building on them. Fedotov pleads with the policemen to release Nikitin and they reluctantly agree, instructing him to leave the city with his family immediately. Matugin and Fedotov are executed.  Nikitin takes his wife and son and drives away, believing that the building is being evacuated. However, as they drive past it, Nikitin realizes that no attempts at evacuation are being made. His wife is fearful and wants to leave immediately, but Nikitin is angry and tells her to leave him forever. Nikitin decides to stay and help the residents even if his life is at stake. The wife drives off, leaving Nikitin behind. Knowing Nikitin's actions, his parents feel sorry for him and ask him to forgive them for not equipping him to live with and through the reality of the world.  Early morning, Nikitin rushes into the building and evacuates the inhabitants one by one, telling them that the building is about to collapse. Eventually, he gets everyone out of the building, but after seeing nothing has happened, the tenants beat Nikitin and return to their flats, leaving him on the sidewalk.

Foxcatcher
 [[Wrestling at the Summer Olympics|Olympic wrestling]] champion [[Mark Schultz (wrestler)|Mark Schultz]] ([[Channing Tatum]]) speaks at an [[elementary school]] in place of his older brother, [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|Dave]] ([[Mark Ruffalo]]). Both are Olympic gold medal winners, but Mark feels overshadowed by Dave. Mark is contacted by philanthropist and wrestling enthusiast [[John Eleuthère du Pont|John E. du Pont]] ([[Steve Carell]]), an heir to the E.I. [[du Pont family]] fortune, who arranges to fly Mark to his estate in [[Pennsylvania]] where du Pont has built a private wrestling training facility. Du Pont invites Mark to join his wrestling team, Team Foxcatcher, to be paid to train for the World Championship. Mark accepts the offer, with du Pont urging him to enlist Dave as well. Dave declines for the sake of his wife and two children, who are settled where they live, so Mark moves to Pennsylvania alone.  Mark stays in a homey guest house ("The Chalet") and is greeted there later in the night by du Pont. Through training with his new teammates and du Pont's financial support, Mark excels with Foxcatcher, winning a Gold Medal at the [[1987 World Wrestling Championships]]. Du Pont praises him, and they develop a friendship. Du Pont introduces Mark to [[cocaine]], which he starts to use regularly. He confides in Mark, whom he now calls a true friend, telling him how his mother, [[Jean du Pont]] ([[Vanessa Redgrave]]), paid a boy to act as his friend. Jean tells her son that she believes wrestling is a "low sport" and does not like seeing him "being low". One day, Mark and his teammates in Foxcatcher take the morning off from training to watch [[mixed martial arts]] (MMA) on TV. Angered by this (as well as Mark's insistence that his brother will not join Team Foxcatcher), du Pont verbally and physically rebuffs him, saying that he will enlist Dave by any means necessary while also demanding that Mark work out his differences with his brother as soon as possible.  Dave decides to move with his family to Pennsylvania so he can join Foxcatcher. His self-esteem damaged by du Pont, Mark decides to work and train alone, pushing away both du Pont and even Dave. As Team Foxcatcher prepares to enter the preliminaries for the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], du Pont's mother is escorted into du Pont's gym to watch him coach his team. He awkwardly demonstrates basic maneuvers for her and the other wrestlers. Jean leaves in disgust after seeing du Pont [[back mount|give his back]] to his student.  At the 1988 Olympic Trials in [[Pensacola]], [[Florida]], Mark performs poorly, losing his first match. Angered by his failure, Mark destroys his room, cries and goes on an eating binge. Dave manages to break into his room and is alarmed at his brother's condition. They work feverishly so Mark can make his [[weight class]]. As Mark exercises, Dave prevents du Pont from speaking with Mark. Mark competes well enough to win his match and make the Olympic team. Dave notices that du Pont is absent, learning that he left for Pennsylvania after being told his mother died. After returning to the estate, Mark tells Dave that "you and I both know that I can't stay" at Foxcatcher once the Olympics are over and asks Dave to leave with him. A documentary funded by du Pont about his exploits with Team Foxcatcher is made, during which Dave is asked to praise him as coach and [[mentor]]. Mark loses his matches in Seoul, after which he leaves Team Foxcatcher. While Dave continues to live at du Pont's estate and train with Foxcatcher, as a condition for his remaining he negotiates an arrangement with du Pont to continue to support Mark financially.  Later, du Pont is seen sitting alone in his mansion's trophy room watching the documentary about Team Foxcatcher, which ends with Mark complimenting du Pont at a ceremony depicted earlier. Du Pont calls his bodyguard and drives to Dave's home, where he finds him in the driveway working on his car radio. As Schultz approaches du Pont's car to greet him, du Pont rolls down his window, asks Dave "Do you have a problem with me?," and shoots him three times at close range. Dave's wife, Nancy ([[Sienna Miller]]), calls 9-1-1; and, as du Pont drives off, she runs outside to her husband, who dies in her arms. Du Pont is later arrested outside his own home, and the film ends showing Mark as he competes in a [[mixed martial arts|cage fighting]] match with the crowd's cheers ringing in his head.  
Fort Tilden (film)
 While at a rooftop gathering for their twin musician friends, roommates Allie ([[Claire McNulty]]) and Harper ([[Bridey Elliott]]) meet two guys, Russ and Sam. After the boys announce that they will be spending the day at [[Fort Tilden]] the girls make plans to meet them and bring them [[MDMA|molly]].  The following day, after realizing that the ferries are closed, the girls decide to bike to [[Fort Tilden]] and borrow a bike from their upstairs neighbor, Ebb. They pick up the drugs from Harper's friend Benji, who mocks her for being a dilettante who only pretends to be an artist. While riding through [[Brooklyn]] Harper has them stop in front of a cheap clothing store. When Allie realizes that she has not brought a bike lock, Harper urges her to simply wrap the chain around the bikes. While standing in line they watch as a boy steals Allie's bike, but because of their hesitation whether to confront him or not he easily makes off with the bike. Harper urges Allie to leave Ebb's bike behind, which she eventually does, covering it in trash so that it will not be stolen.  The girls call a cab driver who offers to take them to Fort Tilden for a hundred dollars. While in the car Allie grows frustrated because her contact for the [[Peace Corps]], Cabiria, keeps contacting her in order to obtain her information. Giving up on her Harper makes small talk with the driver, who is from [[Calcutta]] and mentions having been there. However, after Harper mentions what her father does they are thrown out of the car by the cabbie, who tells her her father is a horrible man and a criminal.  The girls walk the rest of the way to Fort Tilden, but upon arrival at the beach discover they are at [[Jacob Riis Park]]. Wandering around they stumble upon three abandoned kittens whom they decide to rescue. While walking Allie receives a text from Cabiria, who asks her how she is enjoying the beach and Allie realizes that Harper posted a picture of her in her bathing suit on Instagram. Frustrated, the girls abandon the kittens in a trash can, reasoning that they left them better than they found them.  As they continue to look for Fort Tilden they receive a text from the boys that they are at Jacob Riis. The girls finally return there and on their way finally pass Fort Tilden. Upon arrival at Jacob Riis they see the boys are with two girls who are topless. Reluctantly, Harper and Allie take their tops off too. Despite the fact that the sun is going down Harper pulls Russ into the water where she tries to have sex with him. Meanwhile, Allie discovers through conversation that the girls, Russ and Sam are all in high school. As the four high school friends leave Sam invites Allie to his mom's house. Allie instead goes to Harper in the water and tells her the kids are in high school.  Afterwards Allie and Harper call a cab and go back to their apartment in Williamsburg. On the way Harper calls 911 and tells the operator about the kittens in the trash can. He tells her to take them out as it is about to rain and they will drown. She hangs up on him.  At home Allie goes to see Ebb and tells him she abandoned his bike, is unwilling to get it, and will probably not be going into the Peace Corps after all. Returning to her apartment she sees Harper having a conversation with her father where she tells him she misses him and asks him how he figured out life at her age. After the conversation ends the two girls curl up with toast and listen to the latest song from their twin musician friends.  
The Frame (film)
 Alex (David Carranza), a methodical cargo thief working for a dangerous cartel narrowly escapes arrest after an elaborate semi truck heist is reduced to a foot chase in the opening scene.  Alex plans ahead and disappears into a crowd to avoid capture.  Sam (Tiffany Mualem), an empathetic and tough paramedic pulls up to the scene of domestic violence and runs into the house before cops arrive.  Sam manages to save a battered woman and protect herself and the daughter from a belligerent husband.  Clearly rattled by her day job and trying to reconcile seeing pain every day, Sam visits her therapist and talks about her wish to make everything better but recognizes the futility.  Home after collecting his pay for the recent heist, Alex stashes it in a hidden wall safe and turns on the TV to eat dinner.  We see he's intently watching a television show which happens to be the scene with Sam the paramedic we just saw happen in real time.  Sam is the star of the show called ''Urban Hope''.  Sam, home after her therapist visit, sits eating dinner in front of the TV and watches Alex's recent heist and escape with the intensity of a true fan.   Alex's show is called ''Thieves and Saints''.  Late one evening, as the two have their televisions on they realize that they are broadcast live from their living rooms on the others TV set. They say hello, panic, and turn off their TV's.  Each handles the impossibility in a different way – Sam expresses to her Therapist she may be losing her mind and Alex believes the cartel or cops have him under surveillance.  Alex visits his mentor Noah (Cal Bartlett) who is sick and elderly but who seems to be the only person Alex has in the world.   Noah senses Alex is in danger and reminds him he's living in a dark world of his own creation and sends him home with the violin Alex played as a child. Alex is reluctant to take the violin as it is a reminder of something painful in his past – a clue we received when he almost accidentally ruined a photo of him with his parents and the violin as a young boy.  Alex and Sam continue to see each other randomly through their televisions and attempt to unwind the mystery by setting a meeting point at a bridge then at her apartment.  Both are met with bizarre interactions with Alex's Cartel Boss showing up in one form on the bridge in his world, Sam's Therapist showing up in another form on the bridge in her world and in front of her apartment as a dark character riding a bizarre black tar-spewing bicycle.  We realize these characters are one and the same, crossing the boundaries between their worlds and morphing into different forms.  We also realize that Sam and Alex have the additional connection of music between the two worlds&nbsp;– Sam hums a beautiful melody from the bridge and Alex taps his foot to the same count and we see a mysterious vibration around them.  The violin that Noah gave to Alex keeps appearing in Alex's apartment and is something that Alex wishes to make go away so he repeatedly puts it away in the closet.  Back out again on a moving box, the camera pans across the room and knocks the violin off the box with the left frame line.  There is definitely some kind of surveillance happening in Alex's world but it isn't the cartel or the cops.  Something else is watching him.  The menacing Therapist, Cartel Boss and Black Tar Mechanic characters (all played by Christopher Soren Kelly) continue to distract and thwart them from each from believing that the connection on the television is legitimate.  Alex has one last heist to pull and Sam sees that his show is ending – that the advertised Season Finale of ''Thieves and Saints'' is the final heist.  Sam pleads with Alex not to go on the heist, that she doesn't know what will happen to him and perhaps there is a fate worse than being caught by the cops or killed by the cartel.  Sam wonders if there is a writer to his show – is some production company in charge of both of their stories?  Alex fires back, angry at the idea that a writer would write him such a horrific life.  Sam says either everything is chaos or everything is a miracle.  Alex is certain everything is chaos.  On a hunch, Sam researches the ''Thieves and Saints'' production company website.  The final heist in ''Thieves and Saints'' has Alex gunning down most of his crew to save an innocent bystander family.  Alex takes a shot to the gut in the shootout as Sam watches panicked at her TV.  Alex stumbles home and sees her on his TV and she pleads with him to call an ambulance.  He fears being caught, he thinks the cartel are everywhere and he is content to die with the connection to Sam from his apartment.   Knowing he doesn't have much longer, Sam asks Alex to hum a melody with her.  It's the same melody she was humming at the bridge and as Alex joins in, both of their worlds begin to vibrate.  Alex weakens, takes his final breath and Sam sits stunned pleading with him not to leave her.  She springs into action remembering she had found the ''Thieves and Saints'' production company address and drives there only to be stopped by her Therapist who has been looking for her, fearing she is not mentally well.  She runs past him into the building and to the floor of the ''Thieves and Saints'' writer's office.  A 60's dressed secretary sits in a small lobby staring at a phone and asks how Sam is doing.  Sam goes through the only door in the room and finds herself in a vacuous room – on one side extending to infinite black and the other with spools feeding into a typing machine.  She exits the other side which takes her back into the secretary's office and has the same short conversation as if on a repeating loop.  Finally she summons the courage to walk toward the typing machine in the vacuous room and sees a projection image above the machine showing Alex on the floor of his apartment.  The typing machine deposits the final page for “Thieves and Saints: Episode 50”.  Sam picks up the script and flips through, seeing everything that had happened up to this point in his show.   Sam is able to write onto the script and change Alex's fate, reviving him from death.  Changing the script sets off a cascade of changing events that Sam struggles to keep up with as she drives through the city to escape her persistent Therapist.  Humming her favorite melody nervously and paying more attention to the script than the road, Sam's car is hit by oncoming traffic and spun around. In her final desperate attempt to save Alex from his ever=changing script, she burns it.  Shortly thereafter another car crashes into hers and kills her.  At that moment, everyone in Alex's world disintegrates into black tar and the traffic, noise and activity come to a halt.  Alex sits catatonic for a few moments then walks around the vacant city in wonder.  He passes by an antique shop with an old television playing Sam's show and he sees her car accident and final demise.  As he's reeling from her death, he turns around to find Sam's Therapist morph from the TV into the Black Tar Mechanic standing right behind him. The Mechanic delivers a bizarre speech – beginning with 'all that was left was the man and the devil, trapped in the writer's creation. ' Alex realizes he is in fact written and that the only person left in the world with him is the devil.  The devil is determined to erase the world with his black tar machine, with or without Alex in it.  Alex returns home with earlier scenes from Sam's show playing on a loop. He wanders the city a bit, always aware there is something over his shoulder watching him.  Out of paranoia he looks back but nothing. He is despondent, exhausts his remaining food and is entirely alone but for Sam's reruns and a massive ugly machine spewing black tar into the sky and blocking out the sun.  He sees that Sam burned his script and it gives him idea to do the same – what if he could find the writer's office too?  Arriving in the same strange secretary's room at the production company, it is also vacant.  No signs of life anywhere.  Alex opens the door to the vacuous room and hears typing on the far end.  As he walks toward the sound of the typewriter, he sees a projection of himself in that moment repeating into infinity.  He turns back and stares directly into the camera – aware for the first time that the camera is the entity who is watching him.  He approaches the typewriter and sees a full script sitting in the paper tray called 'The Frame'.  The script describes the exact moment we're seeing, Alex becoming aware of the script and storyteller and writer.  He stumbles backward in disbelief and the left side of the camera frame hits him in the back.  He moves in the opposite direction and finds the other side of The Frame. After challenging both sides, The Frame lifts him up and tilts him backwards and he mysteriously wakes up at home.  Contemplating his encounter with this mysterious force, he draws a square, then two arrows: one pointing left and one pointing right toward both edges. He then pokes a hole through the paper and realizes he needs to run away from the camera, not toward the edges.  Alex, finally ready to test fate and his entrapment, jumps out of his third story window.  The Frame catches him gracefully at the bottom of the picture, preventing his death.  Alex runs and The Frame pursues him at every turn – Alex smashes into the edges of The Frame and is angrily re-living his childhood of having his parent's murdered and the prayer to help him go unanswered.  He tells the writer to fuck off – that the writer left him.  He left him all alone.  The writer wrote him a cruel and lonely life and made him do terrible things. Alex heaves his anger one final time at The Frame and he passes out on the street.  Gently The Frame picks him up and carries him home.  Alex again wakes up in his apartment as The Mechanic is closing in on his promise to black out the world.  Sam's final episode is still replaying on his TV – she is being pursued by her Therapist and hums nervously while she drives and changes Alex's script.  With nothing left to do but surrender, Alex finally reaches for his violin.  As he plays, the melody of her humming and his strings combine to merge their two worlds together.  Alex swings the final note from the intersection in her world which sends the car who had run into and killed her flying over her, leaving her safe.  Stunned to see him kneeling on the intersection where she burned his script, she approaches him with disbelief.  Sam slowly walks up to him and places his hand warmly on his head.   Alex bows in relief.  For the first time in the film, The Frame pans off of both characters and blurs to white.

Freezer (film)
 Robert Saunders ([[Dylan McDermott]]) wakes up to find himself bound and locked inside a meat locker. After he is able to cut himself loose, two Russian mobsters Kiril and Stepan enter the freezer to question him. It becomes apparent that neither understand English, but before they leave they tell a confused Robert they want "money". Left alone, Robert finds a ventilation duct in the top of the ceiling that appears to lead to the fans inside the locker. Just then, he finds a ringing cell phone on the floor and speaks with Detective Al Dorian, who first addresses him as "Sam". Robert explains that he was having dinner in a restaurant with his girlfriend for his birthday before being knocked unconscious and thrown into the freezer. Before Dorian can complete a trace, the mobsters return and destroy the phone. They are accompanied this time by the bi-lingual Alisa ([[Yuliya Snigir]]), who accuses Robert of having stolen $8 million from them and demands its return; otherwise, he will freeze to death within four hours. He tries to convince them that he is innocent and this is a case of mistaken identity, but the Russians are undeterred and take his shoes before leaving.   After finding bags to wrap his bare feet, Robert tries to keep his body temperature up by exercising. While running around the room, he knocks over some boxes revealing a seriously wounded Detective Sam Gurov lying in a shelf. Sam tells Robert that he will not be allowed to leave the locker alive regardless if he is able to convince the mobsters he is innocent. Before passing out, he confesses that he was an undercover cop trying to bring down the mobsters' boss, Oleg. Robert hides Sam again and begins attempting to stop the fans by beating them with a fire extinguisher.      The Russians return and again Alisa demands to know where the money is. Robert maintains his ignorance of the matter and evades her questions, but a groan from Sam alerts Kiril. Robert takes advantage of the situation by grabbing Alisa as Kiril threatens to kill Sam. Sam shatters Robert's innocence by telling them Robert took the money despite his protests. Robert deduces that Alisa was supposed to be in charge of the lost money and she begs Robert to confess if not to save himself, then to save her. After the Russians leave again, Sam explains that after a failed hit, Oleg began moving his vast fortune around for protection; during the shuffle, the $8 million was lost. Sam volunteers to change clothes with Robert and pose as him in order to allow Robert a chance at escape. The plan fails, and Robert, in a bid to save Sam's life, confesses that the money is hidden in the restaurant where he was abducted. Despite this, he is knocked out and Sam is killed.      Upon waking up, Robert makes Alisa believe that Stepan is the real thief and Robert is being framed, since Stepan was responsible for both the death of Sam's informant and identifying Robert as the thief. Robert kills Kiril with a meat hook, but is incapacitated by Stepan before he can escape. Alisa, now clearly shaken, tells Stepan that Robert accused him of taking the money. Enraged by Kiril's death, Stepan drags Alisa out of the freezer and locks Robert inside once again. After he puts on Kiril's clothes, he continues to search for but fails to find any way out of the meat locker. When Stepan and Alisa return, Robert convinces them to let him contact Detective Dorian because, as Sam's partner, he will know where the money is. Stepan impatiently ends the call and throws a bucket of water on Robert before leaving.     With hypothermia setting in Robert again tries to disconnect the fan wires in ventilation shaft, but is unable due to his state. At that time, a well-dressed and bound Russian man is thrown into the room with Robert. The man, introducing himself as Danil, offers to help Robert escape in exchange for a portion of the money. Robert instructs Danil to cut the electrical wires in the shaft, but when the mobsters enter the room, Danil is electrocuted to death. Alisa reveals that Danil was merely a plant to get the truth from Robert and was in fact Vadim, Oleg's son.      When Oleg arrives, he finds Robert and identifies him as the assassin who previously failed to kill him. Once Robert drops his claimed innocence and acknowledges the truth, he and Oleg fight as Alisa and Stepan look on. Due to his weakened state, Oleg gains the upper hand but is killed by Alisa before he can finish off Robert. Alisa is in fact Robert's girlfriend and had been working on the inside for him. A wounded Stepan escapes and locks the two inside. Robert uses the severed electrical wires to cause the metal meat rack to give off enough heat to warm their hands. At this time, Detective Dorian arrives and demands to know where the money is after instructing the two to bind their hands to the rack. Alisa confesses that the money has been inside the meat locker the entire time, hidden inside the boxes of cuts. While Dorian is distracted with this, Alisa and Robert escape by burning through the zip ties binding their wrists together on the heated rack.      Robert and Alisa use a semi-truck to hook up to the freezer with the money and Dorian inside. After traveling to a port, they load the container onto a cargo ship. Alisa gives Robert a "birthday present" from Oleg, a box of cuts holding a large amount of money. They drive off planning a warm vacation, but not before knocking an injured Stepan into the bay.

Fury (2014 film)
 In April 1945, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] make their [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|final push]] into [[Nazi Germany]]. Don "Wardaddy" Collier, a battle-hardened [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Staff sergeant#U.S. Army|staff sergeant]] in the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|Second Armored Division]], commands an [[M4 Sherman]] [[M4 Sherman variants#US M4 sub-types|"Easy Eight"]] tank nicknamed ''Fury'' and its veteran crew: gunner Boyd "Bible" Swan, loader Grady "Coon-Ass" Travis, driver Trini "Gordo" Garcia, and assistant driver–bow gunner "Red". They have been together since the [[North African campaign]] and have fought in France and Belgium. Red is [[killed in action]] and replaced by [[Private (rank)|Private]] Norman Ellison, a fresh recruit trained only as a [[clerk]] typist.  As the unit moves deeper into Germany, Norman's inexperience becomes dangerous: he fails to react when he spots [[Hitler Youth]] child soldiers who ambush the commanding officer's tank with a ''[[Panzerfaust]]'', killing the entire crew; later, he hesitates under fire during a skirmish with [[7.5 cm Pak 40|anti-tank guns]]. Angered at Norman's incompetence, Don tells him he is useless unless he can kill Germans; after the battle, he orders Norman to execute a captured German soldier for wearing a U.S. Army coat. When Norman refuses to shoot the German in the back, claiming it's not right, Don wrestles the pistol into his hand and forces him to pull the trigger, killing the prisoner and traumatizing Norman.  Don leads the tanks to capture a small German town. While searching an apartment, Don and Norman find a German woman, Irma, and her younger cousin, Emma. Don pays them cigarettes for a hot meal and some hot water for a shave. Norman and Emma then go into the bedroom, bond, and have sex. As the four sit down to eat, the rest of the crew drunkenly barges in, harassing the women and bullying Norman, but Don keeps them firmly in line. They are then called away for an urgent mission, with Norman promising to write as Emma tearfully says goodbye. As the men prepare to leave, German artillery targets the town; Emma is killed in the bombardment, traumatizing Norman further.  The tank platoon is ordered to capture and hold a vital [[crossroads (junction)|crossroads]] to protect the division's rear echelon. En route, they are ambushed by a [[Tiger I|Tiger tank]], which wipes out the entire platoon except the Fury. The Fury eventually destroys the Tiger by out-manoeuvring it and firing into its thinner rear armor. With their radio damaged, the Fury is forced to continue on alone. Upon arriving at the crossroads, the tank is immobilized by a [[landmine]]. Don sends Norman to scout a nearby hill; there, Norman spots a [[Waffen-SS]] battalion approaching their position. The crew wants to flee and let the battalion pass, but Don refuses, compelling the others to stay and fight.  The men disguise Fury to make it appear knocked out, and then hide inside. While they wait, Norman is finally accepted by the crew and given his nickname: "Machine." They then ambush the arriving Germans, inflicting heavy casualties in a long and vicious battle. Grady is killed by a Panzerfaust that penetrates the turret, Gordo is shot while unpinning a grenade and sacrifices himself by covering it, a sniper kills Bible and badly wounds Don. Out of ammunition and surrounded, Don orders Norman to escape through an emergency hatch in the floor as the Germans drop grenades into the tank. Norman slips out just before they explode, killing Don. Norman tries to hide as the Germans move on but is spotted by a young SS soldier, who hesitates, then leaves without alerting his comrades.  The next morning, Norman crawls back into the tank, where he covers Don's body with his jacket. He is then rescued by American soldiers, who praise him as a hero. As Norman is driven away in an ambulance, he looks back at the hundreds of dead Germans lying around the destroyed Fury.

The Gambler (2014 film)
 Jim Bennett is a [[Los Angeles]] literature professor with a severe gambling addiction caused by an extreme world-view and a pathological obsession with gambling. This view goes unchanged even after the death of his grandfather, Ed, who names Jim his heir just before dying. Jim ends up owing $240,000 to Lee, the proprietor of an exclusive, high-stakes underground gambling ring, and another $50,000 to Neville Baraka, a [[loan shark]]. Lee gives Jim seven days to pay off his debts or be murdered.  During one of his classes, Jim begins an awkward discussion of literary excellence based on Shakespeare as an example, discussing how almost all aspiring writers fail to accomplish literary excellence. Jim singles out some exemplary athletes in his class for discussion. First he picks Dexter, an emerging tennis star; he later confronts a basketball student star, Lamar Allen, who does not pay attention in class but intends to become an [[NBA]] basketball player. Jim expresses his extremist view on achieving excellence in one's field or vocation of choice. If you can't be exemplary, Jim reasons, then you might as well resign yourself to mediocrity. Making a general comment to the class, he tells them that no one but Amy Phillips, a quiet student, is capable of a career in literature. Jim identifies Amy as a potential writing prodigy based on her previous writings in his class, as well as having previously encountered her working surreptitiously as a waitress at the underground gambling house. Amy develops a personal interest in Jim, which he reciprocates.  After the class, Jim visits his mother Roberta at the family's luxury estate, but she says that she will not give him any more money. Jim considers borrowing money from Frank (another loan shark) to consolidate his debts and buy himself some time, but refuses to do so after Frank's demands include that Jim admit “I am not a man”. Jim convinces Roberta to give him enough money to pay off his debts, expressing no gratitude to her, then gambles it all away during a trip to a casino with Amy. Baraka kidnaps Jim, has him tied-up and tortured, and then confronts him with an ultimatum—if he does not convince Lamar to [[Point shaving|win one of his college basketball games by a margin of 7 points or less]], he will murder Amy.  Jim goes to Frank, who advises him to change his version of a "fuck you" attitude towards life by getting enough money to build a safe house, for protection against his severe gambling losses. Frank lends him $260,000 to pay his debt to Lee, but also threatens to kill everyone in Jim’s personal life if he is not repaid. Lee's men assault Jim when he comes to ask Lee to stake him $150,000, saying the only way he can pay his full $410,000 debt to Lee and Frank is to gamble and win. He uses the $150,000 to bribe Lamar into going along with the basketball point-shaving scheme. Jim sends Dexter to [[Las Vegas]] to bet on the game with the $260,000 he got from Frank. Lamar succeeds, barely, so Jim uses his winnings to pay his debt to Baraka, denying he knows anything about the large bet made in Vegas.  Jim then convinces both Lee and Frank to meet him in a neutral gambling den, where he wagers enough money to pay both men off—if he wins—on a single roulette spin. Successful, he leaves the money at the club for Lee and Frank. The payment to Frank is more than he owed; Frank finds Jim and offers to give back the “cream” but, to Frank’s amusement, Jim responds “Fuck you”. On an apparent adrenaline rush, Jim runs miles through the city to arrive at Amy's apartment; he is broke, but free from debt.  
Gajakesari
 The film begins in the forest area of Aanegudde, an elephant reserve. A state minister arrives at the place of a local don, Rana. Rana forces the minister to sign a deal to open a resort at Anegudde. The minister signs reluctantly after seeing his bodyguard being murdered by Rana.  The scene next shifts to Prakash Raj introducing an ancient temple in the royal city of mysore called "Shankara Narayana" temple which is being managed by a holy Mutt, headed by the pontiff ([[Anantnag]]). The Mutt has a very good reputation by not being involved into any politics and also being equally revered by both Shaivites and Vaishnavites. Then comes into picture, the hero Krishna ([[Yash (actor)|Yash]]), with his mother [[Girija Lokesh]]. Krishna is a happy-go-lucky youth, a hard-core [[Rajkumar (actor)|Rajkumar]] fan, who has a kind heart for people and is involved in a small-time loan financing company. It is revealed that Krishna’s family is very much devoted to the Mutt and also that he was born after Krishna’s father pledged that Krishna will be sent to become the next Pontiff of the Mutt after [[Anantnag]]. In this context, Krishna is given a warm welcome at the Mutt and is requested by the Mutt head [[Anantnag]] to take up the spiritual leadership. Krishna refuses as he feels he is still attached to the worldly ambitions and he requests the pontiff to suggest an alternative. The Pontiff says that Krishna has to donate an elephant to the Mutt, if he cannot take up the leadership of the Mutt.  Krishna first tries several ways to avoid taking up Sanyasa ashramam in various negative ways, but each time in his attempt, he is given full respect and protected.  Krishna finally goes in search of the elephant and hence sets his foot in the forest of Aaneguddi. He takes the help of the local Forest officer "Agni" ([[Rangayana Raghu]]) who introduces him to the forest tribal people. The ancestors of these tribal people have been in that forest since centuries and have taken care of the local elephants. They befriend Krishna and some incidents make Krishna meet a single strong elephant "Kalinga", who is feared by the tribal folk for his roughness. Krishna also meets a young ecologist ([[Amulya]]).  The local don Rana hatches a plan to route out the local tribal folk from their homes and build a resort there. When he comes there with his henchmen, Krishna and Amoolya revolt and help the folk. Krishna fights the henchmen and creates fear in the mind of Rana. Rana takes his right-hand man Selva to kill Krishna and at this juncture, the elephant Kalinga comes to his rescue.  The head of the tribal folk sees Krishna reducing the anger of Kalinga and deduces that he is definitely the incarnation of Baahubali ([[Yash (actor)|Yash]]), a fierce warrior in the army of the King of Karunadu. The tribal chief then narrates the story about the valour of Baahubali. The king of Karunadu is about to be attacked by a king Verma. At this juncture, Baahubali defeats one of the strongest warriors of Verma. Saddened at this, Verma resorts to a cunning way and makes Baahubali’s close friend poison Baahubali. When he is poisoned, Verma attacks him with his army along with the traitor minister of Karunadu. In spite of his dying state, Baahubali single-handedly defeats the entire army of Verma and kills them. In this fight, Baahubali loses his pet elephant "Balarama" (this is the elephant which has incarnated as Kalinga), who kills some of the enemy soldiers and dies. Finally, Baahubali dies and the king of Karunadu awards the title of "Gajakesari" to Baahubali for his meritorious act of bravery and his service to the Motherland.  Now, Krishna having known his past life, faces Rana and his henchmen and is almost killed. The Pontiff Anantnag having sensed Krishna’s battle for life, performs Mrityunjaya Homa at the Mutt. This ritual strengthens Krishna and Kalinga aids him to finish off Rana and the henchmen. Finally, the Mutt Pontiff arrives at the tribal village and tells Krishna that it was his destiny that he had to help the village tribal people and that he has to continue to protect them as he did in his previous birth. The Pontiff also tells him that he need not become the next successor to him nor donate any elephant to the Mutt. He blesses Krishna to marry Meera(Amulya) and lead a prosperous life.

[[Hate speech]] and [[bigotry]] are common in online spaces, and how that affects people personally when they play games is commented on. Solutions to harmful activity is postulated, and many point to the GaymerX convention for doing good work in creating a [[safe space]] in adding visibility, to influence a more open-minded gaming community, as well as more LGBTQ characters in mainstream games.  The film also stars Naomi Clark (game creator), [[Colleen Macklin]] (game designer and professor), Joey Stern ([[Geeks OUT]] organizer), Shane Cherry (NYC Gaymers promoter), Jessica Vazquez (games journalist), and Matthew Michael Brown (“Gaymer” of [[The Tester]], Season 2 winner).<ref></ref><ref></ref> Everyone in the main cast either identifies as LGBTQ, and/or active in gay gaming work of some kind. Many GaymerX attendees also make appearances, including [[Game Revolution]]’s Editor in Chief, Nick Tan.

Garm Wars: The Last Druid
 The planet of Anwynn was once populated by eight tribes, known as Garms.<ref></ref> Long ago, the planet was at peace, as all the different races of Anwynn were united by their collective servitude to their god, Diarne. Unfortunately, violence broke out when Diarne left, setting all the tribes against each other. The war proved devastating, destroying all the tribes on the planet except for three- the Briga, the Kumtak and the Columba. During this time, the Druids, who were previously conveyed the words of Anwynn's god, disappeared. The Briga tribe lives on the ground, and controls the weaker Kumtak tribe to help in their war against the Columba. Meanwhile, the Columba live in airships.  The film itself is divided into three different acts. In Act 1, ''The Exile of the Three Magi,'' a Kumtak man named Wydd ([[Lance Henriksen]]) is captured by the Columba, along with his holy canine pet Gula, and a mysterious being who is identified as Nascien (Summer Howell), the last of the missing Druids. During his interrogation aboard the Columba airship, Wydd claims that he fled from the Briga people because the Kumtak are enslaved, and offers his services and the Druid's power to fight against his people's oppressors. When the airship is eventually destroyed during a Briga attack, Wydd reveals his true purpose- to travel to the lands of the Druids with Nascien and discover why and why Diarne would create the Garms, if she intended to leave. He then recruits Khara (Melanie St-Pierre), the Columba clone-soldier that interrogated him, and Skelling ([[Kevin Durand]]), the Briga officer who led the attack on the airship, before setting off on this quest.  In Act 2, ''Passage to the Other World,'' Wydd and his companions continue their journey to the land of the Druids. As the journey draws on, Skellig and Khara both learn that they are quickly running out of mana, the life-energy that sustains their lives. Despite this pressing concern, the party travels in a Briga tank across war-torn wastelands and seas. Upon witnessing the devastation and brutality of the war, Khara begins to question the worth of the war, but Skellig does not appear to share these concerns.  In the final act, ''Sacred Grove,'' the party finally arrives at the land of the Druids. Unfortunately, the Briga tank breaks down, forcing Skellig to stay behind and repair it as Wydd, Khara and Nascien continue onwards. During their exploration of the sacred grove, Wydd accidentally activates the Druids' defence systems and awakens giant robotic defenders. Skellig manages to repair the tank and hold off the defenders while the others escaped, but loses his life in the process. When the group finally arrives at the source of the Druid's knowledge and power, Nascien kills Wydd and reveals her true purpose- to take control of the Druid`s guardians and destroy all the Garms. While the guardians are awoken and set against the Garms, Khara manages to destroy Nascien before she escapes. Khara then asks the dying Nascien why the Garms were abandoned by the gods. Nascien reveals that the goddess Diarne left because she feared the destructive potential of the Garms, which is why Nascien took it upon herself to destroy them for her. The film then ends on a [[cliffhanger]], with the warring tribes uniting to fight against the guardians.  
The Games Maker
 Young Ivan Drago places first in a mail-in contest for board game inventors, only to be disappointed after receiving the grand prize of a temporary tattoo. However, he soon discovers his tattoo is permanent, prompting his father to reach out to Ivan's long-estranged grandfather. Soon after, Ivan's parents are lost in a balloon race, whereupon Ivan is placed in a strict school, where classmates and teachers alike constantly show their dislike for him. Ivan escapes the school to run away to his grandfather in Zyl, the games capitol. Once there, Ivan learns that his tattoo matches a missing piece in the town jigsaw puzzle, and is a symbol of Morodian, the man who stole the puzzle piece and is responsible for Zyl's downfall as the greatest game-making town. Ivan runs off to confront Morodian, who had been tracking Ivan his whole life, and was responsible for the disappearance of Ivan's parents. Morodian puts Ivan to work as his personal games maker, but Ivan escapes with the missing puzzle piece and his parents, who Morodian was keeping hostage. With Morodian vanquished, Ivan replaces the missing puzzle piece, his father is reunited with Ivan's grandfather, and Zyl is restored to its former glory.

Get on Up (film)
 ''Get on Up'' is told using a [[nonlinear narrative]] as if through James Brown's [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]], including [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]] events and frequent breaks in the [[fourth wall]].  The film opens in 1993 with James Brown walking through a darkened hallway as an audience chants his name. He hears the voices of people he knew throughout his life. The film then cuts to 1988 in [[Augusta, Georgia]]; James learns that his private bathroom in a strip mall he owns was used without his consent. As James confronts and then forgives the trespasser, James accidentally fires a shotgun, attracting the police.  During the 1960s, James and his band decide to travel to [[Vietnam]] to show support to the black troops, where they put on a well-received show. In 1939, James is raised in the woods by his parents (Susie and Joe Brown), whose marriage is fraught with financial struggles and physical abuse. Later he performs in a singing group, [[The Famous Flames]], formed by [[Bobby Byrd]], whose family sponsored his release from prison, a penalty he paid for stealing a suit. James lives with the Byrd family and becomes lead singer of Bobby's group. In 1964, manager Ben Bart convinces them to let [[The Rolling Stones]] close The [[T.A.M.I. Show]] instead of The Flames. The Flames upstage the Stones, and, exiting the stage, James tells the Stones, "Welcome to America". In James' childhood, Susie leaves Joe, and Joe threatens her with a gun and keeps James. Joe continues to abuse James until Joe joins the army. James is left living with and working for his Aunt Honey, who runs a brothel. At her home, he attends church and enjoys the choir.  At the age of 17, James steals a suit, is arrested, and receives a 5-to-13-year prison sentence. In prison, James sees a group of singers performing. His enthusiastic reaction incites a riot wherein both he and one of the singers, [[Bobby Byrd]], are injured. Bobby invites James into the Byrd household. Years later, James joins Bobby's gospel group and they put on a show at a club as The Famous Flames, following a performance by [[Little Richard]]. Another flashback from James's childhood shows him and other black boys forced into a [[Professional wrestling battle royal|battle royal]] boxing match while a band plays. Inspired by the funky band, James wins the match.  In the 1950s, James and Bobby meet an agent from [[King Records (United States)|King Records]], with whom The Flames record their first single, "[[Please, Please, Please]]", on the [[Federal Records]] label in 1956. King Records executive [[Syd Nathan]] initially mocks the song but appreciates James's vocals. Ben Bart becomes James' manager, calling him the true voice of the group. The records are labelled as "James Brown and His Famous Flames", leading all the members except Bobby to quit. James and Bobby form a new band with [[Maceo Parker]], [[Alfred "Pee Wee" Ellis|Pee Wee Ellis]], Nafloyd Scott, and Baby Roy. The Famous Flames singing group is also re-formed, replacing the members that quit. The Flames perform at the [[Apollo Theater]] to an excited audience. After the show, Bobby tells James that a lady claiming to be his mother is there. As a young child, James had seen Susie with a soldier, to whom she claimed she didn't know James. Aunt Honey consoled James, saying that his mother was a fool and James would someday be rich.  James has a child, Teddy, with his first wife Velma. He later divorces her and marries Dee-Dee. On one occasion, the couple hosts a Christmas event. Afterwards, James hits Dee-Dee for wearing a revealing outfit. In an attempt to reach out to the black community, James records the song "[[Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud]]" (1968) with a group of children. James convinces the [[Boston Garden]]'s manager to not cancel a performance following the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]]. Several people try to get on stage; security guards intercede until James controls the audience.  Over time, James manages the band poorly, and they all quit. Ben dies of a [[heart attack]]. Bobby muses about a career as a lead singer, leading to a heated argument with Brown, who tells Bobby that, although Bobby's wife [[Vicki Anderson]] (who was a featured singer in Brown's Revue) could be a major solo performer, Bobby could not. Angry and upset, Bobby fires back at Brown, and after Brown makes some cruel statements, finally leaves him for good. Backtracking several years, to an incident at the Apollo, Brown's mother Susie appears backstage during a Flames concert and expresses her love for James despite her reluctance to be a mother. After she leaves, Bobby comes back in, sees James having a breakdown, and heeds his request to take care of Susie. In 1973, James learns Teddy has been killed in a car accident. Immediately before the incident at the strip mall, James smokes a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] laced with [[Phencyclidine|PCP]]. The police chase James and arrest him.  In 1993, James meets Bobby for the first time since Teddy's funeral to give him tickets to his show. James walks onto the stage through a darkened hall. He sees visions of people from his life chanting his name. His performance of "[[Try Me (James Brown song)|Try Me (I Need You)]]" moves Bobby and his wife Vicki to tears, and the audience cheers.  
Gemma Bovery (film)
 Martin ([[Fabrice Luchini]]), an ex-Parisian with a deep appreciation for [[Gustave Flaubert]], has settled in a village in [[Normandy]] as a baker.  He sees a British couple moving into an old property across the road. Their names, Gemma ([[Gemma Arterton]]) and Charles Bovery ([[Jason Flemyng]]), echo those of the leading characters in Flaubert's 1856 masterpiece ''[[Madame Bovary]]''. Martin engages with the young couple and observes Gemma's behaviour replicates that of her namesake, including a series of romantic and sexual liaisons that suggest she is headed for a tragic finale like that of the novel. He intervenes but cannot alter the inevitable conclusion.  
Get Santa
 A few days before Christmas, Steve Anderson, a former getaway driver, is released on parole from prison, with his parole officer, Ruth, informing him that she will consider any occasion where he misses his meetings with her as a violation of his parole and send him back to prison. Amid reports of reindeer wandering the streets of London, Steve is surprised when his son, Tom, calls him to claim that he has found Santa in his family shed. Steve responds to the call, but although Santa mentions a time Steve saw a shooting star as a child, he dismisses 'Santa' as a madman and sends him out of the shed. Alone, Santa tries to retrieve his reindeer from police lock-up, but is caught when he tries to catapult one of them out and is sent to prison.  The next morning, Steve appears for his first scheduled day with Tom, but Tom refuses to go anywhere but to see Santa at prison. Santa instructs Steve on how to find his reindeer, and hence his crashed sleigh, and in return Steve provides him with a few pointers on how to cope in prison. While Santa is asked to act as the Father Christmas for the local prison party, Steve finds the field where the reindeer have been taken, with Tom establishing which reindeer is the leader, Dasher, as Dasher communicates through flatulence. They are able to find the sleigh, but when Steve calls Santa to update him, he accidentally releases all of the magic dust the sleigh needs to fly.  Stuck for options, Steve agrees to go to the Phoenix Tower in Suffolk, where Santa informs him that he will find help, based on a book in the sleigh's glove compartment, despite this trip meaning that Steve will miss his parole hearing. Despite such delays as difficulty hitch-hiking and a close call that forces them to steal costumes from a pantomime, they are able to reach the Phoenix Tower, but are unable to work out what to do next.  Back at the prison, Santa manages to convince the other prisoners of his identity when they see letters hit the window addressed to Santa, followed by Santa recounting some of the last presents he left for the criminals when they were children. However, when Ruth comes to prison to report Steve has missed his parole hearing, she not only identifies him as the man who stole Dasher, but also identifies Santa as 'Henry Mitchell', who was arrested while trying to climb down a chimney over twenty years ago but escaped en route. However, the prisoners begin to acknowledge the truth when an emergency news report reveals that Australian children have woken up with no presents in their stockings.   With Santa transferred to solitary, Steve contemplates giving up, but Tom is able to translate a clue in the book to work out how to open the Phoenix Tower, which is one of several receiving towers that pick up the letters to Santa and divert them to Lapland. Travelling through the letter-tunnel, Steve and Tom reach Elf City, where Steve convinces the elves to let him use an old sleigh to rescue Santa from prison while deploying a squirrel called Oswald to release the other reindeer, Steve arguing that those children who have woken up without presents may simply find them in other areas. Reaching the prison, they are able to use a magic slinky to enlarge a small chimney so that Steve and Tom can enter the prison.   At the same time, Santa is about to be transferred to solitary, but attempts a break-out with the aid of a midget prisoner known as 'Sally', culminating in a fight in the prison gym that ends when Santa punches the guard responsible for supervising the transfer when he says he hates Christmas. As Santa and Sally attempt to break out through a tunnel, Steve writes a letter to Santa so that it will lead him to the tunnel, where they intercept Allison, Tom's mother, as she drives to the prison looking for Tom. When the police discover the car, Allison is forced to go along with the request to take them to a park, Santa buying time by using a gun loaded with reindeer droppings as a distraction. They reach the park where Oswald has reassembled the sleigh and the reindeer, Santa inviting Sally to accompany him, just before the police and Ruth arrive. As Ruth asks why 'Santa' would choose Steve to help him, Santa notes that Steve is commendable because he never stops trying, and consoles Tom that adults can make mistakes but just need a chance to believe in the magic of Christmas. With that, Santa takes off in the sleigh and departs for his night's work, wishing them all a Merry Christmas and thanking Steve and Tom for their help, expressing faith that the police will let him off once they see the truth.

 Aya, the most popular student of a [[Catholic school|Catholic all-girls school]], suddenly shuts herself in her room. Her admirer, Kasumi Nohara, kisses her photo at midnight and suddenly disappears with her friend Michi as a witness. Her disappearance is quickly attributed to a supposed curse that affects girls who kiss the photo of the person they admire at midnight. Aya's photo is taken to the attic by Sakuya Itsuki and Risa for safekeeping, but the two alongside three other girls are enticed to kiss the photo. Except for Risa, who is later found dazed but alive, all of them are eventually found dead at a nearby river.  When Michi attempts to kiss the photo, Aya stops her and reveals that she is not responsible for the curse, as the photo is not hers. They search help in Kazumi "Mary" Kusanagi, an eccentric photographer, who keeps photos inside her studio of [[lesbian]] girls who made [[suicide pact]] by drowning themselves at a lake, which is now closed down, due to the then society's intolerance towards same-sex couples.

Aya then admits to Michi that she is haunted by the guilt of letting a fellow orphan of hers die in front of her.   Michi decides to kiss the photo to put herself into the curse and chains herself to Aya so the latter can save her should she be in danger. However, the two are separated halfway through and Aya is knocked out by Takashi, the mentally handicapped brother of the school [[nun]], Mayumi Aso. She is thrown into a reservoir located at the place where the lesbian couples committed their suicides. There, Aya remembers that the doppelganger is in fact her twin sister, Maya. Though she died at an early age, Maya "grew up" alongside Aya and put a curse at the photo until Aya could find her in the reservoir. Meanwhile, Michi is about to be drowned by Mayumi, who is revealed to be the one murdering the girls so as to keep Takashi's supposed involvement in Maya's death a secret, but she chooses to drown herself with Takashi when the authorities are closing in. Michi goes to the reservoir and reunites with Aya.  Aya and Michi participate in the school [[choir]] celebrating their graduation. Meanwhile, Mary visits the school's headmistress and [[abbess]], correctly deducing her as the lesbian girl who was haunted by the spirit of her lover.

When one of the girls rides home alone afterwards, Loverboy knocks her from her bicycle and throws her off a bridge, making the girl's death look like an accident.  In the present day, struggling to pay her way through school following the death of her father, college coed Kylie Atkins is recruited by entrepreneur Gary Preston to join his online pornography venture Girl House.

The Giver (film)
 Following a [[disaster|calamity]], referred to as The Ruin, [[society]] is reorganized into a series of communities, and all memories of the past are held by one person, the Receiver of Memory. Since the Receiver of Memory is the only individual in the community with the memories from earlier times, he must advise the Chief Elder and the other Elders on the decisions for the community. The Receiver of Memory and his assistant are also the only ones endowed with [[color vision]] (color blindness being a side effect of the daily, emotion-numbing drug injections imposed on everybody else).  Jonas ([[Brenton Thwaites]]) is a 16-year-old boy who, like everyone else, is anxious about the career that he will be assigned. His best friends are Asher ([[Cameron Monaghan]]) and Fiona ([[Odeya Rush]]).  On the day of graduation, everyone is assigned a career. Jonas is briefly skipped. He is not assigned a career until the end of the ceremony, when he is told that he will become the next Receiver of Memory and will progressively receive memories from his predecessor, the Giver ([[Jeff Bridges]]). Upon assuming his role, Jonas learns of the past of the Giver and his child, Rosemary ([[Taylor Swift]]), who had preceded Jonas as Receiver of Memory. She was so distraught from the memories that she committed [[suicide]], which the Community calls "release". Its nature is regarded as mysterious, but the audience learns that it is death by [[lethal injection]]. Jonas begins to teach his findings to Fiona and decides to share the idea of emotions. Fiona, who is unable to comprehend the idea of emotion, is unsure how she feels. Jonas then tells her to stop taking the injection and the next day, he kisses her, an [[obsolete|antiquated]] action that is unknown to the community and Jonas gained through memory.  Jonas also shares his memories with the baby, Gabriel, who was brought home by his father, to their house. He develops a close relationship with him after discovering that he shares the [[birthmark|same mark on his wrist]] Jonas does, the mark of a potential Receiver of Memory. Jonas decides that everyone should have the memories of the past and eventually, the Giver and Jonas decide that the only way to help the community is to go past the border of what they call "Elsewhere" and beyond the community. That would release the memories back into the community. Jonas sneaks out at [[curfew]] and decides to get Gabe at the Nurturing Center, who is to be "released" for his general weakness. Asher, his other longtime friend beside Fiona, tries to stop him before he leaves the neighborhood, but Jonas quickly punches him. Asher lies on the ground, stunned, and Jonas rides his bike to the Giver's dwelling. Jonas tells the Giver, and the Giver, reluctant to let Jonas leave first, lets him leave after giving him memories of courage. He rushes to the Nurturing Center. He tells Fiona of his plan and wants to take her with him, but she refuses and instead helps him retrieve Gabe. Before he leaves, she kisses him then aids in his escape.  Meanwhile, Jonas' mother ([[Katie Holmes]]) and Asher go to the Chief Elder ([[Meryl Streep]]) to tell them Jonas is missing. Guards are sent to contain Jonas, who they say has become "dangerous," but Jonas gets one of their motorcycles and drives off the cliff near the Giver's dwelling into Elsewhere. Asher is assigned by the Chief Elder to use a drone to find Jonas and "lose" (kill) him, but when he finds Jonas stumbling through the desert, he instead captures Jonas with the drone. After Jonas implores Asher to think that if he ever cared for Jonas and would let him go, Asher sets him free by dropping him into a river. Jonas stumbles onto Elsewhere, and Fiona has been condemned to be "released" for helping him. Just as she is about to be "released" by Jonas' father ([[Alexander Skarsgård]]), the Giver steps in and stalls the Chief Elder with memories of his daughter, Rosemary, trying to call out the Chief Elder but is unsuccessful.  Eventually, Jonas finds a sled, like the one that he rode in a memory from the Giver, and makes his way beyond the border of Elsewhere, releasing memories and color vision back into the community, thus saving Fiona and Jonas' father who realizes what he's doing. Right then, Jonas' mother sheds a single tear as she finally understands the feeling of love. Jonas and Gabe return to the house of his memories, where people are singing Christmas carols, and the [[voiceover]] says that back in the community, he swears that he hears music or possibly just an echo.

They are found by the woman, who kills Hossein. After Atti helps her dispose of Hossein's body, she tells her to take the cat and leave.  The following morning, Arash discovers Hossein's body. Distressed, he runs to the apartment of the woman and begs her to run away with him. As she is gathering up her things, the cat appears and Arash realizes that she had something to do with his father's death.

Godzilla (2014 film)
 In 1954, [[Godzilla]], an ancient [[Apex predator|alpha predator]], is lured to an island in an attempt to kill it with a [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]].  In 1999, Monarch scientists Ishiro Serizawa and Vivienne Graham investigate a colossal skeleton underground that was unearthed by a collapsed mine in the [[Philippines]]. They find two giant spores in the cave; one dormant and one hatched with a trail that leads out of the cave to the sea. In [[Japan]], the Janjira [[Nuclear Power Plant]] experiences unusual [[seismic]] activity; Supervisor Joe Brody sends his wife Sandra with a team of other technicians into the reactor. A [[tremor]] breaches the reactor, leaving Sandra and her team unable to escape while the plant collapses.  Fifteen years later in 2014, Joe and Sandra's son Ford, a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[United States Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal|explosive ordnance disposal]] officer, returns from a tour of duty to his wife Elle and young son Sam in [[San Francisco]] but has to immediately depart for Japan after Joe is detained for trespassing in the Janjira [[quarantine]] zone. Joe is determined to find out the cause of the Janjira [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]], and he persuades Ford to accompany him to their old home in the quarantine zone to retrieve vital data while discovering that the zone is not contaminated by radiation. They successfully retrieve the data but are discovered by soldiers and taken to a secret facility in the power plant's ruins. After several power failures, a giant winged creature emerges and escapes, destroying the facility. Joe is severely wounded and dies as he and Ford are taken by [[helicopter]] to the [[USS Saratoga (CV-60)|U.S.S. ''Saratoga'']]. The incident is reported around the world as an [[earthquake]].  Serizawa, Graham, and Ford join a U.S. Navy task force led by Admiral William Stenz to search for the creature, called a "[[MUTO]]" (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). Serizawa and Graham reveal to Ford that a 1954 deep sea expedition triggered the appearance of Godzilla and nuclear tests in the 1950s were really attempts to kill him. Project Monarch was established to secretly study Godzilla and other similar creatures such as the MUTO, which travelled from the Philippine mine to Janjira and caused the meltdown, and how they are connected with each other. Ford reveals that Joe had monitored [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] signals that indicated the MUTO was communicating with something, assumed to be Godzilla.  The MUTO attacks a Russian submarine and drops it on land in [[Hawaii]] to eat the sub's nuclear material. Godzilla arrives, causing a [[tsunami]] in [[Honolulu]] and briefly engages the MUTO in battle, until it flees. Meanwhile, a second, larger, wingless MUTO emerges from the other spore in [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Nevada]] and devastates [[Las Vegas]]. The scientists deduce that the second MUTO is female and was the one the male was communicating with, their signals being a mating call, and now the two MUTOs will meet to breed in San Francisco. As Godzilla is hunting them, they will lure him there. Over the scientists' objections concerning the monsters' radioactive nature, Stenz approves a plan to use nuclear warheads to lure the monsters to the open ocean and destroy them, with more power in the warheads than the power in the bomb used against Godzilla in 1954. Ford returns to the U.S. and, volunteering his extensive EOD knowledge, joins the team delivering the warheads by train, but the female MUTO intercepts the train and devours most of the warheads. The single remaining warhead is airlifted with Ford to San Francisco and is activated after a confrontation between the military and Godzilla at the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], but the male MUTO steals it and takes it to the female, who forms a nest around it in the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] area.  While Godzilla and the MUTOs battle, a strike team, including Ford, enters the city via [[High-altitude military parachuting|HALO jump]] to find and disarm the warhead. Unable to access the timer, the rest of the team sets the warhead on a boat for disposal at sea. The MUTOs are eventually able to get the upper hand, but Ford blows up the MUTO nest, ultimately distracting the MUTOs enough to allow Godzilla to emerge victorious in the end, killing the male MUTO by slamming him with his tail into the side of [[50 California Street|an office building]] and the female by firing his atomic breath down her throat, beheading her. Godzilla then collapses from exhaustion on the city shore. With the rest of the team wiped out, Ford uses the last of his energy to get the boat with the warhead out to sea. He is rescued before the warhead explodes and reunites with his family at an [[emergency shelter]] the following morning.  Godzilla awakens, rising from the destroyed San Francisco, and with a final, victorious roar returns to sea while the media hails Godzilla as "King of the Monsters - savior of our city?".

Gone Girl (film)
 The day of their fifth wedding anniversary, writing teacher Nick Dunne returns home to find his wife Amy is missing. Her disappearance receives heavy press coverage, as Amy was the inspiration for her parents' popular ''Amazing Amy'' children's books. Detective Rhonda Boney does a walkthrough of their house and finds poorly concealed evidence of a struggle. The police conduct a [[forensic]] analysis and uncover the remnants of cleaned blood stains, leading to the conclusion that Amy was murdered. Suspicions arise that Nick is responsible, and his apathetic behavior is interpreted by the media as characteristic of a [[sociopath]].  Flashbacks reveal that Nick and Amy's marriage had disintegrated; both lost their jobs in the [[Great Recession|recession]] and moved from [[New York City]] to Nick's hometown of North Carthage, [[Missouri]]. Nick became lazy and distant, and began cheating on Amy with one of his students.  Boney unearths evidence of financial troubles and domestic disputes, and a witness states that Amy wanted to purchase a gun. She also finds a medical report indicating that Amy is [[pregnant]], of which Nick denies knowledge, and a diary supposedly written by Amy highlighting her growing isolation, ominously ending with the fear that Nick will kill her.  Amy is revealed to be alive and well, having changed her appearance and gone into hiding in a distant campground in the [[Ozarks]]. Upon learning that Nick was cheating on her, she resolved to punish him by framing him for her murder. Amy plans the framing in great detail: she befriends a pregnant neighbor to steal her urine for the pregnancy test, drains her own blood to leave traces of evidence of murder and fabricates a diary describing her fear of Nick. She also has Nick increase her [[life insurance]] so it looks like he murdered her for the money. By using the clues in a "treasure hunt" game she and Nick play on their anniversary, she ensures he visits places where she has planted the corroborating evidence of Nick's guilt for the police to discover. She anticipates Nick will be convicted and executed for her murder, and contemplates committing suicide after his conviction.  Nick hires Tanner Bolt, a lawyer who specializes in defending men accused of killing or raping their wives. Nick meets Amy's ex-boyfriend Tommy O'Hara, who says Amy falsely accused him of rape, and gradually deduces Amy's plan. He also approaches another ex-boyfriend, the wealthy Desi Collings, against whom Amy previously filed a [[restraining order]], but Desi refuses to share any details. When Amy's neighbors at the campground rob her of her remaining money, she calls Desi and convinces him that she ran away from Nick because he was abusing her. He agrees to hide her in his lake house, which is equipped with surveillance cameras.  Nick convinces his twin sister, Margo, of his innocence. After Nick's mistress reveals their affair at a press conference, Nick appears on a talk show to profess his innocence and apologize for his failures as a husband in the hope of luring Amy. His performance rekindles Amy's feelings for him, even as Boney arrests him for Amy's murder. Amy inflicts injuries on herself and uses Desi's surveillance cameras to her advantage, making it appear that Desi kidnapped and raped her. She seduces Desi and kills him during sex by slitting his throat. Covered in Desi's blood, she returns home and names him as her captor and rapist, clearing Nick of suspicion.  When Boney questions Amy about the holes in her story, Amy accuses her of incompetence. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] sides with Amy, forcing Boney to back down. Amy tells Nick the truth, saying that the man she watched pleading for her return on TV is the man she wants him to become again. Nick shares this with Boney, Bolt, and Margo, but they have no way to prove Amy's guilt.  Nick intends to leave Amy and expose her lies, but Amy reveals she is pregnant, having [[Artificial insemination|artificially inseminated]] herself with Nick's sperm stored at a fertility clinic. Nick doubts the child is his and says he will take a paternity test. He then reacts violently to Amy's insistence that they remain married, but feels responsible for the child. Despite Margo's objections, Nick reluctantly decides to stay with Amy. The "happy" couple announces on television that they are expecting a child.

Golpo Holeo Shotti
 Rudra ([[Soham Chakraborty]]) is a pizza delivery boy who lives with his girlfriend Anu ([[Mimi Chakraborty]]). She is an aspiring novelist and is researching for writing a horror story, whereas Rudra does not believe in supernatural powers, and is very afraid of anything supernatural. Anu, keeps telling him that he would soon realize the presence of supernatural beings. At first, Rudra is confused and scared, and his fears are confirmed when he comes to know his boss, i.e., the Pizza restaurant owner Ratul's ([[Rajatava Dutta]]) daughter is possessed by a spirit named Mrinalini. He gets further scared when the possessed girl glares at Rudra when asked by a priest if she wants to take revenge on somebody. Meanwhile, Anu becomes pregnant, and after a brief altercation, Rudra and Anu get covertly married. One particular day, Rudra goes out to deliver a pizza to a customer and returns to the restaurant in a state of shock while covered in blood; he is apparently injured, keeps constantly muttering Anu's name, and seems to be worried about her. When his boss questions him, Rudra explains that went to deliver a pizza to a customer named Smitha ([[Sayani Ghosh|Saayoni Ghosh]]) in a bungalow and recounts the events that happened at the bungalow.  Smitha requests Rudra to wait downstairs while she goes upstairs to retrieve change. Almost immediately, there is a  power failure, which alarms Rudra. While waiting downstairs completely alone in the dark for a long time and not getting any reply after calling out, he goes upstairs to investigate and finds Smitha nailed to the wall and murdered suspiciously. After looking around with a torch, he notices one slice of the pizza he delivered is missing, suggesting that there may be somebody else in the house. Horrified, Rudra makes a dash for the door only to realize that it has been locked from inside. Further more when the murdered woman’s husband Bobby (Simha) arrives, he at first believes his wife is running an affair and calls her. Rudra receives the call and notices that her body is missing. Through Smitha's cellphone Rudra communicates with Bobby and explains his situation thoroughly instigating Bobby to aid him on how to get out of the house. After shuffling through various drawers, he finally finds the keys but to his dismay, he is unable to unlock the door. Moreover, Bobby suddenly disappears from the front entrance followed by a gunshot, and is found by Rudra inside the house mysteriously murdered in the same room as his wife, with two slices of the pizza now missing. Also, Rudra encounters the couple's child "Mrinalini", identical to the name of the spirit allegedly possessing Ratul's daughter and finds a scribbling "Mrinalini 5-D" in her room.  Rudra tries everything he can to get out of the house including trying to break down the sealed doors and glass windows leading outside, to using the house phone which happens to work even though the line is dead. Rudra manages to contact Anu using the phone and gets her to contact to the local police to come and rescue him. When a couple of policemen arrive at the bungalow, Rudra believes that Anu had requested them to help him, but they reveal that four people had been killed in that house - Smitha, Bobby, their young daughter and a girl named Anu in the front garden, implying that she is Rudra's girl friend, Anu. The police disclose that Rudra has been missing for four days and Anu died a week ago. Besides, they also wonder how Rudra managed to enter a sealed crime scene and also show them the exact area of the room where the murders have occurred with absolutely correct and minute details. Confused and in tears, Rudra does not believe the policemen and attempts to escape the clutches of these police men in order to go in search of Anu. While trying to escape, he witnesses the police getting dragged into the house. At this juncture, Rudra, in a horrified state, runs back to the restaurant and on the way has a fight with his friends when they spot him running and try to calm him down. While Rudra can not come to terms with the reality that Anu is dead, his friends at the restaurant and Ratul start realizing that they never saw Anu; they also observe that Rudra's home does not have any evidence that he lived with Anu. Further, it is revealed that the haunted bungalow witnessed the untimely deaths of a married couple, their daughter, and two policeman, whose ghosts Rudra interacted with. Meanwhile, Rudra seems to continue his search for Anu, has constant health issues, and seems to be disturbed by ghosts and supernatural entities.  During a delivery, when Rudra stops and calls Anu, the true story of what had happened is disclosed. The restaurant owner asks Rudra to deliver a box of candies to his house. On the way, Rudra is involved in a bike accident and come in contact with the hidden diamonds. He and Anu decide that this stealing those diamonds would improve their life style and support their baby. So, they concoct a clever story in which Rudra convincingly "forgets" the Pizza bag at the "haunted" bungalow which Ratul would never enter into, thanks to his fear of supernatural powers. Meanwhile, Anu has moved to Singapore with the diamonds and her belongings, and has obtained fake documentation using which Rudra and Anu can settle abroad. Rudra, after the phone call, goes to deliver a pizza to a house and he encounters a series of events similar to the story he narrated. Inside, he meets a little girl identical to the "Mrinalini" he had described in his story. He is locked inside the home with "Mrinalini" glaring at him. The light then goes off.  
The Golden Cane Warrior
 At the time of the [[Tang Dynasty]], in the ancient [[Sichuan Province]], Cempaka ([[Christine Hakim]]) is a silat master known as The Golden Cane Warrior. She has four disciples: Biru ([[Reza Rahadian]]), Gerhana ([[:id:Tara Basro|Tara Basro]]), Dara ([[:id:Eva Celia|Eva Celia]]) and Angin ([[Aria Kusumah]]); all of whom were children of enemies she defeated in the past. To one of them she would bequeath her powerful Golden Cane along with the ultimate technique. She eventually chose Dara, who initially felt uneasy about being the heir to the Golden Cane and thus become The Golden Cane Warrior herself.  However, before Cempaka got to teach the ultimate technique to Dara, she was betrayed by Biru and Gerhana who wanted the Golden Cane for themselves. They ambushed her as she was traveling to the place where she planned to teach Dara, along with Angin, whom she brings along to care for her deteriorating health. To give Dara and Angin the window to flee and save themselves, Cempaka fights Biru and Gerhana who manage to defeat and kill her. Later it is revealed that Gerhana was the one who had been secretly poisoning Cempaka with deadly snake venom.  Shocked by the betrayals of Biru and Gerhana as well as the death of Cempaka, Dara and Angin fled the scene but Biru and Gerhana caght up and attacked them. During the fight, Dara and Angin fell off a cliff but were saved by a mysterious man. Waking up from unconsciousness, Dara found that the man who saved her and Angin was Elang ([[Nicholas Saputra]]). Dara and Angin decided to embark on a mission to find The White Dragon Warrior, Cempaka's partner in the past. He was the only person left to teach Dara the ultimate technique of the Golden Cane. However, Elang warned them that they're not ready to find the warrior.  Angin was later caught by a group of Red Wing Warriors who were deceived by Biru and Gerhana into believing that Dara and Angin were responsible for the death of Cempaka after betraying her. The master of the Red Wing Warriors ([[Whani Darmawan]]), a close friend of Cempaka, helped Biru and Gerhana hunt Dara and Angin down not knowing that the real betrayers were the ones he trusted and was helping. Dara exchanged the Golden Cane in return for Angin alive with Biru and Gerhana. The two antagonists promised to let them go only to renege on their word. Trying to save Dara, Angin was later killed in the fight with Biru and Gerhana.  Angered by the death of Angin, Dara sneaks into the Red Wing Warriors compound, which Biru and Gerhana has taken over after killing the master with the same snake venom they used to poison Cempaka. Elang intervened and took her with him, knowing that she's not ready to fight Biru and Gerhana yet.  Elang apologized to Dara saying that he should have helped her saving Angin earlier but he cannot do so because he promised his father, who was later revealed to be The White Dragon Warrior ([[Darius Sinathriya]]) never to have anything to do with Cempaka, who was in fact White Dragon's past lover and his birth mother. He told Dara that his father was already dead and he was the only remaining person who knew the secret of the Golden Cane's ultimate technique. It was revealed that the technique that can only be done by two warriors. Dara realized at that moment that Cempaka meant to teach her and Angin the technique. She begs Elang to take her as his disciple, which he agreed to despite knowing that he was breaking the promise he made to his father. The Leader of the High Council ([[Slamet Rahardjo]]) advised against this move, but he decided to do otherwise.  Back at the former Red Wing Warriors compound, which Biru and Gerhana have transformed into their Golden Cane Warriors compound, Biru has become very violent; killing anyone unwilling to obey his words. It was later revealed as well that Biru and Gerhana were in fact lovers.  One day, Dara and Elang invaded the compound. She demanded that Biru return the Golden Cane in peace so that there will be no blood spilled. Biru refused and Dara had to challenge Biru and Gerhana to fight her and Elang fairly. The condition was no one must intervene. During the fight between Dara and Gerhana, a girl walks out of a room and Dara asked Gerhana to take the fight somewhere else as she did not want to kill Gerhana in front of her daughter. They pause for a moment but Gerhana attacked Dara who was caught off-guard. Dara, however, managed to defeat and kill Gerhana; making Biru angry. Biru blindly attacked Dara and Elang but was taken down by a blow, allowing Dara to snatch the Golden Cane. Biru got up, attacking Dara and Elang with a huge tree trunk. Dara and Elang started to spin holding the Golden Cane together; performing the Golden Cane's ultimate technique which killed Biru with a single blow.  Dara and Elang were later seen kissing and hugging; indicating that they have feelings for each other. However, the next morning, Elang left Dara who was saddened by his departure. Elang was seen talking to the Leader of the High Council, also Elang's Uncle, saying he was ready to serve the punishment for breaking the promise he made to his father. Dara, back at Cempaka's old barn, was seen teaching Biru and Gerhana's daughter martial arts; just as Cempaka took the children of her defeated enemies as her disciples.

Good Kill
 Major Thomas Egan is an officer with the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] stationed at an Air Force Base near [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. He is a former [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Falcon]] pilot, married, with two children who live with him in a suburban house off-base. His current assignment involves flying armed [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]] drones in foreign air space in support of the U.S. [[War on Terror]]. He is admired by his commanding officer and support staff for his calm demeanor, precise flying, and adaptability. Privately, he is concerned about the assignment, which he took after being informed there was reduced call for and increased competition for fighter pilots in the Air Force. His previous CO informed him that a tour flying [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) would look good on his record and would increase his chances of being posted back to a flying assignment.  At first, the new assignment seems stressful but relatively benign. He is assigned to attack more clear-cut terrorist cells, vehicles, and facilities in [[Afghanistan]]. He flies these assignments during daylight hours over his targets, which is night-time in Las Vegas, leaving his days free for his sleep period, and to spend time with his wife and children. However, the high-tempo assignment – he is attacking targets on almost a daily basis – begins taking its toll. His wife notices the stress he's under and he begins drinking when off-duty.  Still, his performance is excellent and his crew is rated among the highest in the squadron, so, on the orders of his commanding officer, he is assigned to more challenging missions under the direction of [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] controllers. Many of these targets are in [[Yemen]] and [[Somalia]], places where the U.S. has no acknowledged military mission. The targets themselves are increasingly morally ambiguous: crowds the CIA controller calls terrorist cells, public buildings the controller says are sleeping spots for high level terrorist leaders or factories for making explosives. [[Collateral damage]] goes from being a rare occurrence to a routine one. On several occasions, the CIA controller orders strikes on obvious civilian targets – including women and children – describing these casualties as unfortunate but necessitated by terrorist leaders using them as human shields.  Egan's performance declines and his drinking intensifies. He narrowly avoids being arrested for drunk driving, and starts avoiding home commitments, not wanting to inflict the stress he's under on his wife. He relishes a rare [[overwatch (military tactic)|overwatch]] assignment protecting U.S. troops as they sleep, but must break a promise to his wife in order to perform the mission. On another overwatch mission, the troops are killed by an [[improvised explosive device]] that Egan could not protect them from. After a stress-induced violent episode at home, Egan's wife demands to know the details of Egan's work, and Egan tells her. She appears appalled. Soon after, she says she is leaving him and taking the children to [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], Nevada, blaming his drinking and violent behavior.  Finally, Egan cracks. His CIA controller orders a strike on a small group of civilians responding to a building Egan had previously destroyed. Rather than obey the order, Egan simulates a glitch in the UAV control system and the targets escape. His CO has no choice but to demote him away from the attack role into a surveillance one. While on a surveillance mission, Egan notices a man whom he had previously watched rape a woman several times approaching her home. His Mission Intelligence Coordinator had previously described this man as "a bad guy. But not ''our'' bad guy." Egan conspires to send his support staff on a break, then uses the surveillance UAV to attack and kill the rapist. He then leaves the base without orders and is seen driving away from Las Vegas toward Reno.

Because of this, Vladimir sends a team of hit-men to kill Sasha. Assuming that Sasha is now dead, Vladimir goes to Lena’s flat to prepare her for Mr. Chen, but after noticing Lena’s considerably younger sister Mya, he decides to take her instead. Mr. Chen’s buyer has a particular taste for young women, and according to Mr. Chen, “the younger the better”.  Sasha goes to Vladimir’s club, and Vladimir is surprised that he is still alive. Although Vladimir tried to have him killed, Sasha asks for more time to get Vladimir his money back. After beating up Vladimir’s men in a fistfight, Sasha is given more time to recover the money. Vladimir tells Sasha that as long as he gets his money back in 14 hours, he will give Mya back to him in one piece.  To try to find out the location of Mya, Alexander kidnaps Vladimir. After being tortured, Vladimir discloses the location of where Mr. Chen is holding Mya. Alexander then attends a meeting with Mr. Chen, and offers to give Mr. Chen his $300,000 - in exchange for Mya’s safe return.

A bloody shootout then ensues, and after killing all of Mr. Chen's men, Alexander finally kills Mr. Chen in a sword-fight. He then takes Mya safely home to her brother Sasha and sister Lena.  
Goodnight Mommy
 After undergoing cosmetic facial surgery, a woman (Susanne Wuest) comes back home to her modern, isolated lakeside house and to her nine-year-old twin sons, Elias and Lukas (Elias and Lukas Schwarz). Her head is swathed in bandages, with only her eyes and mouth visible. The twins are unnerved by their mother's appearance and are further taken aback when she begins to exhibit strange behavior. She pointedly ignores Lukas and appears to only acknowledge Elias in conversation. Though it is the middle of summer, the mother orders the twins to keep the blinds closed during the day, imposes a strict rule of silence inside the house, and allows them to only play outdoors. The mother also acts cruelly and lashes out at Elias physically when he is mischievous or disobedient. The boys comment that this is something their mother would never do.  The twins begin to suspect that beneath her bandages, their mother may not be the same person. These doubts are confirmed when they find an old picture that shows the mother with another unknown woman who is wearing identical clothes and shares similar physical traits. With the suspicion that the woman residing in their house is an impostor, the twins tie the woman to the bed and refuse to let her go until she tells them where their real mother is. The woman insists that she is their mother, and the twins ultimately seal her mouth with tape to keep her from screaming for help.  In the meantime, two employees of the Red Cross arrive to collect donations. Although they initially await the return of the mother, they finally leave the house after receiving a large amount of cash from Elias, which he discreetly stole from his mother's purse. Meanwhile, the woman breaks free from the adhesive tape around her mouth and yells for help, but is too late to attract the attention of the Red Cross employees. The twins seal her lips with [[Cyanoacrylate|super glue]], only to realize that she is unable to eat. The twins cut open her lips with a small pair of scissors.  As the woman is still bound and trapped, she wets her bed. The twins briefly set her free from her shackles to change the bedding, allowing her to subdue the boys and escape. The twins, however, have set up a booby trap that causes her to fall and hit her head, knocking her unconscious. The woman wakes glued to the living room floor. Elias starts to burn down the house to pressure her into telling them the truth about their mother. The woman firmly insists that she is the twins' real mother.  The woman tells Elias that Lukas has died in an accident prior to her return home. She tearfully explains to Elias that Lukas' death was not his fault and she begs her son to set her free so they can both move on from the tragedy. Elias challenges her to prove that she is their mother by telling them what Lukas is doing. As she cannot see Elias' hallucination of Lukas threatening to set fire to a curtain, she cannot answer the question. So Elias, believing that his real mother could see Lukas, grabs his arm and lights the curtain. The woman subsequently burns to death before firefighters arrive.  The final shot of the film shows Elias and Lukas walking through the cornfield and emerging to be with their mother, the three of them smiling and embracing.

Grace of Monaco (film)
  ''Grace of Monaco'' is focused on former Hollywood star [[Grace Kelly]]'s crisis of marriage and identity, during a [[France–Monaco relations#Monegasque politics|dispute]] between Monaco's [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]] and France's [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1962 as well as her considering a return to Hollywood to film [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]''.<ref name=autogenerated1></ref>  In 1962, several years after her departure from Hollywood in 1956, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] visits Princess Grace in Monaco with an invitation to return to Hollywood to star in his new film ''Marnie''. The offer comes with a lucrative incentive of a one million dollar contract if she accepts his offer for the starring role. Princess Grace is intrigued by the offer. Her role as the wife of a head of state has been limited in scope and dealing mostly with charity work for hospitals and humanitarian efforts. She asks her husband for permission and he initially appears to be agreeable to her taking the role if she wants the part.  In the meantime, tensions between France and Monaco are growing due to the dependence which France associates with the trade favors it has been offering to Monaco throughout the twentieth century. France initiates diplomatic measures to get Monaco to accept a position of being a province within France, in the hope that Prince Rainier will give up his sovereign control over Monaco. The Prince is reticent to accept any such offer. This in turn provokes France to begin initial steps toward a trade embargo against Monaco. The French government also initiates clandestine contact with close members of the Prince's family, namely his sister and her husband, in order to help expedite the Prince's capitulation to French demands in exchange for favors. The tensions caused also created difference in opinions of the Prince and his wife which cause the Prince to wish to take back his offer to allow Grace to accept the film offer from Hitchcock. The Princess appears to need to take stock of her responsibilities and re-evaluate her priorities.  She decides to increase her concern for her participation in the improvement of local hospitals and Red Cross aid throughout Europe, and she organizes a charity Ball to take place in October for the purposes of fund raising and improving the prestige of Monaco in the process. Unexpectedly, she receives a report presenting photographic evidence that the Prince's sister has been covertly negotiating with France and de Gaulle against the interests of the Prince, which she promptly reports to the Prince. The Prince denounces his sister's conduct and takes steps to have her exiled from Monaco by due process of law. Princess Grace decides that the Hollywood offer is no longer a part of her life and no longer a viable option to her given her new diplomatic and political responsibilities in Monaco. Her international charity ball for the Red Cross is a grand success and Monaco gains significant international political capital from the event which allows the Prince and Princess to preserve the sovereignty of Monaco for themselves, their children, and the people of Monaco.  
The Grand Budapest Hotel
 In the present day, a teenage girl approaches a statue in a courtyard. In her arms is a memoir by "The Author." She begins reading about a trip he made to the Grand Budapest Hotel in the late 1960s. He discovered that the nearly deserted hotel, located in the Republic of Zubrowka, a nation ravaged by war and poverty, had fallen on hard times and become dilapidated. The Author meets Zero Moustafa, the hotel's owner, who tells him over dinner the tale of how he took ownership of the Grand Budapest and why he is unwilling to close it down.  Moustafa's story begins in 1932 during the final years of the hotel's glory days. Zubrowka is on the verge of war but this is of little concern to M. Gustave, the Grand Budapest's devoted concierge. When he is not attending to the needs of the hotel's wealthy clientele, managing its staff or training the new lobby boy, Zero (a younger Moustafa), Gustave courts a series of aging, blonde women who all flock to the hotel to enjoy his "exceptional service."  One of these, Madame D, spends the night with Gustave prior to her departure.  A month later, he is informed that Madame D has died under mysterious circumstances. He and Zero race to her wake where he learns that she bequeathed him a valuable painting in her will. This enrages her family, all of whom hoped to inherit it, especially her son, Dmitri Desgoffe-und-Taxis. Gustave and Zero take the painting and hide it in a safe at the Grand Budapest. Gustave is then arrested and framed for the murder of Madame D.  In prison, Gustave befriends a group of hardened cons who include him in their escape plan. With the aid of Zero's new fiancée Agatha, the group escape the maximum security prison. They part ways and Gustave enlists Zero to prove his innocence. Their adventure takes them to a mountaintop monastery where they meet with Madame D's butler Serge X, the only person who can provide Gustave with an alibi for the night of Madame D's murder. However, Serge is murdered by J.G. Jopling, a henchman hired by Dmitri.  Zero and Gustave steal a sled and chase Jopling as he flees the monastery. During a clash on the edge of a cliff, Zero kills the assassin and rescues his mentor.  Zero and Gustave return to the Hotel, which the military has commandeered as war has just broken out. They find that Dmitri has also appeared, chasing Agatha, who was entrusted with the painting. A chase and a gunfight ensue, and a different version of Madame D's will is discovered hidden in the painting by Serge X, in which she bequeaths her entire fortune, including the Grand Budapest, to Gustave in the event that she should be murdered.  During a train trip, soldiers search Gustave's carriage and he is killed while trying to protect Zero. A heartbroken Zero vows to continue his legacy at the Grand Budapest, but the ongoing conflict and the ravages of time take their toll. Agatha succumbs to a disease and dies a few years later.  Moustafa confesses to the Author that he cannot bring himself to close the hotel because it is his last link to his dearly departed wife. The Author later departs for South America and never returns to the hotel. The hotel is eventually demolished, though Moustafa's ultimate fate is left unknown. Back in the present, the girl continues reading the author's story about the Grand Budapest.

Gore, Quebec (film)
  A voiceover announces that the following footage was recovered from the camera of Dave Reynolds, who, in 2011, had left Ontario to spend a weekend in his parents' cottage in [[Gore, Quebec]] with his brother Sean, and their friends Katie, Brandon, Stacey, Colin, Erin, and Mike.  When Sean and Dave reach the cottage, they find a note informing them that the alarm was tripped a week ago, but that there were no signs of vandalism or theft; they also spot someone watching them from the woods, though Sean dismisses the observer as a neighbor or a hiker. Most of the others arrive, and mention that Brandon, Mike, and Mike's [[blind date]] Amanda should be there by tomorrow afternoon. A few hours into the group's partying, Katie stumbles into the cottage bleeding, followed by a man who attacks the others, and turns Dave's camera off. The film switches to a traditional third-person narrative, and shows the intruder breaking Erin's neck with an [[oar]].  The next day, Brandon, Mike, and Amanda drive to the cottage as a newscast announces that new DNA evidence has cast doubt on the guilt of Nick Gleason, who was convicted of five counts of first-degree murder in 2003. Upon reaching the cottage, Brandon goes for a walk, and Mike and Amanda go out on the boat, and discover Katie's body in the lake. Mike and Amanda go in search of Brandon, who has stumbled onto a series of abandoned structures, some of which are covered in [[graffiti]] that appears to have been drawn with blood. The killer mutilates and hangs Brandon, and uses his blood to add to the graffiti.  Elsewhere, the wounded Dave awakens in the woods, surrounded by the corpses of Erin and Sean, and runs off in search of aid, finding Mike and Amanda. Dave tells the two what happened to the others, and as they head back to the cottage, the killer throws an axe into Dave's back. The killer chases Amanda and Mike to where Colin and Stacey's remains are, and a flashback shows how he framed Nick Gleason for the five murders he committed in 2003.  Amanda and Mike reach the cottage, as does the killer, who axes a visiting neighbor. When the killer enters, Amanda bludgeons him with an oar, and she and Mike make a run for it, reaching Brandon's car, which they crash. The film returns to the "[[found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]]" format used at the beginning, with the killer using Dave's camera to film the posed bodies of his victims, and the captive Mike and Amanda.

[[Nova Corps]] officers capture the four, detaining them in the [[List of correctional facilities in comics#The Kyln|Kyln]]. A powerful inmate there, [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]], attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Ronan and Thanos, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora has a buyer for the orb, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the ''Milano''.  Ronan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, [[Thanos]], to discuss her betrayal.

Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the ''Dark Aster'', Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.  The Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the ''Dark Aster'' at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the ''Dark Aster'' with the ''Milano''. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet.

The damaged ''Dark Aster'' crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, they use it to destroy Ronan.  In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species.

They meet Lateef (Pankaj Tripathi), who offers them food in exchange for smuggling guns. One of Lateef's customers, an army officer, wants one of the boys as his sex slave; if Lateef refuses, his daughter will be taken. Lateef chooses Bala at first, but Bikram insists that he will go instead. Bala refuses to leave his best friend, and returns to save Bikram from the officer, whom they kill. This makes them partners in crime; when the army chases them, Lateef is killed while trying to protect the duo. Bikram and Bala flee to [[Calcutta]] and work at a restaurant.

To avoid detection, he performs the surgery at his house, much to the chagrin of his wife Ghazala ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]), who questions his allegiance. The following day, during a military raid, Hilaal is accused of harbouring terrorists. A shootout ensues at his home, during which Ikhlaque is killed and Hilaal is taken away for questioning. The doctor's house is bombed subsequently to kill any other militant hiding inside. Several days later, Hilaal and Ghazala's son, Haider ([[Shahid Kapoor]]), returns from [[Aligarh Muslim University]] to seek answers about his father's disappearance. Upon arrival, he is shocked to find his mother singing and laughing along with her brother-in-law, Khurram ([[Kay Kay Menon]]). Unable to understand his mother's behaviour, he begins searching for his father in various police stations and detention camps with the help of his childhood sweetheart Arshia Lone ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]), a journalist.  Saddened by the growing closeness between Ghazala and Khurram, and unable to find any leads, Haider begins to lose hope. However, Arshia encounters a stranger, Roohdar, who asks her to inform Haider that he will be able to provide information about Hilaal. Haider contacts Roohdar ([[Irrfan]]), who turns out to be part of a separatist group. Roohdar then narrates the story of how he met Hilaal in one of the detention centers, where they both were tortured. Hilaal attributes his imprisonment to his brother, Khurram. Roohdaar then tells the story of how Haider's father was brutally murdered by Khurram's made-up terrorist group and how Roohdar survived after being shot and thrown into the river with Haider's father, which stopped his bleeding and allowed him to escape, though Hilaal died. Roohdaar then tells Haider that he simply wanted to pass on his father's message to him: revenge for Khurram's betrayal. Thereafter, angry and swearing to avenge the injustice done to his father, Haider breaks down at Hilaal's grave site and becomes mentally and emotionally shattered. He starts suffering from the effects of a [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], shaving his head and behaving strangely. Khurram, after learning of the meeting between Haider and Roohdar, tells him that Roohdar was the one who killed his father. Haider is now confused as to whom to believe despite knowing the truth himself, and discloses his dilemma to Arshia, adding that Roohdar gave him a gun to kill his uncle. Arshia confides this to her father Pervez, who informs Khurram about the gun. Khurram, at a ceremony related to his marriage with Ghazala, which has now been solemnised, immediately orders his men to corner Haider and send him to a mental institution.  The following morning, Haider is all set to kill his uncle but cannot accomplish it because his uncle is offering [[Salat|prayers]] and his morals prevent it. Haider is captured by Pervez who orders him to be executed, but Haider manages to escape, although not before mercilessly killing his captors, the Salmans. He contacts Roohdar, who suggests getting trained in Pakistan to avenge his father's death, and Haider agrees. He calls his mother and informs her about it to which she asks him to meet her once before going to the other side of [[Indo-Pakistani border|border]]. During the meeting, Ghazala discloses that she had told Khurram about the terrorists hiding in their house not knowing that he was an informer of the Indian army. Pervez traces them and is about to shoot Haider when Haider shoots him dead and escapes.  Tormented by her father's death at the hands of Haider, Arshia is emotionally traumatized and commits suicide. Meanwhile, Ghazala finds Roohdar's contact number from Arshia's diary and calls him. Haider goes to his pickup point, the graveyard where his father was buried. At the graveyard, Haider contemplates about the universal nature of mortality. On seeing Arshia's brother Liyaqat in the graveyard, he realises that the corpse is of Arshia. He runs towards her body where Liyaqat sees him and informs Khurram. A fight ensues between Haider and Liyaqat, resulting in the latter's death. Khurram arrives with full force and a gunfight ensues; meanwhile Roohdar drops Ghazala at the graveyard. A fierce exchange of bullets and bombs leaves only Haider and few men on Khurram's side alive. Just when Khurram is about to kill Haider, Ghazala pleads for a chance to convince Haider to surrender. She confronts her son who says that he cannot die before avenging his father's death. Ghazala tells him that revenge only results in revenge and there is no end to this cycle, but Haider, who is bent on revenge, does not understand. Ghazala kisses Haider goodbye and steps outside, only to reveal that she is wearing a suicide vest (given to her by Roohdar). Khurram and Haider rush towards her but she pulls the pins of the [[hand grenade]] resulting in a big explosion, killing herself along with the rest of Khurram's men and gravely injuring Khurram himself, while Haider is only slightly thrown back from the force of the explosion. Haider goes to his mother's remains, weeps by her side and goes to kill Khurram, whose legs have been severed from his body.  He is reminded of his mother's words that "revenge only results in revenge" and thus decides to let Khurram live. Khurram begs Haider to kill him to free him from the burden of guilt and to avenge his father's death, but Haider doesn't oblige Khurram, instead ignores him and leaves just as Khurram dies

Durand), a Haitian man visiting the city. Despite her parents' objections, Marie accepts Paul's wedding proposal. They both decide to get married in Haiti on January 12, 2010 - the day that the 2010 Haiti earthquake took place.  On Marie and Paul's first wedding anniversary, Marie returns to Haiti, where she proceeds to walk through [[Port-au-Prince]] in her wedding dress. Upon her arrival to the ruins of the cathedral where the wedding was held, she discovers three fragments of [[stained glass]] (colored red, blue and yellow) at the altar where Marie and Paul stood one year ago. In July 2012, Marie receives a call in New York from Paul, who is residing in Haiti. She requests that they meet in Port-au-Prince, where she intends to surprise him with the news that he is the father of her two-year-old son named Christophe. The turbulence experienced during the flight back to Haiti reminds Marie of the earthquake, and as a result, she contacts Paul upon her arrival, requesting that they meet in [[Cap-Haïtien]] (where initially they had planned to spend their honeymoon) instead of Port-au-Prince. Paul agrees to see Marie, but informs her that at the moment, he's "seeing friends". Through a brief voice-over narration by Paul, it is revealed that after the earthquake, he experiences difficulty in connecting with his emotions and confronting his past. After an unsuccessful attempt at recollecting his memories at the Port-au-Prince cathedral, Paul is transported to the commune of [[Jacmel]] on his friend's motorcycle.  In Jacmel, three weeks prior to his reunion with Marie, Paul spends time with his lover and fiancée Natasha (Ketia Lerine). Natasha harbors feelings of mistrust for Paul, who left for New York after the earthquake, and spent three years there without having ever contacted her. Upon his return to Haiti, Paul proposed to Natasha, much to the disapproval of her mother (Enice Lerine) and sister (Fabienne Lerine). During his stay in Jacmel, he receives a [[still camera]] from Natasha's father, an elderly [[Voudon]] painter (Pariza Domond), which he eventually uses to take pictures of the city. In her voice-over narration, Natasha expresses her desire for Paul to, one day, do an exhibit of his photographs, thereby showcasing the beauty of her hometown.  The following day, Natasha's father explains to Paul the inspiration behind one of his paintings, which depicts Paul and Marie in their wedding clothes on the altar of the cathedral. According to Natasha's father, the image of the wedding came to him in a dream he had on the day before the earthquake. He also reveals that he lost all his material possessions during the earthquake, with the exception of his paintbrush which he now uses to make his living as an artist.  Days later, during a vehicular tour of Haiti, Paul and Marie finally reunite. While exploring an abandoned [[château]] during the tour, Marie converses with Paul. She informs him that their son Christophe is currently in the United States, while Paul reveals to her that he lost his memory after the earthquake.  Meanwhile, a disenchanted Natasha sits on a rocking chair inside her home, caressing Paul's motorcycle helmet. Outside the house, Natasha's father stares at a blank canvas. With a pencil, he makes a light sketch.  Suddenly, in a [[surrealistic]], high-speed, [[monochrome]]-colored montage, all the preceding events in the film are shown in reverse.  The montage concludes with a close-up of bride and groom cake toppers atop of a wedding cake before returning to the shot of Natasha's father and the blank canvas.

However, for the script's ending, Yudi goes to Mumbai and sees Aanchal where he tells her they can take it one day at a time – and perhaps live their whole lives together like that.

 Ko, a corrupt detective whose mother recently died, drives away in the middle of the funeral, having been informed that his squad is being investigated by internal affairs for bribery. He crashes into a homeless man who wanders onto the road, killing him. Fearing manslaughter charges, as he is intoxicated, Ko declines to call the police, and hides the body from a passing patrol car. With the body in his trunk, he returns to the funeral and manages to seal the body into his mother's coffin while escaping detection. A few days later, Ko purposely gets into another crash, which conceals the earlier damage and gives him a reason to visit the repair shop. To the fortune of Ko and his squad, the aforementioned investigation is cancelled by a lieutenant named Park.  The next assignment of the squad happens to be the capture of a wanted murderer, Lee, revealed to be the homeless man. While searching his hide-out, the squad finds nothing significant, but they meet another police officer who is investigating a hit-and-run incident based on an anonymous tip. As it happens, the hide-out is right next to the site of the collision, and a traffic camera is nearby. The squad examines the low-quality camera footage, noting that the model of the colliding car is the same as Ko's. Moreover, a triangulation of the homeless man's phone, while inexact, points to an area near Ko's mother's grave.  It is revealed that the driver of the patrol car mentioned earlier was Park, who outranks Ko, and that he witnessed Ko's collision, though he doesn't know where the body was taken. Rather than formally report Ko, Park black-mails him and demands possession of the body. Ko excavates the coffin and searches Lee, wishing to understand why Lee's body is so important, and finds Lee's cell phone as well as a metal capsule inside of Lee's rectum. The cell phone receives a call from a fellow criminal, whom Ko tracks down and interrogates, and who reveals, finally, that Park stole a large amount of confiscated cocaine. However, after storing his profits in a private vault, Lee stole the key and escaped, and right before the collision, was bleeding from a bullet wound caused by Park.  Ko returns to the grave-site, but is arrested by his subordinate, who tailed him after discovering, by means of another traffic photograph, that Ko's car was damaged immediately after the time of Lee's death. The subordinate is killed, however, when Park uses a crane to drop a shipping container onto his car. Ko gets ready to report on Park, and to turn in himself as well, but Park threatens to kill Ko's sister and daughter. In response, Ko steals a time-bomb from the police basement and inserts it into Lee's body's rectum, and hands the body to Park, whose van gets blasted off a bridge into a lake. Against the odds, Park survives and fights Ko in his apartment, but shoots and kills himself while trying to dislodge a revolver from a fallen bookshelf. In the end, senior police officials decide to cover up Park's and Ko's crimes to protect their own reputations. Ko chooses to resign, and, using the metal capsule from earlier, accesses Park's private vault, discovering an enormous reserve of cash, more than he could have imagined.

Somehow, everybody is okay, but Malcolm and Ray leave an unconscious Kisha in the backseat and run away. A year later, Malcolm moves in with his girlfriend Megan, an insecure woman with two kids, her bratty and promiscuous teenage daughter Becky and effeminate son Wyatt, who has a stereotypically black imaginary friend named Tony.

He blows its head off to put it out of its misery.  Among other weird scenarios that plague the family is Becky opening her box and having a whole swarm of moths fly out. Malcolm fixes this by installing lights to attract bugs to their doom. He also notices the demon, which Professor Wilde says is named Aghoul, taunting him in the videos. Although he tries to explain the weirdness to Megan and the kids, they don't believe him. To make matters worse, Malcolm comes home the next day to discover Kisha talking to Megan, looking very much not possessed. She has told Megan that Malcolm left her in a ditch to die, and she leaves after flashing him some scary black demon eyes. Later, Malcolm sees Abigail wrote "Miss me?" in red crayon all over the walls. He tries getting rid of her by burying her, but she comes back. He sends her back to Taiwan she still comes back. He chops her up and barbecues her, but again she still comes back.  Malcolm resorts to seeking help from the [[Insanity|insane]] Father Doug Williams. He finds the crazy priest in a church, shanking another priest for absurd reasons. When Malcolm asks for his help, Doug only makes weird comments about the Kardashians coming after him and other men. Malcolm leaves when he thinks he sees demons surrounding a church, but they're really just church women who make comments about Malcolm being with a white woman. Miguel comes over and offers a chicken to be used as a blood sacrifice. Malcolm ends up wrestling the chicken all across the kitchen, ending with him throwing the chicken up into the ceiling fan where it is decapitated. He and Miguel fry the remains and eat it with waffles.  As a last resort, Malcolm goes to find Ned and Noreen Swanson, a sort of racist and sexually frustrated paranormal investigative husband and wife duo. He brings them to his house, where they determine that the demonic presence has attracted the family to it, explaining Becky's need for the box, Wyatt's imaginary friend, and Malcolm's sexual attraction to Abigail. They take hits from a bong mask and go downstairs to find Becky fully possessed. She flails around and gets thrown everywhere. Malcolm calls upon Doug to come by, but he has a mental breakdown and ends up shooting himself in the head. Becky runs upstairs and Malcolm chases after her. After some reluctance, he gets the demon to transfer itself to himself by having Becky regurgitate red goo. Everybody runs upstairs to find Malcolm possessed. He too pukes up the goo back into Becky's box. The Swansons take the possessed items, including Abigail so Ned can have sex with her. Everything seems okay until the night when Malcolm and Megan are watching TV and Kisha shows up behind them. She twists Megan's neck around, sending Malcolm running away.  Ray and his boys come to Malcolm's house to find Megan dead, along with Becky upstairs, impaled in her bed, and Wyatt is missing. They find Malcolm lying on the floor in the basement, still alive. After a bit of panicked rambling, Kisha comes downstairs, leaving all the men to scream in fear.

Haunted Road
 Seven friends: Xuelian, Zengliang, Huazi, Haojian, Ningmeng, Xiaotian, and Dudu, are on their way to attend a friend's wedding when they see the aftermath of a car accident on a highway. Instead of helping the victim, they move about their business until their car breaks down, forcing them to take shelter at a road stop. Throughout the film, Xuelian gives monologues about her friends: how unsympathetic they are to the victim, how they only view love through sex, and how they only reveal their inner feelings when they are in conflict. Seeing that nobody is at the stop, the seven decide to camp out for the night. Dudu, who is single and loves to eat, is dared to take a [[selfie]] across the road. When the lights turn off one by one, Dudu escapes to the service store as the ghost chases her. Xiaotian is bribed by Zengliang to take food and drinks, in the process stealing money at the counter as well as the savings of the car accident victim. While celebrating his findings, he is chased and killed by the ghost.  Xuelian and Haojian decide to search for Dudu after a while. When Haojian professes his love for her, Xuelian ignores it so they can continue the search uninterrupted. They are joined by the lovestruck Ningmeng, who is in love with Haojian, while Zengliang and Huazi have sex in the garage. Xuelian, Haojian, and Ningmeng find Dudu's body at the cafeteria. Panicking, Ningmeng is left behind and killed when the ghost wraps tight cloths and clothesline wires around her. Zengliang and Huazi regroup with the other two after they discover Xiaotian's body in the restroom. Blaming Huazi for making the group not check the accident victim, Haojian tries to kill all of them and is able to injure Zengliang's knee, but is knocked out by Xuelian and left to die at the hands of the ghost.  The remaining trio realize that the deaths are foreshadowed by photos sent to the survivors (Dudu's being sent Xiaotian's, Xiaotian's being sent to Zengliang, Ningmeng's being sent to Huazi, and Haojian's being sent to Xuelian). They futilely try to start a stray car at the garage. Jealous at seeing Xuelian tending to Zengliang's wound, Huazi fakes the cursed photo and strikes Xuelian with an axe, apparently killing her. The couple leave the compound until Huazi breaks her leg in a bush. Left at her own fate by Zengliang, Huazi is then killed by the ghost. After briefly seeing an illusion of a crowded road stop, Zengliang reunites with Xuelian, who has survived her injuries. However, he leaves her behind on the road only for him to be killed by the ghost.  Left alone on the road, Xuelian is confronted by the ghost and learns the truth: Xuelian ''is'' the car accident victim. Abused and tormented since childhood, Xuelian took the final straw when her boyfriend dumped her in favor of another woman. She tried to commit suicide by swerving her car on the highway, but survived; all of the previous events are her [[near-death experiences]]. Her six "friends" are really strangers who chose to stop and help her after witnessing the accident; her previous monologues are her reflections about her trauma. The film closes with Xuelian stating that the six strangers have helped her escape from the darkness and her negative views about the world.

Heavenly Sword (film)
  It is foretold that a human savior will wield the Heavenly Sword. In the past, the Raven Lord would go to war with anyone just to gain power. But when humanity was at its wits end, a warrior descended from the Heavens. He challenged and defeated the Raven Lord with the Heavenly Sword. When the fight ended, the warrior disappeared, leaving behind his sword. Men would fight anyone tooth and nail just to wield the Heavenly Sword’s unearthly power. Eventually, the Heavenly Sword was entrusted to the ancient clan of nomadic warriors to ensure that man does not use it for evil purposes.  From here, the film's plot follows that of the game closely. The film begins with Nariko, who is a part of that very same clan that were entrusted with the Heavenly Sword. She is known as the failure of the clan, including her father.  She is skilled in fighting but her father, Shen, does not recognize her skills since she is a female.  When King Bohan’s [[assassin]]s invade the clan’s fortress, Nariko demonstrates her skills by killing many assassins and rescuing Kyo. Bohan knows the clan guards the Heavenly Sword and came to get it since it is the only sword that can kill him. Shen sees her skills and gives her the Heavenly Sword to protect. She is to travel west, while her father and the remaining clan members travel east.  While escaping some of Bohan’s soldiers, the bridge fell. Waiting on the other side is Bohan. He wants her to hand the sword over or be killed like her father and Kai, her sister. Nariko never knew that Kai was her sister. Apparently, on the night of Nariko’s birth, Shen left the fortress to impregnate many women to correct his mistake: having Nariko. Months later, Kai was born, another failure.  But there is another surprise. Two days before Christmas, one of the women Shen impregnated gave birth to a son, unbeknownst to him. The woman faked her own death and escaped to a fishing village in the north. The son is the chosen one. Bohan spent twenty long years searching for him.  When Nariko was about to give the sword to Bohan, she changed her mind. Since she has nothing to live for, she grabbed the sword and jumped down the [[ravine]].  As the year of the Firehorse began years ago, Nariko was born. No one knew that firstborn child would be a daughter instead of a son. Disappointed in having a daughter, Shen sent Nariko to live far away, in the forest. [[Prophet]] Takashi took this opportunity to train her to become a warrior in secrecy.  As Nariko wakes up, she finds that she is in front of a campfire. The person who fished her out is Kai. Kai knew that Nariko is her sister but didn’t say anything because Shen didn’t want to be Kai’s father. They decide to travel north to find their brother.  As they traveled, Nariko learned about Kai’s mother. Her mother was strong and funny. When Shen visited, he would bring gold – “to help”. One day, Flying Fox came. When her mother saw him, she hid Kai in a cave. He had come to get Kai. Fox and his men killed her people and mother.  Before they reached the fishing village in the dead marsh, General Whiptail’s soldiers killed many villagers. With the help of Nariko and the Heavenly Sword and Kai and her [[crossbow]], they helped some of the villagers and got directions to their brother. But when they reached the hut that their brother, Loki, should have lived in, they learned that he left a year ago for the northeast. He wanted to become a blacksmith for a foreign king.  Whiptail overhears this and orders her soldiers to kill them. When Nariko and Kai kill her, they are informed that Whiptail already told the villagers that whoever tells Bohan of Loki’s whereabouts will be rewarded beyond their wildest dreams.  But when Nariko and Kai reached the fortress in the northeast, Bohan’s soldiers were already coming. The effects of the Heavenly Sword start to show in Nariko. It is slowly draining her soul, trying to kill its bearer. From deduction, they find out that the king Loki is trying to work for is none other than Bohan and the fortress in the northeast is Bohan’s as well. They see Shen getting dragged to a cage and that Bohan lied to them about Shen and their people.  In the fortress, they find and rescue Takashi and the other clan members. They learn that Kyo, the person who bullies the sisters, rode to Bohan’s army after the sisters left but dies fighting them. They told Shen about their brother and that he is the chosen one. Shen said that he was doing the right thing when he impregnated many women. He learned the errors of his ways and his daughters forgave him. As Shen was about to die, Nariko used the Heavenly Sword’s power to bring him back but the effects start to get worse.  Nariko and Kai arrive to Bohan’s blacksmith forge but are too late. The couple they helped earlier when they arrived at Loki’s village sold him out. There were others after them but since they were the first, they get the gold. Nariko and Kai rescue Loki and killed Bohan’s son.  After Nariko gives the Heavenly Sword to Loki, he is killed by Flying Fox. He does the same to Kai. During a difficult battle, Kai, who was just unconscious and badly wounded, killed the real Flying Fox. Kai stops Nariko before she could use the sword’s healing power.

When Bohan’s army arrives, Nariko learns that Kyo, who is supposed to be dead, is alive. He was the one who told Bohan where the Heavenly Sword was. He did it because he knows that Bohan was always coming and once the sword is given to him, the clan will be free. She refuses so Bohan commands his army to rain arrows on them.

As he tells the story, the film switches to Alfred’s point of view. With no dialogue, he gets out of bed fully dressed and goes to the window. A giant airship is waiting for him. He walks across an extended ladder from the hospital to the airship. As the airship flies away, hospital windows full of red balloon dogs can be seen.

 Hector is a quirky psychiatrist who has become increasingly tired of his humdrum life. He tells his girlfriend, Clara, that he needs to go on a journey to research happiness. On a flight to China, he is seated next to Edward, a cranky businessman. Edward takes Hector to a very exclusive nightclub in [[Shanghai]], where Hector meets a young woman named Ying Li and instantly falls for her.  He asks to meet Ying Li's family.

Hector then ventures into the mountains and visits a monastery, where he befriends their leader and talks briefly with Clara via [[Skype]].  Hector departs on a terrifying plane ride to Africa, where a woman invites him to her family's house for [[Sweet potato|sweet potato stew]], and gives him a book about happiness written by one Professor Coreman. Hector meets up with his old friend Michael, a physician, with his bodyguard Marcel, and later meets a quick-tempered [[drug lord]] named Diego Baresco, who doesn't believe in happiness because his wife is unhappy due to her medication, but loans Hector a pen to write down a prescription for his wife.  Hector discovers that Marcel is Michael’s lover, and they are happy. He Skypes again with Clara, who is going out in a fancy gown and seems uninterested in talking to him. He visits the local woman who he befriended on the plane and her family for dinner. His vehicle is carjacked and Hector is kidnapped and locked in a rat-infested cell. When the kidnappers decide to kill him, Hector claims to be friends with Diego to save himself, but cannot prove it. With a gun pointed at his head, Hector asks if he can make one final note in his book about what brings his captors happiness, revealing the pen engraved with Diego's name to the kidnappers. Upon his release, Hector makes his way back to the village where he celebrates with the locals.  While flying to Los Angeles, Hector attends to a woman with a [[Brain tumor]]. Hector then goes to the beach in Santa Monica and encounters Agnes, an old girlfriend, who is now happily married with children. Hector calls Clara and they break up in an argument.  Agnes and Hector meet with Professor Coreman, who is studying the effects of happiness on the brain. During a lecture, Coreman points out that people shouldn't be concerned with the pursuit of happiness, but with the happiness of pursuit. Agnes and Hector check out a project Coreman has been working on, which monitors brain activity in real time and how it reacts to different emotions.  Agnes is instructed to go into an isolated room and think about three things: times when she was happy, sad and scared. Through his [[Neuroimaging|brain-scanning technology]], Coreman is able to tell in which order she thought about the three emotions. When Hector takes his turn, he thinks about Clara marrying someone else, about his time being kidnapped, and about Ying Li, but his emotions are strangely blocked. He receives a call from remorseful Clara, who tells him she wants to be a mother. Hector explains what he's learned, that the most unhappy thing he could imagine would be to lose her. Suddenly Hector's brain scan erupts with a flurry of activity, mimicking the colored flags from the monastery and revealing that true happiness isn't just one emotion; it's all of them. Having finally achieved his own happiness, Hector rushes home and marries Clara.

Kouta and Mai take Shu to Drupers where they meet [[Kamen Rider Decade (character)|Tsukasa Kadoya]], and [[List of Kamen Rider Decade characters#Narutaki|Narutaki]] appears before them as well, affirming that the fifteen Heisei Riders must join forces to stop the Badan Empire, and before leaving, warns them that asking for the Shōwa Riders help is useless as they will refuse to cooperate with them. Tsukasa then departs to gather the other Kamen Riders with Kaito Kumon, while Kouta stays behind to take care of Shu. The first Rider they contact is [[Kamen Rider Double (character)#Shotaro Hidari|Shotaro Hidari]], who refuses to hear their plea before he finishes his job to search for some lost pets. Leaving Kaito behind to help Shotaro with his errand, Tsukasa contacts [[List of Kamen Rider 555 characters#Takumi Inui|Takumi Inui]] who also refuses to help, claiming that his days as a Kamen Rider are over. Kamen Rider Fifteen appears to attack them, and Tsukasa transforms into Kamen Rider Decade to fight him, allowing Takumi and himself to escape harm. Some time later in a ramen shop, Takumi involves himself in an incident where a wounded runaway criminal holds Mari, a high school girl, hostage. [[Kamen Rider X (character)#Keisuke Jin|Keisuke Jin]] appears and heals his wounds before convincing him to release Mari and surrender to the police. Takumi then follows Jin to his clinic, where he helps him tend to another patient. Takumi then confides in Jin about how he is haunted by the death of his friend [[List of Kamen Rider 555 characters#Masato Kusaka|Masato Kusaka]] and Jin convinces him to stay at his clinic for a while.  The next day, Takumi and Mari are attacked by the Badan Empire. In order to protect her, Takumi decides to fight again as Kamen Rider Faiz, defeating them, but in turn, Jin reveals himself as Kamen Rider X, attacking and defeating Faiz before claiming that he must find his resolve by himself.

Elsewhere, Shu finally remembers his past and leads Kouta to his house, where it is revealed that Shu has been dead the whole time. Just before his death, he had a fight with his mother, and he now wishes to see her one last time to make amends with her. Kamen Rider Fifteen then appears to take Shu with him, and Kouta learns that he is actually Shu's father Ren Aoi. Aoi reveals that the Badan Empire intends to use Shu's powers to power up a machine known as the Mega Reverse, which can make the dead return to life while killing the living, allowing his son to come back to life. While Kamen Rider Gaim fights Kamen Rider Fifteen, Kamen Rider Decade appears and takes Shu to see his mother, but [[List of Kamen Rider Black characters#General Jark|General Jark]] stands on his way. Kamen Riders [[Kamen Rider Black (character)|Black]] and [[Kamen Rider Black RX (character)|Black RX]] appear to defeat Jark before turning to fight Kamen Rider Decade as well, but Shotaro appears to fight them instead as Kamen Rider Joker and allows Tsukasa to keep escorting the boy. Kamen Rider Baron appears to assist Kamen Rider Joker against the Shōwa Riders while Tsukasa takes Shu to the lighthouse where his mother is staying. But before he can meet her, Kamen Rider Fifteen appears and defeats both Kamen Riders Decade and Gaim with the power of the Heisei Rider Lockseed.  Back in the present day, as the Shōwa and Heisei Riders fight and defeat each other, [[List of Ressha Sentai ToQger characters#General Schwarz|General Schwarz]] from the Shadow Line appears to join forces with the Badan Empire, interested in using the Mega Reverse Machine to convert light into darkness to expand the Shadow Line's domains, and sends his Kuliners to attack [[Kamen Rider Den-O (character)|Kamen Rider Den-O]]'s Den Liner. Kouta, Tsukasa, and Takumi join forces with the remaining Heisei Riders and confront the Shōwa Riders about their reasons for attacking them. Kamen Rider 1 explains that it was all the Heisei Riders fault, as it was their attachment to their deceased important ones that empowered the Badan Empire and allowed the advent of Kamen Rider Fifteen. Meanwhile, Ambassador Darkness, the leader of the Badan forces, reveals himself as [[Kamen Rider ZX#Ryo Murasame|Ryo Murasame]], who has infiltrated the organization to destroy it from the inside. He betrays the Generalissimo of Badan, apparently destroying the Mega Reverse Machine, but is deceived instead, when the true Mega Reverse Machine is revealed to be the entire Badan Empire base, which takes flight up in the sky. Ryo then reveals that the other Kamen Riders that have supposedly been defeated were in fact been sent to Helheim Forest, and takes the opportunity to summon them back all at once to assist him and Kamen Rider Gaim.  The Heisei and Shōwa Riders confront the Badan Empire helped by Armored Riders Baron, Ryugen, and Zangetsu Shin when the Generalissimo of Badan reveals itself as a giant monster. [[List of Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger characters#Daigo Kiryu|Daigo Kiryu]] from the [[List of Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger characters#Kyoryugers|Kyoryugers]] appears, as well, to fight the monster with Gabutyra, but it proves itself too strong for just his Zyudenryu. Soon after, the [[List of Ressha Sentai ToQger characters#ToQgers|ToQgers]] and Kamen Rider Den-O arrive to assist him, combining their trains with Gabutyra into ToQ-Oh Kyoryuzin feat. DenLiner to destroy the Generalissimo. As Kamen Rider Decade rescues Shu from the Mega Reverse Machine, [[Kamen Rider Wizard (character)|Haruto Soma]] and Jin are about to destroy it for good, when they are stopped by Takumi, who wants to atone for Masato's death by allowing him to be revived. However, they convince him that destroying the machine is the right thing to do, and together the three destroy it together as Kamen Riders Wizard, X and Faiz. Kamen Rider 1 gives Kamen Rider Gaim a special Lockseed containing the powers of the 15 Shōwa Riders, allowing him to transform into 1 Arms and finally defeat Kamen Rider Fifteen, who returns to his senses. With the Badan Empire all but defeated, the Shōwa Riders use their power to have Shu reunite and reconcile with his parents one last time before passing on to the other side. However, the Shōwa Riders are still in doubt if they can leave the protection of Earth to the Heisei Riders and challenge them to a battle, with Narutaki watching it all from afar. The battle concludes when Kamen Rider Gaim risks himself to protect a single flower from Kamen Rider 1's Rider Kick, leading the Shōwa Rider to admit defeat upon realizing his act of kindness. Now truly reconciled, the Shōwa and Heisei Riders then bid farewell to each other and follow their separate ways once more.  In an alternate ending, Kamen Rider Gaim admits defeat instead, as while he prepares a powered up attack to use against Kamen Rider 1, he stops after realizing that the Shōwa Rider could attack him before he deploys it. Kamen Rider 1 still commends him upon realizing his act of kindness, leading the Shōwa and Heisei Riders to reconcile as well.  
Hercules (2014 film)
 [[Hercules]] is the leader of a band of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] comprising the spear-wielding prophet [[Amphiaraus]] of [[Argos]], the knife-throwing thief [[Autolycus]] of [[Sparta]], the feral warrior [[Tydeus]] of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], the Amazon archer [[Atalanta]] of [[Scythia]] and his nephew storyteller [[Iolaus]] of [[Athens]].  Hercules is said to be the demigod son of [[Zeus]], who completed the legendary [[Labours of Hercules|Twelve Labors]], only to be betrayed by [[Hera]] who drove him insane and caused him to murder his wife [[Megara (mythology)|Megara]] and their children during a visit to King [[Eurystheus]]. Throughout the film, it is not clearly established that Hercules is truly the son of Zeus, and many are skeptical of the claim as well as of the stories of Hercules' famous Twelve Labors. Despite this, Hercules displays unusual strength and nigh-unmatched skill in combat. Hercules is frequently haunted by the memory of the deaths of his wife and children by his hand, as well as visions of [[Cerberus]].  After finishing a recent mission and saving his nephew on the [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonian]] Coast in Northern Greece in 358 BC, Hercules and his team are celebrating and drinking at a tavern when they are approached by Ergenia on behalf of her father [[Cotys I (Odrysian)|King Cotys]] who wants Hercules to train the armies of [[Thrace]] to defend the kingdom from bloodthirsty [[warlord]] [[Rhesus of Thrace|Rhesus]]. Hercules accepts after he and his men are offered his weight in gold, and the band is welcomed to Thrace by Cotys and General Sitacles, leader of the Thracian army.  However, Rhesus has reached the [[Bessi]] tribe in Central Thrace and Cotys insists that Hercules lead the army into battle to defend the Bessi, despite their lack of training. However, they are too late as Rhesus' sorcery has turned the Bessi against the Thracians. After the Bessi are defeated, Hercules properly trains the army.  When the training is complete then Hercules and Sitacles confront Rhesus and his soldiers on the battlefield before Mount Asticus. The Thracians force Rhesus' army to retreat, but Rhesus himself rides out to confront Hercules and is defeated by him.  Rhesus is taken back to Thrace as a prisoner, where he is tortured and humiliated. Hercules takes pity and stops the townfolk from throwing more objects at him. Then Hercules mentions Rhesus' actions of burning down villages, Rhesus tells him it was not him or his army and tells Hercules that he has been fighting on the wrong side.  Later in the hall of the palace, Rhesus has been chained up and left on display. Noticing that Ergenia has taken pity on him, Hercules confronts her and finds out Rhesus was telling the truth in that he was merely retaliating against Cotys's aggressive attempts to expand his kingdom. Although Ergenia doesn't agree with Cotys's methods, she goes along with them for the sake of her son Arius, Cotys's successor to the throne, who is being threatened by Cotys.  After receiving their reward, the mercenaries are ready to leave, but Hercules decides to stay behind to stop Cotys, and all but Autolycus choose to follow him. However, they are overpowered and captured by Sitacles and his men.  While chained, Hercules is confronted by King Eurystheus, who is in league with Cotys. Eurystheus reveals that he drugged Hercules the night his family died, viewing him as a threat to his power. Hercules's family was in fact killed by three [[Black wolf|black wolves]] sent by Eurystheus, resulting in Hercules's constant hallucinations of Cerberus. When Cotys orders Ergenia to be executed for her betrayal, Hercules is encouraged by Amphiaraus to believe in himself just as everyone believes in him. In a show of superhuman strength, Hercules breaks free of his chains, saving Ergenia and slaying the wolves with his bare hands. Hercules releases the prisoners, including Rhesus, and then confronts Eurystheus, impaling him with his own dagger. He is attacked by Sitacles, who is then stabbed by Iolaus.  Outside, Hercules and his forces battle Cotys and his army. Arius is taken hostage, but then rescued by Autolycus, who has decided to return to help his friends. In the ensuing battle, Tydeus is mortally wounded while protecting Arius, but fights on slaughtering numerous Thracian soldiers. Hercules again uses inhuman strength and pushes a massive statue of Hera from its foundations and uses it to crush Cotys and many of his soldiers. The remaining soldiers see Hercules as lightning flashes in the background. The surviving soldiers bow to Hercules and Arius takes the throne, with Ergenia at his side.  As the credits roll, an animated retelling of the Twelve Labors shows how Hercules accomplished these feats with the help of his companions.  
Hidden in the Woods (2014 film)
   
Henry & Me
 Jack (Austin Williams) is an eleven-going-on-twelve year old boy living a privileged life in upstate New York. He and his parents ([[Joseph Gian]] and [[Lucie Arnaz]]) are major fans of the [[New York Yankees]] and have attended many of their games. As he and his father are called to dinner, Jack goes through a temporary state of [[anemia]] and drops the ball. His parents are convinced that something is terribly wrong with their son.  The scene switches to Jack in the hospital, where he has contracted cancer to [[alopecia|the point where he is completely bald]]. As he is carted away for an operation, his parents stay behind, and his chaperone Nurse Cyndi ([[Cyndi Lauper]]) sings a jaunty tune of "Take Me Out to The Ball Game" to no avail of lifting the boy's spirits. She leaves Jack outside the room, but not before she treats Jack with a sedative to give him "sweet dreams". Unhappy with the hardships brought upon by his newly contracted illness, Jack contemplates the (seemingly) final moments of his life until he is greeted by a guardian angel taking the form of a Yankees executive named Henry. At first, Jack is hesitant to watch the game while he waits, but unwittingly accepts Henry's offer and the man takes him into a imaginary plane of existence where the 20th century is timeless, illness has no existence, the Yankee players of the past are alive and well and most of all, his hair is back.  Henry and Jack's first stop is early 1930, where they meet [[Babe Ruth]] ([[Chazz Palminteri]]) in a small field surrounded by corn. He convinces Jack to take the bat, and after a nervous fib about a [[peanut allergy]], strikes out three times. Babe convinces him to try again, yet this time, his fellow teammates laugh Jack off for his age. After successfully stealing home run, Jack bids goodbye and rides off in Henry's 1935 [[Cord 810]] convertible for a fun-filled drive into the skies.  Jack and Henry's next stop is mid-1960, where, to Jack's surprise, the [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|original Yankee Stadium]] is still standing next to the new one. Then in the Yankees' locker room, he meets [[Lefty Gomez]] ([[Luis Guzman]]), [[Mickey Mantle]], [[Bobby Murcer]] and [[Thurman Munson]]. Again, Jack is forced into a position on the team, this time to throw the ball from the pitcher's mound. When an actual game ensues, Munson encourages Jack to pitch the ball to Mantle, but he refuses (by saying that he is not a real pitcher). Despite Jack's inexperience, Munson and Jack continue with an upbeat exchange of words until Jack's blood pressure starts to drop, realizing that the game he is fighting for is his life in the physical world. A short montage set to a ballad version of "[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]" shows Jack in what appears to be [[Heaven]], watching several moments of his life up to the hospital with other kids, and making him concerned for his parents. When he asks Cissy, a girl he met on Henry's subway train, if she misses her mother and father, she replies "every day", implying that she too is dead and is living in the imaginary world as a spirit. Cissy and some other baseball kids bid Jack goodbye, but not before she shouts back "We're all rooting for you!" With that, Jack wins the battle, and the game.  Automatically transported to the present, Jack meets the elderly [[George Steinbrenner]], who offers him a place on the team. With the permission of the other team members, among them Yogi Berra, Reggie Jackson and "Goose" Gossage, encourage him to be a winner. Magically outfitted with a real Yankee uniform fit for his size, Jack soon finds himself playing alongside Curtis Granderson and Hideki Matsui in a large scale game against the nondescript [[Boston Red Sox]]. After the Sox pitcher tips the pitch, causing Matsui to hit the ball into the team bench, Jack quickly whispers Babe Ruth's words into Matsui and later on, he bats the ball so hard it goes straight into the hall of fame.  Nighttime falls and Jack asks Henry if he can meet [[Joe DiMaggio]], [[Roger Maris]] and [[Billy Martin]], but Henry suggests saving it for another time and decides to have Jack return home. With an impending rainstorm reflecting the borderline of his decision, Jack is unwilling to return to his unhealthy life and considers staying where he can give his body all the health and exorcise he deserves. After running off, leaving his cap behind, Jack is found by Henry in his chair and reveals that he is [[Lou Gehrig]], another player stricken by [[Lou Gehrig's disease|disease]]. Taking his advice that he should keep playing for his life, Jack finally gives in and waves goodbye to Henry, Lefty and Babe Ruth, who arrive just in time to see the boy leave into the real world.  Now back in the hospital, Jack wakes up to the joy of his parents and to his surprise is visited by the team. Although Jack is confident that his hair will grow back, Mr. Steinbrenner gives him the right of being called a New York Yankee with a pin, the same kind worn by Henry.  In a post-credits scene, Henry and Ruth pick up Mr. Steinbrenner in his Cord.

  [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and the Dwarves watch from the [[Lonely Mountain]] as the dragon [[Smaug]] sets [[Esgaroth|Laketown]] ablaze. [[Bard the Bowman|Bard]] breaks out of prison, and eventually kills Smaug with the [[Middle-earth weapons and armour#Black Arrow|black arrow]] brought to him by his son [[List of kings of Dale|Bain]]. Smaug's falling body crushes the fleeing Master of Laketown and his cronies, who were escaping on a boat laden with the town's gold. Bard reluctantly becomes the new leader of the people of Laketown as they seek refuge in the ruins of Dale, while [[Legolas]] travels to investigate [[List of minor places in Middle-earth#Mount Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] with [[Tauriel]]. Thorin, now struck with "dragon sickness" over the vast treasure in the mountain, searches obsessively for the [[Arkenstone]], which Bilbo had previously found but kept hidden. Thorin, hearing that Laketown survivors have fled to Dale, orders the entrance of the Lonely Mountain sealed off.  Meanwhile, [[Galadriel]], [[Elrond]], and [[Saruman]] arrive at [[Dol Guldur]] and free [[Gandalf]], sending him to safety with [[Radagast]]. They battle and defeat the [[Nazgûl]] and a formless [[Sauron]] himself, banishing them to the East. [[Azog]], marching on Erebor with his vast Orc army, sends his son [[Bolg]] to Gundabad to summon their second army. Legolas and Tauriel witness the march of Bolg's army, bolstered by Orc berserkers and giant bats.  [[Thranduil]] and an Elf army arrive in Dale and form an alliance with Bard in order to reclaim a treasure once withheld from them by [[Middle-earth dwarf characters#Thrór|Thrór]]. Bard goes to the mountain and asks Thorin for the share of gold that he had previously promised the people of Laketown, but Thorin refuses. Gandalf arrives at Dale to warn Bard and Thranduil of the threat posed by Azog, but Thranduil dismisses him. Bilbo sneaks out of Erebor to hand the Arkenstone over to Thranduil and Bard so that they can trade it for the treasures they were promised and prevent a battle. When Bard's and Thranduil's armies gather at the gates of Erebor, offering to trade the Arkenstone for the promised treasures, Thorin angrily refuses to believe they have the Arkenstone until Bilbo admits giving it away and chides Thorin for letting greed cloud his judgement. Outraged by what he sees as betrayal, Thorin nearly kills Bilbo, but Gandalf appears and shames Thorin into releasing Bilbo. Thorin's cousin [[Dáin II Ironfoot|Dáin]] arrives with his Dwarf army, and a battle of Dwarves against Elves and Men begins, until [[Wereworms]] emerge from the ground, releasing Azog's army from their tunnels. With the Orcs outnumbering Dáin's army, Thranduil and Bard's forces, along with Gandalf and Bilbo, join the battle. However, a second front is opened when many Orcs, Ogres, and Trolls attack Dale, forcing Bard to withdraw his forces to defend the city.  Inside Erebor, Thorin suffers traumatic hallucinations before regaining his sanity and leading his company to join the battle. He rides towards [[Ravenhill (Middle-earth)|Ravenhill]] with Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli to kill Azog; Bilbo follows them, using [[One Ring|his magic ring]] to move through the combat unseen. Meanwhile, Tauriel and Legolas arrive to warn the Dwarves of Bolg's approaching army. Fíli is captured, and Azog kills him as Bilbo and the other Dwarves are forced to watch. As Thorin engages Azog in a fight to the death, Bolg knocks Bilbo unconscious, overpowers Tauriel and then kills Kíli, who had come to her aid. Legolas battles Bolg and eventually kills him. Thorin kills Azog, but is fatally wounded in the process. The [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|Great Eagles]] arrive with Radagast and [[Beorn]] to fight the newly arriving Orc army, and the Orcs are finally defeated. Bilbo regains consciousness and makes peace with the dying Thorin. Tauriel mourns Kili, and Thranduil acknowledges their love. Legolas then tells Thranduil he must leave, and Thranduil advises him to seek out a Dunedain ranger in the north who goes by the name [[Aragorn|"Strider"]].  Bilbo bids farewell to the remaining members of Thorin's company and journeys home to [[Shire (Middle-earth)|the Shire]] with Gandalf. As the two part ways on the outskirts of the Shire, Gandalf admits his knowledge of Bilbo's ring and warns him that magic rings are not to be used lightly. Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his belongings being auctioned off because he was presumed dead. He cancels the sale, but finds his home pillaged; he starts to tidy up and to settle back in. [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|Sixty years later]], Bilbo receives a visit from Gandalf on his 111th birthday.

The Homesman
 Mary Bee Cuddy ([[Hilary Swank]]) is a 31-year-old [[spinster]] from New York, a former teacher who journeyed to the Midwest for more opportunity. She is an active member of the small farming community of Loup in the [[Nebraska Territory]], and has significant financial prospects and sizable land ownership. She seems strong and independent, but has depression and is [[Solitude|isolated]]. She makes dinner for her neighbor Bob Giffen ([[Evan Jones (actor)|Evan Jones]]), and sings to him, but when she proposes he turns her down saying she is "plain, and too bossy"; he then leaves to find a wife [[Eastern United States|back east]].  After a harsh winter, three women from the community begin to show signs of mental instability due to the hardships they have faced. Arabella Sours ([[Grace Gummer]]) has lost three children to [[diphtheria]], appears catatonic with grief, and carries one of her daughter’s rag dolls. Theoline Belknap ([[Miranda Otto]]) kills her infant after a poor harvest puts her family at risk of starvation, and also appears catatonic. Gro Svendsen ([[Sonja Richter]]), a Danish immigrant, is shown to be in an abusive relationship with her husband and has a psychotic break after her mother dies; she becomes physically aggressive and primarily only says “God will strike you down”. As each of the women falls deeper into mental illness, Reverend Dowd ([[John Lithgow]]) calls upon one of their husbands to escort the women eastward to a church in [[Hebron, Iowa]] that cares for the mentally ill. One of the men refuses to participate in the lottery to determine who will escort the women; Cuddy takes his place, and the lot falls on her.  While preparing for her journey, Cuddy encounters George Briggs ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]), a [[Land claim|claim jumper]], who is about to be [[Lynching|lynched]] for stealing Bob Giffen's land while he is away. Briggs begs Cuddy for help. Scared to make the trip alone, she frees him, and in return demands his help escorting the women. He immediately casts doubt on the job and insists he be free to abandon her at any time. To persuade him, Cuddy tells him that she is mailing $300 to await his arrival in Iowa, but secretly keeps it with her.  The journey is arduous, with bitter cold, and nights on the exposed prairie. The women have to be helped to care for themselves, including using the bathroom and bathe, and are kept tied off so that they do not become aggressive or run off.  Briggs's experience comes in handy when the group crosses paths with hostile natives, and he is able to bribe them by giving up one of their horses. Later, when Arabella is kidnapped by a freighter ([[Tim Blake Nelson]]), Briggs gives chase, and the two men have a violent scuffle before Arabella kills her kidnapper. Eventually the caravan comes across the grave of an eleven-year-old girl that has been desecrated by Indians, and Cuddy insists they stop and restore it. Briggs vows to push on, so Cuddy stays behind and agrees to catch up with him. After restoring the grave, Cuddy sets out on horseback. However, she loses her way, and after riding all night discovers that she has gone in a circle and her horse has led her back to the grave.  Finally catching up to Briggs after another night of riding, Cuddy, distraught over having to wander the desert, suggests they marry. Briggs, like all the previous men, rejects Cuddy saying he "aint no farmer", and is only along for the promised reward. Later that night, a naked Cuddy propositions him, and despite his initial protestations, the two have sex. Rising late the next morning, Briggs finds that Cuddy has hanged herself. Briggs chastises Sours, Belknapp, and Svendsen, blaming their illness for Cuddy's death as he buries her body.  He discovers that she had kept the $300 with her the entire time, and so takes a horse and abandons the three women. However, the trio surprisingly follow him on foot, and Arabella almost drowns while chasing him across a river. Briggs saves her and decides to continue taking them to Iowa instead.  Briggs seeks food and shelter at an empty hotel belonging to Aloysius Duffy ([[James Spader]]), who informs him that they have no rooms available for the caravan as a group of 16 investors are expected shortly, and the women would sour the establishment. Briggs lashes out at Duffy, whose men pull out guns of their own, resulting in a brief stand-off. Briggs leaves, but returns that night alone on horseback. He sends away the young cook, instructing her not to look back, and sets the hotel on fire, and shoots Duffy in the foot. Briggs takes a [[suckling pig]] to feed himself and the women and exits the hotel, leaving all inside to be burned alive.  Briggs reaches Hebron, passing the women into the care of Altha Carter ([[Meryl Streep]]), the wife of the church's reverend. He informs her of Cuddy's death but does not disclose the true cause. Guilty about having rejected Mary Bee's proposal, he has a wooden slab engraved with her name and plans to mark her grave with it. He gives a pair of shoes to Tabitha Hutchinson ([[Hailee Steinfeld]]), a hard-working young maid at the hotel he is staying at, and then proposes to her, after advising her not to marry some young man going west, but to stay in town.  She replies by telling him "maybe". He then boards the river ferry heading back west, and starts to sing a rowdy song with two musicians on board. When asked to stop, he chastises the people at the pier for wanting to go to the western territories, calling the west a "goddamn devil". Briggs returns to singing, and as the ferry departs, one of the bargemen kicks Mary Bee's marker into the river.

Virat decides to sacrifice his life and plans a suicide attack by instructing Mukund and his fellow officers to follow him via a tracking chip inserted in his arm and plant a bomb at the terrorists' hideout. Virat then drives to a port in various cars, as instructed by Shadab and ends up on a ship full of terrorists. To his shock, Virat finds out that the cars he was asked to drive had bombs in them, which will frame him and his team as terrorists and also boost their plans to recruit sleeper cells in Indian Army with the help of Joint Defense Secretary of India — Mr. Alvin D'souza ([[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]]), who is also a member of this terrorist group. Meanwhile, Joel ([[Randheer Rai]]) who was in touch with Mukund as instructed by Virat, plants a bomb at the base of the ship. Virat has a one-on-one fight with Shadab and escapes with him on a boat before the ship explodes, also later killing Shadab.

Horrible Bosses 2
 In November 2014, Nick Hendricks, Dale Arbus, and Kurt Buckman decide to start their own business after tiring of working for ungrateful bosses. Their idea is a car-wash-inspired shower head called the "Shower Buddy". They have trouble finding investors until they are approached by Bert Hanson and his son Rex. Bert admires their commitment to manufacturing the product themselves, while Rex prefers to outsource to China, and agrees to invest if they can make 100,000 units. Taking out a business loan, the three rent a warehouse, hire employees, and manage to produce their output. However, Bert backs out of their deal at the last minute, claiming that he never signed an agreement, and he plans to take their inventory in foreclosure and sell them (renamed the "Shower Pal") himself, while leaving the three in $500,000 debt with their outstanding loan.  Seeking financial advice, Nick, Dale, and Kurt visit Nick's old boss, Dave Harken, in prison (after the murder of Kurt's boss [[Horrible Bosses|Bobby Pellit]]), who says the three have no feasible legal options to recover their losses. The three then resolve to kidnap Rex and hold him for ransom. They seek the help of "Motherfuckah" Jones, who says the best way to kidnap someone who knows them is to keep the victim unconscious for the duration of the kidnapping. The three create a ransom note asking for $500,000 and go to the office of Dale's old boss, Dr. Julia Harris, to steal a tank of [[nitrous oxide]]. While there, Kurt and Dale are almost caught by Julia's sex addiction group meeting; after the group leaves, Nick has sex with Julia, providing the distraction that allows Dale and Kurt to escape the building. The trio goes to Rex's house, but while they hide in the closet, Dale accidentally turns on the tank and they pass out. When they wake up in the morning, they find Rex gone.  When they arrive back at the warehouse, they find Rex tied up in the trunk of their car. Rex gets out and reveals he found them hiding in his closet, but decided to stage his own kidnapping with them due to his strained relationship with his dad and numerous personal debts. Rex sent the ransom note to his dad and increased the ransom to $5 million. The three are uncertain of Rex's plan, but Rex threatens to go to the police if they back out. They call Bert to inform him of Rex's kidnapping, threatening to kill Rex if Bert calls the cops. However, the police, led by Detective Hatcher, subsequently arrive at their warehouse to question Nick, Dale, and Kurt due to their involvement with Bert. When the police leave, Rex breaks down, knowing Bert cares more about his money than his son. Now sympathetic to Rex, the trio agrees to work with him in the fake kidnapping, and all four devise a plan to outsmart the police and take the ransom money, utilizing untraceable phones, a basement garage to block out any tracking signal, and Kurt disguising himself as Bert.  While the plan is in motion, Nick, Dale, and Kurt find that Kurt left Bert his own phone instead of the untraceable one. They nevertheless call Bert on Kurt's phone to give him the instructions. Before they leave, Julia arrives at their hotel room and demands to sleep with Dale or else she will report them for breaking into her office. Dale's wife Stacy, whom Dale has three daughters with, arrives and believing Dale is cheating on her with Julia, storms off. Dale angrily locks Julia in the bathroom so the three can leave. In the basement garage, Nick, Dale, and Kurt wearing homemade masks tell Bert to give them the $5 million, and the cell phone. However, Bert is suddenly killed by Rex, who reveals that, after seeing that his father did not care about him, he decided to kill Bert and frame Nick, Dale, and Kurt in order to inherit the family business. Rex forces Kurt to switch pants as Rex's pants have Bert's blood on them.  As the trio are about to be cornered by the police, Jones arrives, as he anticipated that the three would be betrayed and killed and was seeking to claim the ransom money for himself. He attempts to help them get back to the warehouse where Rex is supposed to be tied up, with the police chasing them before Rex does so they can prove their innocence. When they get back to the warehouse, Jones escapes with the money and the police arrive to find Rex tied up. Before the police arrest Nick, Dale, and Kurt, Kurt's phone rings in Rex's pocket, and the police recognize the ringtone as the same phone that was left to Bert by the kidnappers. Rex tries to claim the phone is his, but when Hatcher asks why Rex did not bother to call the police if he had a phone, Rex takes Hatcher hostage. Dale attempts to attack Rex, but Rex shoots him, which distracts Rex long enough for Hatcher to subdue and arrest him.  A few days later, Dale wakes up in the hospital to find out the three did get in trouble, but because Dale helped save Hatcher's life, the police dropped the charges. He also finds out Julia helped make amends with Stacy, although she hints at having had sex with him during his coma and promises to have sex with his wife as well. In the aftermath, their business goes into foreclosure but is subsequently purchased by Harken in prison, who allows the three of them to stay employed. Jones, meanwhile, uses the ransom money to invest in [[Pinkberry]].

Due to her history of recidivism, she is sentenced by the judge to [[house arrest]] for eight months under the care of her mother, Miriam. Kylie does not get along with either her mother or her step-father, Graeme, both of whom she considers to be nothing but boring annoyances. A security contractor, Amos, explains that Kylie's [[ankle monitor]] will alert the police if she ever leaves the premises of her mother's house.  Kylie is further frustrated when Miriam calls a radio talk show and says that her [[Haunted house|house is haunted]]. After a disembodied hand grabs her ankle in the basement, Kylie becomes convinced that an intruder is in the house. Amos, responding to an alert from her ankle monitor after it reports tampering, takes Miriam's suggestion of a haunting seriously, much to Kylie's annoyance. Amos promises to return with [[ghost hunting]] equipment and perform a thorough examination of the house for free. When Kylie expresses continued skepticism, Amos chides her for having a closed mind.  After a series of unexplained experiences, including repeatedly encountering the same animatronic teddy bear, Kylie comes to believe that there may be a [[ghost]] in the house. Dennis, a clinical psychologist assigned to Kylie, becomes concerned with what he believes to be possible delusions in both Miriam and Kylie.  After reviewing footage from security cameras, Amos does not believe her reports and accuses her of lying.  However, once Graeme reveals to Kylie that their home was once a [[halfway house]] and the site of a horrific murder, Amos once again becomes interested.  As they investigate further, they discover evidence of the crime, including an [[Retainer (orthodontics)|orthodontic retainer]].

After she flees back to the family's home and hides in the basement, Kylie panics when she believes the neighbour to be stalking her, and she accidentally stabs Graeme, who has also entered the basement.  As Graeme recuperates in the hospital, Amos in turn attempts to break into her neighbour's house.  The neighbour says that he is not the killer, and he tells the story of a young savant, Eugene, whom he adopted.  Eugene is an expert at mechanics and electronics, and he disappeared a year previous to the killing, though the neighbour believes him to be possibly responsible.  At the same time, Kylie accidentally discovers Eugene's secret hallways in their house, and she flees.  Kylie and Amos separately converge at the police station, and Amos corroborates her wild stories of a serial killer who lives in hidden passageways.  However, the police find no evidence, and Dennis convinces all involved that it would be best if Kylie were institutionalized.  Once Dennis reveals that he wears a retainer, Kylie becomes suspicious of him.  When she confronts him with evidence that he was an intern at the halfway house, he turns hostile and attempts to kill Miriam and Kylie.  He kills a policeman. When Amos arrives at the house, Dennis incapacitates him.  Kylie and Miriam flee into the secret tunnels, where they encounter Eugene.  Realizing that their paranormal activity has been Eugene all this time, they are at first frightened but realize that he is friendly.  Dennis stabs Eugene, and, after an extended hunt that results in Dennis' presumed death, he knocks out Kylie and begins to strangle Miriam.  Eugene wakes Kylie and hands her a weapon, which she uses to stab Dennis.  As Dennis sees that the weapon is connected to a long cable, Eugene throws a switch, and high voltage explodes Dennis' head.  Months later, all have recovered, Amos finally removes Kylie's ankle monitor, and Eugene has seemingly become an accepted (albeit mostly unseen) member of the household.

The film starts with the story of a notable family who lives in the house right after the fall of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). When the family's third son, Huo Lianqi ([[Tony Yang]]) falls in love with a prostitute named Lu Dieyu (also [[Ruby Lin|Lin]]), his request to marry her is refused and instead the family force Lu to marry their second recently deceased son in a posthumous wedding ceremony. Going from the wedding directly to the funeral, the family throws Lu Dieyu into a coffin with the pale-faced dead body of her new husband.  After being locked in the coffin with her newly-wed and deceased husband, Huo Lianqi rushes back to the house upon hearing of the news that she was married to his second brother. He released her from the coffin and they got married on the spot in front of the coffin and consummated their marriage in the same room unbeknownst to the family. The day after, Lu Dieyu woke up only to find Huo Lianqi gone.  The scene flashes back to the present, Xu Ruoqing started having visions around the mansion, and this condition grew worse with each passing day in the mansion. Her daughter has came to her several nights claiming that a young girl dressed in red kept wanting to play with her. Horrified, Xu Ruoqing started asking for Zhao Yitang to come back to accompany her and their daughter for the nights, only to have him rejecting her requests as his company are currently facing funding issues and usually spent the nights with his assistant, Liu Li ([[Monica Mok]]) to source out potential investors. Incidentally, Liu Li is also Xu Ruoqing's best friend who was the one who brought the two of them together. Liu Li has pointed out in a conversation that Zhao Yitang was actually still in a marriage with his wife and the divorce papers have not been signed by his wife ([[Pat Ha|Patricia Ha]]), contrary to what Xu Ruoqing thought.  Getting increasingly disturbed by the visions around the mansion, with Zhao Yitang's absence around the house at night, Xu Ruoqing started getting suspicious that Zhao Yitang might actually be having an affair with Liu Li.  The scene cuts back to the past, where Lu Dieyu was shown to be pregnant with Huo Lianqi's child on the night of their consummation. Despite being married to the deceased second son of the family, the family thought that it is strange that she is pregnant as the physician deduced that the child was supposedly conceived on the night of marriage. The eldest son, Huo Lianxiu (also [[Francis Ng|Francis]]) however, allowed for her to kept her child. Lu Dieyu was then moved to the basement of the mansion to await her pregnancy. Lu Dieyu was seen to be continuously writing letters back-and-forth to Huo Lianqi, even after her daughter was born, she continued writing and receiving letters from Huo Lianqi but he was not seen to have returned to the mansion, writing in one of his letters that he's studying abroad and will return once he's graduated.  Back at the present, Xu Ruoqing confronted Liu Li on whether she is having an affair with Zhao Yitang, to which she rejected and explained that Zhao Yitang's company is having a lot of financial issues and she is only maintaining a strict workers relationship with Zhao Yitang. Feeling a mix of emotions of guilt, fear and insecurity, Xu Ruoqing turned to her old friend, who is also a psychologist ([[Qin Hailu]]) for consultation on her current situation.  Her visions in the house did not go away, her daughter came to her one night to ask her for help in catching a red butterfly, where she was led to the basement of the mansion where Lu Dieyu stayed during her pregnancy. In there, she found a box of letters and photos, and realised that she looked identical to the Lu Dieyu in the photos.  Having found a surviving servant from the Huo's family in the mansion, Gen, told Xu Ruoqing about the tragedy of the Huo family that unfolds. Huo Lianxiu's wife (also [[Pat Ha|Patricia Ha]]) suspected that Huo Lianxiu is gradually being attracted to Lu Dieyu, and under the persuasion of her brother and cousin, agreed to letting them put in Marijuana into Lu Dieyu's herbal medicine and letting her consume it, making Lu Dieyu seems 'crazier' which will hopefully make her husband less interested in her. On the other hand, Huo Lianxiu went to the basement to find Lu Dieyu with Huo Lianqi's death certificate, telling her that Huo Lianqi has passed away long ago, and the person who has been writing letters to her was him all along. Huo Lianxiu has fallen in love with her since and wanted to bring her with him to leave the family, Lu Dieyu rejected and pushed him out, unable to believe that Huo Lianqi has been dead all along. Unable to cope with Huo Lianqi's death, Lu Dieyu killed herself in the basement while wearing her red wedding dress. Huo Lianxiu learnt of her suicide and wanted to join her in death, stopping when he saw her daughter by Lu Dieyu's body. On the 7th day of Lu Dieyu's funeral, everybody in the mansion died, including Huo Lianxiu's wife, her brother and cousin. Huo Lianxiu decided to grow her daughter as his own and left the mansion.  In the present, Zhao Yitang has been called by his wife where he was given the option of having a cheque with a huge funds to save his career, only if he agrees to tear up the divorce papers. Zhao Yitang refused, and finally his wife revealed that it's too late for him to do anything now. She has been bribing Gen, agreeing to let him inherit the mansion, on the condition that he changes Xu Ruoqing's medicines with another chemical substance that will cause Xu Ruoqing to hallucinate and these hallucinations might eventually kill her. Meanwhile, Xu Ruoqing are escaping from all the servants who have died in the mansion, and flee with her daughter to the basement of the mansion, managing to find some peace over there. The little girl in red whom her daughter claimed to have encountered previously appeared, revealing that she's actually the daughter of Zhao Yitang and his wife and had been instructed by the wife to dress in red all the time in the mansion and her daddy will come back to her.  Zhao Yitang rushed back to the mansion, finally reuniting with Xu Ruoqing and both his daughters in the basement. Upon returning to the main area of the mansion, Gen pushed out a wheelchair and explained that Huo Lianqi has returned after the tragedy only to find the house empty. Huo Lianqi had been waiting at the house for the return of Xu Ruoqing, and Gen wanted the mansion for him and Huo Lianqi as he believes Huo Lianqi is the rightful owner of the mansion. Gen turned the wheelchair around, only to reveal the decomposed body of Huo Lianqi, and chased Zhao Yitang's family out of the mansion. The movie ended as the decomposed body slowly turned into dust as Xu Ruoqing left the mansion.

How to Train Your Dragon 2
  Five years after the [[Vikings|Viking]] village of Berk and the dragons made peace, they now live together in harmony. Hiccup goes on adventures with his dragon, Toothless, as they discover and map unexplored lands. Now 20 years old, he is being pressed by his father, Stoick the Vast, to succeed him as chieftain, although Hiccup remains unsure if he is ready for this responsibility.  While investigating a burnt forest, Hiccup and Astrid discover the remains of a fort encased in ice and meet a group of dragon trappers led by Eret, who blames them for his fort's destruction and attempts to capture their dragons for an insane conqueror named Drago Bludvist. The two dragon riders escape and return to Berk to warn Stoick about the dragon army that Drago is amassing. Stoick orders the villagers to fortify the island and prepare for battle. Hiccup, however, refuses to believe that war is inevitable. After Stoick interrupts Hiccup's plan to get Eret to take him to Drago, Stoick explains that he once met Drago at a gathering of chiefs, where Drago, mocked after offering the chiefs his service in return for their servitude, murdered them all using armored dragons, with Stoick as the only survivor. Undeterred, Hiccup flies off with Toothless in search of Drago to try to reason with him.  They run into a dragon rider named Valka, who is revealed to be Hiccup's long-lost mother. She explains that she, like her son, could not bring herself to kill dragons. After being carried off during a dragon raid, she spent 20 years rescuing dragons from Drago's traps and bringing them to an island nest created out of ice by a gigantic [[Alpha (ethology)|Alpha]] dragon called a "Bewilderbeast", which is able to control smaller dragons. Stoick tracks Hiccup to the nest, where he discovers that his wife is still alive. Meanwhile, Astrid and the other riders kidnap Eret to find Drago, but Drago captures them and learns of Berk's dragons.  Drago and his armada lay siege to the nest, where he reveals that he has his own Bewilderbeast to challenge the Alpha. A battle ensues between the two colossal dragons, which ends with Drago's Bewilderbeast killing its opponent and becoming the new Alpha. Drago's Bewilderbeast then seizes control of all the adult dragons, which hypnotically obey. Hiccup tries to persuade Drago to end the violence, but Drago orders him killed. Toothless, under the Bewilderbeast's influence, approaches Hiccup and launches a blast, but Stoick pushes Hiccup out of the way and is hit instead, dying as a result. The Bewilderbeast momentarily relinquishes control of Toothless, but Hiccup drives him away in a fit of despair. Drago maroons Hiccup and the others on the island and rides Toothless, again under the control of the Bewilderbeast, to lead his army to conquer Berk. Stoick is given a [[Norse funeral|Viking funeral]] and Hiccup, now having lost both his father and dragon, is unsure what to do. Valka encourages him by telling him that he alone can unite humans and dragons, and inspired by her words and his father's, Hiccup decides to return to Berk to stop Drago.  The dragon riders fly baby dragons back to Berk, as they are immune to the Bewilderbeast's control. They find that Drago has already attacked the village and taken control of its dragons. Hiccup confronts Drago and a brainwashed Toothless while the other riders work to distract the Bewilderbeast. Hiccup succeeds in freeing Toothless from the Bewilderbeast's control, much to Drago's surprise. Hiccup and Toothless briefly separate Drago from the Bewilderbeast and confront Drago on the ground, but the Bewilderbeast attacks them, encasing them in ice. However, Toothless blasts away the ice, revealing that both Hiccup and he are unharmed. He then challenges the Bewilderbeast, shooting it in the face repeatedly, which breaks its control over the other dragons, who side with Toothless as the new Alpha dragon. All the dragons repeatedly fire at the Bewilderbeast until Toothless fires a final massive blast, breaking its left tusk. Defeated, the Bewilderbeast retreats under the sea with Drago on its back. The Vikings and dragons celebrate their victory and Hiccup is made chieftain of Berk.  Afterwards, Berk undergoes repairs while feeling secure knowing that its dragons can defend it.

The Houses October Built
 The film begins ''[[in medias res]]'' to a dazed and bloodied Brandy (Schaefer) being put in a truck and driven off. Days earlier, a group of friends from [[Ohio]] -- Brandy, her boyfriend Zack (Andrews), cameraman Jeff (Larson), Bobby (Roe), and Mikey (Roe) -- decide to take a trip south to visit some of America's scariest and extreme [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|haunted house attractions]] in the days leading up to [[Halloween]]. They plan to record their experiences in the haunted houses as well as interview actors who work there. This leads to disturbing revelations about the establishments' operations, such as failure to perform background checks, utilizing criminals and disturbed individuals as actors, using real corpses and body parts as props, and performing increasingly dangerous stunts for the sake of scares.  The group begins with well-known haunted houses at first, though their main goal is to locate an extreme haunt called "Blue Skeleton," a mysterious group that moves to a different, secret location every year and is said to employ real [[torture]] to elicit scares. Zack in particular is determined to find Blue Skeleton, growing increasingly agitated with what he views as pedestrian scares of well-known haunts. The group also antagonizes haunted house staff by filming and being disruptive, but the staff's animosity grows sinister when they are followed to a different site by a clown from an earlier house, as well as a young actress from the same house appearing outside their [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] despite the group having traveled over a hundred miles.  Bobby, Zack, and Brandy are later confronted by a staff member from another house accusing them of filming inside a prohibited establishment, although they had turned their cameras off; Jeff, going to the woods to urinate, is chased by a man dressed in a bunny costume brandishing an axe, though the man turns out to be an actor. Zack also meets other guests who inform him that they experienced Blue Skeleton, and that it is in [[Louisiana]] this year; they also tell him of a bar where they can find a man who can take them there. Later that night, an actor breaks into their van and films the group while they sleep, stroking Brandy's face. Bobby finds the video uploaded to haunted house forums, but Zack tells him to keep it a secret, as he does not want the rest of the group getting cold feet. A cow heart is also left inside their refrigerator. Brandy and Bobby grow reluctant to continue, but Zack insists they keep going.  At the bar, the group finds themselves surrounded by actors, and they are confronted about filming again. While Brandy is in the bathroom, the rest of the group goes outside to meet with the connection to Blue Skeleton. Meanwhile, two male actors take the abandoned camera and film themselves cornering Brandy in the bathroom, seriously unnerving her; but she manages to escape the bathroom. She tells the rest of the group what happened. They confront the two and reclaim the camera. Zack reassures her and the rest of the group that Blue Skeleton was what they had been waiting for. While preparing for bed, the group finds the RV surrounded by dozens of actors; one of them, walking on top of the RV, cuts the lights. After getting the lights back on, they find the actors gone. The next morning, they find a [[pumpkin]] outside of the RV with skeleton masks and instructions on how to meet with their next connection to Blue Skeleton.  The group arrives at the rendezvous point at a Halloween festival and look for another actor wearing the same mask. Though they spot one, they are ignored. In the commotion, Jeff is lured to an alley by an actor dressed as Mikey. He finds himself cornered by the clown, the young actress, and the actor in the bunny suit. Jeff is stabbed and has his tongue cut out while his phone is taken away. The rest of the group tries to call him, but only get a message telling them of another meetup location. Despite Brandy and Bobby's pleas, Zack drives there. They are approached by a bus and receive a text telling them to leave the RV or else Jeff will be killed. Zack complies, while the rest of the group is dragged out by attackers lurking in the RV. They are hooded and bound before being driven off in the bus. While the rest of the group panics, Zack insists it is still part of the Blue Skeleton experience.  The men are dragged out at one location, while Brandy is driven to a second location. She is given a camera and told to film everything she sees. The group members wander through their respective rooms. Zack, in a darkened room armed with nothing but a [[glowstick]], is bludgeoned by an actor. The rest of the group are terrorized before being driven to a remote area and buried alive in coffins by the Blue Skeleton members.  
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1
   After being rescued from the destroyed arena in the 75th Hunger Games, [[Katniss Everdeen]] and fellow tributes [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Beetee|Beetee]] and [[Finnick Odair]] are taken to District 13, now an underground district isolated from Panem that has been spearheading the rebellion. There Katniss is reunited with [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Mrs. Everdeen|her mother]] and sister [[Primrose Everdeen|Prim]]. While recuperating, she is introduced to [[List of The Hunger Games characters#President Coin|President Alma Coin]], the rebel leader, and is told that immediately after the force field was destroyed by her arrow, riots erupted in over half the districts in Panem, which joined 13 in the rebel cause, though it also caused Snow to firebomb District 12 in retaliation. Coin asks her to become the "Mockingjay"—the symbol of the rebellion—as part of their "[[Winning hearts and minds|hearts and minds]]" strategy but Katniss declines. After seeing how Peeta is being manipulated by Capitol state television to quell the rebellion, Katniss reluctantly agrees to become Coin's Mockingjay on the condition that Peeta and the other captured victors will be rescued and pardoned at the earliest opportunity. When Coin refuses, Katniss angrily demands their amnesty. [[Plutarch Heavensbee]], the head Gamemaker who rescued Katniss from the arena, convinces Coin to meet Katniss's demands.  After [[Haymitch Abernathy|Haymitch]] notes that Katniss thrives on spontaneity, she meets her film team (led by Capitol escapee [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Cressida|Cressida]]), is dressed up in a specially-designed Mockingjay suit, and is given [[Effie Trinket]] as a stylist and close friend [[Gale Hawthorne|Gale]] as a bodyguard. They go to District 8 to visit a hospital, but as the visit concludes, a Capitol bombing squadron arrives to attack the hospital. In reaction, Katniss and Gale shoot down two Capitol hovercrafts, which is captured on camera. In her rage, Katniss gives a rousing speech against the Capitol, which is broadcast when Beetee hijacks the Capitol's news feed. After it is broadcast, strikers in District 7 kill an entire team of Peacekeepers with hidden land mines; themselves climbing trees to safety.  After seeing a weakened Peeta in a propaganda clip, the team return to District 12, where Gale recounts District 12's destruction; Katniss is filmed singing "[[The Hanging Tree (The Hunger Games song)|The Hanging Tree]]". Soon after, hundreds of protesters in District 5, singing the same anthem, launch a suicidal [[human wave attack]] against a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dam]] that is the Capitol's primary source of electricity. The attack destroys the dam, and causes an outage in the Capitol, forcing them to revert to secondary generators and weakening their abilities to broadcast propaganda.  That night, Katniss watches Peeta being interviewed by Caesar Flickerman, the Games' former presenter, when Coin and Beetee hijack the signal to air a clip of Katniss. After seeing it, Peeta shouts a warning that the Capitol is about to attack District 13. Capitol officials immediately cut the broadcast, and Coin orders a mass evacuation into deep underground shelters and the facility survives the attack unharmed. Upon emerging, Katniss discovers the area littered with white roses; she concludes that President Snow orchestrated this to inform her that the Capital is holding Peeta captive, whom they've been torturing whenever she speaks against the Capitol. As Peeta's warning gave the District an additional eight minutes evacuation time, Coin dispatches an elite special forces team, which includes Gale and Boggs, to rescue him, along with [[Johanna Mason]], [[Enobaria]] and [[Annie Cresta]], the remaining Victors, from their prison in the Capitol's Tribute Center.  Beetee hijacks the Capitol's defense system to fill the frequencies with a propo narrated by Finnick, who explains how he had been prostituted by Snow under the threat of having his loved ones tortured and executed. During a live video call, Snow informs Katniss of his awareness of the rescue before cutting the broadcast. The Capitol hijacks their transmission, preventing Beetee from communicating with the special forces. Gale's team ends up escaping from the Capitol unharmed, indicating the Capitol reduced the security on purpose. When Katniss goes to greet a bruised and beaten Peeta (which was caused by the Capitol torturing him immediately after the last interview with Caesar), he unexpectedly attacks and strangles her into unconsciousness, before being knocked out by Boggs.  Katniss wakes up in a medical facility. She is informed that Peeta has been "hijacked" - brainwashed into killing Katniss by associating memories of her with the terror created by [[tracker jacker]] venom, which explains why the Capitol allowed the team to escape unharmed. Peeta is restrained to a bed and placed in [[solitary confinement]], while a serum is being developed to reverse the hijacking effects. Meanwhile, Coin announces that the Victors have been rescued; their next objective is the Capitol's principal military stronghold in the ravines of District 2 - the only district still loyal to the Capitol.

 The Kadam family ran a restaurant in [[Mumbai]]. The second-oldest son, Hassan ([[Manish Dayal]]), was being groomed to replace his mother ([[Juhi Chawla]]) as the restaurant's main cook. However, a mob attacks and firebombs the restaurant over an election dispute. Papa Kadam ([[Om Puri]]) and his family evacuate the guests, but Mama is killed. Seeking [[political asylum|asylum]] in Europe, the family first settles in London, where their residence proves ill-suited for a restaurant. They depart for [[Continental Europe|mainland Europe]].  Shortly after entering France, the brakes on Papa's van fail near [[Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val]] in the [[Midi-Pyrénées]]. Marguerite ([[Charlotte Le Bon]]), a [[sous chef]] at an upscale French restaurant named "Le Saule Pleureur" ("The Weeping Willow"), passes by and offers to help the Kadams find an auto repair shop and a guest house. She brings the Kadams to her apartment and treats them to cold food. Papa is amazed at the quality of the food in the village and its availability and discovers that Marguerite made the food herself.  Papa learns of an abandoned restaurant building available for purchase.  It is located directly across the street — only a hundred feet (30&nbsp;m) — from Le Saule Pleureur.  Madame Mallory ([[Helen Mirren]]), proprietor of Le Saule Pleureur and purporting to act as caretaker for the owners of the abandoned restaurant, asks the Kadams to leave because it is "private property". Papa buys the property, even though the rest of his family is against it, and names the restaurant "Maison Mumbai".  Mallory asks for their menu and by the time of their opening night has bought all the locally available ingredients they would need to serve. A cold war erupts between Papa and Mallory. The war peaks on [[Bastille Day]] when one of Mallory's chefs, Jean-Pierre, and two others vandalize the Kadams' restaurant by spray-painting words which translate to "France for the French" on the outer wall and firebombing the interior. Hassan catches the arsonists in the act and scares them off, but his hands and legs are burned.  The following morning Mallory, who knew nothing of the arson and vandalism, dismisses Jean-Pierre and personally cleans the graffiti from Maison Mumbai.   Hassan, having heard from Marguerite that Mallory hires potential chefs by taste-testing an omelette and deciding whether the person is indeed a great chef, asks if he may cook an omelette for her to his recipe. Due to his injured hands, Mallory helps under Hassan's supervision. After tasting the omelette, which had Indian influences to it, Mallory recognizes Hassan's potential and invites him to work for her as an apprentice, and confessed that she deliberately sabotaged his apology on behalf of his father, when he recreated a classic pigeon dish. Papa is initially against the move, but ultimately strikes a deal with her as to Hassan's pay.  Hassan's cooking, which gradually evolves into a fusion of [[Indian cuisine]] and [[French cuisine]], results in Mallory's restaurant receiving its second [[Michelin Guide#Stars|Michelin star]]. The award draws national attention to Hassan's cooking, and he is offered and accepts a job in Paris. Papa and Mallory make amends and begin seeing each other, but Hassan's relationship with Marguerite has soured.  Hassan's cooking in Paris quickly receives critical acclaim, fueling speculation of a third Michelin Star for the Paris restaurant, but his work is increasingly bogged down by thoughts of his family and Marguerite (with whom he had an ongoing romance). Hassan returns home a year later and reunites with Marguerite. He invites Marguerite to join him in a business venture—buying a stake in Mallory's restaurant, along with operational control. Hassan believes this will help the restaurant earn its third star. That evening, Hassan and Marguerite prepare dinner at Mallory's restaurant and bring the dishes across the road to the courtyard of Maison Mumbai for all to enjoy.

Humpty Sharma Ki Dulhania
 Kavya Singh ([[Alia Bhatt]]), who is set to be engaged to an [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]] American doctor, Angad ([[Siddharth Shukla]]), decides to go to Delhi to buy an expensive designer bridal dress for her wedding, after her father, Kamaljeet ([[Ashutosh Rana]]) refuses to get her the pricey dress. She meets Rakesh "Humpty" Sharma ([[Varun Dhawan]]) in Delhi, who falls in love with her. Humpty, with the help of his friends, Shonty ([[Gaurav Pandey]]) and Poplu ([[Sahil Vaid]]), chases and harasses Kavya, but she’s not interested. She, however, befriends him. Kavya confides in Humpty, that her friend in Delhi, Gurpreet Sodhi ('''Guncha Narula'''), was blackmailed by her ex-boyfriend, who had secretly filmed a sex sequence of the two.   Humpty stumbles upon an idea for victimizing Gurpreet’s ex that would also avenge Gurpreet, and also gather the money for the wedding dress for Kavya. They manage to get some money but Kavya isn’t happy about the way that money is obtained. However, these ensuing adventures make Kavya fall for Humpty, and the night before she’s supposed to leave Delhi for her home in Ambala, Humpty and Kavya have sex. When Humpty asks her if she loves him, she says she won’t go against Kamaljeet's wishes. In order to help Humpty get the money for Kavya’s dress, his father and friends chip in. Kavya reluctantly accepts the money and leaves Delhi.  Kavya is a changed person when she arrives home. She tells her family that she has decided not to buy that expensive dress. In the meantime, she gifts a car to Humpty using that money, as she had known about Humpty's father’s dream for a car. Overwhelmed, Humpty and his friends go to Ambala, where he tries to win over Kavya. Kamaljeet believes firmly in arranged marriages against love marriages, as his elder daughter, Swati, married against his wishes and the marriage turned out to be a disaster ending in divorce. Kamaljeet instantly disapproves of Humpty, and gets him & his friends beaten up. Upon repeated persuasion, he gives Humpty a chance to find at least one reason why his daughter shouldn’t marry Angad. He sets him a five-day deadline to give him the reason. Humpty and his friends try their best to find flaws in Angad but fail to do so.  At the end of the deadline and on her wedding day, Kavya runs away from home and calls Humpty to join her on a train to leave the town. Kamaljeet and the rest of the family reach the train station, where Kamaljeet is extremely angry and hits Humpty. Humpty gives an emotional explanation saying that he may not be as rich, successful or good-looking as Angad, but he loves Kavya from the core of his heart. He leaves Ambala and heads back to Delhi after that incident. When Kavya is dressed up as a bride, Kamaljeet asks her if she still fancies that expensive wedding dress. She replies she’s not fit for expensive classy dress, but is suitable for local dresses. He gets the idea that her relationship would be fuller with Humpty, the local boy and not Angad, the American doctor. He brings everyone to Delhi where he approaches Humpty and gives his consent to marry his daughter.  
The Hungover Games
 Four friends are heading out for a bachelor party for their friend Doug, who is marrying a man named Tracey. They decide to have a quiet, subdued night at a small hotel in Laughlin, Nevada. They put their friend Zach in a [[straitjacket]] and cone to ensure he does not drug them and drink non-alcoholic beer.  When they wake up the next morning they find they are in a strange room littered with party and sex toys and realize that Doug is, again, missing. A woman named "Effing" walks in and Zach recognizes her as a remake of [[Effie Trinket]]. When Ed attempts to leave and opens the door only to realize they are on a train, Zach realizes they are in the Hunger Games, or as Effing calls it the "Hungover Games", a fight to the death in an arena between various Hollywood districts. The three watch a video on Zach's phone and realized that Doug and the trio volunteered as tribute the previous night in their drunken state. The three realize they will have to fight in the games to find Doug and get him back to his wedding in time.  At the training center the three become acquainted with other tributes and the heavily favored "career" tributes, including homosexual [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], [[Tonto]], Gratuitous Nudity (two topless women), Carrie (nicknamed Scary), and [[Ted (film)|Ted]]. Ed meets Katnip Everlean, a girl he met the previous night while drunk and who likes him. Soon training ends and they are sent to rooms where they will ascend into the arena. While searching the rooms they see a man ascending into the arena but cannot see his face and are forced to leave after Zach spills bubble tea on the room's electronic controls.  The games begin, and the tributes begin murdering each other. Zach becomes separated from Ed and Bradley. The two flee and spend the night in a tree to sleep but witness the careers murder two other tributes. They see Zach with the Careers and realize that Zach has allied with them to help them find and kill Ed and Bradley. In the morning Bradley is urged by another tribute, Little Boo, to drop a hive of "Swaggerjacks" (wasps) onto the careers sleeping below them. In the process Bradley and Ed are stung several times and the hallucinogenic venom causes them to pass out. They awaken and find Zach has nursed them back to health and they go search for Doug again.  Zach reveals that the reason they are in the Hungover Games is because the previous night he plugged in air-fresheners that were "midnight berry" scented and that the scent of the poisonous berries drugged them. He also reveals that the air-fresheners "may cause transportation to futuristic dystopia." Enraged, Ed and Bradley leave Zach and he is later seduced by a female Avatar. He is ambushed by the careers but is saved by Katnip and Boo, who kill Gratuitous Nudity, though the female Avatar is also murdered.  Meanwhile, Ed and Bradley decide to reunite with Zach after a rule change that states that four men who share a "bromance" can all win together. Ed and Bradley find Zach, Katnip and Boo and remember that Boo may know where Doug is. Before she can say, she is killed by Thor, who is murdered by Ed in retaliation. After a short funeral for Boo, Katnip decides to leave on her own to kill Tonto.  The three decide to head back to the Pornucopia after an announcement that something everyone is looking for is located there. Assuming it is Doug the three rush to the Pornucopia, but are attacked by Carrie. Zach murders Carrie in a rage, Ted and the other two puppets attack the three but Zach is able to blow up two of them using his Hunger Games's book and Katnip returns and saves Ed from Ted. She reveals she was mortally wounded in her fight with Tonto and dies with Ed beside her.  The three realize that their prize at the Pornucopia is a cell phone, not Doug, and they realize they will never find him and call Tracey to inform him of the situation. But after a short conversation with Zach, Ed realizes where Doug is and stops Bradley from making the call. Ed explains that Doug's tube never came up because Zach's bubble tea shortcircuited the tube that sends up tributes. After looking in his tube they realize Doug isn't there, but Doug emerges from the forest camouflaged and attacks them, berating them about how they always forget him and how he is almost never in the movies. The three tell him they will never forget him again and that he will have more lines in the next film, and he decides to spare them.  Another rule change states that there can only be one victor and the four turn on each other. Zach proposes they all eat poisonous berries, as the creators of the games would never let them all die as they would rather have four victors than none, and so would interrupt the four before they can eat the poison. Zach's plan fails after they eat the berries and die with no one interrupting them. They wake up in their hotel room, realizing it was all a dream they shared. The four go to the wedding where Ed laments about Katnip but runs into an identical looking girl who seems to be attracted to him.

Hungry Hearts (2014 film)
 When Mina ([[Alba Rohrwacher]]) and Jude ([[Adam Driver]]) first meet, it's under the worst of circumstances; Mina finds herself accidentally trapped in a bathroom with Jude, who is suffering from [[food poisoning]] induced diarrhea. Despite this awkward first encounter, the two form a seemingly strong relationship. However, when Mina announces that she's going to return to Italy, Jude initiates a sexual encounter that ends with him ejaculating inside of her, despite Mina specifically requesting otherwise. Mina becomes pregnant as a result of the encounter, which further ties her to Jude and prevents her from traveling to Italy. The pregnancy ends up putting a large amount of strain on their relationship since Mina is obsessed with purity and greatly distrusts [[modern medicine]]. While Jude wants her to visit an [[obstetrician]], he decides to trust Mina's decision to rely more on [[alternative medicine|alternative]] and [[traditional medicine]], even going so far as to attend a meeting with a psychic, who declares the fetus an [[Indigo child]].

When she goes into labor, she attempts a water birth with a midwife, but after hours, the baby goes into distress and Jude takes her to the hospital against her wishes, where she has a C-section.  Once the baby is born Mina begins putting the infant on a vegan diet, which concerns Jude, who begins to secretly go against Mina's parenting techniques. This puts the two parents at odds with one another and Mina begins to further obsess about keeping the child pure, at one point feeding the child an [[anti-nutrient]] oil because Jude fed the child some meat. As things progress the relationship continues on a downward spiral that puts the child's well-being and life at risk.   Towards the end of the film, Jude takes the child from the couple's home and brings him to his mother, where he feeds him a meal. Mina comes and attempts to sneak away with the child, only for Jude to stop her. As a result, Mia throws herself face-first into a door, causing injury.

However, when she returns home and puts the baby to sleep, an unseen person enters the apartment. Mina sits up in bed and watches the person enter the bedroom. The screen then cuts to black as a gunshot rings out. Jude is next seen running into the police station, frantically asking where his son is. The baby is unharmed, but Jude breaks down in tears.

The Hybrid (film)
 Jim Powell, a mercenary, is released from prison when a corporation wants to hire him.  He is to accompany a scientist, Dr. Lyla Healy, to a former Soviet lab now occupied by a militia and recover the remaining assets.  Powell reforms his team, including soldiers Steinmann, Mason, and Corry, and engineers Harris and Williams.  Powell is frustrated to learn corporate security man Spencer, but Healy insists he join them.  As the mercenaries approach the bunker, they are nearly discovered by a scout on a motorcycle.  After taking cover in what they suspect to be a minefield, they press on.  The bunker itself is fortified by many militia members.  Harris and Williams attempt to infiltrate the camp.  When Williams' Russian accent does not seem to be convincing the camp's guards, Harris improvises an drunken, anti-Russian rant in Georgian.  As the other mercenaries grow tense, the leader of the camp responds well and allows Williams and Harris to enter.  Williams and Harris take control of the base's security system and remotely guide the rest of the team to the underground bunker.  Steinmann becomes spooked but does not find any enemies.  Corry, leading the rear, is surprised by a silent attacker, who stabs him with a syringe before disappearing again.  Alerted by his gunfire, Powell orders them to ignore the attacker, as they do not have enough time to search.  Corry keeps quiet about the syringe, though he rapidly becomes ill.  After developing boils and a fever, he falls behind, unnoticed by the others.  After seeing more hostiles on the security system, Harris leaves Williams behind to warn the others.  While joining them, he is shot in the stomach.  Exiting a series of tunnels, they find the lab.  Powell sets up Harris at a medical area, and they search the area, finding Dr. Irvine.  Irvine greets Healy, revealing Healy as her former assistant.  Though ordered not to ask any questions, Powell becomes frustrated with the lack of information provided to him and demands Irvine explain the situation.  Irvine says the Soviets, though cutting edge in other sciences, fell behind in genetic engineering.  When they discovered what they believed to be extraterrestrial DNA in a meteorite, they lured her with promises of completely unfettered research.  Free of any ethical or legal restraints, she created two hybrid alien-human creatures.  The hybrids, though only several years old, have reached sexual maturity, and she has bred them. Reasoning that they are unintelligent, she plans to sacrifice the female's life to grow a purer specimen, as their physiology precludes the female from surviving a pregnancy.  Enraged by Irvine's callousness to the female's suffering, Steinmann kills the female out of mercy.  Healy demands that Powell kill Irvine now that she and her work have become useless.  When Powell refuses, Mason assaults him and reveals that he and Harris have already struck a bargain with Healy.  Steinmann, who left the others to tell the male hybrid, Goethe, that his sister has died, realises too late that he is intelligent and has hidden a weapon.  After disabling her, Goethe kills Irvine.  Powell and Mason reconcile now that they have no further conflict over whether to kill Irvine, and they leave the lab to stop Goethe, who has fled.  Meanwhile, Healy murders Steinmann, and, when she reveals her intention to kill Harris, he uses a grenade to destroy the lab.  Mason returns to the lab and finds everyone dead.  Spencer suggests that since the mission has been a complete failure, they simply leave together without worrying about any other objectives.  A mutated Corry attacks and kills Spencer, only to be killed by Powell.  As Mason and Powell exit the tunnels, they find the militia camp in disarray, fighting a losing battle against Goethe.  Williams is killed while assisting Powell, and Mason offers to sacrifice himself to give Powell a chance to kill Goethe.  Healy, revealed to have survived, interrupts Mason; the alien kills Mason as Powell instead targets Healy.  As Powell approaches the alien, it addresses him, telling him to kill it.  Powell hesitates, and Goethe escapes, later being revealed to have entered the United Kingdom.  
I Origins
 A Ph.D. student, Ian Gray, is researching the evolution of human eyes with Karen, his first year lab assistant, and Kenny. He has a particular hostility to superstition, religion and "[[intelligent design]]", which he hopes to discredit by filling in the steps of [[Evolution of the eye|the evolution of the eye]]. At a Halloween party he has an encounter with Sofi, who is wearing a black face mask, where only her magnetic hazel-speckled, ash-blue eyes are visible. Fascinated, he photographs her eyes and then up at the warehouse party she later leads him into the washroom to have sex. However, soon after, she abruptly leaves without saying goodbye.  Ian can't stop thinking about her. One day, synchronicities around the number eleven, amongst others, seem to mysteriously guide him to a billboard displaying what he recognizes to be Sofi's eyes. Eventually he sees her on a train and approaches her, letting her listen to the music on his earphones. They begin a relationship, although his rationalism often clashes with her fey spirituality. One day they spontaneously agree to marry. They are told they need to wait a day for a license, and as they disappointedly walk out of the registry office, Ian gets a call from Karen at the lab. There has been an exciting breakthrough in their research. She has found a blind worm—''[[Eisenia fetida]]''—with the DNA necessary to develop an eye, just what they'd been looking for. Ian takes Sofi to the lab with him, though she's less pleased he's willing to do so on their supposed 'wedding day'. He attempts to appease her by exchanging their wedding rings, to which she's reluctant as it possibly being bad luck. He states he doesn't believe in such, then places her ring on her finger anyway, whilst whispering that he's loved her forever.  Back at the lab, Sofi is upset by the research they're doing and an uncomfortable Karen leaves. After a short argument, Sofi kisses Ian and knocks over a bottle of formaldehyde, accidentally splashing Ian's eyes. They call Karen, who helps him to the eyewash station and bandages his eyes, and Sofi takes him home. On the way up, the elevator in Sofi's apartment building stops between floors. Ian wishes to hoist up Sofi but she refuses. Frustrated by her childish fears, he rips off his bandages and attempts to climb out himself. As he's pulling up Sofi, the elevator suddenly starts to move again. With blurry eyes, Ian thought he had pulled her out in time, but it was too late - Sofi's bottom half being chopped off, she dies instantly in his arms. Ian goes into a deep depression, and Karen continues their research. One night Karen brings him a meal at his home. He begins to cry and she comforts him. They begin to kiss.  The film flashes forward seven years. Ian has written a book on the evolution of the eye that he claims further debunks creationism. Ian and Karen are now married and Karen is pregnant. When their baby is born, the hospital takes an [[iris scan]] of baby Tobias' eyes. The results are entered in the database and the program identifies the baby as a certain Paul Edgar Dairy. The nurse re-enters the results, thinking it a glitch, and the problem disappears.  A few months later, a Doctor Simmons calls, claiming that a test of the baby's urine may indicate an elevated risk of [[autism]] and recommending a further test. But Ian and Karen become suspicious during this unconventional test and decide to investigate Doctor Simmons. They find that she is in fact one of a very few people with full access to the iris scan database. Ian tracks some pictures from this test to Idaho where he stumbles on the family of Paul Edgar Dairy, who apparently died just before their baby was conceived.  Ian's former research partner, Kenny, is the creator of the iris database. He helps Ian and Karen run some photos of deceased family members, plus various other people's eyes through the database to see if there are any other recent matches. They get a hit for Sofi, whose iris scan matches one made in India just three months prior, years after Sofi's death.  Ian goes to India to find the subject of this scan. There he finds Priya, the head of the community centre where the iris scan was made. Priya recognizes Sofi's eyes as those of a girl she knows, named Salomina, and agrees to help. Ian and Priya begin searching for Salomina, who is an orphan and seems to have disappeared into the crowds of the city. Ian tries putting up a billboard showing Sofi's eyes and offering a cash reward. He is besieged with calls but none are credible. Weeks later he comes across a little girl staring at the billboard. It is Salomina. He takes her back to his hotel and contacts Karen over [[Skype]]. The two of them conduct a simple test designed to reveal if Salomina might be somehow linked with Sofi. At first Salomina is uncannily accurate, but in the end her results are within the probable range of random chance. Karen asks him how he feels about this and he says he feels rather foolish. Feeling somewhat disheartened, Ian then leaves the hotel room with Salomina to take her to Priya but when they reach the elevator, the moment the doors open Salomina panics and throws herself into his arms, too frightened to enter. Staring into each other's eyes with a certain recognition, they then cling to each other, tears streaming down both's faces. He picks her up and takes her down the stairs instead, with Salomina tightly gripped around his neck, till they walk out the dark interior and step out into the light.  A [[post-credits scene]] shows Dr. Simmons scanning the irises of famous deceased figures, apparently finding many such matches.

I, Frankenstein
 In 1795, Dr. [[Victor Frankenstein]] ([[Aden Young]]) creates a [[Frankenstein's monster|monster]] ([[Aaron Eckhart]]), a soulless creature patched together from corpses, and then rejects it, disgusted with what he has made. In a fit of rage, the creature kills Victor's wife [[Elizabeth Lavenza|Elizabeth]] ([[Virginie Le Brun]]) and Victor chases it to the Arctic to get revenge, but succumbs to the weather. The creature buries his creator in the Frankenstein family crypt and is then attacked by [[demon]]s before being rescued by the [[gargoyle]]s Ophir ([[Mahesh Jadu]]) and Keziah ([[Caitlin Stasey]]), who bring it before the gargoyle queen Leonore ([[Miranda Otto]]) and their commander Gideon ([[Jai Courtney]]). Leonore explains that they were created by the [[Archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] to battle demons on Earth and protect humanity. They name the creature "Adam" and invite him to join them, but he declines and departs after being given heavy, baton-like weapons to protect himself, as more demons will come after him. The weapons allow him to "descend" demons (destroying their bodies and trapping their souls in [[Hell]]) as they have the symbol of the Gargoyle Order carved on them.  Throughout the centuries, Adam fends off the demons that pursue him. During a modern-day confrontation at a nightclub, a human [[police officer]] is killed. While Adam is summoned by the gargoyles once more, the demon Helek ([[Steve Mouzakis]]) reports that Adam is alive to his leader, the demon-prince [[Naberius]] ([[Bill Nighy]]), who is disguised as billionaire businessman Charles Wessex, and his right-hand man, Dekar ([[Kevin Grevioux]]). Wessex has employed [[scientist]]s Terra Wade ([[Yvonne Strahovski]]) and Carl Avery ([[Nicholas Bell]]) to conduct experiments with reanimated corpses, and sends a group of demons led by his most formidable warrior, Zuriel ([[Socratis Otto]]), to attack the gargoyles' cathedral and capture Adam so he can unlock the secret to giving life.  Before Leonore can punish Adam for the police officer's death, the cathedral is attacked and Adam convinces Ophir to release him. In the ensuing battle, a number of gargoyles, including Ophir and Keziah, are "ascended" (returned to and trapped in [[Heaven]]) while Leonore is captured and brought to an abandoned theater. Gideon is instructed to bring Adam as a trade for Leonore; Adam interrogates a demon and gains the same information. Adam having escaped, Gideon descends into the vaults and takes Victor Frankenstein's journal, which was taken off of Adam's body the night they found him. He exchanges the journal for Leonore, as it contains the secrets of the experiment. Once Gideon departs with Lenore, Adam attempts to recover the journal, but is prevented from doing so as several demons attack. Descending them, Adam then follows Zuriel to the Wessex Institute, where he learns that Naberius plans to recreate Frankenstein's experiment and use thousands of reanimated corpses as hosts for souls of the descended demons. The demons will be able to return from Hell if they have soulless bodies to possess. Adam retrieves the journal and escapes and later confronts Terra before they are attacked by Zuriel. Adam manages to "descend" Zuriel.  Adam warns the remaining gargoyles of Naberius' plan, agreeing to give them the journal if they get him and Terra to safety. Leonore agrees, but sends Gideon to kill him and retrieve the journal. After a violent fight, Adam is forced to "ascend" Gideon and then decides to burn Frankenstein's journal and destroy its secrets before the gargoyles come after him. Adam evades them, leading them to the Wessex Institute where they join battle with Naberius' demons, descending Dekar early in the fight. While the battle progresses, Adam ventures into the Institute to rescue Terra, who had been kidnapped by Naberius to put the next stage of his plan into process after he killed Avery. Naberius takes his true demonic form and activates the machine. Naberius overpowers Adam and tries to have one of the demon spirits possess him, but Adam proves immune as he has grown his own soul. As the gargoyles attempt to stop the reanimated bodies, Adam carves the symbol of the Gargoyle Order on Naberius, sanctifying his very body and utterly destroying it, descending Naberius alongside all the other demons in his army, and causing the entire building to collapse.  Recognizing Adam's bravery, Leonore rescues him and Terra and forgives Adam for Gideon's death. Adam retrieves his weapons. After bidding farewell to Terra, Adam departs to begin an immortal quest to protect the humans of the world and hunt demons for selfless reasons, the attitude that had earned him his soul in the first place. In doing so, he embraces his role and his true name of "Frankenstein".

Idhu Kathirvelan Kadhal
 The film opens with a [[prologue]], in which a person is being taken to a hospital and the doctor later reporting that the person's condition will be known only after sometime. The scene then shifts a few months back.  Enter Kathirvelan aka Kathir ([[Udhayanidhi Stalin]]), a [[Madurai]]-based [[minibus]] owner who is a devout [[Hindu]] and devotee of [[Hanuman|Lord Anjaneya]] since the age of five. Due to his devotion for Lord Maruti, he does not show any interest in women.  One day, while returning from a Sri Anjaneya temple, he sees his elder sister,  Vineethra ([[Chaya Singh]]) crying outside his house after his father ([[Aadukalam Naren]]) refused to take her in, having disowned her for eloping with a [[Coimbatore]]-based mill owner Shanmugham ([[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Dr. Bharath Reddy]]) against his wishes. Vineethra, however, now has issues with Shanmugham, as a result of which, she left him and returned to her father's house. On Kathir's cajoling, his father reluctantly accepts Vineethra into the house. Kathir then decides to find out what caused the standoff between Vineethra and Shanmugham and leaves for Coimbatore, lying to his father that he is headed for [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]] to do some work related to his minibus business. Before leaving, he is warned by Vineethra not to fall for Shanmugham's neighbor, Pavithra ([[Nayanthara]]), as her father and Shanmugham are sworn enemies.  In Coimbatore, Kathir successfully manages to resolve the conflict between Vineethra and Shanmugham, with Vineethra returning to Coimbatore eventually. He, however, does not return to Madurai immediately, staying back in Coimbatore after noticing Pavithra and falling in love with her, despite Vineethra's warning and his devotion to Lord [[Bajrangbali]]. Determined to win Pavithra's heart, he takes the help of his college friend Mayilvaganam aka Mayil ([[N. Santhanam|Santhanam]]), who is a medical doctor, finds out that Pavithra is working as a manager in a [[Panasonic]] showroom. The duo go there so that Kathir can speak to Pavithra, but end up creating a scene, forcing Pavithra to throw both of them out. After Pavithra notices Kathir constantly following her, she confronts him and threatens to take him to the police, which increases the friction between them. However, when Pavithra finds out how Kathir had saved Vineethra's marriage, she forgives him and becomes his friend, but later reveals that she is in love with a businessman, Gautham ([[Sunder Ramu]]), which breaks Kathir's heart. To add to Kathir's woes, Shanmugham finds out that he is in love with Pavithra, and kicks him out of his house for showing interest in his enemy's daughter. Meanwhile, back in Madurai, his father too disowns him after finding out that he had not gone to Salem after all. Without a place to stay now, Kathir moves into Mayil's home.  Kathir soon finds out that Pavithra's boyfriend Gautham is a womanizer, planning to dump Pavithra after having a [[one night stand]] with her at his friend's upcoming marriage in [[Ooty]]. He tells her about this, but she rubbishes his claims and admonishes him for still hitting on her. However, she soon realizes the truth about Gautham after he attempts to kiss her in his car causing her to dump him. She and Kathir reconcile, but she now realizes that she has feelings for Kathir. With the help of Mayil and Pavithra's [[Malayali]] friend (Kala Kalyani), who Mayil has fallen in love with, they soon express their feelings for one another.  Trouble soon erupts however, after Shanmugham and Pavithra's father find out that Kathir and Pavithra are in love. Kathir and Pavithra decide that the only way Shanmugham and Pavithra's father can accept their relationship is to make them reconcile, as it is revealed by Shanmugham, that he and Pavithra's father are sworn enemies due to the enmity which existed between the latter and Shanmugham's deceased father, who happened to be Pavithra's paternal uncle. They take the help of a mimicry artist, Balaraman ([[Mayilsamy]]), who mimics both Shanmugham's and Pavithra's father's voices in the presence of the real Pavithra's father and Shanmugham respectively, which eventually leads to Shanmugham and Pavithra's father reconciling.  With the initial hurdle cleared, Kathir and Mayil then plan to convince Kathir's father, who has now reconciled with Kathir, but is also searching for a bride for him, to allow Kathir to marry Pavithra. However, while trying to tell Kathir's father about Pavithra, Mayil consumes poison and is immediately rushed to the hospital, which it is later revealed that Mayil pretended to poison himself by pretending to swallow [[laxatives]], fearing the wrath of Kathir's father, and thereby revealing the identity of the person in the [[prologue]]. On returning home, Kathir tells his father about Pavithra, who, as expected, becomes furious and locks himself up in his room. Later, Kathir manages to calm down his father and adds that he will not marry Pavithra as long as he refuses to accept their relationship, whilst also saying that, unlike Vineethra, he does not want to marry without seeking his father's permission. On hearing of this, his father forgives Kathir, accepts his relationship with Pavithra and gives the go ahead signal for their marriage.  The film ends with Kathir and Pavithra getting married happily.

After her parents see that Mia is passionate about the cello, they hire a teacher to help her play. Kat is shown pregnant with Teddy, whom Mia thinks is the reason for her father's departure from his band.  Years later, an adolescent Mia is still passionate about the cello and is playing at school in the band room where Adam peeks in on her playing, seeing her for the first time, leading him to ask Kim, Mia's best friend, about her. Adam then asks Mia out on a date to a cello recital, where they show mutual affection towards one another.  The story flashes back to current time with the family driving to the grandparents' farm when their car collides with an oncoming truck. Mia appears to have an [[out-of-body experience]] where she finds herself barefoot and sees her body lying on the road while paramedics are trying to help her and her family. Mia tries to ask a paramedic what is happening, but realizes that no one can see or hear her. Mia, now in the hospital, panics as she does not know the current status of any of her family members when they take her in for surgery. A sympathetic nurse, Nurse Ramirez, tells Mia—her physical body, not Mia's spirit, which apparently she cannot see either—that it is up to her whether or not she wants to stay.  The story flashes back once again to Mia attending one of Adam's concerts with his band Willamette Stone, where she does not seem to fit in. Adam's band is steadily gaining more recognition and gets signed to a label, which starts to put a strain on their relationship due to the travel schedule.

In the present day, Mia undergoes surgery. She sees a doctor speaking with her grandparents who are standing outside of a pediatric room where Teddy lies in a coma-like state. Adam comes to the hospital to see Mia, but is not allowed in as he is not an immediate family member. It is then revealed that Mia's mom Kat was pronounced [[dead on arrival]] and her dad Denny died on the operating table. She later finds out that Teddy has died from an [[epidural hematoma]]. Grandpa talks to Mia, revealing that her father gave up being in a band because he wanted to give her a better life and be a better father. He also, tearfully, gives Mia permission to move on from this life if she wants, which influences Mia to decide that she wants to die so that she can join her family on the other side.  The story flashes back to Mia at her audition for Juilliard, where she plays the best she has ever played, leading her to think that if accepted, she would go. After a reconciliation with Adam, they talk about the huge possibility of her going to Juilliard, which ultimately leads to them breaking up and going their separate ways.  After some time, Mia seems stable enough to receive more visitors. Mia is shown symbolically about to let go when she hears the music performed at the cello recital that she attended with Adam. It is revealed that Adam has come to see Mia and that he is playing his [[iPod]] for her. He brings with him a letter Mia has received from Juilliard saying that she has been accepted and lets her know that he would do whatever she wants if she stays. He begins to play the song he has finally written about her. Mia, after flashing back through all the happy moments in her life, squeezes Adam's hand and opens her eyes and sees Adam as he hovers over her and says, "Mia?".  
The Imitation Game
 In 1952, two policemen, Nock and Staehl, investigate the mathematician [[Alan Turing]] after an apparent break-in at his home. During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at [[Bletchley Park]] during the [[Second World War]].  In 1927, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in [[cryptography]]. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but he dies from tuberculosis.  When Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander [[Alastair Denniston]], he joins the cryptography team of [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], [[John Cairncross]], Peter Hilton, Keith Furman and Charles Richards. The team are [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|trying to decrypt]] the [[Enigma machine]], which the Nazis use to send coded messages.  Turing is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior; he works alone to design [[Bombe|a machine]] to decipher Enigma. After Denniston refuses to fund construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. [[Joan Clarke]], a Cambridge graduate, passes Turing’s test but her parents will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept the messages, and shares his plans with her.  With Clarke's help, Turing warms to the other colleagues, who begin to respect him.  Turing’s machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma settings before the Germans reset the Enigma encryption each day. Denniston orders it destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives, Turing has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate. Turing realises they cannot act on every decoded message or the Germans will realise Enigma has been broken.  Turing discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing’s sexuality. When the MI6 agent [[Stewart Menzies]] appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already, and planted Cairncross to leak messages to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is gay. Heartbroken, Clarke states she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work and that they can never see one another again or share what they have done.  In the 1950s Turing is convicted of [[gross indecency]] and, in lieu of a jail sentence, undergoes [[chemical castration]] so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts him by saying that his work saved millions of lives.

Simon and Will are depressed and ostracised at [[Sheffield University]]; Neil is working in a bank; and Jay is taking a gap year in [[Australia]]. He emails Neil, claiming that he is now a top DJ at a popular nightclub, lives in a luxury mansion, and has daily sex with multiple partners. This convinces them to visit him in Australia for their Easter holidays. Once they arrive at the club in [[Sydney]], they find that Jay was lying, and in fact; only works as a toilet attendant and lives in a tent in his Uncle Paul's front garden, while Will meets Katie- an old friend from his private school days, who is [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking]], and she persuades him to join her. Simon, intending to break up with the abusive Lucy over [[Skype]] is then interrupted by Jay's uncle in the background. Thinking Simon asked her to marry him, she excitedly tells him yes.  [[File:Byron Lighthouse looking south 2004-28-12.JPG|thumb|The four main characters drive to [[Byron Bay]], along with the backpackers]] The next day, the four travel to a youth hostel in [[Byron Bay]], as Will wants to follow Katie there. He attempts to become friends with one of the backpackers, Ben, but is unsuccessful when the backpackers quickly deduce that he is a tourist, rather than a "traveller". When seated around a campfire, it is implied but not revealed that Jay still misses his ex-girlfriend Jane, and has followed her to Australia to try to win her back. Will and Katie hit it off, to Ben's annoyance as Will mocks his guitar playing. Katie drunkenly seduces Will but then unknowingly to him, passes out as they are in bed together and Will is fingering her. A backpacker girl comes in, sees what is happening and thinking that Will had taken advantage of a now unconscious Katie, wrestles him to the ground, and sets off a "rape alarm" Will's overprotective mother gave to him.  The Inbetweeners and the backpackers visit a water park where, Neil accidentally kills a dolphin and Jay gets Simon into trouble with the parents of some children. It is revealed that Jane was working somewhere at the water park and Jay tries to find her, but another member of staff tells him that she has since left for the outback and that he will "never find her"; leaving him feeling dejected and he finally reveals to the others his longing to reconnect with Jane. Will takes on Ben in a waterslide race on the condition that the loser must strip naked. Neil, who is suffering from [[irritable bowel syndrome|irritable bowels]] tries to alert Will that he is about to soil himself, to which Will ignores him but Neil defecates down the slide Will has just gone down. Will wins the race against Ben, but Neil's poo lands right on his face, causing him to vomit uncontrollably, making everybody evacuate the pool.  Lucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane is working on a [[stud farm]] in the remote settlement of [[Birdsville]], and the boys intend to drive there but Will, trying to become a "traveller" instead of a tourist, gets into an argument with Simon and they part ways. Will stays in Byron Bay in the hopes of getting with Katie while the other three head for Birdsville.  Will struggles to fit in with the "spiritual" activities of the travellers and discovers that Katie is sleeping with multiple people at once including Ben, launching him into one of his foul-mouthed tirades towards them, which leads Katie into having sex with Ben in the hostel dormitory. Regretting his decision, Will books a flight with a local farmer and reunites with the rest of the group in the outback.  Their car runs out of fuel in the middle of the desert. The group hold hands together as they realise that they will most likely die, but they are rescued by Jane and her work colleagues. She realises how far Jay came to win her over again, and although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house, the boys find that their parents have flew out to find them after hearing of their near-death experience. The boys are shocked to find Mr. Gilbert (their old head of [[sixth form]] and Will's nemesis) there too, and Will's mother announces that she and Gilbert are in a relationship, to the abject horror of Will and amusement of the other three friends. Over Skype, Lucy breaks-up with Simon because she has been cheating with, and is now in a relationship with his university "best friend" Pete, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging-up on her.

The Incident (2014 film)
 Small-time criminal Carlos comes home to find his younger brother, Oliver, agitated.  Before Oliver can explain his behavior, rogue cop Marcos emerges from hiding and places both brothers under arrest.  Oliver explains that he has confessed under duress and begs forgiveness.  Carlos demands to see a warrant.  Marco admits he does not have one and attempts to take them to the police station at gunpoint.  They overpower him and flee down their apartment complex's stairs.  While chasing them, Marco shoots Carlos in the leg.  Marco seems surprised by his action and is further worried when he hears a loud noise in the distance.  Carlos and Oliver surrender to Marcos, who refuses to take them to a hospital.  Marco is horrified when the stairs turn out to be endless, looping in on themselves.  Oliver applies first aid to his brother but can only watch as Carlos bleeds to death the next day.  Before he dies, Carlos urges Oliver to appreciate the present, something he could never do.  As Oliver mourns Carlos' death, Marco becomes shaken when he sees that a vending machine on the stairwell has become restocked, exactly as it was 24 hours ago.  Enraged by Marco's callousness, Oliver disarms him and threatens to kill him with his pistol.  Marco insists that he did not consciously choose to shoot Carlos, and the two argue over the metaphysics of their situation.  Elsewhere, Sandra and her two children, Daniel and Camila, prepare to visit her ex-husband.  Although her new husband, Roberto, is anxious about the trip, Sandra reassures him the long drive will give him a chance to bond with her children.  On the way, they stop at a gas station, where Roberto carelessly offers fruit juice  to Camila.  Camila has an allergic reaction to it, which brings on an asthma attack.  After Roberto accidentally destroys her inhaler, an accident he insists was fated to happen, a loud explosion sounds in the distance.  Sandra asks Daniel to retrieve the backup inhaler, but he reveals that he forgot to pack it.  Panicking, Sandra insists that Roberto turn around and return home.  After passing the same gas station repeatedly, they realize the road endlessly repeats the same stretch.  Roberto exits the car and walks off through the brush to seek help.  Without access to her inhaler, Camila dies.  Believing herself to be stuck in a nightmare, Sandra abandons her children and drives off, vainly attempting to wake herself.  Daniel picks up his sister's body and begins walking down the road in the opposite direction.  All converge to the same spot and give up hope of escape.  Thirty-five years later, both groups are still stuck in their respective locations.  Each day, everyone finds a fresh copy of all their possessions.  Over the decades, these items gather into towering piles as the two groups attempt to live their lives.  Sandra and Roberto, now elderly, have animalistic sex, Daniel lives on his own without much interaction with them, and Oliver leads the elderly Marco in rituals worshiping Carlos' skeleton.  After Sandra dies, Roberto and Daniel hold a funeral, where Roberto is struck by a moment of lucidity as he, too, nears death.  He says he now understands why they are stuck.  Marco and Roberto jointly reveal that they are the same person, living different lives in alternate dimensions.  Daniel and Oliver, too, are the same person.  These dimensions split off from reality and are stuck in a time loop.  They are brought on by tragedy, and the emotions that the inhabitants feel are fed back to people in the real world.  As he dies, Roberto/Marco urges Daniel/Oliver to break the cycle of creating new dimensions by refusing to follow his fate.  Daniel and Oliver find they are now free to leave their dimension.  Each initially hesitates but follows his fate.  Daniel enters a police car and becomes Marco, off to arrest Oliver and Carlos.  Oliver leaves his apartment complex, becoming a Russian bellhop who operates an elevator for a bride and groom.  He sets in motion an accidental death for the groom, trapping himself and the bride in a new dimension for thirty-five years.  
Interstellar (film)
  In the mid-21st century, crop [[blight]]s and [[dust storm]]s threaten [[Human extinction|humanity's survival]]. Cooper, a widowed [[engineer]] and former [[NASA]] pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law Donald, son Tom, and daughter Murph. Cooper is reprimanded for telling Murph that the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions were not fake; he encourages her to carefully observe and record what she sees. They discover strange dust patterns forming in a room in their house. Although Murph first attributes this phenomena to a [[poltergeist|ghost]], further observation shows that they are the result from [[gravity]] variations, and translate into [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinates]]. These lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Cooper's former supervisor, Professor John Brand, who explains that 48 years earlier a [[wormhole]] appeared near [[Saturn]], opening a path to a distant [[galaxy]] with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a [[black hole]] named "''Gargantua''". Volunteers had previously traveled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with astronauts Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reporting back desirable results. Brand explains he has conceived two plans to ensure humanity’s survival - Plan A involves developing a [[Gravity|gravitational]] [[propulsion]] theory, allowing a mass exodus from Earth, while Plan B is a conventional launch of the ''Endurance'' [[spacecraft]] (equipped with two Ranger [[Single-stage-to-orbit|SSTO]] [[spaceplanes]] and two [[Lander (spacecraft)|Lander]] cargo craft) with 5000 [[Cryopreservation|frozen]] [[embryo]]s to colonize a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet]]. Cooper is recruited to pilot the ''Endurance''. When Murph refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch to compare their [[Relativity of simultaneity|relative time]] when he returns.  The crew consists of Cooper, the robots TARS and CASE, and the scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Dr. Romilly, and Dr. Doyle. After traversing the wormhole, Cooper, Doyle and Brand use a Ranger to investigate Miller's planet, an [[ocean planet|ocean world]] where time is [[gravitational time dilation|severely dilated]]. After landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from Miller's expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines. By the time the engines restart, 23 years have elapsed on ''Endurance''.  Having enough fuel for only one of the other two planets, Cooper rules they go to Mann's, as he is still broadcasting. En route, they receive messages from Earth. Murph is now a scientist working on Plan A. On his deathbed, Brand reveals to Murph that Plan B was his only real plan, knowing that Plan A required observations of [[Gravitational singularity|gravitational singularities]] from within a black hole.  On Mann's planet, the ''Endurance'' crew revive Mann from [[Cryonics|cryostasis]]. He assures them colonization is possible, despite an extreme environment. On an excursion, Mann attempts to kill Cooper and reveals that he falsified the data in the hope of being rescued. He steals Cooper's lander and heads for the ''Endurance''. While a [[booby trap]] set by Mann kills Romilly, Brand rescues Cooper with the other lander and they race to the ''Endurance''. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation with Ranger 1, severely damaging the ''Endurance''. Through a difficult docking maneuver, Cooper regains control. With insufficient fuel, they resort to a [[Gravity assist|slingshot]] around ''Gargantua'' which costs them another 51 years. In the process, Cooper and TARS jettison Ranger 2 and Lander 1 to allow Brand and CASE to reach Edmunds' planet. Slipping past the [[event horizon]] of ''Gargantua'', they eject from their craft and find themselves in a [[tesseract]], possibly constructed by humans of the far future. Across time, Cooper can see through the bookcases of Murph's old room on Earth and weakly interact with its gravity. Realizing that he is now Murph's "ghost", he manipulates the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left, transmitting via [[Morse code]] the quantum data that TARS collected from inside the event horizon.  The tesseract, its purpose completed, collapses and ejects Cooper and TARS. Cooper awakes on a [[space habitat]] orbiting Saturn. He reunites with Murph, now an old woman nearing death. Using the quantum data, she was able to develop the gravitational propulsion theory, enabling humanity's exodus and transformation into an advanced spacefaring civilization. She reminds Cooper that Brand is out there alone. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Brand and CASE, who are setting up a human colony on Edmunds' habitable planet.  
The Interview
 Dave Skylark is the host of the talk show ''Skylark Tonight'', where he interviews celebrities about personal topics and gossip. After Skylark and his crew celebrate their 1,000th episode, the show's producer Aaron Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticized the show as not being a real news program. A while later Rapaport reveals his concern and urge for change, to which Skylark agrees. Skylark discovers that North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]] is a fan of ''Skylark Tonight'', prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview. Rapaport travels to a place outside [[Dandong]], [[China]] to receive instructions from Sook-yin Park, the [[Propaganda in North Korea|North Korean chief propagandist]], and Rapaport accepts the task of interviewing Kim, on behalf of Skylark.  The next day, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Lacey shows up at Skylark and Rapaport's place, proposing that the duo assassinate Kim using a [[Transdermal patch|transdermal strip]] that will expose Kim to [[ricin]] via handshake; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the ricin strip hidden inside a pack of gum. Upon their arrival in the presidential palace in [[Pyongyang]], they are introduced to security officers Koh and Yu; Koh discovers the strip and chews it, believing it to be gum. That night, Lacey airdrops them two more strips from an [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]], but in order to smuggle it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a [[Siberian tiger]] and then hide the container in his rectum. Later, Kim shows up and introduces himself to Skylark.  Skylark spends the day with Kim by playing basketball, hanging out and partying. Kim persuades Skylark that he is misunderstood as a cruel dictator and as a failed administrator, and they become friends. At dinner, Koh has a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]] due to the ricin poisoning and accidentally kills Yu before dying. The next morning, Skylark feels guilty and discards one of the ricin strips, then thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After another dinner mourning the death of Kim's bodyguards, Skylark witnesses Kim's malicious side as he threatens war with [[South Korea]]. Skylark leaves, and after taking a walk, he discovers that a nearby grocery store is merely [[Potemkin village|a façade]] and realizes that Kim has been lying to him.  At the same time, during attempted [[sexual intercourse]] with Rapaport, who still has the ricin strip in his hand, Sook-yin reveals that she despises Kim and apologizes for defending the regime. Skylark, Rapaport, and Sook-yin form a plan to break [[North Korean cult of personality|Kim's cult of personality]] by causing him to cry on air. As they arm themselves for the event, Rapaport and Sook-yin have sex. Before the broadcast starts, Kim presents Skylark with a puppy to keep.  During the internationally televised interview with Kim, Skylark addresses increasingly sensitive topics and challenges Kim's need for [[Kim Jong-il|his father]]'s approval. Meanwhile, Sook-yin and Rapaport seize control of the broadcasting center and fend off guards trying to halt the broadcast. Despite his initial resistance, Kim eventually cries uncontrollably and soils himself after Skylark sings [[Firework (song)|"Firework"]] by [[Katy Perry]] (having learned of Kim's fondness of Perry earlier), ruining his reputation. Feeling betrayed, Kim shoots Skylark and leaves, but Skylark reveals he has survived due to wearing a [[bulletproof vest]]. Skylark, Rapaport, and Sook-yin regroup with the puppy in tow and escape the presidential palace with the unexpected help of a panel-control guard. The trio hijack Kim's [[T-54/T-55|personal tank]] (which had been given to [[Kim Il-sung]] by [[Joseph Stalin]] and then passed down to Kim) to get to their pickup point. Kim boards a helicopter, and his army pursues the group. He prepares a nuclear missile launch, but before he can issue the command to launch, Skylark fires a shell from the tank and destroys Kim's helicopter, killing him. With the immediate threat over, Sook guides Skylark and Rapaport to an escape route, and they are rescued by three [[SEAL Team Six]] members disguised as [[Korean People's Army]] troops and are loaded onto a rescue craft. Back in the U.S., Skylark writes a book about his experience, and North Korea moves toward becoming a denuclearized [[democracy]] with Sook-yin as [[Transitional government|interim]] leader.

  A tornado hits the car carrying four high school students, killing them all. In the town of Silverton, Oklahoma, the local high school senior class is preparing for graduation. The high school's vice-principal, Gary Fuller ([[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]), has asked his two sons, Trey and Donnie, to record messages from the seniors for a [[time capsule]] to be opened in 25 years. Elsewhere, Pete ([[Matt Walsh (comedian)|Matt Walsh]]), a veteran [[Storm chasing|storm chaser]], has been attempting to intercept and film tornadoes using a heavily armored [[Tornado Intercept Vehicle]] nicknamed Titus, but has come up short all year long. Upon learning of a major line of developing storms, the chasers confer and decide to head for Silverton in hopes of filming tornadoes. After arriving in Silverton, the team discovers that the cell they had been chasing has dissipated, upsetting Pete. As the team reconvenes to determine its next move, the Silverton cell abruptly strengthens, resulting in a [[hail]]storm and [[tornado]]. As the team films, the funnel abruptly shifts course and heads for the high school.  At the high school, the senior students are participating in [[Graduation|commencement ceremonies]] when the weather suddenly sours. Moments later, the [[civil defense siren|tornado sirens]] sound, and the students are subsequently marshaled into the school building by the head principal and his staff. In the aftermath of the tornado, shaken students emerge from the damaged building to view the destruction, while Gary sets out to rescue his eldest son Donnie, who had gone to an abandoned paper mill to help his friend Katlyn ([[Alycia Debnam-Carey]]) with a project; both were subsequently trapped when the tornado brought the building down on them.  As Pete's storm chase team stops in a small part of town, a tornado takes shape just as Gary and Trey arrive, destroying several buildings. Before the tornado dissipates Gary must save Pete's meteorologist, Allison Stone ([[Sarah Wayne Callies]]), when she fails to make it to safety with the others. Then, after Gary pleads for help, Pete's team agree to help Gary get to the paper mill. While en route, another round of erratic tornadoes forms and encircles Pete's team, in the process destroying a residential neighborhood and a car lot. An explosion turns one of the tornadoes into a [[Fire whirl|firenado]], which Jacob the cameraman, ([[Jeremy Sumpter]]), tries to film, only to be caught up in the storm and killed. This causes friction between Pete and his team, as Pete's concern seems to be more on collecting data than ensuring his team's safety. After recovering their vehicles, Allison leaves with Gary to continue their trip to the paper mill.  At the mill, the two trapped students attempt to use their phones to call for help, but the storm's devastation has rendered the phones almost useless. To make matters worse, a water pipe abruptly breaks and begins to flood the hole in which the two are trapped. Injured and at risk of drowning, the two record messages for their loved ones, then prepare for the worst. At the last minute, Gary and Allison arrive and successfully free the two students.  In the skies above Silverton, a [[convergence zone|convergence]] of two large tornadoes results in a colossal [[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF5]] tornado that threatens to level the town. The town's citizens have taken shelter at the school, but Pete's team determines that the school's [[Storm cellar|storm shelter]] will be inadequate in the face of the monstrous tornado. Unable to alert the school's staff with mobile devices, Pete's team rushes to the school to notify the citizens that they must evacuate. While citizens rush to board [[school bus]]es to flee the advancing storm, Pete and his team move to track and follow the storm, but the last school bus and a handful of cars are cut off from the retreat due to a downed [[transmission tower]].  In an attempt to improvise a shelter, the storm chasers and school refugees take cover in a [[storm drain]] at a construction site, but debris from the tornado damages one of the storm grates, compromising the shelter. In an attempt to save lives, Pete hands over his research [[Hard disk drive|hard drives]] to Gary, then sacrifices himself by leaving the shelter to move Titus down to the storm grate, where a combination of the vehicle's weight, ground anchors, and winch cable are used to anchor the storm grate to the concrete face. Titus's equipment proves unable to anchor the vehicle to the ground, and the tornado picks up the vehicle. From the camera turret aboard Titus, Pete observes the funnel of the tornado as the vehicle is lifted above the clouds, before then crashing back down to the ground, killing him and wrecking Titus. Shortly thereafter, the EF5 tornado dissipates.  In the aftermath of the tornado outbreak, the townspeople begin efforts to clean up and rebuild. As Gary's sons move to complete their time capsule film, many of those they interview after the tornadoes express a newfound appreciation for their lives, and a hopeful outlook on life. Allison praises Pete's sacrifice and dedication to science.  The last footage shows the two local daredevils Donk and Reevis, who were sucked up by the tornado while filming it earlier, are revealed to have survived the storm.

Inner Demons
 Carson Morris (Lara Vosburgh) is a former straight-A student that has been using drugs for the past year, having begun shortly after she enrolled in a prestigious Catholic high school. She has agreed, albeit reluctantly, to allow a film crew to monitor her for an ''[[Intervention (TV series)|Intervention]]''-esque documentary show as she checks into a rehab clinic. Carson is quickly made a target of ridicule by the other patients, as she has been taking drugs because she believes that she has been demonically possessed. Jason (Morgan McClellan), a production assistant for the film crew, is sympathetic and quickly bonds with Carson - even going so far as to believe her claims after her behavior turns increasingly erratic. During all of this Carson also has several displays of supernatural behavior that is captured on camera but only when she is alone. There are suggestions of bringing in an [[exorcist]], however the clinic's physician Dean Pretiss (Richard Wilkinson) thinks that this would be detrimental to Carson's mental well being. When Carson attacks Jason the show's producer Suzanne (Kate Whitney) begins to push Pretiss for an exorcist, only for him to state that he wants to transfer Carson to a mental institution.  The following day Pretiss gives a much calmer Carson a physical exam and discovers that Jason gave her heroin while she was unconscious, as he now fully believes that the drugs will keep the demons at bay. As a result, Carson is expelled from the clinic and her family withdraws their consent to have her filmed. Not deterred, Jason follows Carson home and continually tries to get in touch with her family, but is repeatedly sent away by her parents, Beth and Steve (Colleen McGrann and Christopher Parker). It's only when he investigates her "friends" that he discovers that she was being bullied at her new school by her new acquaintances. They decided to prank her by forcing her to take part in a Satanic ritual, which is when she got possessed. Jason returns to the Morris family home with the rest of the film crew and breaks into the house demanding to see Carson. Her parents are initially hostile, but grow fearful after they hear Carson screaming upstairs. With no other options, Jason tries to [[exorcism|exorcise]] Carson himself but is unsuccessful and the demon causes the house's power to go out. Carson, now fully possessed, then picks off the house's occupants one by one, including her own mother after she tearfully admits that Carson is a victim of physical abuse. Jason tries to appeal to Carson one last time and is seemingly successful. However their joy is short lived, as Carson's father enters the room and shoots Carson in the head and then kills himself, believing that she is still possessed. A horrified Suzanne is then murdered by Jason, who then turns off the camera currently filming, and we see that his eyes are now pure black, as were Carson's earlier in the film.  
Into the Woods (film)
   A baker ([[James Corden]]) and his wife ([[Emily Blunt]]) wish for a child but suffer under a curse laid upon the baker's family by a [[Witchcraft|Witch]] ([[Meryl Streep]]) who found the baker's father robbing her garden when his mother was pregnant. Because the baker's father also stole some magic beans, the witch was punished with the curse of ugliness by her own mother.  The witch offers to lift the curse but only if the baker and his wife obtain four critical items for her: a [[Cattle|cow]] as white as milk, a cape as red as blood, a strand of hair as yellow as corn, and a slipper as pure as gold. The witch later tells the baker that she asked him to do this task for her because she is not allowed to touch any of the objects.  The witch's demands eventually bring the baker and his wife into contact with Jack ([[Daniel Huttlestone]]), who is selling his beloved cow, Milky-White, and to whom the baker offers magic beans left him by his father (which were stolen from the witch) which grow into a large beanstalk; with Red Riding Hood ([[Lilla Crawford]]), whose ruby cape the couple notices when she stops to buy sweets on her way to grandmother's house; with Rapunzel ([[MacKenzie Mauzy]]), whose tower the baker's wife passes in the woods; and with Cinderella ([[Anna Kendrick]]), who also runs into the baker's wife while fleeing from the pursuing prince ([[Chris Pine]]).  After a series of failed attempts and misadventures, the baker and his wife are finally able to gather the items necessary to break the spell. Meanwhile, each of the other characters receives a "[[happy ending]]": Cinderella marries the prince; Rapunzel is freed from her guardian, the witch, by Cinderella's prince's brother and marries him; Jack provides for his mother by stealing riches from the [[Giant]] in the sky, and kills the pursuing giant by cutting down the beanstalk; Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother are saved from the [[Big Bad Wolf]] ([[Johnny Depp]]); and the witch regains her youth and beauty after drinking the potion.  However, each of the characters learns that his/her "happily ever after" is not very happy: the baker is worried that he is a poor father to his newborn baby; the baker's wife is temporarily seduced by the prince; Cinderella is disenchanted by the cheating prince; and the witch learns that she has lost her powers with her restored youth and beauty. The growth of a second beanstalk from the last remaining magic bean allows the giant's wife to climb down and threaten the kingdom and its inhabitants if they do not deliver Jack in retribution for killing her husband. The characters debate the morality of handing Jack over. In the process, Red Riding Hood's mother and grandmother, Jack's mother, and the baker's wife are killed. The characters blame each other for their individual actions that led to the tragedy, ultimately blaming the witch for raising the beans in the first place. She curses them for their inability to accept responsibility for their individual actions. Casting all her remaining beans away, she begs her mother to punish her again and disappears into a large pit of boiling tar.  The remaining characters resolve to kill the threatening giant's wife though Cinderella and the baker try to explain to the distraught Red Riding Hood and Jack the complicated morality of retribution and revenge. The characters lure the giant's wife into stepping in the tar pit where she ultimately trips and falls to her death. With the giant's wife dead, the characters move forward with their ruined lives. The baker, thinking of his wife, is determined to be a good father. Cinderella decides to leave the prince and help the baker, and Jack and Red Riding Hood, now orphans, are living with the baker and Cinderella. The baker comforts his son after he begins to cry by telling a story as the movie ends with the witch's moral, meaning that children can change due to the parent's actions and behaviors.

Twelve years later, Ryan is working on [[Wall Street]] covertly for the CIA looking for suspicious financial transactions that would indicate terrorist activity. When the [[Russian Federation]] loses a key vote before the [[United Nations]], Ryan notices that the markets do not respond in the expected way. He discovers that billions of dollars held by Russian organizations have disappeared. A large number of these funds are controlled by Viktor Cherevin (Branagh), a Russian tycoon.  Ryan's employer conducts business with Cherevin, so when Ryan discovers certain accounts are inaccessible to him as an auditor, he has reason to visit [[Moscow]] and investigate. On arrival he narrowly survives a murder attempt by an assassin (Anozie) posing as his bodyguard. Ryan sends an SOS and is surprised to learn his backup is Harper. During their debrief, Ryan explains how Cherevin's shadow investments could make the United States vulnerable to complete [[Economic collapse|financial collapse]] following a staged terrorist attack, which would also weaken global markets.  At his meeting with Cherevin the next day, he is told that the problem company and all of its assets have been sold, thus preventing Ryan's audit. Meanwhile, Muller, now Ryan's fiancée, concerned he may be having an affair, secretly flies to Moscow to meet him. Against protocol for unmarried couples, Ryan reveals that he works for the CIA, to her great relief.

Ryan uses his talent for pattern recognition to locate Aleksandr's hideout and intended target, Wall Street. He locates a fake police response vehicle driven by Aleksandr and gives chase. After Ryan catches up and engages in a physical confrontation with Aleksandr, he discovers the bomb in the rear of the police decoy. Unable to defuse it, he hijacks the vehicle with Aleksandr in it. He later crashes it into the [[East River]] while simultaneously jumping out, as the bomb detonates, killing Aleksandr. Cherevin is executed by his co-conspirators in Russia. Ryan and Harper are called to the [[White House]] to brief the [[President of the United States|president]].  
Jai Ho (film)
   Jai Agnihotri ([[Salman Khan]]) is an ex-army officer whose passions include helping citizens and fighting criminals. He was a major in the [[Indian Army]], but was suspended because he ignored orders from his superiors so that he could rescue a group of children from terrorists. After this incident, Jai moved in with his mother and sister Geeta ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]).  One day, Jai is unable to help a physically disabled girl, Suman ([[Genelia D'Souza]]), take an examination while her brother Rohan ([[Vikas Bhalla]])  is stuck in a traffic block. Suman became depressed because no one came to help her, and she commits suicide. Jai is greatly disturbed by this incident. With Suman’s death fresh in his mind, Jai created a system that would encourage citizens to help each other. Each day, citizens were to help three people. These three people would in turn help three more people, and so on. Jai believed that this network would foster kindness and a sense of community among the citizens. His system, however, faced challenges.  On one occasion, for one of his daily good deeds, Jai beat a rich man who had injured a child beggar. In an act of revenge, the rich man employed some men to take Jai's sister Geeta and friend Rinky into their custody. Jai was able to save his sister and friend, but in the process he injured one of the captors. This captor happened to be the henchman of a member of the Legislative Assembly, named Patil. Patil was the son-in-law of the Home Minister Dashrat Singh.  The Home Minister was not pleased that Jai had injured one of his sons-in-law’s henchmen. He attempted to avenge this injury by kidnapping Jai’s nephew. The Home Minister lost his son-in-law in the process. The Chief Minister, Ashok Pradhan, meanwhile found out about Jai's system after his own life was saved by a schoolgirl performing her good deeds for the day. The Chief Minister decided to intervene in the dispute between the Home Minister and Jai in an attempt to put an end to their fight. The Home Minister did not appreciate this intervention. He planned to kill the Chief Minister and frame Jai. Jai, however, was able to save the Chief Minister.  The Home Minister’s son, Arjun Singh, and his hired men attack Jai. Jai killed Arjun, but not before he was severely injured after getting stabbed by the Home Minister’s daughter, Kavita Singh Patil. A rickshaw driver and a former colleague, Arjun Kaul, together helped Jai get to the hospital. While Jai was at the hospital, the Home Minister spread rumors that Jai was responsible for trying to kill the Chief Minister. Once the Chief Minister recovered, he revealed that it was the Home Minister, not Jai, behind the attempted murder. A crowd beat the Home Minister after hearing the truth.  Doctors were able to save Jai. Jai had survived thanks to his own help-three-people concept. When Jai emerged from the hospital, he found thousands of people waiting for him. Jai thanked them all for making his concept a success.  
Jaatishwar
 In the present timeline, Rohit Mehta ([[Jisshu Sengupta]]), a [[Gujarat]]i born and brought up in [[Calcutta]], falls in love with Mahamaya ([[Swastika Mukherjee]]) and tries to woo her. Since he can just barely utter a few Bengali words (and that too in the wrong places), Mahamaya throws him a hurdle to cross - if he can write a song with correct Bengali lyrics and sing it without any accent or mistake, she would think of a possible relationship. Rohit accepts the challenge and goes to Portugal to study colonial history.  Two years pass. Mahamaya is now a radio jockey at a popular radio station. Rohit is in Portugal but still very much in love with her. His Bengali is being refined by his friend and classmate Bodhi ([[Abir Chatterjee]]). Rohit chooses the music course and decides to do a dissertation on the 19th Century folk poet Hensman Anthony([[Anthony Firingee]]). He goes to Calcutta and then to Farashdanga, Chandannagar, where Anthony lived and composed his songs. He goes to the local library to get some books where he meets the assistant librarian, a mysterious man named Kushal Hajra ([[Prosenjit Chatterjee]]), who claims to be the re-incarnation of Anthony himself. Kushal laments that the visions of his previous life is haunting him every day, and slowly taking over the memory of his present life. Rohit promises to take him to Calcutta for treatment, in return he demands the life history of Anthony.  The story then goes back to the 19th Century, where Anthony impresses the villagers with his musical talent. He saves a young Bengali widow, Soudamini, from performing ''sati'' and later marries her. But he yearns to learn the Bengali language and compose songs in that language. He learns it, reading Hindu scriptures and understanding the meaning of the folk compositions. In those days, ''kavigaan''s were very popular in Calcutta, where two ''kaviyaal''s or folk poets would face each other with their respective groups and compete with each other through songs and poems. Anthony was impressed by the ''kavigaan''s and decided to form a group on his own. He used to compose the songs himself, and on the first occasion met the woman ''kaviyaal'', Joggeshwari ([[Ananya Chatterjee]]), whom he defeats. Slowly, as he began to progress in his career as a ''kaviyaal'', he competed with noted ''kaviyaal''s of the time like Ram Basu ([[Neel Mukherjee (actor)|Sujan Mukherjee]]) and Thakur Singha ([[Biswajit Chakraborty]]).  Simultaneously, in the present timeline, Kushal is taken to a psychiatrist, where he is informed that to stop the visions, he must complete a work which he could not possibly do as Anthony. Kushal's visions get stronger and stronger. Rohit meanwhile has found a way to sing his latest Bengali composition in front of Mahamaya, whose radio company has decided to organize a competition among bands hailing both from West Bengal and Bangladesh, "Bandemonium". Bodhi, who meanwhile had come to Calcutta to meet Rohit, takes him to Sidhu (playing himself) to arrange musicians for Rohit's performance. Meanwhile, Mahamaya had also started developing feelings for Rohit.  Kushal reveals to Rohit the story of Anthony's last ''kavigaan''. Anthony had been planning to do a Durga-puja all by himself. But the villagers were against this, as, to them, Anthony is a ''firingee'' (foreigner) who had no right to perform a Hindu puja. He tells Soudamini that he is going to Calcutta for another ''kavigaan'', and so won't be staying during the days of the puja. As planned, he leaves for Calcutta on the day of the puja. This time, his competition is with the best ''kaviyaal'', Bhola Moira ([[Kharaj Mukherjee]]). The competition heightens and Anthony wins after a tough fight.  In the present timeline, the day of "Bandemonium" has arrived. Rohit goes on stage and performs his Bengali song ''E Tumi Kemon Tumi'' as Mahamaya looks on, tears in her eyes. Within the song, the film goes back to the 19th Century. After Anthony returned from Calcutta, victorious against Bhola Moira, he finds his house and his durga idol set on fire by the villagers. He finds Soudamini dead and nobody around. With his love killed and his faith shattered, he digs a grave for her, and then for himself (as he had once promised jokingly to his wife).  During the show, Bodhi brings Kushal to the auditorium to see the performance of Rohit. Kushal meets Mahamaya, and then leaves abruptly. After the performance, Rohit and Mahamaya profess their love for each other backstage. Rohit suddenly is informed that Kushal is missing. He, along with Mahamaya, goes to Kushal's house in Chandannagar, where they find him completely insane and lost in his visions. He attacks Rohit and then blabbers rubbish. Rohit, heartbroken, leaves with Mahamaya, realising that Kushal is beyond cure now. The film then ends with a final twist, revealing Mahamaya as the reincarnation of Soudamini, though she remembers nothing of her previous birth. Anthony had wanted to apologize to his wife for leaving her alone to get killed by the neighbours, which Kushal does after Mahamaya leaves with Rohit. The visions will not haunt him anymore. The film ends as Kabir Suman's song "''Jaatishwar''" plays in the background.  
Jacky in Women's Kingdom
 The film takes place in the fictional state of Bubunne (or Bubunia), a [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] [[totalitarism|totalitarian]] country led by the ruthless La Générale (Generaless). In Bubun, the roles of men and women are reversed, up to the point where the male population is deprived of any civil rights, including work, education, military service, freedom of marriage etc. People worship The White Horses (making horses sacred animals) and the only source of nourishment is "paste" (tasteless viscous liquid delivered from waterpipe-like sinks). The country is isolated from the rest of the world, borders are guarded by armed squads, and public executions are in order (the condemned being mostly men).  Jacky is an over-popular handsome young man, lives in poverty with his widow mother, crushs on La Colonelle (Coloness), the Generaless's daughter and the future leader of the state. Jacky is also one of the few boys with at least some education: his paternal uncle Julin (Michel Hazanavicius), [[gigolo]] and [[contraband]]ist, also a [[masculism]] revolutionist, teaches the nephew literacy. Jacky's maternal aunt, with two husbands, is quite rich and her two sons constantly bully Jacky for being so poor.  Generaless proclaims a grand ball, at which the Lead Rider (the current leader's husband) will be chosen for her daughter as she succeeds to become ruler of Bubun. Jacky's mother cannot afford a ticket to the ball, and Jacky desperately tries to make Julin give up the "treasure" left by Jacky's father. Jacky reports Julin to the police, yet unexpectedly authorities find Julin guilty of treason (printing illegal pamphlets) and incarcerate him for subsequent hanging. [[Sheriff]]ess, grateful to Jacky for informing her, leaves him a free ticket to the ball.  After Jacky's mother dies (ironically, due to Jacky's own actions; sleepless because of the ball preparations, he cleaned her boots so well that she slipped), his aunt takes him in, but refuses to let him come to the ball. At this point, Jacky flees the village, only to be caught by Sherifess and immediately rescued by Julin (who escaped imprisonment by "[[Sex|riding wardens until they were knocked out]]"). Together, they manage to get to the palace. While Julin intends to sell his stash of [[vegetables]] and get money for crossing the border, Jacky wants to get to the ceremony and confess his love to Coloness.  During the ball, Coloness invites Jacky (disguised as a female officer) to her quarters and tells him that she does not want to be the new Generaless, and tries to seduce him (believing Jacky to be a woman). The Generaless, however, interrupts them, as she has already chosen the Lead Rider for her daughter. Jacky's cover is blown when his relatives recognize him, and he finally tells the Coloness he loves her, revealing himself to be a man. When Generaless orders Jacky to be caught and killed, he ventures deeper into the palace, discovering that "paste" is actually processed and enriched [[feces]] (as the Generaless's adjutant puts it, "the poor eat their own shit and are happy"). To reveal the truth, Jacky overloads the main cauldron, making the country realize what their food is made of.  Hiding under the Coloness's bed, Jacky convinces her of his love and spends a night with her, stating that he will love her regardless of who she is. In the morning, she shows him a crowd of men outside the palace: the entire country believes Jacky to be a hero (not without Julin's provocation). Jacky is then captured and sentenced to death, yet Generaless offers him a deal: life and marriage to her daughter in exchange for his cooperation in preventing rebellion. When he agrees, she tries to cut off his tongue (stating that Jacky "has seen too much"), but is immediately strangled to death by Coloness.  Together, the two open the borders of Bubun, establish [[democracy]] and introduce [[emancipation]], as well as restore the country's [[agriculture]]. In the last scene, when Coloness and Jacky are about to officially marry, they announce that Bubunia wants "no more secrets from its people" and strip naked in front of the crowd, revealing that Coloness is actually a man, and that they, in fact, just entered [[gay marriage]] (since Generaless had no daughters despite years of trying, she wanted her last child to become the state leader despite being male). The film ends with a woman from the crowd yelling "[[Blasphemy]]!".  
Jaihind 2
 Jaihind is the journey of five people, linked by one man, who fights for children's rights to education. Parvathi ([[Yuvina Parthavi]]), from a very poor family background, gets an admission into one of the most affluent schools in the city, but unable to pay the exorbitant fees, the man of the house sells one of his kidneys. They still fall short of a big chunk of money and they finally give up and commit suicide. This disturbs Abhimanyu ([[Arjun Sarja]]) deeply, and the computer service engineer becomes a hero over night, by propagandizing a solution for education costing so much. Abhimanyu suggests that all private schools be nationalised, which will compel them to offer services at very little fees compared to that being collected now, while still ensuring that the quality of education is not compromised. This is bad news for the private school owners, who make a business  out of educating children. And hence Abhimanyu is targeted and pushed to extremes. He is put behind bars and is conspired to be murdered. How he succeeds in his mission, despite all this, forms the crux of the movie.

 In the 1880s, Danish Captain Gunnar Dinesen ([[Viggo Mortensen]]) is in [[Argentina]] with his teenage daughter Ingeborg (Viilbjørk Malling Agger) who asks him if she can have a dog--one that will follow her wherever she goes. Dinesen is propositioned by the rutting Lieutenant Pittaluga (Adrián Fondari) who asks him for permission to take Inge to a dance in exchange for one of his horses. In clumsy Spanish Dinesen refuses, stating that Inge is his daughter. When Dinesen warns Inge that Pittaluga is too fond of young girls and she should not go near him, she asks why she ever would.   Unbeknownst to her father, Inge is already involved with a young soldier named Corto. Corto tells Pittaluga and Dinesen about the rumors that Zuluaga, an officer who inexplicably disappeared into the desert, is leading a group of bandits and wearing a woman's dress. The men tell Corto to go into the desert and bring them something tangible as proof that Zuluaga is still alive.  During the night Inge and Corto run off together. Though Pittaluga offers to retrieve Inge, Dinesen insists on going alone. Heading out into the desert he eventually encounters a mortally wounded man whispering the name Zuluaga. He later finds the dying Corto, with his throat cut, and demands of him the whereabouts of his daughter. Laying aside his rifle and hat, Dinesen with revolver in hand goes to investigate a suspicious sound. While the distraught Dinesen investigates the area near the helpless Corto, his horse, hat, and rifle are stolen by one of the natives and Dinesen is forced to continue on foot through the inhospitable desert. Driven onward in the search for his daughter, he continues on in the direction the indigenous man went.  As Dinesen wanders through the desert, he sees a dog who leads him first to a toy soldier that Corto had given to Inge and then to a Danish-speaking elderly woman who lives in a cave. She tells him her husband died of a snake bite. Captain Dinesen tells the woman that he is looking for his daughter and, as the conversation unfolds, it is gradually revealed that the woman is his daughter. She tells him to come back whenever he likes and he wanders out into the desert again.   In the present day, a young girl (also played by Viilbjørk Malling Agger) wakes up in a mansion in Denmark and goes to see her dogs. She is distressed by the fact that one dog has been scratching his fur off and the hound-keeper tells her it is because he is nervous and perplexed by her long absences. The girl takes the dog for a walk in the woods around her home and finds a toy soldier on the ground. She picks it up, and then hearing a sound from her dog, she goes to look for him. Finding only ripples spreading on a pond  and no sign of the dog, Ingeborg casts the toy soldier into the pond.  
Jarhead 2: Field of Fire
  When his sergeant is killed in action against the Taliban, [[United States Marine Corps]] [[Corporal]] Chris Merrimette is given command of a squad and assigned a mission to resupply a forward operating base (FOB). The unit consists of Corporal Danny Kettner ([[Bokeem Woodbine]]), Lance Corporal Danielle 'Danni' Allen,  Private Rafael Soto, Private Justin Li and Private Khalid Hassan abu Faisal, an Afghan National Army soldier helping the unit navigate.  Kettner and Faisal clash verbally, and later physically when Faisal gets tired of waiting for a team of specialists to arrive and evaluate a suspected IED. Faisal manages to disable the IED, allowing the Marines' four-vehicle convoy to continue.  Not long after, the squad is flagged down by SEAL Team 10 Senior Chief John Fox. Because the Senior Chief is ranking officer, he orders Merrimette and his men to assist in his operation, which is to extract the 'package' – a woman named Anoosh – from the Taliban-controlled Helmand River Valley. Anoosh is sought by the Taliban for defying Sharia law by attaining an education.  As the team advances, they are ambushed. Pinned behind a rock, Soto freezes. Fox's SEAL Team 10 companion – and only other survivor of a previous ambush – and Pvt Li are killed trying to get to Soto. Chief Fox motivates the squad to continue with the new mission. The team is again confronted, this time by a Taliban sniper. Not wanting gunfire to call attention to more Taliban, Chief Fox and Merrimette move through the bush and ambush the Taliban sniper and his spotter. Fox stabs the sniper to death after a brief struggle; Merrimette overcomes the spotter and beats him to death with a rock.  More Taliban soldiers, this time in small pickup trucks, surprise the squad.  In the ensuing firefight, Chief Fox and all the Taliban are killed. As he lay dying, Fox orders Merrimette to complete the mission by extracting Anoosh; it turns out – unknown to Fox – that Anoosh is scheduled to make a speech at UN HQ in New York City the next day. Fox tells Merrimette to get Anoosh to his friend, a police captain in the nearby village of Minar.  The team, Khalid, and Anoosh reach Minar and meet up with the Police Captain. A suspicious person using a video camera apparently alerts the Taliban to the presence of the soldiers and their package. Soon well-armed insurgents arrive in trucks with mounted machine guns.  The Taliban attack the police building with rifles and an [[Rocket-propelled grenade|RPG]]; in the fighting Private Soto and the local policemen die. The remaining team is severely stunned and incapacitated by the RPG blast, insurgents enter, find Anoosh, and take her away in a truck, inexplicably leaving the rest of the Marines alive.  A recovering Merrimette vows to pursue Anoosh's captors and deliver her to the Marine base as Chief Fox ordered. Kettner questions the validity of sacrificing Marines for "this package," and becomes skeptical about the mission. Khalid steps in and persuades the team to continue on, by telling Anoosh's story – which she related to him earlier in the film, including that the Taliban executed her 13-year-old sister as punishment for Anoosh's out-of-country university education.  The team sneaks into the insurgent stronghold and silently kill many men. Eventually gunfire alerts the insurgents and their Taliban leader, who vows the Americans will not find Anoosh alive. Just as he is about to execute Anoosh with a blade, she screams out to alert the Marines to her location. Merrimette hears her screams, kills Anoosh's captors and rescues her.  As they are trying to make it to a truck to escape the camp, more insurgents arrive and attempt to corner the team. Kettner is wounded, but tells Merrimette to flee while he provides cover. Khalid stays with Kettner and the two of them keep the Taliban troops pinned down. Merrimette, Anoosh and Danni get to a small pickup truck, take out the insurgents and flee. Kettner and Khalid remain behind, keeping the insurgents at bay, but are both killed in a hail of gunfire.  Merrimette, Anoosh and Danni safely arrive at the Marine base, and Anoosh thanks Merrimette for his help. The commanding officer and XO arrive on scene, tell Merrimette and Danni well done, and drive off with Anoosh, who leaves for the UNHCR conference where she will deliver her speech on education rights in Afghanistan. Merrimette and Danni then walk together further into the base.  
Jeeya Jurir Xubax
 In a remote riverside a plaque was accidentally discovered from a burial. It reveals that something had happened to this person at the hands of the [[British Raj|British]]. The people assumed he was a [[Indian independence movement|freedom fighter]], hence a martyr and proper recognition should be given to him. The government declared to erect a statue in honour of the great martyr as an attempt to gain political advantage. But there was no reference, not even a photograph which can form the basis of the statue. The children of the martyr's family try to figure out their ancestor's face by looking through the hereditary characteristics that are passed onto genetically. They examine the faces of different generations to discover similarity and commonality to create the 'probable' person. But gradually they realized that a real man is found not in his appearance but in his works, so they try to discover and evaluate his deeds.  Meanwhile, the older people are busy in digging out orthodox [[Caste system in India|caste matters]], the youths are busy more in the celebration aspects and the government is busy in trying to score political issues. At last, the children thought that they have found the real man and give shape to their understanding in the form of a [[Play (theatre)|play]], through which people get a look into the past of a person, of the village, of the times.<ref></ref>  
Jalal's Story
 Just as Moses was found in the river Nile, an infant is rescued from a river, and adopted by Miraj, Karim and Sajib in turns over the years, only to be abandoned at the various stages of his life.

Jilla
 Sakthi ([[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]) is the adopted son of a [[Madurai]]-based [[crime boss|don]] Sivan ([[Mohanlal]]) and is also his right-hand man, bodyguard and driver. He hates the police due to a police officer killing his father, who was Sivan's driver, in his childhood. His hatred is such that he hates the [[khaki]] colour (which is worn by policemen in India), constantly teases his friend Gopal ([[Soori (actor)|Soori]]), who is a sub-inspector, and even loses romantic interest on a woman named Shanthi ([[Kajal Aggarwal]]) after he finds out that she is a police inspector. However, when Sivan is insulted by the new Police Commissioner of Madurai ([[Pradeep Rawat (actor)|Pradeep Rawat]]), he forces Sakthi to become an IPS officer to save his crime syndicate and prove the Commissioner's words wrong (A policeman can think like a criminal, but a criminal can never think like a policeman). Reluctantly taking charge as [[Assistant Commissioner of Police (India)|Assistant Commissioner of Police]] of Madurai city, Sakthi gives free rein to Sivan and his henchmen, who wreak havoc over Madurai, until one of their activities inadvertently causes a gas leak which destroys a school and some nearby buildings, killing several people, including women and children. This incident, along with the assault of a woman ([[Meenal]]), whose husband was killed in the gas leak, by Sivan's henchmen when she had come to the police station to lodge a complaint against Sivan, causes Sakthi to take up the path of an honest and upright police officer. Sakthi's new persona is not liked by Sivan and after a heated argument between the two, he disowns Sakthi. A cat-and-mouse game then begins between Sivan and Sakthi, with Sivan, his henchmen and his family determined to humiliate Sakthi at every opportunity, while Sakthi, assisted by Shanthi and Gopal, tries to rid Madurai of Sivan's influence. Sakthi is soon promoted to [[Superintendent of police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]] for his efforts.  Later, Sakthi finds out that Sivan's other adopted son, a minister Aadhi Kesavan ([[Sampath Raj]]) is plotting to kill Sivan in revenge for Sivan killing his police officer father (the same police officer who killed Sakthi's father) in his childhood. Since Sakthi had inadvertently thwarted his earlier plans to kill Sivan, he also plans to get Sakthi killed at the hands of Sivan by killing Sivan's son Vignesh ([[Mahat Raghavendra]]) and putting the blame on Sakthi for Vignesh's death. Unfortunately for Aadhi, Sivan sees through his plan and reconciles with Sakthi, both of whom team up to kill Aadhi.  In the end, Sakthi reluctantly arrests a reformed Sivan for his misdeeds, on Sivan's request.  
Jessabelle
 The pregnant Jessabelle "Jessie" Laurent ([[Sarah Snook]]) is about to move to her fiancé, Mark's ([[Brian Hallisay]]) house when their car is hit by a truck, killing Mark and causing Jessie's miscarriage. Two months afterward, Jessie, who now uses a wheelchair, moves in with her estranged father, Leon ([[David Andrews (actor)|David Andrews]]) in [[St. Francisville, Louisiana]]. She resides in her mother's former bedroom; her mother having died due to a [[brain tumor]] shortly after she was born.  One day, Jessie finds a box containing three videotapes shot by her mother. Kate ([[Joelle Carter]]), who addresses Jessie by her full name, congratulates her on her 18th birthday and gives a [[tarot reading]] about [[Death (Tarot card)|Death]] that tells of a transition, taught to her by Moses, a man whom she met at a local church. Kate warned that an unwanted presence is haunting Jessie, a reading that turns out to be true, as Jessie feels that a black-haired woman ([[Amber Stevens]]) is haunting her ever since she moved in. Jessie also has a dream where she is strapped to a bed by her mother and sees a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] ritual being conducted, where a man chokes her. Leon, who has repeatedly tried to dissuade Jessie from watching the tapes by breaking them and throwing Jessie's wheelchair, attempts to burn all of the tapes, but a force burns him alive inside the house's shed. During his funeral, Jessie reunites with her high school friend, Preston Sanders ([[Mark Webber (actor)|Mark Webber]]), but collapses after she sees a severely burned man (Vaughan Wilson).  After Preston leaves from tending to Jessie, Jessie discovers a fourth tape that she opts not to watch. The next day, Jessie and Preston head across a nearby [[bayou]], which Jessie has suspected ever since she saw glittering light and flames appearing there. The two discover voodoo icons and effects, as well as a grave of "Jessabelle" with a baby's skeleton, dated on Jessie's birthday, whom they give to Sheriff Pruitt ([[Chris Ellis (actor)|Chris Ellis]]) for DNA testing. Jessie and Preston then visit the house of Mrs. Davis ([[Fran Bennett]]), the mother of one of their friends, who speaks about Moses. Thinking that Moses is involved, the two head to Moses' voodoo shrine, but is attacked by a group of men who force them to leave. The two return to Jessie's home where Preston confesses that, despite being married, he is still in love with Jessie. Just before he leaves, the mysterious woman attacks and knocks him unconscious.  Left alone, Jessie watches the fourth tape, showing Kate shouting "Jessabelle, you're dead!" before it cuts off. Conducting a ritual to summon the woman, Jessie is informed by Pruitt that the baby is Kate's daughter, but not Leon's. The tape plays out again and shows Kate committing suicide, tearfully saying that Moses is dead. Jessie is confronted by Kate's spirit and realizes the truth: Jessabelle was the [[biracial]] daughter of Kate and Moses who was killed, alongside her father, by Leon; Jessie ''is'' the unwanted presence, being a child adopted to cover up the crimes. Swearing revenge, Kate and Moses planned to transfer Jessabelle's spirit to Jessie. Jessie is pushed by Kate and Moses towards the bayou, where Jessabelle swims up and takes her bracelet, resurfacing back in the form of Jessie, who kisses Preston after he saves her. When Pruitt asks "Jessie" if she is all right, she replies "It's Jessabelle".  
Jigarthanda
 Karthik Subramani ([[Siddharth (actor)|Siddharth]]) is a short-film maker and aspires to make a feature film. He participates in a talent search program (like ''Naalaya Iyakkunar'') and is in the semi-final round. The show’s two judges include a highbrow film director ([[Nassar]]) who trashes Karthik’s attempt at film-making and a profit-oriented producer ([[Aadukalam Naren]]) who riles against the director, and declares that Karthik made the best film among the contestants. Though the director eliminates Karthik from the contest, the producer offers to produce a film with Karthik as the director and both the judges storm out of the show. The next day, the producer is annoyed that Karthik took his words seriously and came to meet him. He is uninterested in the script that Karthik wants to film, and instead suggests that he wants to make a gangster film along the style of [[Nayakan]], [[Thalapathi]], [[The Godfather]] etc. Karthik takes this suggestion to heart and sets his mind on documenting the life of a gangster and making a film script out of it.  With help from his journalist uncle (Gajaraj), Karthik finds out about "Assault" Sethu ([[Bobby Simha]]), a ruthless gangster in the city of [[Madurai]], and decides that he will make a film about the life of Sethu. He travels to Madurai and enlists the help of a reluctant college friend Oorani ([[Karunakaran (actor)|Karunakaran]]) to conduct surveillance on Sethu and his men. Since Karthik and Oorani are afraid of approaching Sethu directly, they plot to develop contacts with two of Sethu’s top henchmen.  They also try to obtain information from an old shopkeeper ([[Sangili Murugan]]) who has been around since Sethu was a kid. To get closer to Sethu, Karthik also puts up an act of reciprocating the love of Kayalvizhi ([[Lakshmi Menon (actress)|Lakshmi Menon]]), whose mother ([[Ambika (actress)|Ambika]]) cooks for Sethu.  Because of their various attempts to seek information about Sethu, they arouse the suspicion of Rasu ([[Ramachandran Durairaj]]), Sethu’s right-hand man, who puts an underling, Sounder (Senthil Kumaran) to watch Karthik and Oorani. Sounder becomes good friends with Karthik, and Karthik uses his trust to plant a wireless microphone in a music player that he lends to Sounder. In a quick turn of events, Sounder is busted as a mole for an opposing gang and is killed.  Sethu finds out the tap placed in the music player that Sounder was carrying and quickly locates Karthik and Oorani. When about to die at the hands of Sethu, Karthik confesses that he was spying on Sethu so that he could make a movie about his life, along the lines of ''Nayakan'', ''Thalapathi'', '' The Godfather'', and etc.. Sethu is enamored by the prospect of his life being portrayed on the big screen and initiates Karthik and Oorani into his gang so that they can document his life. He and his gang members boast of their crimes and take Karthik along for their gang activities. Karthik gleefully documents everything and is ecstatic that he has a fantastic story in hand for his debut movie. When he is ready to leave Madurai with all the information that he ever needed, Kayal discovers that Karthik used her for information and is vengeful. Sethu invites him for a send-off party. During the partying, Kayal remarks that Sethu himself should act as the main character in the gangster film about his life. Sethu takes this seriously and threatens Karthik to direct the film with Sethu playing himself on screen. Distraught at the sudden turn of events, Karthik tries to flee out of Madurai but is caught by Sethu’s gang. They also kidnap the producer of Karthik’s film and force them both to make the gangster movie.  Karthik reluctantly agrees, but soon finds that Sethu and his men cannot act in front of a camera. He hires an acting coach Muthu ([[Guru Somasundaram]]), who sets up a rigorous teaching schedule for Sethu and his men. After a period of training, Muthu thinks that while the others are hopeless, Sethu has at least a sliver of acting talent. The production of the movie commences and Karthik becomes quite frustrated with Sethu’s acting ineptitude. Still, he perseveres with the movie and has Muthu coach Sethu in emotional crying scenes in between breaks. Finally, the production is wrapped. Sethu and his men are on cloud nine and create a great fanfare for the movie’s release. The film releases and during the first show, Sethu gets the shock of his life. Realizing that a serious gangster film featuring Sethu would be a disaster, Karthik had surreptitiously changed the story of the film into a comedy. He edits and dubs over Sethu’s voice in such a way that the film shows Sethu as a guy who achieves everything in life by crying. The film’s title ''A. Kumar'' is revealed to be ''Azhuguni (Crybaby) Kumar'' and not ''Assault Kumar'' as Sethu had thought. The film receives a tremendous response from the audience who left theaters in tears after laughing their guts out. Sethu is mad at being made a fool to the world and searches for Karthik. However, Karthik and the rest of the crew go into hiding in anticipation of Sethu’s wrath.  While searching for Karthik and his crew, Sethu encounters events that make him realize that the fear that people have for him does not equal respect. He finds that by making people laugh inadvertently through his film, he had earned true respect than respect by fear such as his mother, who never spoke to him, ever since he became a gangster and finally spoke to Sethu after seeing his film. In a final face-off, Sethu and Karthik meet each other by accident, he's on his way to deliver the video recordings of Sethu’s boastful confessions to the police. Sethu pardons Karthik in a dramatic way and Karthik chooses to put Sethu’s past behind him and let him seek a new life. They each go on to pursue careers in the movie industry. Karthik now has started to use Sethu's gang to bully people such as [[Vijay Sethupathi]] into acting for his movies, while Sethu started working as an actor by acting in a film made by [[Vetrimaaran]]. Sethu also has married Sounder's wife while Karthik married Kayalvizhi.  
Jersey Boys (film)
  In [[Belleville, New Jersey]] in 1951, [[Tommy DeVito (musician)|Tommy DeVito]] performs together with his brother Nicky, and their friend [[Nick Massi]], as [[The Variety Trio]]. He meets 16-year-old Frankie Castelluccio, a barber's son, already well known in the neighborhood for his singing voice. Frankie has the admiration of [[Genovese Family]] mobster [[Angelo DeCarlo|Angelo "Gyp" DeCarlo]], who takes a personal interest in him.  One night, the group attempts a robbery of a safe, resulting in the police later arresting them. In court, Frankie is let off with a warning, but Tommy is sentenced to six months in prison. After his release, Tommy reunites with the group, and adds Frankie as lead singer. Frankie changes his professional name to Frankie Vally, and then [[Frankie Valli]]. At a performance, Frankie is entranced by a woman named Mary Delgado. He takes her to dinner, and they are soon married.  The group, now called "The Four Lovers," is in need of a songwriter after Nicky leaves. Tommy's friend, [[Joe Pesci]], tells him about a talented singer-songwriter, [[Bob Gaudio]], and invites him to hear the group perform. Gaudio is impressed with Valli's vocals, and agrees to join.  The band, having recorded several demos, attempts to attract interest, but has little success. One day, in [[New York City]], producer [[Bob Crewe]] signs them to a contract. However, they quickly realize that it only allows them to perform back-up vocals for other acts. Crewe says that the group does not have a distinctive image or sound yet. Inspired by a bowling alley sign, the band is renamed "The Four Seasons," and they sing a new song Gaudio has written, "[[Sherry (song)|Sherry]]", to Crewe, who agrees to record it.  "Sherry" quickly becomes a commercial success, followed by two more, "[[Big Girls Don't Cry (The Four Seasons song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]" and "[[Walk Like a Man (The Four Seasons song)|Walk Like a Man]]". However, before an appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', Valli is approached by mobster Norman Waxman, a loan shark for one of the other [[Five Families]], who claims that Tommy owes him $150,000. Frankie goes to DeCarlo, who gets Waxman to allow the group to pay the debt, which turns out to be considerably larger. Tommy must go to work for the mob's associates in Las Vegas until it is paid. Nick, irritated by Tommy's irresponsibility, not being involved in the group's decisions, and never being able to see his family, also leaves the group.  Forced to tour constantly to pay the debt, the band hires a set of studio musicians, and becomes Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, with Gaudio now acting solely as songwriter and producer. Valli learns from his now ex-wife, Mary, that his daughter, Francine, now a drug addict, has escaped from home. Valli meets his estranged daughter and regrets not acting as a better father for her when she was growing up. He also arranges for Gaudio to offer her singing lessons and for Crewe to cut a demo for her.  A few years later, the group has finally paid off Tommy's debt. However, this coincides with the news of Francine's death by [[drug overdose]]. Frankie and Mary both grieve for their daughter. Gaudio composes a new number for Valli to sing, his first as a solo artist. At first, Frankie is hesitant, as he is still in mourning, but eventually agrees. The track, "[[Can't Take My Eyes Off You]]", becomes a commercial success.  In 1990, the Four Seasons are about to be inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. The band performs "[[Rag Doll (The Four Seasons song)|Rag Doll]]" onstage, their first performance together in over twenty years. The music fades as the four men take turns addressing the audience. Tommy, in an ironic twist, now works for Joe Pesci, who has gone on to become an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning actor. Nick claims to have no regrets about leaving the group, enjoying the time he spends with his family. Bob has retired to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Lastly, Frankie states that the best time he had during his time with the Four Seasons was before their success, "when everything was still ahead of us and it was just four guys singing under a street lamp."  
Jilmil Jonak
 ''Jilmil Jonak'' traces the life of a successful businessman based in [[Thailand]]. Aloof from his family for years, the story takes a twist when his past and family comes back to him. 
Jimmy's Hall
 In 1932, after ten years in the [[United States]], [[James Gralton|Jimmy Gralton]] returns to his native Ireland to help his mother run the family farm. A new government is in power in Ireland ten years after the end of the [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]]. To meet the needs of the young people of [[County Leitrim]], Jimmy, in spite of his reluctance to cause upset to his old enemies (the Church and the local landowners), decides to reopen the "Hall", a young people's centre, free and open to all, where the local young people meet to dance, study or talk. Success comes quickly, but the growing influence of Jimmy and his radical ideas are not to the taste of everyone in the village.  The film centres around political tensions between the Catholic church, the state and the republican movement to which Jimmy through his pre-emigration history is connected. Jimmy's political alignment is central to the film, he suffers for being a free-thinker and committed to the liberation of ordinary people through education and also by having experience from America of [[jazz]] (the rhythms and passions of "darkest Africa" are warned against in one church sermon warning of the perils of the "Hall"). Jimmy is aligned to communism by the communist support and encourage participation in the study and dancing that evolve as key activities at the "Hall".  The power and hypocrisy of the church is demonised in the film by aligning it to the beating by her father of a free spirited young girl who laughs at the priest while she is named and shamed for attending a dance at the Hall in a church service. The pious religion of Jimmy's mother is also contrasted against her love of learning and ability to explore popular non-religious literature, which has aligned her family to [[Communism]] for liberation of working people. It is clear throughout the film that Jimmy and his mother are not aligned to any struggle above and beyond the necessities of their local community; however, this does bring them into involvement with attempting to prevent an eviction of a family who are displaced from their home.  This eviction and the assertive reinstatement of the family along with Jimmy's support and oratory to those gathered at the reinstatement draw him to the attention of the [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]]. This starts a chain of events which ends in Jimmy's expulsion from Ireland based on the flimsy premise that he holds a US passport and that political agitators have previously been expelled from the country on such grounds. The lack of a fair trial is emphatically explained in the film by a speech given by Jimmy's mother at a rally surrounding the expulsion.  The behaviour of the state's police is shown and explained to be occurring at a time when [[Stalin]] was in full control of the [[Soviet Union]] and it is obvious that the state and church are fearful of forces that threaten to destroy them. It is this tension between the ideals of Christianity and the fear of the church and its natural tendency to be reactionary that is the central issue that the film explores.

He connects with the puppy and they spend their day driving around in his vintage 1969 [[Ford Mustang Mach 1]]. At a gas station, he encounters a trio of Russian gangsters whose leader, Iosef Tarasov, insists on buying his car, but John refuses to sell it. The mobsters follow John to his home that night, knock him unconscious, steal his car, and kill Daisy.  Iosef takes the Mustang to a [[chop shop]] run by Aurelio to have the [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] changed. Aurelio recognizes the car and, upon learning that Iosef stole it from John, punches him before throwing him out of his shop. John visits Aurelio, who tells him Iosef is the son of Viggo Tarasov, the head of the [[Russian mafia|Russian crime syndicate]] in [[New York City]]. Viggo, informed by Aurelio of Iosef's actions, beats and berates Iosef, explaining to him that John Wick was his best assassin, nicknamed "[[Baba Yaga]]". When John wanted to retire and marry Helen, Viggo gave him an "impossible task", implied to involve multiple assassinations. John succeeded, and his efforts were key in establishing the Tarasov syndicate.  Viggo tries to talk John out of seeking retribution, but John silently refuses. Viggo then sends a twelve-man hit squad to John's house, but John kills them all and has the bodies professionally removed. An unsurprised Viggo places a $2-million bounty on John's head and personally offers the [[contract killing|contract]] to John's mentor, Marcus. John seeks refuge at the Continental Hotel, which caters exclusively to the criminal underworld and permits no "business" on its premises. Viggo doubles the bounty for those willing to break the rules to kill John at the Continental.

John enters the Red Circle and kills his way to Iosef, but Viggo's henchman Kirill waylays John, allowing Iosef to escape. John retreats to the Continental to mend his injuries. Ms. Perkins, an assassin and former acquaintance, sneaks into John's room to kill him, but Marcus alerts John, allowing him to subdue Perkins. He forces Perkins to reveal the location of Viggo's [[front organization|front]], knocks her unconscious and leaves her with fellow assassin Harry to await punishment. However, Perkins frees herself and kills Harry.  John travels to the [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn|Little Russia]] church which serves as Viggo's front and destroys Viggo's cache of money and [[blackmail]] material. When Viggo and his team arrive, John ambushes them, but he is subdued and captured. Viggo taunts John for thinking he could leave his old life behind. Before John can be killed, Marcus intervenes again, allowing John to free himself, kill Kirill, and accost Viggo, who reveals Iosef's location. John then travels to Iosef's [[safe house]] and kills him.  Perkins sees that John and Marcus have been in contact and tells Viggo, who has Marcus beaten for information before executing him in his home. Viggo calls John to report this, planning to have Perkins ambush him. Perkins, however, is called to a meeting with Winston, who has her executed for breaking the Continental's rules.  Winston calls John to inform him that Viggo is planning to escape by helicopter. John races to the harbor helipad, where he kills Viggo's remaining henchmen before engaging Viggo in a fistfight on the dock. Viggo pulls a knife, but John allows himself to be stabbed, surprising Viggo. John then disarms and fatally wounds Viggo. Wounded himself, John stops at a waterfront animal clinic to treat his wound and takes with him a [[pit bull]] puppy which was scheduled to be [[animal euthanasia|euthanized]]. John and the dog walk home along the boardwalk where he had his last date with Helen.

Luthor awakes nearly 1,000 years into the future; he explores the museum, discovers Superman's secret identity and locates an ancient item called the Eternity Glass, which allows its user to manipulate the fabric of time and space. Taking Captain Cold's weapon, he freezes Dawnstar and Karate Kid. He then uses the Eternity Glass to unleash [[Time Trapper]] as his servant, allowing him to travel to the point when he last fought the League. Vengeful, Luthor plans to return and destroy Superman. The young heroes break free and follow.  Resuming control of the Legion, Luthor instructs Time Trapper to send his forces back in time to prevent the [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Kent family]] from adopting Kal-El in Smallville. The young heroes enlist the Justice League's aid to stop them, and travel to the [[Hall of Justice]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]   After a misunderstanding, they explain their story and verify its validity through Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth. The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg travel into the past to prevent Bizarro, Toyman, Cheetah and Solomon Grundy from sending the baby Kal-El back into space, while Superman and the rest of the League attempt to stall Luthor's Legion in the present.  Despite the Justice League's efforts, the Legion sends Kal-El's ship away from Earth. Without Superman, there is nobody left in the past to inspire individuals with extraordinary abilities to become superheroes. This causes a [[temporal paradox]], enabling Time Trapper to erase the Justice League in the present. Unwilling to risk being erased from existence, Dawnstar and Karate Kid retreat. In the absence of the Justice League, the Legion pillages the world, robbing banks and depositories, and leaving Washington D.C. in ruins. The young heroes realize that they can induce their own paradox by ensuring Lex Luthor's past counterpart never traveled to the 31st century so he could not steal the Eternity Glass and return to the past. The young heroes discover Luthor's confinement with Dawnstar's tracking ability, where Karate Kid breaks the ice and frees Luthor's earlier self. However, the Time Trapper is immune to the paradox because he exists outside the timeline, and with Luthor's counterpart freed, Time Trapper is  at liberty to do as he pleases because Luthor is no longer his master.   The Time Trapper banishes the future Luthor from existence and tries to remake the current world in his image. Superman and the Justice League, who exist again because of the latter's absence, confront the villain. Time Trapper is too powerful for the League to fight. Karate Kid discovers that Time Trapper is composed entirely of [[dark matter]]. Karate Kid realizes that only Dawnstar's light-based powers can defeat Time Trapper. Dawnstar charges Time Trapper and the League defeat him, reverting the Eternity Glass, which imprisons Time Trapper once more. The Justice League thanks the young heroes and offers them the opportunity to stay. Karate Kid and Dawnstar decline, stating they must return to their time. They use the Eternity Glass to return to the 31st century. Superman recovers Luthor and sends him to [[Blackgate Prison]]. [[Gorilla Grodd]] assumes control of the Legion of Doom. Returning to their own time, Karate Kid and Dawnstar discover that a statue of Luthor has replaced a statue of Superman. Believing they have altered history in some unforeseen fashion, they immediately return to the 21st century to help the Justice League once more.

Jongens
 Sieger is a fifteen-year-old boy, living with his widowed father, Theo, and his brother, Eddy, who, burdened with his mother's death, clashes with and acts out against his father. Along with his best friend (Stef), Sieger is a member of the local athletics team. They—and two other boys, Tom and Marc—are chosen to represent the team at the national championship relay race. In order to win, they must train intensively.   One day, they decide to go swimming in a nearby river. After Stef and Tom leave, Sieger and Marc share two kisses. Confused, Sieger insists that he isn't gay, to which Marc responds, "Of course you're not," before Sieger heads home. Despite the incident, the boys remain close friends. When Stef meets and begins dating a local girl named Kim, Sieger feels pressured to romance her best friend, Jessica, and suppress his feelings for Marc.   One weekend, the athletics team goes on a training trip. On the first night, Sieger sneaks out, and Marc follows him to the beach, where they spend the rest of the night kissing and resting in each other's arms. When they return home, Sieger, Jessica, Stef, and Kim attend a fair. Also at the fair, Marc sees them and wants to join up. However, afraid that the truth will come out, Sieger tries to ignore Marc. He manages to distract and appease Jessica by winning her a stuffed animal; and after, Jessica kisses Sieger, stirring in Marc feelings of confusion and pain.   Some days later, Sieger attempts to make up with Marc, and they agree to go swimming that evening. However, Theo and Eddy get into a fight after Theo learns Eddy was fired from his job a while ago and has been spending the time riding motorbikes with his friends. Theo locks up the motorbike.  Instead of going to the river, Sieger tries to convince his brother to come home. Eddy won't heed his pleas but offers him a ride in a car he's driving. On the way, they almost hit Marc while he's riding his bike. Marc gets the chance to ask Sieger why he did not turn up at their appointment, and Sieger, afraid to be caught speaking to Marc, does not answer him and walks off.  On the day of the relay race, Sieger offers Marc a simple "sorry" which Marc, waiting for an explanation that does not come, tells Sieger to go back to his "charade". Despite this, the team wins. Sieger, Eddy, Theo, and Stef celebrate with dinner at Sieger's house, where Theo gives Eddy back his motorbike. Stef reveals that he knows about Sieger and Marc, telling Sieger "that they make a good team". At dinner, Theo notices Sieger acting rather introverted and asks if he is okay. Sieger answers "no" and jumps on the motorbike, and drives away.  The final scene shows Sieger driving Eddy's motorbike with Marc on the back, embracing him. Perhaps to the beach, but as the words of the final song indicates, Sieger is on a journey of self-acceptance. They are finally together and appear to be happy.  
John Doe: Vigilante
 John Doe ([[Jamie Bamber]]) is an ordinary man who decides to take the law into his own hands due to frustration with a failing legal system after his wife and daughter was killed and the murderer not caught. John Doe then exacts his justice by killing one criminal at a time, filming the process and sending it to the media - gaining attention from the media in the process.  However, the mainstream media edited the films, showing only the "killing process" but not the reason.  John Doe then gave the films to a smaller media outfit who then showed the films in its entirety on the internet.  As expected, there are sections of the public who support what he did and there are those who questions what would he do once he had finished killing all criminals ? A movement supporting John Doe's actions ("Speak for the Dead") was started and started publicising John Doe's "victims" - repeated serial pimps, serial rapists, paedophiles - criminals who were arrested, sentenced and upon their release, re-commits the same offences again. An incident occurred at a night club where two bouncers threw a teenage boy out of the bar and assaulted the boy.  The boy died as a result of his injuries.  John Doe killed one of the bouncer with a home-made cyanide patch.  This inspired other copycat vigilantes <ref></ref>. Three teenage boys then decided to go after the other bouncer but it went horribly wrong with the bouncer killing all the three teenage boys.  But this incident resulted in the movement becoming more organised and the next scene showed a larger group of people wearing masks who attacked the bouncer with baseball bats. It transpired that one of the three teenage boys was a patient of John Doe.  The question arose whether John Doe had "influenced" the boys to carry out the actions on his behalf. The story ends with John Doe filming what he did with Adam, a serial criminal who killed his wife and daughter, who was 9 years old.  The whole incident was shown live with John Doe removing his mask halfway. He gave Adam an opportunity to convince him why he (Adam) should not be killed.   This indie film is unique in that it presents both sides of the story, one of them from John Doe who has already been caught and arrested (his motivation and objective), and another from the media and police, which many films dealing with vigilantes focus less on.  The typical questions regarding the "right" or "wrong" of the purpose of a vigilante is presented objectively. * [[Jamie Bamber]] as John Doe / Mr Jones. * [[Daniel Lissing]] as Jake * [[Lachy Hulme]] as Ken Rutherford, an investigative journalist whom John Doe requested to meet a day before the Jury makes its decision. * Ditch Davey as Detective Clint James * Sam Parsonson as Murray Wills * Paul O'Brien as Officer J.Callahan * Chloe Guymer as Chloe * Louise Crawford as Leah * Ben Schumann as Boy * Fletcher Humphrys as Henry Junig * Brooke Ryan as Mary * Gary Abrahams as Sam

The Judge (2014 film)
 Hank Palmer ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]) is a successful [[criminal defense lawyer|defense attorney]] in [[Chicago]] who has been estranged from his family in a small town in [[Indiana]] for some time. While in court, he receives a call telling him his mother has died. As he leaves to fly to his hometown of Carlinville, it is revealed that Hank is going through a divorce (due to his wife's infidelity) and custody battle for his young daughter.  In Carlinville, Hank reunites with his older brother Glen ([[Vincent D'Onofrio]]), owner of a tire shop, and his younger brother Dale ([[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]]), an [[autism|autistic]] aspiring filmmaker who carries an old [[8mm film]] camera everywhere he goes. Hank then stops by the small county courthouse, softly enters a courtroom, and sits in the back where he observes a case in progress. The judge is Joseph Palmer ([[Robert Duvall]]), Hank's father. When Joseph sees Hank for the first time in many years, at the funeral, he is treating guests with kindness but acknowledges his son coldly. Hank and his brothers go out to a bar and Hank starts making out with a teen bartender.  The next morning, Hank notices damage to his father's [[Cadillac Coupe DeVille]] as he is preparing to leave. Upon seeing the damage, Joseph denies knowing how it happened; but Hank believes his father was drinking and driving and damaged his own car. After a heated exchange, Hank leaves, promising never to return. But after boarding his plane, Hank learns that Joseph is being questioned by police with regard to a fatal [[hit and run]]. The victim is identified as Mark Blackwell ([[Mark Kiely]]), a recently released convicted murderer whose crimes, before the killing, Joseph had treated with leniency.  After Blackwell's blood is found on the car, Joseph is soon indicted, with prosecutor Dwight Dickham ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]) seeking a conviction for first-degree murder. Hank agrees to defend Joseph and learns that his father was undergoing [[chemotherapy]]. This explains Joseph's inability to remember the accident and provides a potential [[Diminished responsibility|diminished capacity]] defense, but Joseph rejects any such defense because of the potential damage it would do to his legacy. During the trial Hank and Joseph confront their bitterness with each other, dating back to a teenage drunk driving accident in which Hank was driving and Glen was injured – ending the latter's potential for a career in professional baseball. Joseph saw to it that Hank was sent to a [[youth detention center]], and Hank left Carlinville after never receiving acknowledgement from Joseph for turning his life around.  Hank also reconnects with his old girlfriend Sam ([[Vera Farmiga]]), whom he abandoned after going to a [[Metallica]] concert more than 20 years ago. He discovers that Sam has a daughter named Carla ([[Leighton Meester]]), born nine months after he left (and is the same girl from the bar) who is studying law at Georgetown and is on spring break. He struggles as he deals with his concern that he is Carla's father (although it is later revealed that Glen is the actual father).  At trial, Hank believes he has established enough [[reasonable doubt]] in the case to result in an [[acquittal]]. But Joseph sabotages the case by testifying that although he still cannot remember the accident, he has come to believe that he probably did kill Blackwell intentionally. Joseph confesses on the stand that he was personally haunted by Blackwell's case, having seen Hank in Blackwell, and wanting to help him like he would his son. Having misread Blackwell, Joseph afterward saw him in Hank.  Joseph is acquitted of murder but convicted of [[voluntary manslaughter]] and sentenced to four years in prison, though he is released on [[Compassionate release|compassionate parole]] after seven months (per Dickham's request), his cancer being terminal. He and Hank go fishing. After acknowledging Hank as the best lawyer he knows, Joseph dies peacefully in the boat. After Joseph's funeral, Hank makes amends with his brothers and then asks Sam for a date. Later Hank, having finally made peace with his father, returns to the empty courtroom Joseph once reigned over, and spins the judge's chair, where it ominously stops, pointed at him.  
The Journey (2014 Malaysian film)
 Uncle Chuan (Lee Sai Peng) is a conservative father with a rigid set of rules. When his daughter Bee (Joanne Yew) returns home after spending most of her formative years in England with her fiancée Benji (Ben Pfeiffer), Uncle Chuan refuses to give his blessing. With cultural differences and a language barrier that could potentially damage the union between Benji and his loved one, he feels that something must be done quick. Uncle Chuan reluctantly allows them to marry but on one condition — the wedding ceremony has to be in the traditional way.  Despite their lack of understanding towards one another, Benji and Uncle Chuan embark on a nationwide journey to hand-deliver wedding invitations to the latter’s childhood friends. Throughout the journey, the two learn valuable lessons about accepting each other’s differences.  
Ju-On: The Beginning of the End
 Continuing the trademark of the series, ''Beginning of the End'' is divided into eight segments presented in an [[anachronistic]] order, each titled after a character central to that segment. They are, in the following order: Yui (結衣), Nanami (七海), Kayako (伽椰子), Yayoi (弥生), Rina (莉奈), Aoi (葵), Naoto (直人), and Toshio (俊雄). The synopsis presents a rough chronology of the film's plot.  In 1995 [[Tokyo]], after a report of a possible child abuse happening in the Yamaga household, authorities and the schoolteacher of the family's son, Toshio, search the household and find Toshio dead in the bedroom closet.   Nine years later, a group of high school students: Nanami, Yayoi, Aoi, and Rina, visit the former Yamaga house, now taken for sale by Aoi's older sister. Nanami is shoved to enter due to rumors of the house being haunted. While the others find drawings depicting horrific deaths upon them and laugh, Nanami hears a noise and sees black liquid. She tries to escape but Toshio grabs her. Unaware, her friends leave. Yayoi is later dragged away by Toshio in the infirmary. Nanami and Aoi find Rina having gone insane since the house visit. Rina is then also taken by Toshio in the refrigerator. Aoi's brother-in-law, Kyosuke, is concerned that Aoi visited the house. In the bathroom, Toshio kills Aoi by ripping off her jaw and leaving it for her sister to find. Nanami is terrorized by her dead friends on a train before being dragged away and killed offscreen. Meanwhile, Aoi's sister sells the house to a couple named [[Takeo Saeki|Takeo]] and [[Kayako Saeki]].  Ten years later, an elementary schoolteacher, Yui Shono, is assigned to replace Mr. Konishi as homeroom teacher. She is concerned when she finds that a student, [[Toshio Saeki]], has been absent for a week and decides to visit the Saeki household. She meets Toshio's mother, Kayako, who acts strangely, and finds the bedroom closet sealed with tape. Yui is disturbed by Kayako's behavior and hastily leaves. She is informed the next day that Mr. Konishi has died. She has hallucinations of Toshio, and finds Kayako's diary. Her boyfriend, Naoto Miyakoshi, reads the diary, which reveals that Kayako, who could not have a child with Takeo, became pregnant when a boy in white "touched" her in a dream. He meets with the widowed Kyosuke, who inquires about the curse that claimed the lives of his wife and their sister, and finds out that Toshio Yamaga and Toshio Saeki are the same. Naoto is later killed by Kayako when Kayako snapped his neck clockwise.  Yui, having recovered, visits the Saeki household to seek vengeance and opens the closet, discovering a box of tapes that show the Saeki family's lives. One tape reveals that Kayako did indeed get pregnant not by Takeo, but by the spirit of Toshio Yamaga. Yui experiences flashbacks of Takeo murdering Kayako and Toshio after he found out he was not Toshio's father. She finds Kayako's body, who crawls towards her, and is then cornered by both Kayako and Toshio. Suddenly, she wakes up at her apartment. Thinking everything was a dream, she goes outside, only to find Naoto, his head snapped, walking towards her. Yui's fate was left unknown.  
Joy Ride 3: Roadkill
  Rob and Candy are holed up in a motel room, using methamphetamine and having sex. When they run out of drugs, Rob convinces Candy to use the CB to lure a trucker to their room, so they can rob him. Rusty Nail responds to Candy's summons. When Rob answers the door, Rusty realizes he's been tricked and takes the pair captive. Rob and Candy are chained to each other and the axle of Rusty Nail's truck. He takes them to a deserted stretch of Highway 17 and tells them he will let them go if they can hang onto the hood of the truck for a mile.  If one of them falls, the other will be pulled off the truck by the chain, and both will die under the truck.  He tapes a bag of meth to the windshield of his truck, telling them they can have the drugs after they make it.  After riding awhile, Rob calls out that they have ridden for at least a mile, and Rusty Nail agrees.  Thinking they have made it, Candy reaches for the bag of drugs; her chain is pulled into the axle, and she and Rob are both pulled underneath the still-moving truck and killed. Later, the authorities are called to the scene; Officer Williams, a newly appointed deputy, wants to investigate further, but is encouraged by Officer Jenkins to make it an open-and-shut case.   Racecar drivers Jordon and Austin, along with their team -- Jewel (manager and Jordon's girlfriend), Mickey (mechanic and pit crew chief), Alisa (PR), and Bobby (groupie) -- are caravanning from Kansas to Canada so that they can compete in the Road Rally 1000; they have an SUV with a flatbed trailer for the racecar, and walkie-talkies to communicate from car to car. When they stop at Headingley Grill for lunch, Austin finds Highway 17 on a map; he discovers that it would shorten their journey by a day and give them more time to get the lay of the land. When they ask a creepy truck driver, Barry, for directions, he warns them against taking 17; he tells them it's called "Slaughter Alley" (which the cops at the scene of Rob and Candy's deaths also claimed), and tells them the story of Rusty Nail, who has become something of an urban legend. Jenkins stops in for a cup of coffee and denies Barry's claims, encouraging them to take 17. Barry tells them that stretch of highway is unpatrolled, which appeals to Austin, who wants to be able to test the limits of their car on open road, so they agree to go that way.  Austin drives the racecar and Jordon, Jewel, and Alisa ride along. They tease Austin about a wreck he had previously gotten in. This is clearly a sore subject for Austin, who vents his frustration by messing with a truck driver (who just happens to be Rusty Nail) and then speeding off. Jordon makes Austin pull over and takes the driver's seat; just as they catch up to Mickey and Bobby in the SUV, Rusty Nail catches up to the group and starts laying on his horn. When Jordon tries to let him pass, he boxes them in, switching lanes so neither car can get around him. Jordon gets around, but as Mickey tries to pass, Rusty rams the flatbed trailer, causing it to detach from the SUV and run off the road. He then tailgates Jordon, who dodges to get out of the way of an oncoming station wagon; when Rusty tries to do the same, he jackknifes. Jewel and Alisa try to convince Jordon to stop, but he refuses, worried a mark on his record will cost them the race. Rusty checks a camera he has mounted to the front of the truck, identifying Jordon's license number, and then uses the CB to hail them; he has found their website and now knows exactly who they all are, threatening to make them pay for what they did. Jordon disregards his threats, and the team continues on.   Night falls, and the group stops at a gas station. Everyone is at odds over how to proceed. After Jewel fights with Jordon, she and Austin leave in the SUV to go to the police, as the others continue on in the racecar. Rusty Nail catches up to Jewel and Austin and tries to run them off the road; they desperately try to call Jordon for help on the walkie-talkie, which doesn't work on Jordon's end (as Barry warned them might happen). Rusty runs them off the road and puts their unconscious bodies in the back of his truck. Just then, the gang in the racecar gets their signals back and worry when they can't reach Jewel and Austin.   Rusty takes Jewel and Austin to a deserted field and then kills Austin by putting his hands and then face through the engine fan of his truck. He then calls Jordon on the walkie-talkie, telling him he'll trade Jewel and Austin for the racecar. Rusty instructs Jordon to come to an old warehouse in an hour; Jordon and the others devise a plan to ensure that Rusty Nail will not double cross them, as Rusty torments Jewel. Meanwhile, Officer Williams finds the wrecked and abandoned SUV.   Jordon, Mickey, Alisa and Bobby arrive at the warehouse and split up; Alisa stays with the car, Bobby and Mickey go around the perimeter, and Jordon heads inside. After a tense search of the warehouse, during which Rusty kidnaps Bobby, Rusty flees in the truck. Jordon, Mickey, and Alisa follow in the racecar. When they come across a police cruiser, they pull over to find Jenkins; after convincing him of their story with a photo Rusty sent of Jules, he agrees to help them catch up to Rusty Nail. However, Rusty comes out of nowhere and obliterates Jenkins and his cruiser; Jordon, Mickey, and Alisa give chase. Meanwhile, Officer Williams encounters a truck weaving recklessly, and flags it down; however, it's a driver for a meat packing plant on a rush to deliver his cargo. When Williams searches the cargo, he finds parts of Austin's body; the driver claims he picked up a "rogue load" from a fellow trucker who needed help, but Williams subdues him and tries to hail Jenkins on the CB. He then tells dispatch he's bringing the meat truck driver in. Later he finds the burning wreckage of Jenkins' cruiser.   Rusty contacts Jordon, and kills Bobby as the group listens helplessly over the walkie-talkie. Rusty then tells Jordon to meet him at a junkyard and give himself up; only then will he set Jewel and Austin free. Mickey wants to go get help instead, and forces Jordon off the road; he tries to convince Alisa to come with him, but she refuses and leaves with Jordon to go save their friends. Mickey goes for help on foot; he finds the truck parked on a side road, and is overpowered by Rusty Nail. Rusty crushes Mickey's head in a wench, then lights the semi-trailer of his truck on fire, driving off in just the tractor unit.   Jordon sends Alisa to go get help and enters the junkyard alone. Jewel's screams draw him into the final showdown with Rusty Nail. The two fight, as Rusty indicates Jewel is trapped in a dangling car about to be crushed. Just as it seems Rusty has the upper hand, Alisa runs him over with the racecar, and she and Jordon go to rescue Jewel from the crusher. However, Jordon finds the video camera in the trunk of the crushed car; it is playing previously shot footage of Jewel. It's revealed that Rusty Nail tied her to the roof of the truck and ran her into the girders of a steel bridge, killing her.   Enraged, Jordon and Alisa get in the car to go find Rusty Nail, but he rams into them, trying to crush them. Alisa's leg is stuck, keeping her from getting out. Jordon runs to a nearby wrecking claw and uses it to put Rusty's truck in the crusher, with Rusty inside. Later, however, when Williams and his men investigate, Rusty Nail is nowhere to be found. The film ends with Rusty Nail hitching a ride with another truck driver.  
The Judgment (2014 film)
 The film takes place in Bulgaria by the [[Rhodope Mountains]], near the Turkish border. A widower, Mityo, needs money to forestall foreclosure on his home. He drives a milk tanker but business is slow, so he reluctantly accepts a job smuggling migrants over the border into Bulgaria. (A character in the film describes the migrants as "Gypsies, Arabs, and blacks"; many of them are presumably [[Refugees of the Syrian Civil War]].<ref></ref>) The work reminds Mityo of his military service in the late 1980s, assigned to the Bulgarian border guard, where his task was to prevent citizens from ''leaving'' the [[Eastern Bloc]].  
Journey to Dinosaur Island
  Lucas, a 13-year-old boy, visits his grandmother's old house which is now set 'for sale'. There, while exploring bookshelf, he finds a crystal enclosed in a box. Amused he takes it with him. The adventure begins when, in his plane, he moves the crystal onto the next empty seat and it shines. A disaster strikes the plane and Lucas finds himself stranded in a strange land littered with ghost ships and prehistoric creatures. While searching for other signs of life, Lucas hears a radio broadcast in the distance and is drawn into the jungle, where he encounters a beautiful young girl Kate, who claims to have come from the 1950s. He learns from her that Kate also used to possess a similar crystal like the one with Lucas. She gives him her diary which she denotes as ‘Survival Guide’ for Lucas. He also meets a ''[[Sinornithosaurus]]'' whom Kate named ''Mimos''. Mimos was able to imitate any sound he listened. At a minor [[earthquake]], Lucas learns that mists arrives with earthquakes and bring airplanes, like the one in which Lucas arrived, from different time including past and even future. The airplanes are always empty but bring many useful things. When another airplane arrives, Lucas and Kate leave to explore it. At the same moment, some tribal people attack the plane and capture the duo. On their way they face gigantic [[Pitcher plant|Pitcher Plants]]([[Nepenthes]]) and [[Venus flytrap|Venus Flytraps]] . On reaching the village, they are put into a pyramid-shaped wooden jail. There, Lucas meets another prisoner who when sees the crystal in Lucas’s hand, gets surprised and call it a ‘sing sing stone’. He whistles and because of it, a mist forms over the crystal. This mist brings things from time. He says that these stone are present in larger form between the twin volcanoes and they are responsible for forming the mist and bringing planes on that island. Lucas concludes that it is a massive [[Piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] [[crystal cluster]] which attains its resonant frequency due to seismic activities and creates the [[portals in fiction|portal]] which can also help him to get back home. He and Kate, together escape through an opening at the top. Kate frees some large [[pterosaurs]], one of which gives them a ride towards the volcano twins although they have a bad landing. When a ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' chases them, Mimos imitates the roar and scare him away. Again some [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurs]] chase after them but they make their way to the middle of the volcanic twins.  Upon reaching the destination, Lucas uses a jar and fills it with water. He creates the sound required to energise the crystals. Suddenly, one of the dromaeosaurs enters and catches Mimos. However they manage to beat him but lose their jar. Mimos suddenly wakes up, imitates the jar singing and fly away. The crystals start creating the portal. But Kate says that she won’t go back without her diary, which was lying in a stone cavity. She insists that without proof the world won’t believe her and Lucas must go into the portal as she will be right behind him. Lucas proceeds.  He wakes up in a hospital, and hears the news about the mysterious island. Soon he meets his grandma, Kathryn, who says she prefers Kate as Kathryn is so old fashioned. It is revealed that she is actually Kate whom Lucas met at the island. With the proofs of her diary, she receives [[Nobel Prize|Noble Prize]] Award for Science and the film ends.

Justice League: War
   A series of abductions have occurred in [[Gotham City]]; [[Batman]] is implicated due to video footage. [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] stops a kidnapping before attacking the kidnapper, a monstrous [[Parademon]], and is almost defeated when Batman appears. The Parademon attacks them both; Batman and Green Lantern chase it into the sewers, where it charges a [[Mother Box]] and explodes. They examine the box, deduce it is of extraterrestrial origin, and decide to ask [[Superman]] for an answer. Another Mother Box, supplied by [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] is being studied at [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] by [[Silas Stone]], father of [[Cyborg (comics)|Victor Stone]].  Superman, who fought with a Parademon previously and believes Batman and Green Lantern are working with it, fights with them; the two are hopelessly outmatched, with the battle only stopping when Batman calls him "Clark" and Superman discovers Batman is Bruce Wayne. The trio begin to work together against the Parademons. On the planet [[Apokolips]], [[Darkseid]] orders [[Desaad]] to begin an invasion of Earth in response to the superheroes' discovery of his plans. Victor and Silas argue over Silas' belief that [[metahuman]]s are more important than football. Superman, Batman and Green Lantern realize an invasion has begun when the box activates and several [[Boom Tube]]s appear throughout the world.  The Box in S.T.A.R. Labs explodes and creates a Boom Tube when Victor is holding it. The explosion fuses the technology inside the Box to Victor's wounded, mutilated body. As several Parademons attack, Silas takes Victor to a technologically advanced medical bed and uses experimental technologies on him. Countless Parademons appear and attack around the world. The Box's technology spliced with Victor's body fuses itself with the various technologies around the room. Victor is transformed into Cyborg, with a body capable of transforming and adapting itself, including obtaining new features. Just as the Flash saves the scientists, Cyborg discovers details of Apokolips, Darkseid, and the invasion plan. He learns that the Parademons are actually inhabitants of world conquered by Darkseid, spliced with his technology, allowing him to mind-control them into serving as an army for conquering other planets. Billy Batson sees a Parademon outside and mystically turns into the superhero [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Shazam]]. [[Air Force One]] is attacked in the air, but is saved by the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]] princess [[Wonder Woman]] and Superman. After the heroes gather, Cyborg reveals that the invasion is a prelude to the [[Terraforming|terraform]]ing of Earth. Darkseid arrives and proves to be a powerful opponent.  Darkseid uses his Omega Beams to fight Flash and Superman, who is incapacitated and captured by a Parademon. Batman prevents Green Lantern from going after them on his own with a broken arm. He tells Green Lantern to think about the lives at stake rather than his own image as a hero, and after unmasking himself, reveals that his parents' murders are what motivated him to fight evil. Bruce allows himself to be captured to save Superman. Green Lantern decides to strip Darkseid of his Omega Beams by destroying his eyes. Bruce goes through a portal to Apokolips, where he escapes the Parademon and stops Desaad from turning Superman into a Parademon. Superman is left unstable and highly aggressive because of the brainwashing process, resulting in him strangling Desaad to death and attacking Parademons and Batman. Batman reasons with him, and helps him reassert his own personality. On Earth, after Darkseid's eyes are destroyed, Cyborg reopens the Boom Tubes to send Darkseid and his army back to Apokolips. Darkseid fights back, and with Superman and Batman's assistance, the group eventually force him through the portal.

Kaaka Muttai
 In a tiny concrete-and-tin [[Chennai]] home in the slums live two young brothers with their mother and grandmother. With the boys' father in prison for unknown reasons and with an ageing mother-in-law, the mother does her best to keep the kitchen fires burning. The brothers spend their time playing games and stealing and devouring eggs from crows' nests. Their love for these eggs leads them to start calling themselves "Periya Kaaka Muttai" ( Big Crow Egg) and "Chinna Kaaka Muttai" (Small Crow Egg).  The young boys constantly beg their mother and grandmother for toys they cannot afford, and later for a television. They don't yet understand that the two women can't give them everything they want. When their mother and grandmother finally do bring home a television&nbsp;– a gift from the government to ration card holders who live below the poverty line&nbsp;– it's like the opening of a portal. The boys see a [[pizza]] commercial on TV whose steaming, slow-motion images make the unfamiliar food look like manna from heaven. Meanwhile, a brand new pizzeria comes up in the neighbourhood, and actor [[Silambarasan]] alias Simbu comes to its opening. Remembering the looks of enjoyment on Simbu's face when he tasted a pizza at the pizzeria, the boys thereafter think of nothing else but getting their first taste of a pizza.  The brothers go to the railway tracks each morning to collect the charcoal that falls off goods trains. They sell the charcoal at a scrap metal shop and are paid for their trouble. They usually hand the money over to their mother who is saving up to pay their lawyer to get her husband out of jail. But once the boys become aware of the cost of a pizza, they begin saving the money for themselves instead, lying to their mother that they have not collected any charcoal since they were out playing.  The boys succeed in saving the ₹ 300 required to buy a pizza, but are shooed away by the watchman of the pizza shop since they are badly dressed, which reflects the fact that they are local slum-dwellers. The boys narrate this story to their friend Pazharasam who works as a lineman with the Railways. He tells them that people place a lot of importance on clothes and advises them to save up and purchase new dresses before approaching the pizza outlet again.  The boys go on to work again to save money for buying new clothes at [[Chennai Citi Centre]]. In the meantime, they show their grandmother the pamphlet from the pizza shop. She tries to make them a home-cooked pizza using [[dosa]] batter as base, but the boys deride her attempts and insult her.  After finally saving up enough money for new dresses when the boys see Citi Centre, they realise that it is another big mall which would definitely not allow them inside. But they somehow manage to acquire a newly bought pair of clothes from a couple of rich children by buying them [[panipuri]] from a street vendor, much against the wishes of the rich boys' father, who had denied them the treat as he considered it unhygienic.  The happy brothers return to the pizza shop in their new dresses. Another group of slum boys who are envious and sceptical about the brothers' story about going to eat pizza follows them to take a video of what transpires with the brothers at the pizza shop. The brothers are once again confronted by the watchman and he now forces them to go home right away but the boys protest by saying that they have money and are wearing new clothes. This argument attracts the attention of the pizzeria supervisor who comes out and slaps the older brother. This is caught on video by the other slum kids who laugh at the brothers' humiliation.  The sad and disappointed brothers return to their slum only to be further overwhelmed by the miserable sight of their dead grandmother. The brothers feel guilty when they remember insulting their grandmother some time before.  When two men in the slum happen to watch the video of the boy being slapped, they try to make money by threatening the owner of the pizza shop to release the video to the media. The owner realises he could be imprisoned and his pizzeria sealed by the government due to his supervisor's act of discrimination and violence against slum children. He offers one of the men a hundred thousand rupees for not making the video public. The man agrees, but his associate releases it to the media hoping to make some money (unaware of the huge sum being offered). This stirs up tension amongst the pizzeria's owners who finally decide to publicly apologise to the slum kids.  The boys are welcomed to the pizza spot in a red carpet reminiscent of Simbu being welcomed in the opening ceremony of the pizzeria. The owner also promises them free pizzas for life. Even as the brothers begin to finally enjoy their first pizza, they tell each other that the dosa-pizza which their grandmother had earlier made for them had tasted much better.  
Just Another Margin
 This movie takes place in an unspecified time period of China, but it is one where the famous heroes of [[Liangshan Marsh]], the 108 Bandits, are currently active. A strange girl named Xu Jin Ling ([[Betty Sun]]) possessing a powerful [[yueqin]], which doubles as a weapon for self-defense, offends the prominent businessman, Mr. Zhao ([[Guo Degang]]), by humiliating his niece using said musical instrument. As punishment for this act of insolence, Mr. Zhao arranges the marriage between Jin Ling and their home village's ugliest resident, Mao Dai Long ([[Suet Lam]]). However, Mr. Zhao's lecherous and conniving cousin, Shi Wen Sheng ([[Ronald Cheng]]), takes notice of the beautiful girl, and plots with Mr. Zhao to be rid of Mao Dai Long so that Jin Ling will become Wen Sheng's wife. An unexpected turn of events occur, however, because when Dai Long introduces Jin Ling to his little stepbrother, Mao Song ([[Cheng Yee Kin]]), they immediately recognize each other, as they have met each other a long time ago when they were but children. Another series of unexpected events start happening in this seemingly uneventful village, as when Mao Song is helpless to save Dai Long from the crime he was framed by Wen Sheng for and is unable to save Jin Ling from becoming Wen Sheng's wife, he runs into two oddly dressed men, to whom the audience is introduced to as two space aliens named Tranzor and Shakespeare of Planet B16, but introduce themselves to the destitute and somewhat suicidal man as two immortal fairies who will help him address his grievances. For the moment, it seemed as if everything was going the way Mao Song wanted, but things then take a turn for the worse when Jin Ling runs away from home since she refuses adamantly to acknowledge the hideous-looking Dai Long as her husband, though Dai Long didn't really care about that, Mr. Zhao and Wen Sheng hire the 108 Bandits, who are portrayed in this movie not as valiant heroes, but as money-grubbing mercenaries, to kill Jin Ling, and an alien martial artist ([[Hu Ge]]) who has been living undercover among humanity for decades and serves a powerful warlord of Planet B16 named the Black Emperor, is finally activated and deployed to assassinate Mao Song, for Mao Song is, in reality, a B16 Alien who's the legitimate heir to the leadership of B16, but was abandoned on Earth by his family under the guise of a human child so that the Black Emperor won't be able to find him.  A great chase occurs with the 108 Bandits being the pursuers and Mao Song and Jin Ling, whose face was horrendously scarred by an acid spray from one of the Bandits, being the quarry. They manage to elude the mercenaries, but Jin Ling attempts to commit suicide by falling off a cliff, as she was unwilling to be married to Mao Song now that her face was rendered hideous, and she was on tenterhooks that Mao Song would have to endure humiliation and being the back end of nasty comments and jokes for marrying such an ugly girl. Mao Song jumped into the dark abyss after her, intending to die alongside her, and it was in this moment that his identity as the leader of Planet B16 had been realized, and when they were seconds away from hitting the bottom, Mao Song sprouted wings of light from his back, flew back up the cliff, and healed Jin Ling's face in the meantime, making her face beautiful again. In this scene, everybody, except for Tranzor and Shakespeare who are drunk at a brothel, shows up; Mr. Zhao and Wen Sheng show up, hidden in the forest behind the cliff's edge, the 108 Bandits stand by the cliff's edge, staring in awe and wonder at the space ship that was rising out of the ground behind Mao Song and Jin Ling, Mao Dai Long appears, following the yueqin that transformed into a hovering robot probe, and the alien assassin, who was disguised as a female school teacher, shows up to kill Mao Song. A duel takes place at the bottom of the cliff, with the alien assassin and Mao Song seeming equally matched, but Mao Song at the last moment turned the tide of the battle in his favor by borrowing the strengths and fighting skills of all the 108 Bandits. After defeating this foe, Mao Song flies back up to the ship where he weds his beloved and offers the 108 Bandits new homes and jobs on Planet B16. Mao Dai Long remains in China with two pretty B16 girls to be his wives after they altered his appearance to make him handsome, and Mr. Zhao and Wen Sheng lament on their mistakes.  At the very end of the movie, the people of the village are seen everywhere lighting incense sticks in honor of a jade Buddha statue they erected some time after witnessing the B16 space ship rising from the ground, which bore a strong resemblance to the Buddha when they saw it from a distance.

He also realizes that the word Inves and Helheim are unknown meanings in this world. Kouta also runs into the young boy from earlier who reveals that his name is Lapis. However, when Kouta tries to ask more questions, Lapis disappears in thin air. Mitsuzane discovers that his brother is alive and has a wife, causing Mitsuzane to remember the discrepancies in front of him with memories of his time in the original world.

At Team Baron's loft, Peko, who envied both Kaito and Zack, starts to ramble about wanting the Golden Fruit before transforming into Kurokage Shin with a Genesis Driver to attack Zack. Kaito intervenes, but Peko is mysteriously enveloped in what appears to be Helheim vines and is reduced to nothing with his Matsubokkuri Energy Armor Part retracting back into the Matsubokkuri Energy Lockseed.

Lapis, watching from afar is confronted by Mitsuzane, however Sagara appears before them explaining what is happening and how Kouta is in danger.  Kouta at the outskirts of where Zawame City was unaffected is confronted by Yuya, who asks why Kouta isn't yearning for the Golden Fruit like the other Armored Riders. Mai follows Kouta, but Kouta stops Mai from going to Yuya's side by revealing that Yuya isn't really Yuya. Kouta reveals that he found it weird how he was Gaim in this world if Yuya was always the original intended user for Kouta's Sengoku Driver. Yuya stated that Kouta was the best choice. Kouta asks Yuya why does he have a Lockseed if the Lockseed's purpose is to be used alongside a Driver. Yuya then says he needs it to protect himself from Inves. Kouta, now confirming his theory tells Mai that this man isn't Yuya. Yuya turns into Kougane and calls himself the "God of the New Generation" using the Golden Ringo Lockseed to transform into Armored Rider Mars before attacking Kouta.

Kouta is enveloped by the Helheim vines with Kougane being angered that Kouta wasn't fully consumed.  Mai runs around the wreckage of the now destroyed Zawame to find Kouta. She becomes relieved when she sees him, but Mitsuzane tells Mai that Kouta has already fallen. Transforming into Ryugen against Kouta's "Black Jimber Lemon Arms", he is easily defeated. Mai notices Lapis and the two are confronted by Kouta. However, Yoko Minato and Kaito appear to join the fight, but the two are easily defeated by both Kouta and Kougane. Lapis reveals to Mai that his real name is Shamubishe and he is what they call an "Over Lord". Lapis enters Kouta's mind revealing to him that they're not so different, that they had the same goals while showing him his memories of Demushu, Redyue, and Rosyuo. Lapis reveals to Kouta that he's not in Zawame, but rather a world that he created that is like a dream - it's not connected to Zawame and that the Helheim threat is still real and active.

Kaththi
  In [[Kolkata]], prisoner Kathiresan "Kathir" ([[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]), a petty criminal, helps the police capture an escaping prisoner Vivek Banerjee ([[Tota Roy Chowdhury]]), but he himself escapes afterwards. He goes to [[Chennai]] and decides to escape to [[Bangkok]] with his friend and fellow-criminal Ravi ([[Sathish]]). However, he drops this plan after meeting and falling in love with Ankitha ([[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]]) at the airport, who dupes him into believing that she wants to marry him after realising that he is having a crush on her. Later, Kathiresan and Ravi notice a [[doppelgänger]] of Kathiresan named Jeevanandam "Jeeva" (also Vijay), being shot by a group of thugs. They admit him to a hospital, following which Kathiresan decides to impersonate the injured Jeevanandam to escape from the police. Under the name of his doppelgänger, Kathiresan and Ravi enter an [[Retirement home|old-age home]] run by Jeevanandam with the aim of collecting 25 [[lakh]]s (which is meant for the inmates of the old-age home) for their Bangkok trip, until he learns about his doppelgänger's mission. Jeevanandam is a [[communism|communist]] ideologue and a post-graduate in [[hydrology]] from the arid village of Thanoothu in [[Tirunelveli district]] who had discovered [[groundwater]] under some lands of the village which could be used as an irrigation source not only for the village, but for the entire Tirunelveli district and the neighbouring [[Thoothukudi district]] as well. But, an [[Multinational corporation|MNC]] owned by Chirag ([[Neil Nitin Mukesh]]) cheated the villagers into giving their lands for the construction of a factory. Jeevanandam gets arrested by the police and six villagers commit suicide to bring this news to the media forefront and release Jeevanandham from prison. On learning of the plight of Jeevanandam and the villagers, Kathiresan decides to fight for their cause while still under the name of Jeevanandam. The people of the old home and Kathiresan go to the jury and try to convince him to go in favour of them, but Kathiresan starts stating rules and scares the main jury person (whom Chirag had bribed). Kathiresan then sends a person (disguised as a hairdresser) to Chirag and makes him lay a fingerprint on Chirag's neck. After that Chirag sends 50 men to kill Kathiresan but he soon defeats them using the coins the villagers gave when he was attending a ceremony for him.  Meanwhile, the real Jeevanandam gains consciousness and finds himself in the Kolkata prison where Kathiresan was locked up. With the help of Vivek, who has heard his story and has plans to kill Kathiresan in revenge for getting him caught and thrown back into prison, he soon escapes along with Vivek's henchmen.  Not knowing that Jeevanandam and Vivek's henchmen are headed for Chennai, Kathiresan makes efforts to convince the media to bring the plight of the villagers to national consciousness, but the media is not interested as they feel that it is not a sensational news. A few days later, at the [[Madras High Court]], the judge declares the verdict in favour of Jeevanandam and the villagers, but adds that Chirag has claimed that certain villagers who are working abroad have shown their support for the factory. If they cannot prove that their support was faked by Chirag within the next five days, the verdict will then go in favour of Chirag and the villagers will lose their lands. Since the villagers, who have denied supporting the factory, are abroad and cannot come to Chennai within five days to rebut Chirag's claims as their passports are held by their contractors, and the verdict is to be decided within five days, Kathiresan decides to take drastic measures to sensationalise the issue. He, Ankitha, Ravi and the inmates of the old-age home block water supply to Chennai by sitting on the pipelines which carry water to Chennai from five lakes. With the plight of the Chennaites due to no water supply having gained national attention, Kathiresan comes out of the pipeline after a few days and highlights the villagers' plight in an emotionally charged speech to the media, which is telecast nationwide and moves many people. By now, Kathiresan has discovered that Jeevanandam has escaped and is searching for him.  Meanwhile, Jeevanandam and Vivek's henchmen reach Chennai, but Jeevanandam is soon kidnapped by Chirag's henchmen. While in Chirag's custody, he sees Kathiresan's speech on television and is moved by the efforts made by his doppelgänger to help the villagers. On the night before the verdict, Kathiresan's bluff is exposed, but Kathiresan assures the old men that he is genuinely interested in their cause, that Jeevanandam is alive and that he will rescue Jeevanandam from Chirag and hand him back over to the villagers with the assurance of a positive verdict. Kathiresan goes to Chirag's office, where Jeevanandam is being held. He rescues Jeevanandam and fights Chirag and his henchmen, killing Chirag in the process.  The next day, the verdict is declared in favour of Jeevanantham and the villagers. Kathiresan, despite his efforts to thwart Chirag and the MNC, does not take part in the ensuing celebrations over the verdict and instead surrenders to the police and returns to the Kolkata prison, but not before promising Ankitha, who has now fallen in love with him, that he will marry her once he is released.

As fate would have it, her services are called for by a royal family in [[Rajasthan]] where King Shekhar Singh Rathore ([[Aamir Raza Husain]]) is paralyzed from the waist down. She is told that 40 doctors have already left the job, so evidently treating the King is no easy task.  Mili travels to the royal palace and meets the discipline-oriented queen, Nirmala Devi Rathore ([[Ratna Pathak Shah]]) who is not amused by Mili's enthusiasm and clumsiness, and they do not get along very well.

He gives Mili the same answer that the Queen gave her, "if you cannot handle the job, you may leave". Mili gets frustrated and tries to explain to them that all family members must help the King to get better instead of being stubborn, rigid and self-centered all the time.  Just when Mili decides to leave, she learns the real reason for the King's unwillingness from the royal servant Ram Sevak ([[Ashok Banthia]]). He explains that ten years ago, the family's eldest son died in an accident in a convertible gifted by the King, during one of their long rides. The King went into a coma for over six months during which the Queen's demeanour changed due to the loss of her son, the paralysis of her husband and the royal responsibilities suddenly thrust upon her.

One day the king persuades the prince to take Mili with him to Surajgarh Palace. After that, the prince leaves Mili in the market and goes to a meeting. Mili gets kidnapped, and when Vikram saves her, they both kiss.  The next day, they both decide to forget about it but the two start falling for each other. Mili confesses her love for him but Vikram refuses to acknowledge it, saying that they come from two different stocks. He is also engaged to a lady of his status Kiara ([[Aditi Rao Hydari]]). Divya runs away to try out for auditions in Jaipur. Mili informs the queen that she knew about Divya's plans. The queen becomes furious and Mili is ordered to leave. Divya returns and tells Nirmala that she came back because of Mili. The king surprises Nirmala by standing up from his wheelchair and admits that he saw Divya run away. He tells her that this is what Mili has been trying to teach them; to love life as it is. Mili, however, is heartbroken due to Vikram's refusal. Vikram breaks off his engagement with Kiara and confesses his love for Mili and the royal couple gives him their blessings, telling him to go find her in Delhi.

Kid Cannabis
  Nate Norman ([[Jonathan Daniel Brown]]) lives in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d’Alene, Idaho]] with his younger brother and their single mom who works multiple jobs to support them.  An eighteen-year-old high school dropout, Nate smokes copious amounts of marijuana with his best friend Topher Clark ([[Kenny Wormald]]), a 27-year-old who had moved from Boston. The two become increasingly fed up at being nobodies scraping to get by in a city of wealth. Nate and Topher decide to try their hand at smuggling weed across the border.  Beginning in northern Idaho, Nate and Topher don camouflage gear and hike north through the woods towards Canada. Upon coming to a road, the two realize they’d made it when they spot a speed limit sign that is displayed using the metric system. Knowing how easily they can travel unnoticed between the two countries, Nate and Topher return to the US to acquire some “anal probes ”.  After salvaging and selling a sunken motorboat, the two head back towards Canada; this time by car; with $1,800 on hand and in search of a supplier. Once safely in Canada, they travel to the nearby border town of [[Creston, British Columbia]]. They enter a [[marijuana dispensary]] full of people smoking medicinally, and start a conversation with the clerk about his selection. Their pending purchase is interrupted by a greasy man approaching and telling Nate and Toph to walk away, advising them that the building’s surveillance system would surely lead to their arrest should they attempt to transport the marijuana across the border. He then brings them to his run-down apartment and sells them $1,800 worth of weed himself, before promptly kicking them out.  Nate and Toph realize on their way back they had wound up buying “Mexican goat-fucker’s weed” instead of the high-potency strains they had come for, but know they are past the point of turning back and make for the border with their yield. As per their agreement, the much more athletic Topher hauls the weed back through the woods, while Nate drives the clean vehicle across the border and picks Topher up on the other side - but not before he endures another cavity search and Topher gets lost for several hours. Despite selling a lackluster product, the demand for “[[BC Bud]]” in Coeur d’Alene proves to be massive. Nate and Topher quickly unload their stash and make their way back to Canada to find a reliable supplier with top-grade product.  Both in the car this time, Nate and Topher are pulled over soon after the border by a Canadian police officer. After a brief but tense conversation, the cop advises them that if they are looking for weed, they should go to the town of [[Nelson, British Columbia]] to find the best. Outside of a gas station in Nelson, Topher meets a beautiful girl named Nicole Grefard ([[Merritt Patterson]]). Nicole is smoking a joint, and after talking with Toph and Nate she winds up offering to sell them as much as they need.  Nate agrees to purchase 300 pounds from John, her father.  With Topher back in the States, Nate assembles six of their close friends to serve as their drug-runners. He puts the crew through military style training and has them wear camouflage ghille suits, and their first transport goes off without a hitch. The gang makes a series of successful runs, and the money begins to pile up. Nate buys an extravagant lake house for his mom and buries a large case of money as a “retirement fund”. Nate and Topher rent an apartment in [[Spokane, Washington]] to serve as a transfer point for marijuana and cash. The boys buy expensive new cars and throw lavish parties with dozens of sexy girls. One night during a run the crew is approached by Brendan Butler, who is also on a smuggling run. Butler demands at gunpoint that they hand over their product, and shoots at them when they make a run for it. The crew makes it back safe with the pot, but tensions over their pay reach a boiling point. Upset with Nate taking on the sole leadership role despite seemingly agreeing to on a 50/50 split, Topher gets into a heated argument with Nate on behalf of the rest of the crew. Nate reluctantly agrees to pay them all triple for that run. Nate throws himself an extravagant birthday party at his family’s lake house. Brendan Butler notices the party from his house across the lake, and is enraged at Nate for intruding on his business and social status. While Nate heads to his bedroom with two voluptuous women, Butler storms into the party wearing a black mask and shoots a gun into the air several times. Nate retrieves a gun of his own and runs outside to confront Butler. A very brief shootout between the two occurs before Butler drives away.  Brendan Butler meets with two career criminals, the Mendiola brothers, whom he hires to rob Nate of his cash and drug supply. The Mendiolas go to Nate’s family’s house on the night of June 14, 2006. As a result of the earlier shooting, Nate and his family were staying at a house belonging to Barry Lerner, while Nate’s crew member Scuzz was staying at the lake house with his girlfriend. The Mendiolas restrain the couple but quickly realize that Scuzz isn’t Nate. Scuzz has no idea where the weed, money, or Nate is, but at gunpoint offers to show them a different house belonging to Nate. The brothers drive with the hostage couple to the house, which turns out to be lived in by a different family, and the brothers are shot at after attempting to break in. Scuzz and his girlfriend are surprisingly released from the car alive.  After the failed robbery, Brendan Butler is greatly irritated and demands a second attempt, this time including the murder of Nate and Topher. Meanwhile, Scuzz brags to the crew about not ratting them out but receives a beating from Nate for leading the criminals to a house he thought Nate still owned. Butler brings the Mendiola brothers to a spot in the woods where he wants them to hide the bodies. As Butler cockily runs his mouth at the brothers, one of the brothers brutally strangles him and stabs him in the throat, killing him. It is unclear but heavily implied by Nate in a tense discussion with Topher that he had Brendan Butler killed.  Despite Nate’s ensuing orders to lay low, Topher leads drug runs with people Nate doesn’t know. One of them decides to rob the crew, secretly hiding part of his load in the woods on their way back. After returning to retrieve the pot, he is stopped by the police, who had been following him. Facing a mandatory minimum 25-year sentence for Conspiracy to Distribute Marijuana, the unnamed thief leads police to the rest of the crew on their next drug run. Through connections of Barry Lerner’s, Nate hides throughout Canada while his crew is arrested. When threatened with life in prison for the amount of drugs they smuggled, every member of the crew identifies Nate Norman as the leader; including Topher, who at this point concedes that it was always Nate who ran the show. To lure Nate back into their jurisdiction, Idaho police threaten his mother with money laundering charges and a ten-year sentence unless Nate turns himself in.  To keep his mother out of jail, Nate returns to the US, turning himself over to police immediately at the border.  The film ends with a recap of the crew members’ sentences. All served various amounts of jail time, and have since been released and are leading happy lives. Nate was offered a reduced sentence to identify his sources of financing and distribution, but refused.

While driving home from work, Nomura witnesses a young woman, Hisae, attempting to get her autistic younger brother killed by getting him to stand in the middle of the street. Hisae fails to do so and tearfully pulls her brother away, immediately regretting her decision. Fascinated by Hisae's compulsion to "kill", Nomura develops a friendship with the woman.  Meanwhile, in Indonesia, Bayu Aditya, an ambitious [[Jakarta]]-based journalist, attempts to interview a corrupt politician, Dharma, about recent rumors surrounding domestic violence against his wife. Bayu's obsession to publicize Dharma's scandals has caused his marriage and career to fall apart. While trying to get the latest scoop, Bayu corners Dharma in the parking lot and attempts to gather more footage, only to be beaten up by one of Dharma's bodyguards.  Coming home from work, Bayu is kidnapped by a taxi-driver and his accomplice. In self-defense, Bayu fights back and gunfire is exchanged within the taxi. Both of the thugs are killed and a terrified Bayu hurriedly leaves the scene of the crime for home. Traumatized and delirious, Bayu sees one of Nomura's videos and develops a fascination for the killer, who is masked in the footage. Bayu eventually follows the same dark path to become a [[serial killer]] himself. He forms his own killer-persona, personally vows to kill in the name of justice, and also uploads his deeds to the internet, similar to Nomura's [[modus operandi]]. Nomura is pleased with Bayu's work and eventually gets in contact with him via social media however neither knows each other's true identity.  Bayu goes to Dharma's personal fixer, Robert, and corners him in his home. Upon detaining Robert, Bayu hears rumbling upstairs. He investigates and finds a young boy shackled to the bed, revealing that Robert is a child-molester. Disturbed and angered by this, Bayu pistol-whips Robert and locks him in the basement. Upon gaining information on Dharma's whereabouts, Bayu sets Robert on fire, records the murder, and uploads it to the internet.  Meanwhile, Nomura stalks a hooker and eventually lures her into his car. He plans to take her back to his house and murder her but is interrupted by a hallucination of his deceased sister, causing the car to violently swivel across the road. Temporarily regaining his sanity, Nomura decides not to carry out his deed and drives the hooker back, who is outraged at his reckless driving. The hooker complains to her pimp and Nomura is subsequently beaten up for mistreating the prostitute. Before leaving, the pimp takes Nomura's wallet which contains his driver's license.  Nomura frequently visits Hisae at her flower store, but their friendship quickly sours one day when Nomura talks about his perverse thoughts about murder and death. Nomura further degrades his friendship with Hisae by inappropriately giving Hisae's brother a tazer as a toy.  Bayu begins to develop feelings of remorse and seeks Nomura for counseling over webcam chat, but Nomura only encourages him to kill again. Bayu, under the guise of a masked intruder, storms Dharma's Star Hotel but only finds Dharma's son, Adit. Bayu becomes delirious and shoots Adit dead, alerting Dharma's bodyguards. A lengthy chase follows and Bayu manages to escape the hotel, but he loses his mask in the process and his identity gets compromised.  On a busy night in downtown Tokyo, Nomura attempts to find the prostitute who caused him trouble. He stalks her pimp to a nightclub, stabs him to death, and retrieves his stolen wallet and ID. He then searches the nightclub, grabs the intoxicated hooker, and throws her into the trunk of his car. He attracts the attention of undercover policemen, but they fail to discover his crime. Upon returning home, Nomura decides to kill the hooker on webcam for Bayu to see. Nomura calls up Bayu on social media and prepares to kill her in front of the webcam. Bayu screams and pleads Nomura to stop, but Nomura believes that Bayu is "just like him" in that he shares the same sadistic pleasure in seeing people killed. Right before Nomura is about to hurt his victim, Hisae rings his doorbell and Nomura knocks out the hooker before leaving to answer it. Hisae is furious with Nomura for giving her brother a taser and confronts him about his abnormal behavior. Their conversation is interrupted once the prostitute wakes up and screams for help. Hisae manages to temporarily disable Nomura and get the hooker out of Nomura's house, but eventually they are both killed by Nomura.  Bayu passes out that night from all his stress and wakes up the next morning to be greeted by his daughter. Bayu and his wife decide to get back together and repair their failed marriage. Unfortunately, Bayu's daughter is eventually kidnapped by Dharma's thugs for Adit's death. Bayu returns home and discovers his wife murdered and the deed recorded. He tears up and stumbles out of his house, only to see Nomura who has just arrived in Indonesia.  Bayu attempts to chase down Nomura as he suspects him as the murderer of his wife, but is hit by a car and kidnapped by Dharma's thugs in the process. Dharma's thugs bring a detained Bayu to a floor in a high-rise building. Right before Dharma's bodyguard kills Bayu in front of his kidnapped daughter, Nomura arrives and shoots dead the bodyguard. Nomura, armed, taunts Bayu and commands him to kill Dharma or else his daughter will be shot dead as well. Bayu strangles Dharma to death but Nomura decides to kill Bayu's daughter anyway. Bayu grabs hold of Nomura and both of them scuffle for a while before falling off the high-rise building.  The pair land on a car, Bayu dead and Nomura mortally wounded.

Kingsman: The Secret Service
 During a mission in the [[Middle East]] in 1997, probationary [[secret agent]] Lee Unwin sacrifices himself to protect his superior Harry Hart. Hart, blaming himself, returns to London to give Lee's widow Michelle and her young son Gary "Eggsy" a medal engraved with an emergency assistance number.  Seventeen years later, Eggsy, having dropped out of training for the [[Royal Marines]] despite his intelligence and capability, has become a stereotypical [[chav]].<ref></ref><ref></ref> After being arrested for stealing a car, Eggsy calls the number. Hart arranges his release. Hart explains that he is a member of Kingsman, a private intelligence service founded by wealthy British individuals who lost their heirs in [[World War I]]. Hart, code name "Galahad", explains there is a position available, as agent "Lancelot" was killed by the assassin Gazelle while trying to rescue Professor James Arnold from kidnappers. Eggsy becomes Hart's candidate. Other candidates are eliminated through dangerous training tests run by operative "Merlin", until only Eggsy and Roxy, a candidate he befriended, are left. Eggsy refuses to complete the final test – shooting a Pug puppy he has raised during the training process (unaware that the gun holds blanks) – and Roxy is named the new "Lancelot".  Meanwhile, Merlin discovers that Professor Arnold has returned to work as if nothing had happened. Hart attempts to interrogate him, but a [[Microchip|chip]] in Professor Arnold's neck explodes, killing him. The detonation signal is traced to a facility owned by Internet billionaire and philanthropist Richmond Valentine, who has recently offered everyone in the world [[Subscriber identity module|SIM cards]] that grant free lifetime cellular and Internet connectivity. Hart, impersonating a billionaire philanthropist, meets Valentine face-to-face. Hart learns of Valentine's connection to an obscure [[hate group]]'s church in [[Kentucky]], and travels there, wearing glasses containing a video [[transceiver]]. As Eggsy watches, Valentine activates the SIM cards in the church, triggering a signal that causes the parishioners to become murderously violent. Hart's spy training leaves him as the only survivor. Outside the church Valentine explains what happened, then shoots Hart in the face.  Eggsy returns to Kingsman headquarters and finds that Chester "Arthur" King, Kingsman's leader, has a scar on his neck just like Professor Arnold's. King reveals that Valentine plans to transmit his "neurological wave" worldwide via satellite network, believing the resulting "culling" of the human race will avert its extinction. Only those Valentine has chosen, willing and unwilling, will be unaffected. King tries to poison Eggsy, but Eggsy switches glasses and King poisons himself.  Eggsy, Merlin and Roxy set out to stop Valentine. Roxy uses [[high-altitude balloons]] to destroy one of Valentine's satellites and break up the network, but Valentine quickly secures a replacement from a business associate. Merlin flies Eggsy to Valentine's base, where he masquerades as King. Eggsy is discovered by a failed Kingsman recruit, Charlie Hesketh, leading to both Eggsy and Merlin being cornered. On Eggsy's suggestion, Merlin activates the implanted chips' failsafe, killing almost everyone with a chip. An angry Valentine activates the signal and triggers worldwide pandemonium. Eggsy kills Gazelle and uses one of her sharpened prosthetic legs to impale Valentine and kill him, stopping the signal and ending the threat.  In a [[mid-credits scene]], Eggsy, now a full Kingsman agent, offers his mother and half-sister a new home away from his abusive stepfather Dean, who flatly objects to Eggsy's suggestion. Eggsy then dispatches him in exactly the same manner that Hart dealt with one of Dean's henchmen earlier.

Kochadaiiyaan
 A young boy named Rana, who hails from the kingdom of [[Kottaipattinam]], leaves his family, despite his twin brother Sena pleading him not to do so. The boy soon meets with an accident while rowing in the river and is eventually discovered by some fishermen from the neighbouring kingdom of [[Kalinga (historical region)|Kalingapuri]], a rival of Kottaipattinam. Rana ([[Rajinikanth]]) grows up there and trains in weaponry, and grows up to be a fearless warrior. Due to his fighting skills and bravery, he soon wins the confidence of the king of Kalingapuri, Raja Mahendran ([[Jackie Shroff]]), who promotes him as [[Commander-in-chief|Commander-in-Chief]] of the Kalingapuri army. The son of Raja Mahendran, Veera Mahendran ([[Aadhi Pinisetty|Aadhi]]) shows Rana around the kingdom's mine where the captured soldiers of Kottaipattinam work as slaves. Veera says that this information is known only to a few people. After this, Rana promotes a war strategy to Veera that they release the slaves and have them trained in the army of Kalingapuri. Veera agrees and the slaves are freed. He then gets Raja Mahendran's approval to attack Kottaipattinam. However, during the war, Rana encounters his childhood friend, crown prince Sengodagan ([[R. Sarathkumar]]), the son of Rishikodagan ([[Nassar]]), king of Kottaipattinam. Instead of fighting, it is revealed that the main motive of Rana's plan was to free the soldiers of Kottipattinam. Immediately signalling an end to the war, he, along with the soldiers disown Kalingapuri and return to Kottaipattinam, much to the disgust of Raja Mahendran and his son, crown prince Veera Mahendran, who swear revenge on Rana for tricking them and betraying Kalingapuri.  At Kottaipattinam, Rana and Sengodagan renew their friendship. Sengodagan introduces Rana to Rishikodagan, who is alarmed on seeing him. Rana also reunites with his younger sister Yamuna Devi ([[Rukmini Vijayakumar]]) whom he last saw as a baby and their uncle ([[Nagesh]]), who raised her, but soon learns that his mother Yaaghavi ([[Shobana]]) is dead and his brother Sena is missing. He soon learns that Yamuna and Sengodagan are in love with each other. He accepts their relationship and decides to get them married, even cleverly convincing Rishikodagan, who was unwilling to get his son married to a commoner like Yamuna. Meanwhile, Rana also falls in love with his [[childhood sweetheart]], princess Vadhana Devi ([[Deepika Padukone]]), the daughter of Rishikodagan.  Soon, Sengodagan and Yamuna get married. But following the wedding, Rishikodagan disowns his son for marrying Yamuna despite knowing that the latter does not belong to a royal family. An unfazed Sengodagan immediately leaves the palace with Yamuna. Later that night, a masked man barges into the palace and attempts to kill Rishikodagan. Vadhana immediately goes after him, fights him and gets him captured. Rishikodagan unmasks the assassin who is revealed to be Rana, and immediately throws him into prison, sentencing him to death. An upset Vadhana rushes to the cell where Rana is imprisoned, where Rana tells her why he attempted to kill Rishikodagan.  Years ago, Rana is the younger son of Kochadaiiyaan, the former Commander-in-Chief of Kottaipattinam's army. Kochadaiiyaan is extremely respected in Kottaipattinam for his bravery and is more popular than Rishikodagan himself. So,  Rishikodagan jealous of Kochadaiiyaan. One night, when Kochadaiiyaan is returning by ship to Kottaipatinam with his army after buying horses and ammunition, they are attacked by the rival army of Kalingapuri. Kochadaiiyaan defeats them but allows them to return to their kingdom as an act of chivalry. However, the Kalingapuri army, before leaving, poison the food on the ship. The Kottaipattinam army men consume this food, and fall ill.  Despite knowing that he had been tricked by the Kalingapuri army, Kochadaiiyaan immediately rushes to Kalingapuri itself, because it is the only land body close enough to provide medicines to the sick and dying soldiers. He orders Raja Mahendran to provide medical assistance to his soldiers. Raja Mahendran, in turn, cunningly proposes a deal that, if he wants his men to be saved, he has to leave all the horses, ammunition and the sick army men in Kalingapuri as slaves. Only if Kochadaiiyan agrees to this, his soldiers will be nursed back to health. Kochadaiiyan thinks that his men rather be alive as slaves than die from poisoning, and also thinks that when they officially wage a war in the near future, all of them could be easily rescued. So he accepts Raja Mahendran's offer and leaves Kalingapuri all alone. When he returns to Kottaipattinam, the jealous Rishikodagan seizes this opportunity to strip Kochadaiiyan off all respect and dignity and sentences him to death for becoming a traitor to Kottaipattinam by surrendering his army men, horses and ammunition to Kalingapuri. Though all his subjects are dismayed at Kochadaiiyaan being sentenced to death, and his wife Yaaghavi even goes to the extent of publicly rebuking Rishikodagan for his injustice, Rishikodagan stands firm in his decision. Kochadaiiyaan is executed the following morning before Rana's eyes.  The story comes back to the present, with Rana telling Vadhana that he ran away to Kalingapuri, with the intention of freeing the soldiers of Kottaipattinam and to take revenge on Rishikodagan for unjustly killing his father. Vadhana is shocked on hearing about her father's actions and reconciles with Rana. She then pleads with her father to release Rana, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Rana escapes from the prison. When Rishikodagan learns of Rana's escape, he immediately arranges for Vadhana's marriage with prince Veera Mahendran after consulting with an astrologer and learning that his life is at Rana's mercy. Despite the enmity between Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri, he arranges this marriage with the hope that their united armies and their mutual hatred for Rana can subdue him.  On the day of the marriage, Rana arrives just when the marriage is about to take place. He and the people of Kottapattinam berate Rishikodagan for becoming a traitor and surrendering the whole kingdom of Kottaipattinam to Raja Mahendran for his own personal interests and commitments, which was the same charge that Rishikodagan had placed on Kochadaiiyaan years ago. Following this, a war starts between Rana and the united armies of Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri. Rana successfully manages to subdue the armies of both kingdoms and along with a majority of Kottaipattinam's army, he kills Raja Mahendran and allows Veera Mahendran to return as he was defeated, reminding him of their friendship. He then fights Rishikodagan and [[Decapitation|decapitates]] him.  Finally, as Rana and Vadhana reunite, a young soldier comes towards them riding a horse. This soldier is revealed to be Sena, who looks surprisingly angered, as their father had asked him to protect the king but Rana had killed him, indicating that a fight awaits.

Caught amidst labor revolts & naxal uprisings, the last thing Saryu Bhan Singh wanted was to make enemies with the top government officer of his region. He sends his most lethal human weapon, Karua (Vipinno) to scare Nisheeth Kumar off to silence.   But the mission don’t-kill-just-scare-him goes horribly wrong when Karua ends up fatally injuring Nisheeth’s wife and in the process of escape, ends up carrying Nisheeth's infant also, thus abducting the child. What happens hereafter tells a thrilling & heart-rending story of how the real power doesn’t always flow through the barrels of guns but through the tender touches of a child, love of a mother & heartfelt prayers of the hapless millions.  
Korengal
 The documentary takes place between 2007 and 2008 in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan.<ref name=NPR/> The film consists mainly of interviews with men in a [[platoon]] stationed at outpost Restrepo.<ref name=reuters></ref> Forty-two soldiers died in Korengal Valley before the United States pulled out in April 2010. Unlike ''Restrepo'', which was a film mostly about battle, ''Korengal'' examines the military life and experiences of those same men. The men are filmed in extreme closeup as they are interviewed; they express the most intense fear and exhilaration they ever experienced while in combat. They express bonds between each other that go beyond the intensity of their own family ties. One soldier states that he would gladly die for one of his fellow soldiers.<ref name=NYT> </ref>  Whereas ''Restrepo'' showed the "high" of combat, ''Korengal'' expresses more bitterness.<ref name=NYT/> Many of the soldiers interviewed after their deployment missed the camaraderie of the other men, missed the adrenaline of war, and the excitement of "cheating death."<ref name=NYT/>  One soldier expressed this simply as "I'd go back there if I could."<ref name=NYT/><ref name="The New Yorker"></ref>

Kubot: The Aswang Chronicles 2
 [[Tiktik: The Aswang Chronicles|After defeating the Tiktiks during the previous night in the town of Pulupandan,]] Makoy (Dingdong Dantes), with his wife Sonia, their newborn son Mackie, Sonia's father Nestor (Joey Marquez) and neighbor Pacing quickly takes the first bus trip to the next town. However, their bus is ambushed by Kubots (hairy bat-like creatures - a variation of aswang). The accident kills most of the passengers, while Makoy loses his right arm. The Kubots' leader, Veron (Elizabeth Oropesa), kills Sonia and takes Mackie in retribution for Makoy's actions in Pulupandan. Makoy and Nestor survive the ordeal.   Two years later, Makoy and Nestor work as mechanics in Manila and lives together with his older sister Nieves (Lotlot de Leon) and her daughter. Makoy also sports a prosthetic arm built by Stacey (Julie Anne San Jose) and Benjie (Abra), a couple of engineering students.  Nieves works as a secretary for a physician, Lex (Isabelle Daza), whom Nieves suspects of illegal medical practices. One night, she decides to eavesdrop on the doctor's after-office work, and finds her torturing a patient. In reality, she is investigating incidents where people are turning into aswangs. Lex's residence is attacked by aswangs during that night, resulting in the death of her family. Nieves and Lex escapes back to the former's house.  While there, Lex explains that she found out that tainted processed meat from Dom's Hotdogs are causing normal people to change into aswangs. They try to seek help from Makoy and Nestor, but they refuse to help Lex after it is revealed that she is an aswang herself. Nieves and Lex then return to the latter's house, where they are brought to the police station as part of the investigation regarding the murder of Lex's family.  Meanwhile, a council of elder aswangs (with one council member absent) summon Dominic (KC Montero), an aswang raised in a foreign country and owner of Dom's Hotdogs, to express their disapproval of Dom's actions. He reiterates the need to multiply their race, and offers a merger of the different aswang tribes. The councilmen reject the offer, after which Dom murders them all.  Back at the police station, aswangs attack with the intention of getting Lex. Makoy and Nestor arrive to help. As additional police arrive, Makoy and Lex escape while Nestor and Nieves are arrested, although they are able to prove that it was an aswang attack due to the capture of Tope (Jun Sabayton), a corrupt meat inspector who was turned into an aswang. Two of the policemen, Justiniani ([[Ramon Bautista]]) and Macapagal (Bogart the Explorer), torture Tope to get the location of the aswangs' hideout in the city.  As they make their escape, Lex explains that she and her tribe refrain from eating human flesh, although this makes them weaker than the ones that do eat humans. She also reveals that she has found a way to turn aswangs into humans, although there is only a certain window to make the process work. They are cornered by some people who are after them for bounty. Makoy and Lex are saved by Lex's tribemates although Makoy is shot. Lex treats his wound. Makoy is then asked by the tribe to leave, as an elder aswang, whom they asked for help in dealing with Dom, is scheduled to arrive. Makoy comes face-to-face with Veron, the elder leader of the Kubot. After a tense standoff, Veron lets Makoy free.  Makoy later arrives back at Nieves' house, and Nestor and Nieves tries to convince Makoy to help foil Dom's business. He still refuses to help due to his indifference to the aswangs' feud. He later changes his mind after finding out that a free concert sponsored by Dom's Hotdog is scheduled that night. Makoy, Nestor and Nieves plan to prevent the delivery of the free but harmful food. Makoy receives a new arm in preparation for battle.  Lex and Veron confront Dom regarding the missing council members. He admits to the murder, and captures the two.  Justiniani and Macapagal arrive at the Dom's Hotdogs warehouse but are captured.  Makoy, Nestor and Nieves also arrive and are also captured.  Justiniani and Macapagal are executed, but the rest of them are able to get free due to Makoy's efforts.  Nestor and Nieves stop the meat shipment, while Lex and Veron wipeout Dom's minions. Makoy defeats Dom.  After sometime, Veron makes her presence felt at Makoy's car repair shop. Makoy wasn't able to find her, and instead sees a boy at the spot where he heard her. As Nieves picks the boy up, Nestor finds a nametag on him that reads Mackie - revealing that Veron did not kill the boy but instead raised him.  Dom's death is mourned by his kin. His grieving mother is consoled by one of the attendees (Marian Rivera), who promises that his death will be avenged.  
Kristy (film)
 The film opens with a hooded figure photographing a young woman's corpse in an empty field, followed by a montage of internet screenshots and video of women being killed in what appears to be [[ritual murder]]s by a [[cybersectarianism|cybercult]], and footage of the murders being uploaded on an anonymous underground website, where members are encouraged to "kill Kristy," "Kristy" coming from a Latin name meaning "follower of God."  College student Justine is attending a private university in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] on scholarship and financial aid, and is unable to afford to fly home for the [[Thanksgiving]] holiday. Her boyfriend Aaron and wealthy roommate Nicole both leave for the holiday, leaving Justine to spend the holiday in solitude on a nearly empty campus, aside from the security guard, Wayne, and groundskeeper, Scott.   On Thanksgiving night, Justine uses Nicole's [[BMW]] to drive to a nearby convenience store off campus. Inside the store, a hooded girl, Violet, approaches Justine, complimenting her car. At the counter, the girl asks for a student discount on a pair of sunglasses, but has no ID. Justine offers to pay for them, but the girl refuses and calls her "Kristy." On the drive home, Justine nearly rear ends a mysterious car parked in the middle of the road. Upon returning to the campus, Justine calls Aaron and informs him of the strange occurrence, and though he offers to come stay the night with her, she declines. After falling asleep on a couch in the common room, she hears odd noises coming from the direction of her dorm. Inside her dorm, Justine finds that someone has accessed her laptop, as a [[snuff film]] plays on the screen. Violet appears in the room with a boxcutter in hand, and Justine flees to the entryway. Outside, Wayne, who had been investigating a noise, is murdered in front of her by a masked man.  The four cult killers assemble, and Violet begins recording Justine, telling her that they will hunt her, and that she should "run to God." Justine flees to Scott's house on the edge of the campus for help. Scott goes outside to confront the assailants, but the killers murder his dog before [[hanging]] him from a swingset in the yard. Justine attempts to call 911 from Scott's cellphone, but the gang has [[hacker (computer security)|hacked]] into it. They begin sending Justine video clips of herself on the phone and menacing text messages. Justine attempts to hide in the library, but is chased to the roof of the building; cornered by the four assailants, she leaps from the roof, falling through the branches of a tree help break her fall.   Aaron arrives at the campus, and Justine struggles to run toward his car, but he is killed by one of the men in front of her. She uses Aaron's car to pin the man against a concrete wall, crushing him to death. She then retreats to the gymnasium where she hides in the swimming pool. She stabs one of the men in the throat with her car keys before drowning him, and beats the other man to death with a baseball bat inside the locker room. She hears a cell phone alert from the dead man's jacket, and reads a text message from Violet asking if he's "killed Kristy yet." Justine responds "yes." While accessing the killer's phone, Justine finds photos of the cult's numerous victims, and their declaration to kill the "Kristys" of the world—pure, beautiful, and privileged women who they believe follow God.  Justine uses pool chemicals from a storage closet to create a flammable powder. She then dresses herself in the dead man's mask and jacket, and approaches the car where Violet is, dousing it in the powder. Violet attempts to lash at her with a box cutter, but Justine ignites the powder, and Violet is engulfed in flames; Justine watches as she is burned alive. She then photographs Violet's corpse with the cell phone, and uploads it to the website, entitled ''/the fold/''.  A montage at the end of the film narrated by news footage reveals a series of similar cult murders had occurred in [[New York City]]; [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]; [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon; [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]; [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]]; [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] and [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], but with Justine's testimony and access to the phone, many of the cult's members have been arrested. A [[post-credits scene]] shows a young woman being attacked by another cult killer outside her home.

She works a dreadful, dead-end job under a boss she hates (who in turn, hates her), unable to connect to her fashionable peers, and nagged by her overbearing mother to find a man and get married. The only joys in her life come from her pet rabbit, Bunzo, and treasure hunting - which leads her to find a [[VHS]] copy of the film ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'', which she found in a secluded cave on the shore. Convinced the film is real, Kumiko obsesses over the only playable scene, in which a character played by [[Steve Buscemi]] buries a satchel of ransom money along a snowy highway, obsessively detailing and noting each aspect of the scene. Kumiko even attempts to steal an atlas from a library, only to be caught by the security guard, who pities her and allows her to take the map of [[Minnesota]].  Under threat of being replaced, a failed reconnection with an old friend, and her mother's increasing nagging, Kumiko abandons Bunzo on a train and boards a plane to [[Minneapolis]] using her boss's [[Credit card#Business Credit Cards|company card]]. With a hand-stitched treasure map and a quixotic spirit, Kumiko embarks on a journey over the Pacific and through the frozen Minnesota plains to find the purported fortune. Once there, she quickly finds herself unprepared for the harsh winter, and unable to communicate due to her weak grasp of English beyond "Fargo".

A [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff's deputy]] picks her up after passersby report her wandering through the streets, believing her to be lost. She shows him the film and he attempts to understand her, gaining her trust, but repeatedly attempts to tell her that the film is not real - later driving her to a Chinese restaurant in hopes of finding a translator, unaware that Chinese and Japanese are not mutually intelligible. While at the restaurant, Kumiko calls her mother from a payphone hoping that she would be able to [[Wire transfer|wire]] her money only for her mother to disown her after being told she stole her boss's credit card. This leads to Kumiko breaking down in front of the officer. While buying her winter attire, Kumiko kisses the officer, but he explains that he is married and tries again to explain to her that the treasure isn't real; upset, Kumiko runs from the store and leaves in a taxi, where she plots a course to [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]].

Convinced that this is the treasure, she spends a long time attempting to break the ice, only to find a badly decayed [[oar]].  That night, during a snowstorm, Kumiko wanders deeper into the forest, the storm growing more and more violent until she is buried. The next morning, Kumiko emerges from the snow, and wanders through a hallucinatory landscape until she happens upon what appears to be the setting of the Fargo scene and sees the marker indicating the location of the treasure. She finds the satchel containing the money. Overjoyed with her triumph, she exclaims "I was right after all". Bunzo appears, and with him, she proudly walks into the distance.

Jacky introduces them to May, the owner of the club, who then introduces them to her partying younger cousin Jolie. Jolie immediately reminds Jacky of his ex-girlfriend Mavis, about whom he still feels guilty. May, knowing Jolie likes to party hard, gives Jacky the task of looking after Jolie. She hopes the two can start a relationship, since his current girlfriend Jeana will soon be leaving for Taiwan for work. Jacky hesitantly agrees to babysit Jolie only because she reminds him of Mavis.  Meanwhile, Jeana pushes Sara to forget about her boyfriend Shin by telling her to party harder and introduces her to her Korean friend Kim.

With Kim and Sara leaving Jolie behind at the club, Jolie gets gang raped by two Korean men she just met. At the police station to find out what happened to Jolie, Sara finds out Kim has a wife and was only using her for a no strings attached fling.

She is introduced to one of Shin's friends, Parker, who takes an interest in her. The two eventually have sex one night, with Papa leaving early in the morning thinking Parker will think of it as a one-night stand the next day. Parker waits outside Papa's workplace the next day to tell her he is truly serious about their relationship.

In Korea Jolie tells Jacky she knows that she reminds him of his ex-girlfriend Mavis and that he's not obliged to take care of her.

[[Kakashi Hatake]], now Konohagakure's village leader and the Sixth Hokage, notices that the moon is nearing Earth and will soon collide with it. The crisis is caused by [[List of Naruto characters#Toneri Ōtsutsuki|Toneri Otsutsuki]], a descendant of Hamura Otsutsuki of the Branch House, who is determined to fulfill his legacy and punish humanity for abusing the energy known as ''chakra'' over a millennium. During the Rinne Festival, as [[Hinata Hyuga]] knits a [[Red string of fate|red scarf]] similar to the one Naruto wore when they first met, [[Sakura Haruno]] offers to help her. Hinata becomes doubtful as Naruto receives a variety of gifts from others, including another scarf.

The Last Five Years (film)
 Cathy sits alone with a letter from her husband Jamie declaring their marriage over ("Still Hurting"). She removes her wedding rings, as well as her wristwatch and bracelet.  Five years earlier, Jamie is an up-and-coming Jewish writer who has just met Cathy. He is overjoyed to be dating outside his Jewish heritage ("Shiksa Goddess"), and declares, "I could be in love with someone like you."  Summer 2013: Cathy and Jamie are in [[Ohio]], where she is working in [[Summer stock theatre|summer stock]]. It is her birthday, and he has come to visit her. She is anxious to fix any problems in their marriage but she becomes angry when Jamie tells her he has to go back early to New York. She accuses him of egotism, of caring only about himself, and of being unwilling to spend time with her ("See I'm Smiling").  Jamie receives a phone call that ultimately leads to a book deal with Random House Publishing Group. He calls Cathy and agrees to move in with her.  He comments on how lucky he feels that he is getting a book published at age 23 and that he is in a relationship with Cathy ("Moving Too Fast"). Elsewhere at an audition, Cathy makes a call to her disinterested agent: it seems her career isn't going the way she planned, as she does not move on to the dance audition.  In late 2009 and early 2010, Cathy attends multiple social functions for the promotion of Jamie's novel and for celebrating its success (63 weeks as a bestseller). She sings about how his newfound fame and success in writing have changed their lives and jokes about how focused or "catatonic" he becomes in his writing process. She expresses that she feels the best way to love Jamie is to focus on him and his growing career. She chooses to "follow in his stride" and put herself and her dreams second to his new success. But she believes this sacrifice is the best way to support and love Jamie ("A Part of That").  After a horrible day working as a bartender, Cathy comes home to an excited Jamie. He tells her a new story he has written about an old tailor named Schmuel, who had given up on his dreams but is able to turn back time, and right past wrongs with the help of a magical clock. The story is complete with dancing and decorating the house and Cathy with Christmas decorations. After the story Jamie compares Cathy to Schmuel and encourages her to take more risks and continue to pursue her own dreams. For her Christmas present, Jamie gives her an appointment for new headshots, a [[Backstage (magazine)|Backstage]] magazine, and a wristwatch, as well as the promise to support her as she pursues acting ("The Schmuel Song").  In summer of 2010, Cathy is in Ohio doing summer stock and video chatting with Jamie who is still in New York. She describes to Jamie her disappointing life in Ohio, her dysfunctional and eccentric colleagues, and her desires to be back in New York and to never return to Ohio ("A Summer in Ohio"). At the end of this song it is revealed that she and Jamie are married.  Jamie and Cathy walk to a gazebo in [[Central Park]], sharing a conversation, though, at first, the audience only hears Jamie's side. Jamie proposes to her, Cathy eventually says yes, and they are then shown getting married in same location ("The Next Ten Minutes"). It is the only point in the film when the characters sing a duet and are in the same time and place. Afterwards, Cathy's side of the conversation at the gazebo is heard, as Cathy's timeline continues to moves towards the beginning of their relationship.  Jamie is facing and resisting temptation and advances from other women, especially now his fame as a writer has escalated (33 weeks as a bestseller). He expresses his desires to remain faithful to Cathy, and continues to try and resist ("A Miracle Would Happen"). Cathy, meanwhile, is auditioning for an off-Broadway role in New York ("When You Come Home to Me"). The audition goes well and she calls Jamie about her hopes for landing the role and not returning to Ohio for another summer. Another Christmas passes and Jamie gives Cathy a gold bracelet. Cathy is back at the summer theater in Ohio for the summer of 2011 and receives a text from Jamie about his coming to see her.  Cathy is shown unsuccessfully auditioning and calls Jamie to talk about her rejection and the fierce competition she has at these auditions. We next see Cathy attending a book reading for Jamie's book "Light out of Darkness."  At this event Cathy realizes that she does not want to be a suburban housewife or a "girl who requires a man to get by" ("Climbing Uphill").  Jamie and Cathy are having a bitter fight. Jamie wants Cathy to attend a party to celebrate the publishing of his book. She states she has been to so many of them only to be neglected and ignored by her husband. He decides he'll go but questions Cathy about why she really refuses to go with him. He suggests that the lack of success in acting (and having to go back to Ohio) is the reason. He says that he believes in her and that they would not be together if he didn't. He asks her to be supportive of him and the fact that he's living out his dream. He accuses her of being unsupportive of his career just because hers is failing ("If I Didn't Believe in You"). Cathy ultimately refuses to go with Jamie.  An unmarried Cathy is in the car with Jamie, who is going to meet her parents. She tells him about her past relationships and hopes not to end up in a small town life like her friend from high school and her parents ("I Can Do Better Than That"). Upon arriving to her parents' house, she asks Jamie to move in with her.  Near the end of the relationship, Jamie wakes up in his apartment beside multiple women, including his editor, Alise, and the receptionist at Random House ("Nobody Needs to Know"). About to leave for Ohio to visit Cathy, he tries to defend his actions and blames Cathy for destroying his privacy and their relationship. Jamie promises not to lie to Alise and tells her, "I could be in love with someone like you," just as he did to Cathy.  Cathy is ecstatic after her first date with Jamie ("Goodbye Until Tomorrow"). She proclaims that she has been waiting for Jamie her whole life. Simultaneously but five years after their first date, Jamie sits in their apartment writing a farewell letter to Cathy about how hard he tried to save her and their marriage and he couldn't find a way for them both to be happy ("I Could Never Rescue You").  As a hopeful Cathy waits for a tomorrow with Jamie, a discouraged Jamie tells Cathy "goodbye". He leaves behind his keys and wedding ring and then exits their apartment. Later that evening, we see Cathy return to the apartment and open the front door, which relates us back to the opening scene of the film. As Cathy closes the door, the film cuts to black.  
Last Flight (film)
 Disaster waits for those traveling aboard the last [[red-eye flight]] from a secluded Pacific island. The captain and chief flight attendant fight to save their passengers from an otherworldly storm of chaos and paranoia threatening their doomed aircraft.  
Last Shift
 Jessica Loren, a rookie police officer on her first assignment, is ordered to take the last shift at a police station before it is permanently closed. Her mother pleads with her not to take the job, as her father, also a police officer, was killed while on duty. After assuring her mother that the shift will be uneventful, she reports for duty. Loren surprises her commanding officer Cohen, who demands that she turn around. He leads her on a brief tour, during which he explains that a [[HAZMAT]] team will be there shortly to collect evidence that is difficult to dispose of and that she is not permitted to leave her post. Before he leaves, he gives Cohen his phone number in case of emergency.  Loren becomes bored and almost falls asleep, though she wakes when she hears knocking. She does not see anyone at the door but turns around to find a homeless man standing in the hallway; he urinates on the floor and refuses to leave. Loren takes him to a holding cell, where the door suddenly closes and locks behind her. The lights go out, a bloody-faced person surprises her in the door's window, and she drops her flashlight. An unidentified person picks it up and taunts her. When the lights come back on, the door opens and no one is there.  Loren is further unsettled when she sees chairs and doors moving on their own, ghostly figures appearing out of nowhere, and hears disembodied voices singing. She also receives a series of distress calls from a woman named Monica Young who says she has been taken hostage by a cult; the police dispatcher confirms that all emergency calls have been rerouted to the new station. Loren encounters a loiterer, Marigold, who tells her that she was in a cell when the police brought in an infamous cult, led by the charismatic John Michael Paymon. Marigold says the story told to the public, that the cult was killed at their residence, is untrue; instead, they committed suicide at the station one year ago to the day. Marigold leaves shortly after, humming the song Loren heard earlier.  Further paranormal events at the station reveal that the cult worships the king of Hell, a being also named [[Paimon]], said to reside in Hell before [[Satan]] was sent there. Before committing mass suicide, Paymon threatened to come back and destroy everything their arresting officers loved. Ryan Price, a fellow police officer, arrives at the station, and she accuses him of planning all the events as a hazing ritual. Confused, he insists he has come by to check up on her, as he had served with her father. Price confirms that the murderous cult was captured alive and tells her that her father, who died apprehending them, would be proud of her. As he leaves, Loren sees a bullet wound in the back of his head and he disappears.  After seeing several more visions of the cultists and their victims as the night continues, Loren calls Cohen and says that she cannot finish her shift, but repents when he threatens to fire her. The dispatcher tells Loren that Monica was the final victim of Paymon's cult and died over a year prior. A member of the cult takes Loren hostage, only to commit suicide in front of her. Loren tries to leave the station after evading a deformed girl, but the glass does not break when shot. Her dead father calls her and demands justice for his death, and she returns to the holding cell to find the homeless man's body hanged. Her father calls again to warn her of several cult members assaulting the station, and she kills them. As she shoots the last one, Cohen shoots her from behind. In a moment of clarity, she realizes that she has murdered the entire HAZMAT team. Cohen calls for medical assistance, and Loren is approached by the spirits of Paymon and his cultists as she bleeds out.  
The Last Survivors
 Ten years after rain ceases to fall, Oregon turns into a dry wasteland, and the survivors spend their time desperately trying to locate enough water to survive and avoiding hostile scavengers.  Kendal takes care of fellow orphan Dean, who is near death from kidney failure.  Her friend Gabriel, who lives on a nearby farm, urges her to join him, but she refuses to abandon Dean.  One day, after hearing a cry for help on their two-way radio, Kendal leaves to assist them.  She finds that it is a trap to ensnare the family's neighbors.  Kendal hides as marauders kill off the remaining family members, unable to save them, then sneaks back to her house in the dark.  As the local wells go dry, Dean theorizes that a local warlord, Carson, has drilled to the aquifer and is draining everyone's water supply.  Carson owns a small compound that he advertises as a safe haven.  Kendal's neighbor Grace, after her well goes dry, tells Kendal that she has accepted Carson's offer to join him.  Grace urges Kendal to accompany her and Gabriel, as she believes Carson has medicine that can help Dean.  Kendal remains skeptical and hides when Carson arrives.  Carson abruptly kills Gabriel's entire family, saying that everyone but Gabriel is either too old or infirm to save based on the limited amount of water available.  Though horrified, Gabriel reluctantly agrees and turns in a relative who was also hiding.  Kendal escapes after killing a sentry.  Kendal checks on Alby, a young boy who lives on his own.  She tells him of Dean's plan to escape via a Cessna that has been almost fully repaired; all they need is the proper distributor cap.  However, Alby says he is better able to survive on his own and asks her not to visit him so often, as it attracts Carson's attention.  After finally recovering the proper distributor cap from a car in Carson's compound, Kendal returns home again, only to find that three survivors have wandered onto their property in search of water.  Dean convinces Kendal to donate water to them, though Kendal remains suspicious of their intentions.  When they return shortly afterward, her suspicions are confirmed as they seek to steal the remaining water.  Dean, barely able to walk, shoots them before they can kill Kendal.  Drawn by the sound of gunshots as he surveys the local farms, Carson investigates.  Dean kills several of Carson's men before they kill him.  After killing one of his men, who has become wounded and thus a liability, Carson expresses regret that he is not able to save more of the survivors.  His lieutenant, a man in priest's garb, reassures him that what they do is for the greater good.  Kendal once again escapes after hiding from Carson's men and retrieves a katana from one the graves at Grace's farm.  Now armed, she returns to the house and kills the men left behind to search it, including the priest and Gabriel, whose identity was obscured by a mask.  When Kendal checks on Alby to invite him to escape with her on the Cessna, she discovers Carson has abducted him.  She attacks Carson's compound and kills all his henchmen.  When only Kendal, Carson, his daughter, and Alby remain, Carson attacks Kendal, who kills him with the katana.  Brooke, Carson's daughter, nearly defeats Kendal by putting her in a choke hold.  Kendal breaks free just before passing out and stabs Brooke with the sword.  She and Alby go to the Cessna and, after inserting the distributor cap, start it up.  As they board the plane, Alby asks about Dean, and Kendal says that he is staying behind.  
Left Behind (2014 film)
 [[University of Central Arkansas]] student [[Chloe Steele]] has flown in from college to surprise her father, pilot [[Rayford Steele]], for his birthday party. However, her mother [[Irene Steele|Irene]] quickly calls to inform her that her father cannot make it. While at the airport waiting for him, Chloe meets up with investigative reporter [[Cameron "Buck" Williams]].  Rayford shows up on his way to a flight and apologizes to Chloe for missing his birthday party, insisting he was called in to pilot a flight to London at the last minute. He also assures Chloe things are fine between himself and his wife, who recently had become an active believing Christian, much to Chloe's chagrin. Chloe suspects things are not fine between her father and mother – she had seen him flirting with flight attendant Hattie Durham and notices he has removed his wedding ring. Her suspicions soon are confirmed when an airport worker hands Chloe two hard-to-get [[U2]] concert tickets in London that Rayford had ordered, indicating his trip to London and possible extramarital fling was planned all along.  Chloe brushes off another one of her mother's preachings about Christianity and takes her brother to the mall. While there, her brother suddenly vanishes, leaving only his clothes behind. Chloe is shocked and notices this same thing has happened to numerous others at the mall. Mayhem breaks loose as shoppers begin looting the stores. A driver-less car plows through the mall windows, and a small plane without a pilot crashes in the mall parking lot. Chloe sees television reports of children and some adults disappearing, as worldwide panic sets in.  On Rayford's flight, the same strange event has occurred – several people, including his co-pilot Chris Smith, Kimmy, one of the flight attendants, and all the children on board, have simply disappeared, leaving their clothing and personal effects behind. The remaining passengers panic and demand answers. Rayford does his best to reassure the passengers he will pass on information once he has any. Rayford has difficulty getting radio or satellite phone contact with anyone on the ground, until he is finally informed that people have disappeared everywhere and the world is in uproar. Soon a pilot-less jet approaches directly into Rayford's flight path. He narrowly avoids a midair collision, but the jet damages Rayford's fuel line. He decides his only option is to return to New York and hope his fuel holds out.  On the ground, Chloe hears her father's mayday call on her cell phone and assumes his plane has crashed. She later finds her mother's jewelry left behind in the shower, as she has also disappeared. Chloe makes her way to New Hope Village Church to discover family pastor Bruce Barnes, who explains God has taken his believers to heaven, and the rest have to face the end of days. The pastor explains he was not taken because he did not really believe what he had preached. Rayford comes to the same conclusion by examining his copilot and stewardess' personal effects. He tells Hattie the truth about his wife. She is initially upset as she did not know he was married, but Rayford convinces her to be brave and to help calm the passengers down until they can safely land.  Chloe climbs to the top of a bridge, intending to jump off it and end her life, when she gets a call from Buck, who is in the cockpit with Rayford. Rayford explains to Chloe all the New York area airports are closed and the streets full, and he is low on fuel and has nowhere to land. Chloe finds an abandoned Ford truck and uses it to clear away the equipment from a bridge under construction in order to create a makeshift runway. She uses her compass app and tells Rayford the coordinates of the landing site. Rayford is able to glide to a rough landing, saving the passengers, who leave the plane only to see the world aflame. Buck mentions that it looks like the end of the world, while Chloe informs him that it is just the beginning.<ref></ref>  
Legend (2014 film)
   The film starts in 1989 where Jitendra ([[Jagapathi Babu]]) and his father, a ruthless don in Kurnool are in Vizag to meet Jitendra's proposed bride ([[Kalyani (actress)|Kalyani]]), the daughter of the local MLA. During their return, Jitendra accidents an aged man and also shoots a bystander who asked him to come out of the car. So, they both, along with their henchmen, are taken to the local landlord ([[Suman Talwar|Suman]]) who lives with his family, consisting of his mother; wife ([[Suhasini Maniratnam]]), who is a college lecturer; sister ([[Eashwari Rao]]); brother-in-law ([[Rao Ramesh]]); their children; son Jaidev (who is in his teens), daughter; and his trusted accomplice Raghavaiah ([[Chalapathi Rao]]). The landlord asks Jitendra to apologize to the injured persons and asks him to pay compensation. This hurts Jitendra's ego and he insults the people calling them as poor. The landlord angrily slaps him and gets him arrested, and thus, Jitendra vows to take revenge.  Jitendra's father (Ramaraju) then kidnaps the landlord's wife and Jaidev, and forces him to take back the complaint. Jitendra is released and he goes to the place where they are held captive. Much to his shock, he sees his father and many of their henchmen killed. One henchmen the reveals that Ramaraju had killed Jaidev's mother because he had hurt their ego and in rage Jaidev kills mostly all of them. Thus their enmity gets permanent. Back in the landlord's house, Jaidev's grandmother (Sujata Kumar) fears that he might be killed like his great-grandfather, grandfather and uncle, so she tells them to stop all this enmity. Meanwhile, Jitendra wants to take revenge and his anger rises day by day and he settles in Vizag along with all their henchmen and also kills his father in law as he tried to stop him.  Fearing the worst, the landlord sends all his family members abroad, but gets killed in hands of Jitendra, which prompts the family to decide that they will not come back to India.  The story shifts forward to present 2014, where Krishna ([[Nandamuri Balakrishna]]), is in Dubai where he saves a bunch of Indian girls to be sold in flesh trade and is planning to come back in Vizag along with his girlfriend Sneha ([[Sonal Chauhan]]) and guru Manikyam ([[Brahmanandam]]) to set talks about their marriage in India. He then meets with Sneha's father ([[Ahuti Prasad]]), who is also the business partner of Jitendra. When he returns from the airport, he saves a dock worker who was an ex-MLA from the hands of Jitendra's elder son Chotu ([[Saravanan (actor)|Saravanan]]) and his henchmen as they wanted to kill him, so that no evidence could be left for their pending cases. Krishna thrashes them badly, and this is noticed by two of Jaidev's former accomplices. Meanwhile, Chotu and the ex-MLA are both admitted to the same hospital. Chotu knows about this and goes to kill him, but in mysterious circumstances gets killed himself. The police, under the payroll of Jitendra, headed by a corrupt ACP, view the CCTV footage which show that the same person was present at both the spots. Enraged he finds about Krishna and goes to kill him. At the temple he shoots him and orders his second son and henchmen to kill the whole family including Sneha, but that the right time are saved by Jaidev (also [[Nandamuri Balakrishna]]), and elder brother of Krishna). Jaidev then kills all the henchmen and Jitendra's second son and the ACP and threatens the current MLA ([[Jaya Prakash Reddy]]) to face severe consequences if Jeetendra is not in control. He also reveals that it was him who killed Chotu in the hospital and not Krishna.

The Lego Movie
  In the [[Lego]] universe, populated by [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] [[Lego minifigure|minifigures]], the evil Lord Business finds a super-weapon called the "Kragle". The wizard Vitruvius attempts to stop him, but is blinded by Business's robots. Before Business leaves with the weapon, Vitruvius prophesies a person called "The Special" will find the "Piece of Resistance", a brick capable of stopping the Kragle.  Eight and a half years later, in the city of Bricksburg, construction worker Emmet Brickowski finds a woman, Wyldstyle, searching for something at his construction site after hours. When he investigates, Emmet falls into a hole and finds the Piece of Resistance. Compelled to touch it, Emmet experiences vivid visions and passes out. He awakens with the Piece of Resistance attached to his back, in the custody of Good Cop/Bad Cop, Lord Business's lieutenant.  Wyldstyle rescues Emmet, believing him to be the Special, and takes him to meet Vitruvius in the [[Lego Wild West|Old West]]. Emmet learns Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are "Master Builders"<ref name="EWKnowAllTheStuff"></ref> – people capable of building anything from their imagination without the need of instructions – who oppose Business. Wyldstyle explains that Business wants to use the Kragle (a tube of [[Cyanoacrylate|Krazy Glue]] with a weathered label) to freeze the world into perfection. Though disappointed to find Emmet is not a Master Builder, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius are convinced of his potential when he recalls visions of a seemingly human deity referred to as "The Man Upstairs".  Emmet, Wyldstyle and Vitruvius evade Bad Cop's forces with the aid of [[Batman]], Wyldstyle's boyfriend. They go to the hidden realm of [[Cloud Cuckoo Land]] to attend a council of Master Builders, all of whom are unimpressed with Emmet and refuse to fight Business. Bad Cop's forces attack, having placed a tracking device on Emmet, and capture everyone except Emmet, Wyldstyle, Batman, Vitruvius, and a small group of other Master Builders. Escaping, Emmet devises a plan to infiltrate Business's office tower and disarm the Kragle, but the group is captured and imprisoned in the Think Tank, where all the Master Builders are forced to make instructions. Trying to retaliate, Vitruvius is decapitated by Business, who sets a self-destruct protocol and leaves everyone to die, including Bad Cop.  As he dies, Vitruvius reveals he made up the prophecy. He soon reappears to Emmet as a ghost and reveals self-belief is what makes one the Special. Strapped to the self-destruct mechanism's battery, Emmet jumps into the abyss outside the tower and severs the connection, saving his friends. Inspired by Emmet's sacrifice, Wyldstyle rallies the Lego people across the universe to use whatever creativity they have to build machines and weapons to fight against Lord Business's forces.  Emmet finds himself in the human world as a Lego mini-figure, unable to move. The events of the story are being played out by a little boy named Finn on his father's expansive Lego set in their basement. His father, "The Man Upstairs", comes home from work and chastises his son for ruining the set by creating variations of different playsets, and proceeds to rebuild and glue his perceived perfect creations together. Realizing the danger his friends are in, Emmet wills himself to move and gains Finn's attention.  Finn returns Emmet and the Piece of Resistance to the set, where Emmet now possesses the powers of a Master Builder and confronts Business. Meanwhile, Finn's father looks at his son's creations and realizes Finn had based the villainous Business on him and his [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]]. Through a speech Emmet gives Business, Finn reconciles with his father, and the two unglue the constructions with [[White spirit|mineral spirits]], which plays out as Business having a change of heart, capping the Kragle, and thawing his victims. Emmet is hailed as a hero and begins a romantic relationship with Wyldstyle with Batman's blessing.  As a result of Finn's father allowing Finn's younger sister to join them in playing with his Lego sets, aliens from the planet [[Lego Duplo|Duplon]] beam down on the Lego world and announce their plans to destroy everyone.  
The Legend of Hercules
 In 1200 BC [[ancient Greece]], King [[Amphitryon]] of [[Tiryns]] invades [[Argos]]. Amphitryon eventually fights rival King Galenus in personal combat, killing Galenus and seizing his kingdom. Queen [[Alcmene]] is disgusted by her husband's thirst for power and warmongering. She prays to [[Hera]] for guidance and Hera, wife of [[Zeus]], tells her that she will allow Zeus to impregnate Alcemene with the savior of her people, a demi-god son to be named [[Hercules]]. The only other witness to this is Chiron, the queen's loyal adviser. Amphitryon names his new "son" Alcides, though Alcmene secretly acknowledges his true name as Hercules.  Twenty years later, Prince Alcides (Hercules) is the lover of Princess [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] of [[Crete]]. Hercules and his older brother, Prince [[Iphicles]], are attacked by a Nemean lion, which Iphicles says cannot be killed, and their spears literally bounce off its hide.  Hercules, no longer with spear, straddles the lion from behind and wrestles it until he's choked the life out of the giant cat. Iphicles takes all the credit and arrives at a royal banquet wearing the lion's pelt as a cloak and calls his brother a coward, though Hebe sees through this lie. At the banquet Amphitryon announces the engagement of Hebe and Iphicles, while Hercules is sent away to a military campaign in [[Egypt]].  Alcemene tells him of his true lineage and that his name is Hercules, not Alcides. Hercules vows to return to Hebe in three moons, before her impending nuptials. He joins the command of Captain Sotiris in the Egyptian desert, where their small company is ambushed, leaving "Alcides" and Sotiris as the last survivors. When the leader of the ambush demands to know where the prince is, Sotiris gestures to the body of a slain soldier, while Hercules finally uses his gods-given name to conceal his identity as the prince. It is revealed that Amphitryon arranged the ambush to eliminate Hercules. The two are sold off as slaves to a promoter of [[gladiator]] style fights, where they excel. The two ask the promoter to take them to Greece to fight in an arena battle, where the two will fight six undefeated gladiators and potentially make the promoter a wildly rich man. When Sotiris is injured in a battle before leaving for Greece, Hercules convinces the promoter to set Sotiris free and he will fight all six gladiators himself. Sotiris secretly follows him to Greece.  Alcmene and Hebe mourn the death of Alcides/Hercules. When Alcmene seeks guidance from Hera, Amphitryon discovers her and learns the truth of Hercules' parentage and that he is fated to overthrow him. Amphitryon stabs Alcmene with her own dagger, then tells Chiron that the Queen committed suicide in her grief. Meanwhile, Hercules arrives in Greece and easily beats the six gladiators in battle. The people celebrate his victory and deserters of Amphitryon's army join him and Sotiris.  Hebe is in anguish after the death of Alcides and dreads her pending wedding to Iphicles. She tries to leap off the roof of the palace but is saved by Chiron, who brings her to Hercules. Amphitryon's army begins to desert him, forcing him to hire foreign mercenaries when Hercules and Sotiris begin a fight against Amphitryon's campaign of tyranny. Iphicles threatens Sotiris' son's life, forcing Sotiris to lead him to Hercules. Iphicles is surprised to discover that Hercules is Alcides. Hercules is chained and publicly flogged, then watches in horror as Iphicles murders Chiron under Amphitryon's orders. In anguish he acknowledges Zeus as his father and calls upon him for strength. Hercules breaks free from his chains and kills Amphitryon's guard, though Amphitryon and Iphicles escape.  Hercules and Sotiris raise an army and storm Amphitryon's palace. Amphitryon's palace guard join Hercules and his army and they battle Amphitryon's mercenaries. Hercules calls upon his father who infuses his sword with the power of lightning. Hercules defeats the mercenaries with his lightning sword, then meets Amphitryon in personal combat. Hercules nearly defeats Amphitryon but Iphicles holds Hebe hostage and threatens to kill her if Hercules does not let Amphitryon go. Hercules hesitates but Hebe thrusts the dagger through her shoulder, killing Iphicles. Hercules finally avenges Alcmene's death and kills Amphitryon with the same blade that killed his mother. Hercules rushes to Hebe's side as she slowly drifts into unconsciousness. Nearly a year later, the cries of a baby are heard, Hercules' and Hebe's baby boy. That night, he watches over his kingdom, finally fulfilling his destiny.

Leprechaun: Origins
 A young couple, Catherine and Francois, are attempting to escape from a figure who eventually catches and drags Francois to his death. It also grabs hold of Catherine just before she arrives at a monolith in a grassland.  Four American college friends, Sophie, Ben, Jeni, and David are vacationing at an [[Ireland|Irish]] countryside at Sophie's behest. The driver, Ian, lets them go at the monolith seen in the beginning. Sophie, who is a history bachelor, takes note of the monolith's symbol before heading to a local bar with the others, where they meet with a friendly old man, Hamish, who tells them about the history of the village: it was formerly a mining center for gold obtained in a nearby cavern, but when the gold ran out, the population dwindled. The four agree to be taken to a cottage where they can begin hitchhiking to the cavern, though they are wary of Hamish and his grumpy son, Sean.   That night, Jeni investigates a ruckus outside and glimpses a figure sprinting past the window. She wakes the others, who discover that Hamish and Sean had locked them up. A figure suddenly enters the cottage through the fireplace and forcibly takes Jeni's gold earring. After a brief struggle which sees David's leg being bitten by the monster, the four escape the cottage and race to the village hall, where they hide in the cellar. From a mythology book, Sophie learns that the monster is a [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], also known as the [[leprechaun]], who owns the gold that the villagers sought after. Hamish and the villagers refused to return the gold and didn't want to leave the village. In return for the gold, the villagers have to sacrifice at least two humans each year as "compensation". The leprechaun lusts after gold, but it can be repelled by a certain symbol, the same one carved into the monolith, which serves as a barrier beyond which the being cannot get out. There was another monolith symbol barrier at the leprechaun's cave; however, when the villagers mined the cave and took the gold, the cave collapsed, causing the leprechaun to escape 15 years ago.    The four are confronted by Hamish, who confirms that the villagers sacrifice tourists each year to avoid having to sacrifice themselves, and Sean, who has grown weary of the unjustified sacrifices, eventually lets them go. The four take the offer to escape by an old woman, Mary, who is revealed to be Hamish's accomplice. The four are then tied to trees as offerings for the leprechaun. The monster arrives and rips out Jeni's golden tongue ring. David manages to get the leprechaun away from Jeni, but the beast slashes his torso, also cutting the rope, allowing him to break free and release the other three before he is attacked and killed. The remaining trio head back to the cottage to set a trap to kill the monster, but the leprechaun tricks Sophie and Ben into striking Jeni with their axes, killing her.  Sophie and Ben fetch Hamish's truck but are cornered by the leprechaun inside the village hall. The leprechaun eventually gets hold of Ben and kills him by ripping his spine out. Though cornered by Hamish, who is still intent on sacrificing her, Sophie is saved by Sean, who pushes Hamish into the cellar out of guilt for letting his father and the villagers sacrifice so many people over the years. The leprechaun kills Hamish in the cellar, much to Sean's devastation (Sean is never seen again; presumably the leprechaun killed him too or he escaped). Meanwhile, Sophie boards Hamish' truck but crashes midway while trying to avoid the leprechaun. She resumes her escape on foot and when the leprechaun finds her she distracts it with gold coins, then decapitates it using Francois' knife, which he had left in the prologue. Sophie finally manages to cross the monolith to safety just as 3 leprechauns are revealed, before continuing her escape.  
Leopardi (film)
 The film tells the story of the short life of the great Italian poet [[Giacomo Leopardi]]. He was a noble, born in [[Recanati]], and soon began to study Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic and English in the rich library of his palace that his father built. Giacomo, however, possessing an inquisitive, restless spirit, would like to travel abroad to widen his views and enrich his knowledge, as was usual for European [[landed gentry]] in the 19th century, though this desire is at odds with his parents (even if his father had a sensibility akin to his, he is too bound by the [[social conventions]] and the expectations tied to his role as '[[Pater Familias]]'; his mother, on the other hand, is too busy shoring up the household declining fortunes to even care about intellectual aspirations). So the poet begins to write his first works, reflecting on the [[human condition]], coming to the conclusion that [[unhappiness]] is a constant factor of [[human existence]], and that in life there is no remedy for this problem. In the 1820s, Leopardi can finally leave his native Recanati, and begin to travel to [[Rome]] and [[Florence]] where, however, his high expectations of intellectual rewards and public recognition are not achieved. He suffered from repeated instances of unrequited love: that he chiefly felt towards the Countess Fanny Targioni Tozzetti, contributing to Leopardi's negative view of life and human experience. He finally moves to [[Naples]], where a physical affliction results in his premature death.

At the police station, she is greeted by Sgt Jim Macready, who charges Caesar with reckless driving. Heggie radios PCs Jennifer Mundie and Jack Warnock to find the victim before taking Caesar to the cells, where he joins his teacher, Mr. Ralph Beswick, arrested for beating his wife.  Mundie and Warnock, having found Six, bring him to the station, mute and covered in scratches and carrying only a notebook with lists of names. Heggie phones Dr. Duncan Hume to examine him. However, upon examination, Hume experiences a flashback and attempts to kill Six for supposedly knowing what he did. Hume is placed in a cell, and Six is identified as having the fingerprints of an old man who died over 20 years ago. Six makes several references to [[Old Testament]] justice before Macready also suffers a flashback and angrily has Heggie and Mundie place Six in cell six. Mundie also has a flashback to beating a prisoner with Warnock.  Macready has Mundie and Warnock go to Hume's house to find his wife before also driving to his own home. Heggie researches the names in Six's notebook, who are all deceased criminals. In the cells, Six, who displays [[supernatural]] powers, quizzes Beswick about the true reason why he beats his wife. Unsatisfied with Beswick's answers, Six induces him to attempt suicide. Caesar alerts Heggie, who allows Hume to examine Beswick, who dies after claiming to know who Six is. Elsewhere, Mundie and Warnock enter Hume's house and find he has murdered his family. Macready hurriedly disposes of a dismembered body in his fridge along with the body of his boyfriend, whon he had beaten to death in a jealous rage.  Hume helps Heggie carry Beswick upstairs, but he attacks her when she learns about his family. After restraining him, she returns him to his cell. Six reveals he knows about Heggie's childhood abuse, and, when she leaves, he offers Caesar [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]] if he confesses to a second hit and run accident from earlier in the night when he ran over a young girl and left her to die. Mundie and Warnock return and drag Hume to interrogation, ignoring Caesar's attempt to confess. As Hume confesses to Mundie about killing his family out of [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] boredom with his career and a desire to unlock the secret of immortality, Warnock talks to Six and has a flashback to staging the suicide of the man he and Mundie had beaten. Enraged, Warnock rushes to interrogation and brutally kills Hume in front of Heggie and Mundie. Heggie is threatened into remaining silent.  Caesar confesses to Heggie about hitting the girl, but Six says it is too late for redemption, as the girl had died two minutes earlier where Caesar left her next to the road. Heggie also has a flashback and remembers that Six had distracted her childhood abuser, allowing her time to escape. Six informs her Mundie and Warnock are planning to kill her. Heggie fights Mundie and Warnock, who nearly succeed in strangling her, until the sudden return of Macready, now insane, wrapped in barbed wire, wielding a shotgun and quoting verses from the Bible. He shoots and kills Warnock, then wounds both Heggie and Mundie as they barricade themselves in the cells. While Macready sets the building on fire, Six makes references to his [[Satan|true identity]], of losing an argument with "[[God|an old friend]]" about human sin, and being an outcast like Heggie. He offers to help her, but only if she asks him to. She refuses.  While escaping, Mundie slips and cuts her throat on a broken window and is killed by Macready's pressing of her throat further onto the broken glass with his rifle butt, and then Macready further wounds Heggie before killing Caesar with his gun after scarring his face. Heggie throws Macready's fuel can at him, which he accidentally shoots. Mortally wounded in the explosion, he quotes another bible verse, after which Heggie responds "Amen" and kills him by crushing his face in with the battering ram. Heggie escapes the police station, and Six appears, unburnt, with his notebook, which he reveals has everybody's name inside. He crosses off every name except Heggie's and condemns the others to Hell for their various sins. Six reveals he is in love with Heggie and offers her a place at his side to seek vengeance on the guilty; she agrees, and they kiss.  
Let's Be Cops
 Two longtime friends, Justin Miller (Wayans), a struggling [[video game]] designer, and Ryan O'Malley (Johnson), an unemployed, washed-up former college [[quarterback]], recall a pact they once made: if they hadn't "made it" in [[Los Angeles]] by the time they were thirty, they would head back to their [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] hometown. As they leave a bar, their car is hit by a Mercedes Benz G500 driven by an Albanian gang, who intimidate them into not retaliating.  Justin attempts to pitch a video game about [[policemen]], but the idea is rudely dismissed by his boss, Todd. Later, Ryan convinces him to use the police uniforms from his presentation as costumes for their college reunion party. Upon attending, they meet many successful former classmates and both are confronted with a sense of failure and they mutually accept to honor their pact. As they walk home, they are treated like real cops and decide to enjoy the gag. They kick the Albanian gang out of Georgie's, a local diner. It allows Justin to finally get the attention of Josie, a waitress to whom he is attracted and who works at the said diner.  Ryan decides to take the hoax further than one night. He learns official procedures on YouTube and buys a used Ford Crown Victoria [[police cruiser]], modifying it with decals to resemble a real [[LAPD]] car. Although reluctant, Justin agrees to continue the charade, and through it, begins a relationship with Josie. Ryan gets revenge on the Albanians who hit his car, unaware they are actually mobsters blackmailing the owner of Georgie's. During their many shenanigans, Ryan and Justin end up on a real distress call with Patrol Officer Segars. The experience shakes Justin, who realizes they face serious jail time if exposed. He tries to "retire," but gets a phone call from Josie about a man frequently harassing her at work. It turns out to be Mossi Kasic, the leader of the same [[Albanian mafia|Albanian gang]]. Once more, the pair are intimidated into doing nothing.  Via Segars, Ryan obtains surveillance equipment to gather evidence and put Mossi away, along with an unidentified partner who has been investigating the pair. Ryan convinces Justin to do an undercover operation to obtain information on an incriminating shipment of crates. During the mission, they discover the crates full of SWAT equipment and weapons, along with [[secret tunnel]]s that run between Mossi's club and Georgie's restaurant. This necessitates the acquisition of the restaurant, explaining the blackmail. After a few close encounters with the mobsters, they barely escape. Fed up, Justin insists on mailing the evidence anonymously, but Ryan, finding purpose in his life again, is set on delivering it personally. They fight, and part ways.  Ryan brings his evidence to Segars, who recommends it go to the highest authority, which is Detective Brolin. Unfortunately, Brolin is actually Mossi's business partner. After instantly recognizing each other, Ryan makes it out of the station, but his sudden threat has blown their cover. Meanwhile, Justin decides to "man up" and, in uniform, assertively pitches his game again. One of Brolin's officers shows up to try and kill him, inadvertently helping to sell the pitch. Ryan is abducted, and Mossi sends a threatening message to Justin. Overwhelmed, Justin pleas to Segars for help after admitting everything. He also confesses to Josie that he is not a real cop, which he had made previous attempts to do, and she disgustedly leaves him.

Thanks to the respective confidence and motivation gained during their impersonations, Justin has become a successful game developer, while Ryan graduates from the police academy as a true, fully-fledged member of the LAPD. Justin apologizes to Josie, and after she forgives him, they rekindle their relationship. Ryan, however, still has not given up on their fun as cops together, and convinces Justin to don the fake uniform once again and join him on patrol.

However, he changes his mind and drives back to the Slocum house.  He finds the house is in disarray, with Geenie and Beth in the kitchen. Tied to a stove, Beth has become a full-fledged, bloodthirsty zombie, having eaten Maury and bitten off Geenie's hand.

He reveals that their parents are still alive, having escaped to a safehouse. Kyle gives Zach his handgun, reminding him that Beth is suffering.  On their hike, Zach and Beth stop by a cliff. He tearfully apologizes to her for never doing the things she wanted when she was still alive. They say "I love you" to each other, and Zach shoots her in the head.  Zach is reunited with his family at the safehouse, along with a traumatized Erica ([[Anna Kendrick]]), who was forced to kill her own grandmother. The survivors make plans to leave town but, suddenly, the power returns and a TV news story shows things inexplicably going back to normal. Zach visits the graves of Beth and Maury, leaving Beth's scarf on her tombstone, and a knight chess piece on Maury's. Zach's mom picks him up in her car, with Erica in the backseat.

Leviathan (2014 film)

The town's crooked Mayor Vadim ([[Roman Madyanov]]) has undertaken a legal plot to [[expropriate]] the land on which Kolya's house is built.  The mayor's plan is supposedly to build a telecommunications mast on Kolya's property, offering a grossly undervalued sum for compensation, although Kolya believes that his real plan is to build a villa for himself. Kolya's long-time friend Dima ([[Vladimir Vdovichenkov]]), a sharp and successful lawyer from Moscow, attempts to fight the [[expropriation]] through the local court system.  During the course of the trial, Kolya is arrested for shouting at corrupt police officers in a police station. When the trial rules in favor of the mayor, Dima manages to get him to step back, and to secure Kolya's release from jail, by threatening him with compromising documents. However, during Kolya's absence, Lilya engages in an impromptu sexual encounter with Dima.  During an outing with Kolya's friend Ivan Stepanich (Sergei Bachursky), Roma witnesses Lilya and Dima having sex and Kolya finds out about the affair, assaulting the couple. Meanwhile, Mayor Vadim visits his friend, a local [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] bishop (Valeriy Grishko), for spiritual comfort, who tells him that all power comes from God and encourages him to solve his problems forcefully. Subsequently, Vadim and his thugs abduct Dima and carry out a mock execution, advising him to return to Moscow. Afterwards Vadim continues his drive to expropriate Kolya's house.  The last appearance of Dima shows him looking out of the window of a train, ostensibly en route back to Moscow.  Lilya returns home to Kolya, but she is depressed by the public revelation of her affair. While the family is packing to move out, Kolya corners Lilya in the basement and forces her into a spontaneous sexual act. Roma witnesses the event and flees the house, collapsing in tears by a whale skeleton on the shore. He returns home late at night, and explicitly blames Lilya for everything that is going wrong in their lives.  That night, Lilya is unable to sleep and leaves the house in the early morning. The next morning she does not turn up at work and her phone is switched off. Her body is discovered a few days later. A mournful Kolya starts drinking even more and, meeting a priest, asks why God is doing this to him. The Orthodox priest, who is a pious man, quotes from the Biblical book of Job, and counsels Kolya that, when Job accepted his fate, he was rewarded by God with a long and happy life.  The next day, Kolya is arrested. The police claim to have evidence that he raped Lilya and murdered her with a blow to the head, using a blunt object. Evidence against him includes his and Lilya's own friends' testimonies about threats he made to Lilya and Dima when he discovered their affair, and one of his shop hammers being shaped "similarly" to the wound in her head. Kolya is convicted of murder and sentenced to fifteen years in a maximum-security prison. With no family left, Roma reluctantly agrees to be taken in by Kolya's former friends, to avoid being sent to an orphanage. Mayor Vadim then receives a call informing him of Kolya's sentence, and he gloats and says that Kolya got what he deserved for having stood up against him.  In the end, Kolya's house is torn down and Mayor Vadim's project is revealed: a lavish Orthodox Church for his friend the bishop. The film concludes with a sermon by the bishop, with the mayor in attendance. The bishop extols the virtues of God's truth versus the world's truth, and says that good intentions do not excuse evil acts. He urges the congregation not to act with force or cunning, but to put their trust in Christ.

The dying dam inspector throws a [[USB flash drive|pen drive]] containing details about the proposed plan to destroy the dam into an abandoned [[Shiva]] temple near the dam and warns the village head Karunakara ([[Kasinathuni Viswanath|K. Viswanath]]) that the temple has to be opened as soon as possible, after which he passes away. Karunakara and the villagers are of the opinion that the temple can only be opened by the descendant of Raja Lingeswaran ([[Rajnikanth]]), who built the dam as well as the Shiva temple. Lakshmi ([[Anushka Shetty]]), the granddaughter of Karunakara and a television journalist, goes on a search to find the Raja's descendant. She soon manages to find the descendant, whose name is Lingeswaran [[also known as|aka]] Lingaa ([[Rajnikanth]]). Lingaa is the grandson of Raja Lingeswaran, but is a petty thief with his family having now fallen on hard times. He holds a grudge against his grandfather, feeling that he had brought down his family into poverty by squandering all his wealth and hence refuses to go with Lakshmi to Solaiyur. However, Lakshmi implicates Lingaa in a robbery, as a result of which the police pursue Lingaa. Lingaa is forced to accept Lakshmi's invitation to avoid getting caught and travels with her to Solaiyur.  At Solaiyur, Lingaa finds out that the [[Lingam]] installed at the Shiva temple is made of ''Maragatham stone ([[Emerald]])'', which is extremely valuable, so at midnight, he enters the Shiva temple with the intention to steal the Lingam. But he is noticed by one of the dam's security guards, who immediately alerts all the villagers including Lakshmi, Karunakara and Nagabhushan, to the temple courtyard. Aware of the villagers' presence, Lingaa pretends to perform pooja to the Lingam. This fools the villagers, who find it auspicious that the grandson of Raja Lingeswaran is performing pooja to the Shiva Lingam installed at the temple built by the Raja at on the occasion of [[Maha Shivaratri]]. Karunakara then tells everyone present, including Lingaa, the story of Raja Lingeswaran.  Raja Lingeswaran, the very rich ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Kodiyur, best civil engineer from Cambridge and a [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|civil services officer]]. He becomes the collector of Madurai district, and arrives at Solaiyur village. There the people tell him that they have no water for 9 months per year, and the other 3 months they have heavy rainfall and floods. They are unable to store water and the resulting famines cause hundreds of deaths every year. Though the collector applies to construct a dam, his plan is rejected in the annual collectors' meeting and he is forced to approve a new railroad from Tuticorin to Kochi through Madurai for goods. He refuses to do so and is blackmailed that he will be fired. He immediately resigns his job and exits.  Later the scene shifts to a palace, wherein all the British and Indian guests arrive in the background of a birthday party given by the erstwhile Maharaja of Kodiyur. It is later revealed that, the Maharaja is none other than Lingeshwaran (Rajinikanth). In the context of hospitality, the Maharaja lets slip that he resigned his post of Collector in order to serve the people of his native. When inquired about it, he expresses his wish to construct a dam at Solaiyur, with his own money and man power, claiming all he needed was only a signature in the form of permission from the British Government. The Governor approves it (after a discreet conversation with his lieutenants, plotting to gain something out of it), gives permission along with a signed order the next day. Though he faces multiple difficulties, the dam is constructed with the help of local man power from the Solaiyur village. It is shown that the Solaiyur village people are very co-operative with Raja Lingeshwaran and work with him cordially, except for small feud and near stoppage of work due to a caste remark ignited by Sambandam ([[R. Sundarrajan (director)|R. Sundarrajan]]), who is later understood to be a spy for the British Collector. Bharathi ([[Sonakshi Sinha]]), the daughter of a villager starts to fall for Raja Lingeshwaran. Finally, the dam is almost completed except for the shaft doors. The doors are being held in custody by the new collector as stolen goods and the floods are soon to occur. Raja Lingeshwaran negotiates with the new collector who proposes that the king gives him all his property (100% of the entire yield) as bribe and all credit of constructing the dam goes to him and British government. The king with whole heart does so. Apart from that, he sells his Palace, gold and silver and other lands he possesses to gain back the land grabbed by the new collector. Sambandam plays a trick here by bringing the villagers to the palace at the same time when Raja gives away his property documents, gold and silver, and makes them believe that, the Raja is a spy of the British. The dam is fully constructed in 1939 at Solaiyur to solve the water problems of that village. The British lie to the villagers that the Raja was a British spy who would hand over the dam and all the villagers' lands to the British once the dam was completed. However, the freedom fighter, Kavi barathi ([[Radha Ravi]]) and another set of few people believe that, the raja is really innocent. The irate villagers throw the Raja out of Solaiyur. The Raja boards a train with Sami Pillai, and Bharathi, who joins him apart from his foreboding. Truth comes out in the form of the Collector's wife when she confronts the villagers when they come to meet him for taking back the land which was taken. She reveals that the agreement signed by Raja Lingeshwaran was almost burned by the Collector's assistant and she in time retrieved it and shows them the document, there by revealing the true identity of the Collector. Later, the villagers realize Sambandam's double play and chase him. unable to face the villagers and due to his own guilt, he jumps off the dam wall and drowns in the reservoir. After a long search, the villagers find the Raja and his wife Bharathi, but living in poverty. After unsuccessfully trying to convince the Raja to return to Solaiyur, the villagers decided to keep the Shiva temple which was built along with the dam, closed until the Raja or his descendants returned to the village. Lingaa, on hearing the Raja's story, changes his opinion about his grandfather and decides to mend his ways.  Story unfolds again when Lingaa decides to leave the village. He is stopped by the Chief ([[K. Viswanath]]), asking to stay behind, as he feels something bad is about to happen to the village, as it almost happened 70 years back. It is revealed that the honest Dam inspector ([[Ponvannan]]) was killed by MP and the new inspector ([[Jayaprakash]]) would be inspecting the dam for a name sake, thereby drilling holes in the dam, to be filled with explosives later by MP's personnel. Finally, the same is revealed to the entire village and broadcast to all Government offices the plot by MP, which was secretly shot by Lakshmi. After an ensuing fight, Lingaa makes the bomb to explode in the water, instead on the dam and the movie ends with Lingaa and Lakshmi, who are now in love with each other, leaving Solaiyur, with Lingaa deciding to return once he has done something good in life like his grandfather.

A Little Chaos
 [[King Louis XIV of France]] assigns the design and construction of the [[Gardens of Versailles]] to [[André Le Nôtre]]. Le Nôtre interviews several other gardeners who submitted designs for the project, including one woman who works alone, Sabine de Barra. He sees her move a potted plant in his garden prior to her interview, and questions her deference to order in design. Sabine affirms her respect for his work and suggests that she would like to create something uniquely French rather than follow classical and renaissance styles. He shows her the door in record time, and she leaves disheartened.  [[File:BosquetRocailles02.jpg|thumb|350px|''Bosquet de la Salle-de-Bal'' at [[Gardens of Versailles]], laid out by [[André Le Nôtre]] between 1680 and 1683.]] On the night after her interview, André surprises Sabine at her home and tasks her with responsibility for an outdoor ballroom surrounded by a fountain and landscaping. André's plans had called for a constant supply of water from a great distance at great expense. Sabine devises another engineering solution based on a reservoir from which water can be continuously recycled through the fountains she has designed. She makes little progress at first, with workmen recommended by one of the men rejected by  André, until another competitor, Thierry Duras, intervenes and offers the use of his crew.  As a beautiful commoner Sabine stands out at court, attracting attention, and is befriended by the King's brother Duc [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d'Orleans]] and his wife [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine]]. At times, Sabine appears haunted by brief glimpses of a young girl or a girl's voice she hears calling. She is attracted to André but does not act on her feelings, while André quietly endures the infidelities of his wife Françoise, who insists that her husband's success is founded on her influence at court. When Françoise warns him against an affair with Sabine, he quotes her own speech declaring their right to seek comfort elsewhere, and becomes resolute in his intention to pursue a relationship with Sabine.  [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Queen Maria Theresa]] dies suddenly. André informs his wife, who is shaken at the prospect that this will lessen her influence at court. The king is shocked at the loss of his wife and takes refuge in his gardener's work area, amongst the pear trees. Sabine finds the king there as she delivers perennials for a trade, first mistaking him for the gardener. After she recognizes him she agrees to continue their conversation as equals. She finds great favour in the king's eyes, and he invites her to travel with him and his court to his palace and gardens at [[Fontainebleau]].  On a stormy day, Louis XIV visits Sabine's work site and assesses the project skeptically but allows it to proceed. After he leaves, Sabine is visited by Françoise, who tells her that André's passionate intentions are only a whim and will prove short-lived. After they both leave, Françoise's lover opens the sluice gates from the reservoir and floods the work site, destroying much of the earthworks. Sabine nearly drowns trying to close the gate, and André saves her.  Afterwards, André finds a glove that belongs to his wife Françoise. He returns the glove and ends their relationship.  Sabine goes to court again, where [[Antoine Nompar de Caumont|Duc de Lauzun]] introduces her to the king's mistress, the [[Marquise de Montespan]], who in turn introduces her to the women of the court. At first they tease her, but when they learn she is widowed and lost her 6-year-old daughter, they reveal their own losses and welcome her into their circle, where they often discuss topics the king forbids at court, including the deaths of their children. The Marquise formally presents Sabine to the King when he arrives, and Sabine offers him a four-seasons rose. They converse about the nature of the rose and its life cycle, hardships and death, and the gardener's responsibilities. It is Sabine's veiled defense of the aging Madame de Montespan, who has begun to lose the king's favor.  André waits for Sabine outside her room that night, and they finally make love. In the morning, André finds himself alone in bed. Sabine is upstairs, lost in the memory of the day her daughter and husband died. He told Sabine he had a mistress that he is going to visit her, taking their daughter with him. As they are leaving Sabine sees that the carriage has a faulty wheel and races after them, and when she stops in front of the carriage it topples off the road and down a hill, killing both father and daughter. André finds Sabine in the grip of this memory and convinces her to stop blaming herself for their deaths.  When Sabine's project is complete, the king and his court arrive for its inauguration. To the music of a hidden orchestra, everyone begins dancing as the fountains send water coursing down the tiers around the ballroom floor. Sabine and André leave the others dancing and walk into the garden together.

This does not stop Spanky. He suggests a pet washing business, which quickly goes haywire after he mistakenly replaces a bottle of shampoo with one containing green dye. The fur of several pets turns green, including Darla's cat. Alfalfa tries to make up for it by offering Darla a ride to the library on his bicycle, but she instead decides to go with Waldo in his toy car. This gives Spanky the idea for the Rascals to build their own taxi cab. This business also ends poorly after Waldo cuts the car's brake wires, sending them down a steep hill and into a gazebo. Darla, who was riding in the taxi, once again leaves Alfalfa for Waldo. Officer Kennedy, who has constantly had his dates with Miss Crabtree interrupted by the Rascals, yells at the kids for ruining yet another attempt at proposing marriage to the schoolteacher. Angered that Kennedy does not like children, Miss Crabtree breaks up with him.  Spanky next decides to have Alfalfa get into the wrestling ring against the mysterious Masked Marvel. Porky is to play Alfalfa's opponent, but he accidentally tells to Waldo. Waldo then hires Butch and The Woim to stop Alfalfa from winning the wrestling match. Butch takes Porky's place in the ring and easily beats Alfalfa. To make matters worse, Waldo convinces Spanky to bet the money he had made from the match to him in the event that Alfalfa loses. Angered at their leader's poor decision and his bossy attitude, the rest of the gang turn against Spanky, but after a talk with Grandma, Spanky is able to rekindle his friendship with the others. The kids now begin rehearsing for the talent show, their last chance at earning the $10,000 for Grandma. Meanwhile, Miss Crabtree agrees to continue dating Officer Kennedy on the condition that he attends the kids' talent show with her. Kennedy reluctantly agrees.  At the talent show, the gang are up against several professional acts including a song-and-dance routine by Waldo and Darla, but Waldo continuously pushes Darla out of the spotlight and she eventually leaves him after he attempts to sabotage the International Silver String Submarine Band's performance. The band's rendition of "I Got You Babe" starts poorly and gradually gets fair, and gets even better when Darla arrives to sing with Alfalfa. The Rascals win the $10,000, Darla officially joins the gang's band (and becomes Alfalfa's girlfriend), Grandma's bakery is saved, and Miss Crabtree agrees to marry Officer Kennedy.  In a mid-credit sequence, Waldo gets a "tree house" from his Dad as promised, in the form of a miniature of their own huge mansion. When his Dad offers Waldo to christen it himself, Waldo proudly announces it a members-only place and strikes the bottle to one of its pillars. However, instead of the bottle, the pillar develops a crack, which then spreads throughout the house and within a moment, it shatters to dust. Waldo's Dad comments to a shocked Waldo, that he might still have the receipt.  
The Living
 Teddy wakes up from a night of binge drinking.  His wedding band is missing, and his fist is bloodied.  When he cannot find his wife, Molly, he visits his mother-in-law's house.  There, Molly's mother, Angela, and her brother, Gordon, explain that she wants nothing to do with him, as he beat her severely while drunk.  Teddy protests that he does not remember the incident and calls out an apology to Molly.  Angela and Gordon warn him off; to their consternation, Molly leaves with Teddy, though she warns him that it is not a reconciliation.  She is only returning to the house, not to their relationship.  At the same time, Angela berates Gordon for not sticking up more for his sister.  At a bar, Gordon tells a friend that he wants Teddy dead.  His friend suggests a friend-of-a-friend, an ex-convict, may be willing to take the job cheap.  Gordon does not answer, and instead suggests they return to work.  There, at a supermarket, he runs into Teddy and Molly, who did not realize he had exchanged shifts.  After apologizing for his behavior, Teddy gives Gordon the opportunity to throw a punch at him.  Gordon awkwardly declines and once again tells his friend how he wishes Teddy were dead.  His friend offers to get the ex-con's number, and Gordon noncommittally agrees.  At their house, Angela again berates Gordon for not being assertive enough to ask for better pay.  At their house, Molly insists that Teddy move out, though she agrees to give him a chance to make amends in the form of a dinner date the following day.  She chooses a local restaurant, and they run into several of their friends, who are too embarrassed to comment on her battered appearance.  When Gordon receives the ex-con's phone number from his friend, he learns that the man, Howard, lives in Mississippi.  Howard insists that Gordon drive from Pennsylvania to his house to discuss the matter.  When Gordon arrives, Howard forces him to strip naked to prove he is not wired and accepts the job.  As they drive back, Gordon becomes increasingly worried about Howard's violent temperament and begins to have second thoughts.  At a roadside diner, Howard murders two people and tells Gordon that he will take his money one way or the other, but it's too late to back out of paying him.  After taunting Gordon with threats to murder him, Howard expounds on his philosophy: he sees his actions as affecting the survivors more than his victims, as the living are the ones who must deal with the grief of loss.  Meanwhile, Teddy and Molly slowly reconcile, and Molly allows him to move back into their house.  Gordon returns to Pennsylvania in time to join Teddy, Molly, and Angela for dinner.  The gathering is a disaster; after a cold reception, Angela demands that Teddy leave.  When Molly defends him, she and her mother tell each other off.  Teddy and Molly return to their house, where they have sex, and Molly presents Teddy with his missing wedding band.  As Teddy gratefully accepts it, he asks if she minds if he has a beer.  Molly agrees that it is harmless, and as he drinks it, they hear a knock at the door.  Howard shoots Teddy dead and walks away.  Stunned, Molly runs after him and attacks him.  After warning her, Howard shoots her dead, too.  After attending his sister's funeral, Gordon returns to Mississippi and confronts Howard with his mother's shotgun.  Though Howard warns him that murder will change him, Gordon says that he is already living with the consequences of his actions.  As Howard makes a final request, Gordon shoots and kills him.  
A Little Game (2014 film)
   
The Loft (film)
 Five married men share ownership of an upmarket loft, which they use to discreetly meet their respective [[Mistress (lover)|mistresses]]. When the body of a murdered woman is found in that loft, the men begin to suspect each other of having committed the gruesome crime, as they are the only ones with keys to the premises. Through flashbacks, which are intertwined with scenes from the present, the story is unraveled.  The five men are:  * Vincent Stevens ([[Karl Urban]]): architect and designer of the building where the loft is situated; married to Barbara ([[Valerie Cruz]]) and has children; the one who initially suggests the five use the loft as a private oasis, he is set up by the other men to be accused of the murder. * Luke Seacord ([[Wentworth Miller]]): married to Ellie ([[Elaine Cassidy]]), who is an insulin-dependent diabetic; the one who discovered the body and initially calls Vincent and the others over to the loft. The police later insinuate that he is attracted to Vincent. He also recorded the men's activities in the loft without them knowing. * Dr. Chris Vanowen ([[James Marsden]]): a psychiatrist married to Allison ([[Rhona Mitra]]), half-brother to Philip. Chris and Philip have a half-sister, Zoe ([[Dora Madison Burge|Madison Burge]]). The most reluctant of the men to the idea and the last to accept a key to the loft, Chris eventually does so because he is attracted to Ann ([[Rachael Taylor]]), who eventually becomes his mistress. She tells Chris not to fall in love with her because she is a prostitute. He gives her his key as proof he does not use the loft with other women. * Marty Landry ([[Eric Stonestreet]]): married to Mimi ([[Kali Rocha]]); a heavy drinker and an obvious lech. He and Mimi become separated when a woman he slept with on a business trip shows up at his home. * Philip Williams ([[Matthias Schoenaerts]]): half-brother to Chris as they have the same mother; recently married to Vicky ([[Margarita Levieva]]), who is the only daughter of a wealthy property developer, who is also his boss. He is a drug user who grew up in a dysfunctional household with his abusive father; very protective of his younger sister Zoe, and warns the other men off having sex with her.  The murder victim is Sarah Deakins ([[Isabel Lucas]]): Vincent, Luke, and Marty met her at a bar; both Vincent and Luke are attracted to her, but she hooks up with Vincent and becomes attached to him. At a party they are both attending, Sarah threatened to tell Vincent's wife about the affair as a way to have them break up, but she is dissuaded from this by Luke. She seemingly tries to commit suicide at the loft, by taking pills with champagne. She is discovered by Luke, who calls Chris, Marty and Philip, showing them a note to Vincent. The note read "See you in the next life"; this note is taken from the loft by Chris.  The men were motivated to set Vincent up by Luke, who showed them DVDs of Vincent having sex with Marty's wife, Mimi; Chris's prostitute, Ann (who Vincent had paid to allow Chris to seduce her, so that he would take a key to and use the loft), and Zoe, Philip and Chris's younger sister. Three of the men leave to set up their alibis, with Philip remaining at the loft to stage the scene. He takes some cocaine and cuts Sarah's wrists, using her bloodied finger to write a Latin phrase similar to that in her suicide note. He then handcuffs Sarah's right hand to the bed.  Over the course of the movie, as the five men discuss what to do with the body, Luke, Chris, Marty, and Philip drug Vincent, strip and handcuff him to the body on the bed. Before Vincent passes out completely, Chris tells him about Sarah's suicide and the contents of her note. While being questioned by the police, Vincent tells them of the set-up, but they do not believe him as the only prints found were Vincent's and Sarah's. They also have the DVDs of his sexual exploits, except the ones with Mimi, Ann, and Zoe; they won't believe him that Luke made the videos and the DVDs of the other men were not found. The police also mention that all four men have alibis for that morning — Chris and Luke were seen together having breakfast, Marty was at his office, Philip was alibied by his father-in-law (who was blackmailed with information about his own cheating, information Philip had because he knew Vincent used that same information to blackmail his father-in-law to give him a contract on a project).  Releasing Chris from interrogation, Detective Huggins ([[Kristin Lehman]]) tells him that Vincent has been arrested for murder; he is surprised as he thought Vincent would only be implicated in Sarah's suicide. The detective further states that the pills did not kill Sarah, that her wrist cuts were not self-inflicted, the prints on the knife were Vincent's and they didn't find a suicide note. The surprised Chris thanks Huggins and leaves. Outside of the police station, he reaches into his jacket pocket, only to find that the suicide note Luke gave to him is gone. He then walks to the loft and confronts Luke about the missing note. After initially denying that he had it, Luke leads Chris to the note, which was in the garbage. Chris looks at the note and wonders why Luke would get rid of the only evidence of the attempted suicide, speculating that Luke, not Sarah, was the author of the note. Luke then tells Chris everything; he framed Vincent, because he was attracted to Sarah himself, and felt that Vincent stood between him and Sarah.  We see that Luke had gone after Sarah the night she almost told Vincent's wife about the affair. He told her that Vincent was using her and not worth it, and that he could treat her better. She rebuffs him, saying she felt nothing for Luke. Hurt, Luke turns around to find that his wife saw him talking to Sarah. When Sarah returned to visit Vincent at the loft, Luke showed up and drugged Sarah, trying to kill her — out of "love" — with an insulin overdose. He then staged the suicide with the pills, champagne bottle, and [[suicide note]]. Chris then tells him that Vincent is being charged with murder as Sarah hadn't been dead when they left her with Philip. Luke then states that technically it was Philip who killed Sarah and that he will clean the situation up. When Chris says no more cleaning up, Luke pulls out a kitchen knife and threatens him. Sirens can be heard and Chris says he called the police, told them everything and that it is over. He and Luke struggle, and he gets the knife from Luke. Luke tells Chris to tell Ellie and their kids that he's sorry; he then jumps from the loft's balcony, killing himself.  Six months later, Mimi and Marty are reconciled, Philip is facing trial for manslaughter, and Chris is divorced, sharing custody of his kids. He runs into Ann after leaving a bar, and she asks if he needs the loft key, that he had given her for them to meet up. Chris mentions the key would not work as Vincent now lives at the loft, since it was the only thing his wife left him with from their divorce. Chris mentions that he heard Ann left the congressman, one of her clients as a prostitute, and she replies that he’s not the only thing she gave up, implying that she’s no longer in that line of work. Ann asks Chris if he would like to grab a cup of coffee with her as the scene fades away.

Liz in September
 Eva (Eloísa Maturén) is on her way out of town when her car breaks down on the side of the road. She makes it into a small town and when she asks for directions to a hotel, the mechanic points her to Margot's (Elba Escobar) place. Margot owns a small hotel and every year some of her friends come to celebrate Liz's (Patricia Velásquez) birthday. She usually would not accommodate another guest during this time, but seems to take pity on Eva and lets her stay. Unbeknownst to Eva, Margot and all of her friends at the hotel this week are lesbians. Having just recently lost a young child to cancer and found out her husband may possibly be cheating, she seems to have a lot on her mind when she arrives.  Liz takes a liking to her after Eva sabotages her fishing outing and invites her to dinner with her friends that night. When her friends see her, Liz bets one of them that she can have Eva in her bed within three days. At dinner, Eva discovers that these women all have something in common: they are lesbians. Almost all of them have had or are currently in relationships with one another, and some have kids from previous heterosexual relationships. This seemingly catches Eva by surprise and it can be assumed that she hasn’t had much interactions with homosexuals and has been a heterosexual her whole life.  Eva seems to be more open minded than most people to the women’s situation. They explain that they reside outside of town in order to escape the wary looks and slander from those in town. As relationships are being formed, an even deeper relationship forms between Eva and Liz. Part of this is because that Liz makes a bet with one of the other women that she can get Eva in bed with her within three days. Although this was Liz’s initial motivation for getting close to Eva, it is clear that it slowly becomes replaced with true feelings for her. As they go on different adventures, Liz’s secret, one that she has kept from everyone except for Dolores whom she had a very intimate relationship with, is revealed and it takes a toll on everyone involved: her cancer is back. Coincidentally it was the same illness that Tommy, Eva's son, had when he died.  Unfortunately, on the night of Liz's 37th birthday celebration, she collapses and is rushed to the hospital and finds out that she has only a couple months to live. While trying to cope with her fear of not having left a memorable impact, she spends her time surrounded by her friends and Eva, who later reveals that she is pregnant and will name the child after Liz if it is a girl, which it turns out to be. The film ends with the death of Liz, agreed and brought out about with the help of Eva, and then a scene of the ladies playing cards briefly talking about Liz. Eva is still with them and plunges into the sea with Lizzy, her young daughter.  
Lost River (film)
 Single mother Billy ([[Christina Hendricks]]) lives in a rapidly crumbling [[Detroit]] neighborhood with her two sons, the teenage Bones ([[Iain De Caestecker]]) and infant Franky (Landyn Stewart). Billy and Bones both dote on Franky but are fairly distant from each other. In his spare time, Bones salvages copper piping from abandoned houses in the neighborhood while trying to avoid a vicious local criminal named Bully ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]), who wants all the copper piping for himself. One day, Bully catches Bones taking piping, which Bones abandons and flees. Later, Bones reclaims the piping from Bully's hiding place and manages to escape from Bully's sidekick, Face.  Billy meets with a banker, Dave ([[Ben Mendelsohn]]), regarding a loan the previous bank manager talked her into so that she could stay in her house, which originally belonged to her grandmother. Since Billy is unemployed, she is unable to repay the bank and must find a way to pay for the house. After their meeting, Dave offers Billy a job, leaving out the details of what it is.  A construction crew begins [[Urban prairie|tearing down the vacant houses]] in the neighborhood. Along with Bones, Billy, and Franky, three of the few remaining residents are Rat ([[Saoirse Ronan]]), her grandmother ([[Barbara Steele]]), and her pet rat, Nick. Rat's grandmother repeatedly watches her old wedding video out of grief for her husband, who died while constructing a dam. Bones discovers an old road that is overgrown and leads under a lake. While hanging out with Rat, Bones learns there is an abandoned town under the lake that was flooded when a reservoir was built. Rat says the only way to break the "curse" that is plaguing their neighborhood is to capture a "beast" from the underwater town and bring it to the surface.  Dave's job offer leads Billy to a cabaret downtown, driven there by a friendly taxi driver. She enters to see a show put on by the main performer, Cat ([[Eva Mendes]]). The appeal of the show is a realistically gory "murder" where Cat ostensibly gets stabbed multiple times and has her "blood" spray all over the delighted audience. Billy goes backstage and meets with Cat, who shows her where the real money is made: in the basement. Down there, women stand in locked plastic "shells" while men do whatever they want in their presence.  Rat invites Bones out for "a night on the town." They go dancing at an abandoned high school and intimate they would leave town together if it ever came to that. Later, they go out to a gas station store and run into Bully and Face, whose lips were cut off by Bully after he let Bones get away. Bones hides from Bully, and to protect Bones, Rat accepts Bully's offer to give her a ride home. Bully walks Rat to her front door and asks her if he can see Nick. He then grabs Nick and brutally kills him in front of her.  Billy has to take Franky to work with her since Bones is out with Rat. For her performance, Billy makes it look like she's cutting off her face, which excites the audience. She later sits with Dave, who hosts the place and performs a song. He takes Billy and Franky home and makes a pass at Billy, but stops when he sees Bones standing outside the car.  Bones drops Billy off at work one night and sees what she has been doing to make money to keep the house. Unable to help their financial situation anymore by stealing copper piping, Bones decides he is going to break the aforementioned "curse." He leaves Franky with Rat and goes into the river to cut the head off a dinosaur statue in an old children's park. Meanwhile, Face enters Rat's house and sets it on fire. He dies in the flames as Rat goes to rescue her grandmother, but she is unable to rouse her from her catatonia and leaves with Franky. Having succeeded in cutting off the dinosaur's head, Bones comes ashore to find his car has been set on fire. Bully tries to run Bones over with his car, but at the last moment, Bones steps out of the way and hurls the dinosaur head at Bully's windshield, causing him to crash against the burning car. Bully is thrown from his car, ends up stuck head first in the lake, and drowns.  At work, Billy is sealed in a "shell" while Dave performs a sexual dance routine around her. Despite having a button that locks the shell from the inside, Dave has a remote that releases the lock. Billy finally steps out of the chamber and stabs Dave in the ear, leaving him to bleed out. Billy returns to find her sons and Rat sitting on the steps of their house while Rat's home continues to burn. With the help of the taxi driver, the four of them run away and leave the neighborhood behind them.  
Love & Mercy (film)
  The film alternates between the 1960s and the 1980s. The early timeline begins with a young [[Brian Wilson]] ([[Paul Dano]]) suffering a panic attack on an airplane. It is agreed with the rest of [[the Beach Boys]] that Brian will no longer tour with them and will instead focus on composition and studio work. Despite [[Don't fuck with the formula|resistance from some of his bandmates]], Brian completes the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album. It is a critical hit, but sales are underwhelming. [[LSD]] is supplied to Brian by a coterie of hippie vagrants who [[Brian Wilson is a genius|praise him as a "genius"]], and his mental health subsequently worsens. After the success of a new single, "[[Good Vibrations]]", he [[Collapse of Smile|fails to complete]] the album ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'', his would-be masterpiece. As Brian's bandmates record [[Smiley Smile|their next record]] without him, he learns that his father has illegitimately sold the [[publishing rights]] to the Beach Boys' songs. This timeline ends with Brian apathetic and detached from life.  In the 1980s, an older and heavily medicated Brian ([[John Cusack]]) meets [[Melinda Ledbetter]] ([[Elizabeth Banks]]), a Cadillac saleswoman. She begins a relationship with him, but is disturbed by the controlling influence Brian's therapist and legal guardian Dr. [[Eugene Landy]] ([[Paul Giamatti]]) has over Brian's life. Eventually, she disengages from the relationship, but not before providing evidence to Brian's family that Landy has been made a beneficiary in his will. This leads to a restraining order being taken out to prevent Landy from seeing Brian, who begins a new and more appropriate course of treatment. Brian accidentally meets Ledbetter again while walking across an intersection, and they eventually get married.  
Loukyam
 ''Loukyam'' opens with Venky ([[Gopichand (actor)|Gopichand]]) kidnapping the sister of Babji ([[Sampath Raj]]), as she is getting married to Bharat ([[Bharath Reddy (actor)|Bharath Reddy]]) although she is in love with someone else (Anand Ramaraju). He goes to [[Hyderabad]] and waits for everything in his home, [[Warangal]] to clear. He stays with his friend, Shyamala ([[Satyam Rajesh]]). There he falls for Chandrakala([[Rakul Preet Singh]]), the sister of Sathya ([[Rahul Dev]]), a don in Hyderabad. Chandrakala rags other students in the college using her brother's power. After her initial rejection, Venky gets her to reciprocate his feelings. Meanwhile, Babji comes to Hyderabad in order to reach Sippy ([[Brahmanandam]]), the driver who helped Venky kidnap Babji's sister. Babji, unaware of the fact that he is traveling in Sippy's taxi, goes around Hyderabad with Boiling star Bablu ([[Prudhviraj (Telugu actor)|Prudhviraj]]), a rising [[Television]] star.  Meanwhile, Kesava Reddy ([[Mukesh Rishi]]), a politician is behind Chandrakala's life. He conducts an attack on her through which Venky comes to know that Chandrakala is actually Babji's second sister and that he had sent her with Sathya to Hyderabad to maintain a low profile. Babji readies Chandrakala to marry Bharath. He also continues to search for whoever (Venky) abducted his sister. Using the help of Nano Shastri ([[Krishna Bhagavaan]]), Venky manages to get Babji and Chandrakala into his house. He also comes to know that the reason Kesava Reddy wants to kill Chandrakala is that his younger sister committed suicide because she loved Babji although he did not reciprocate the same. He hires Hamsa Sippy ([[Hamsa Nandini]]), Sippy's wife, to act as his father, Meka Papa Rao a.k.a. Puppy's wife. He tells Babji's elder sister to come back on the engagement day to act as if not married and Babji fixes the marriage of his elder sister with Bharat. But unexpectedly, they all come to know that the girl is pregnant and so Bharat refuses to marry.  Then Venky tells Babji that his brother who is actually Babji's sister's husband and is acting as Venky's brother will marry his sister. Babji agrees for the wedding and, in turn, tells Chandrakala that she is to marry Bharat again. Through an attack incident, Venky comes to know that Bharat is Kesava Reddy's son. He tells Kesava Reddy that even Babji is aware of this fact and is planning to kill Bharat on a trip to [[Srisailam]]. Kesava Reddy ends up believing him and attacks Babji and the group on the way. He foolishly reveals to Babji that Bharat is his son and that he is aware Babji will kill him. When Kesava Reddy realizes his folly, he kidnaps Chandrakala and Bharat and escapes from the spot. Boiling star Bablu who mistakes it to be a serial shoot stops Kesava Reddy on the way which gives Venky enough time to reach Kesava Reddy. In a thrilling climax, Venky gets Babji to beat up Kesava Reddy and using his "Sympathy angle" trick, which he had earlier used to get Babji and his sister together, He gets Babji to agree for his and Chandrakala's wedding as well. The film ends with Sippy saying that with "Loukyam"(Tact), you can fool not only Babji but even [[God]] and Boiling star Bablu saying he is Cool Bablu from now on and he will do only comedy serials and not action ones.

Five years later, Rosie visits Alex in Boston and they spend a night together talking and visiting places. The following morning, she discovers that his girlfriend is pregnant.

Later, Rosie learns that Alex split from his girlfriend after discovering that the baby was not his. She bumps into Bethany, now a famous model, and suggests that Bethany look up Alex on an upcoming trip to the US.  Rosie's father dies. Alex attends the funeral, where he reconciles with Rosie. At the same event, Greg behaves immaturely, causing a scene. This later prompts Alex to write Rosie a note saying that she deserves better and that he can be that better man. However, Greg intercepts the note and hides it from Rosie. Later, Rosie discovers that Greg is cheating on her and kicks him out. While disposing of his things, she finds the letter from Alex. She calls him, but discovers that Bethany is living with him now and that the two are engaged. They invite Rosie to be the "best man" at their wedding.

Her daughter, Katie, brings a friend named Toby with her to the wedding, in a friendship that is reminiscent of Rosie and Alex when they were children. During a dance, Toby suddenly kisses Katie, but Katie pushes him away and runs outside. Rosie and Alex follow her. Alex counsels her and tells her to follow her feelings with Toby or she might regret it, alluding to how he felt about Rosie. After a moment, Toby finds Katie and apologizes for what he did. As he asks her to forget what just happened, Katie interrupts him with a kiss. In that moment, Alex learns that Rosie does not remember the kiss that they shared on her 18th birthday. He realizes that he had been mistaken in interpreting her desire to forget that night as her wanting to stay platonic.  Years later, Rosie finally fulfills her ambition to start her own hotel. Alex is her second guest. When he arrives, he tells Rosie that he ended his marriage with Bethany, and shares with her a recurring dream he has had about the two of them being together.

Love Me Haiti (2014 film)

In simple words, the film twistfully illustrates how life is a ''bitch''.

Lucy (2014 film)
 Lucy is a 24-year-old American woman living and studying in [[Taipei, Taiwan]]. She is tricked into working as a [[drug mule]] by her new boyfriend Richard, whose employer, Mr. Jang, is a Korean [[Boss (crime)|mob boss]] and [[drug lord]]. Lucy delivers a briefcase to Mr. Jang supposedly containing paperwork, but it actually contains four packets of CPH4, a highly valuable synthetic drug. After seeing her boyfriend shot and killed, she is captured and a bag of the drug is forcibly sewn into her abdomen and that of three other drug mules who will also transport the drug for sale in Europe. While Lucy is in captivity, one of her captors kicks her in the abdomen, breaking the bag and releasing a large quantity of the drug into her system. As a result, she begins acquiring increasingly enhanced physical and mental capabilities, such as [[telepathy]], [[telekinesis]], [[Psychometry (paranormal)|mental time travel]], and the ability not to feel pain or other discomforts. Her personality also changes into a more ruthless and emotionless one. She kills off her captors and escapes.  Lucy travels to the nearby [[Tri-Service General Hospital]] to get the bag of drugs removed from her abdomen. The bag is successfully removed and Lucy is told by the operating doctor that natural CPH4 is a volatile substance produced in minute quantities by pregnant women during their sixth week of pregnancy to [[prenatal development|provide fetuses the energy to develop]]. Lucy is fortunate to have survived with such a large amount introduced into her body. Sensing her growing physical and mental abilities, Lucy returns to Mr. Jang's hotel, kills his bodyguards, assaults Mr. Jang, and telepathically extracts the locations of the three remaining drug mules from his brain.  At her apartment, Lucy begins researching her condition and contacts well-known scientist and doctor Professor Samuel Norman whose research may be the key to saving her. After Lucy speaks with Professor Norman and provides proof of her developed abilities, she flies to Paris and contacts a local [[police captain]], Pierre Del Rio, to help her find the remaining three packets of the drug. During the plane ride, she starts to disintegrate as her cells destabilize from consuming a sip of champagne, which made her body inhospitable for cellular reproduction. Only by consuming more CPH4 is she able to hold off her total disintegration. Her powers continue to grow, leaving her able to telepathically incapacitate armed police and members from the Korean drug gang. With the help of Del Rio, Lucy recovers the drug and hurries to meet Professor Norman. Alongside Professor Norman and his colleagues, she agrees to share everything she now knows after Professor Norman points out that the main point of life is to pass on knowledge, something for which she now possesses an infinite capacity. Jang and the mob also want the drug and a gunfight ensues with the French police.  In the professor's lab, Lucy discusses the nature of time and life and how people's humanity distorts their perceptions. She tells the scientists that time is the only true measure of human life and of existence. At her urging, she is intravenously injected with the contents of all three remaining bags of CPH4. Her body begins to change into a bizarre black substance which behaves like [[nanites]], spreading over computers and other electronic objects in the lab, as she transforms these into an unconventionally shaped, next-generation [[supercomputer]] that will contain all of her enhanced knowledge of the universe. She then begins a spacetime journey into the past, eventually reaching the oldest discovered ancestor of mankind, implied to be [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]]. She [[The Creation of Adam|touches fingertips]] with her, then goes all the way to the beginning of time and witnesses the [[Big Bang]]. Meanwhile, back in the lab, after an [[AT4|M136 AT4]] anti-tank weapon destroys the door, Jang enters and points a gun at Lucy's head from behind. He shoots, but in the instant before the bullet strikes, Lucy reaches 100% of her cerebral capacity and ascends within the [[spacetime continuum]], where she explains that everything is connected and existence is only proven through time. Only her clothes, [[Christian Louboutin|Louboutin shoe]]s, and the black supercomputer are left behind.  Del Rio enters and fatally shoots Jang. Professor Norman takes a star-filled black, presumably highly advanced, flash drive offered by the advanced supercomputer, after which the computer disintegrates. Del Rio asks Professor Norman where Lucy is, immediately after which Del Rio's cell phone sounds and he sees a text message: "[[Omnipresence|I AM EVERYWHERE]]." With an overhead shot, Lucy's voice is heard stating "Life was given to us a billion years ago. Now you know what to do with it." 
Lupin the 3rd (film)
 [[Arsène Lupin III|Lupin the 3rd]], grandson of the legendary [[gentleman thief]] [[Arsène Lupin]], is a member of the international [[thieves' guild]] "The Works", which specializes in stealing valuable objects from wealthy owners. Lupin beats his fellow Works members [[Fujiko Mine]] (his would-be lover), Pierre (a computer genius) and Jiro to the theft of an ancient [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic]] medal in [[Singapore]], but is forced to surrender it to his rival, Michael Lee, when he threatens to kill him and Fujiko. At a meeting of The Works, Fujiko is hailed as the culprit behind the theft (thanks to her machinations), and Thomas Dawson, the leader of the organization, shows them the most valuable item in The Works' possession - the Crimson Heart of [[Cleopatra]], a necklace commissioned by [[Mark Antony]] to symbolize his love for the Queen of the Nile. However, a ruby of Cleopatra's intended to complete the necklace is missing. A trio of thugs led by Michael - Royal, Saber and Maria - steal the necklace and kill Jiro and Dawson, apparently in revenge for "Edward Lam", resulting in the disbanding of The Works. Devastated by Dawson's murder, Lupin, Fujiko, Pierre and [[Daisuke Jigen]] join forces to find Michael and the necklace.  Within a year, Lupin and Jigen have established themselves as accomplished thieves, but Jigen grows weary of following Fujiko's false leads. While meeting with her, Lupin is turned in to the police in [[Thailand]]. He then meets [[Interpol]] [[Inspector Koichi Zenigata]], who informs him that Michael, using the alias Georgio Zhang, is arranging a major [[auction]] with Momrachiao Pramuk, the chairman of Navarone Security and a [[crime lord]] in secret. Zenigata wants Lupin to 'steal' the items that they intend to sell to each other for the police so that he can arrest them; in exchange, Lupin's criminal record will be erased. Lupin begrudgingly accepts, and enlists [[Goemon Ishikawa XIII]] into the gang.  Fujiko meets with Michael, who explains that Edward Lam was a member of The Works and a [[father figure]] to them both, but after helping Dawson find the Crimson Heart and the accompanying ruby in [[Egypt]], Dawson betrayed and killed him, and Pramuk stole the ruby. Michael intends to buy the ruby to complete the necklace. Lupin, who has been spying on the pair, tells Michael that no matter who wins the auction, he will steal the necklace. At the auction, Michael and Pramuk prepare to sell each other the necklace and the ruby respectively. During the transaction, Pramuk tells Michael that he was a former member of The Works, and killed Lam while trying to kill Dawson. Michael attempts to kill himself and Pramuk before the latter can buy the necklace, but Pramuk reveals that Royal, who (along with Saber and Maria) now works for him, disarmed the explosives. Pramuk buys the ruby for $200 million, and Michael destroys his reward cheque in defeat. Lupin, having listened to Michael and Pramuk's exchange via [[lip reading]] technology, calls off the theft to Zenigata's frustration.  Disheartened, Michael offers to join Lupin's gang to steal back the Crimson Heart and ruby from the Ark, Pramuk's stronghold, and is accepted. Lupin and Michael enter the Ark disguised as Zengiata and Commander Narong of the Thailand Army, and upload a virus into the Ark's networks in the guise of a calling card from Lupin. Jigen, Goemon and Fujiko attack the Ark's main defenses, defeating Royal, Saber and Maria in the process, while Lupin and Michael, aided by Pierre and Joseph (a [[computer hacker|hacker]]), along with prior research made by Goemon, penetrate the security defenses protecting the Crimson Heart. Pramuk traps the pair in the vault, intending to suffocate them. Michael places Lupin in the vault's safe and blows the vault door up, killing himself but saving Lupin. Lupin and the others are handed over by Pramuk to Zenigata and Narong, but they instead arrest Pramuk for his crimes, using the Crimson Heart as evidence. Zenigata then discovers too late that the necklace and ruby given to him by Lupin were fakes.  Later, Lupin unsuccessfully tries to get Fujiko to wear the Crimson Heart, and Zenigata returns to pursue them. Fujiko takes the necklace and escapes while Lupin and Jigen escape together in their [[Fiat 500 (2007)|Fiat 500]].

They arrive in Jabalpur to a warm welcome from Uday's friends and Ayesha spends the next few weeks setting up the home and planning events and visits with friends: happy times. As time goes by strange things happen at the factory, machines inexplicably move and crash and employees are crushed, and at home, the gas range and toasters seem to have a will of their own. Ayesha is also perturbed by their immediate neighbors, the hot headed Manohar and his quietly suffering wife Urmi. The servant woman suggests consulting a local <em>baba</em> (healer and exorcist) who quickly concludes Ayesha is being attacked by an evil spirit. The <em>baba</em> suggests an exorcism but before this can be performed, the spirit, now angry, impales and kills the servant woman (with a deer head bust) and the <em>baba</em>. Around this time Ayesha's father hears about these strange events and quickly finds Ugr Pratap and sets off for Jabalpur.  Uday dismisses all the spirit theories and consults a doctor.

As this horrific truth dawns on Ayesha the spirits of Manohar and Urmi and their daughter show themselves. The spirit of Manohar bitterly says it will never let the factory carry on. And with that the three spirits possess Ayesha completely.  Ayesha returns home and now launches her reign of terror on the other servants. Her father and Ugr Pratap arrive just as Ayesha attacks Uday himself. Ugr Pratap fights back with his spiritual <em>kamandal</em>. There is a long battle as the spirit flees to the river bank and repeatedly attacks Ugr Pratap. Uday finally plunges the charmed <em>trisul</em> (trident) into Ayesha and dispatches all the spirits to the other worlds.

Maan Karate
 Five [[Information Technology|IT]] employees, Sandy ([[Sathish]]), Joe (Rajesh Gopalan), Gokul (Vinu Karthik), Vaishnavi ([[Maya (actress)|Preethi Shankar]]) and Nikita (Ashwathy Ravikumar), meet a [[siddhar]] who has the power to grant wishes to those who request them, during a weekend trip to the Chandragiri forest. Sandy, who is sceptical about the siddhar's powers, asks him for a copy of the ''[[Dina Thanthi|Daily Thanthi]]'' newspaper dated on the day after [[Ayudha Puja]] (no newspapers are printed during Ayudha Puja). To his surprise, the siddhar materialises the requested copy. The IT gang read the materialised newspaper and find out to their shock that the company which they work for ([[Mahindra Satyam|Satyam Computers]]) would close down the next day. When this does happen, they accept the credibility of the newspaper and decide to make money through it. While Nikita is reading the paper, she sees an article where one Peter who stays in [[Royapuram]] wins a boxing tournament on the day of Ayudha Puja and dedicates the prize money of 2,00,00,000 to the five of them. The IT gang is astounded on reading this news and decide to find this Peter and sponsor him for the boxing tournament, with the hope of getting 2,00,00,000, despite eventually finding out from the boxing association that the cash prize for the tournament champion is only 1,00,000.  The IT gang successfully manages to track down Peter ([[Sivakarthikeyan]]), but immediately find out that he is not a boxer, but an unambitious youth, absolutely idiotic and unskilled beyond logic, who just spends his time drinking and roaming around with his best friend Neruppu Kumar ([[Arunraja Kamaraj]]). However, he is in love with a young woman Yazhini Sethuraman ([[Hansika Motwani]]), who is a sports buff. To impress Yazhini, he accepts their offer to participate in the tournament. However, Peter does not show any inclination to train for the tournament, instead he uses the IT gang to fulfil his own desires, including winning Yazhini's heart, much to their chagrin. Later, the IT gang find out that there is another boxer named Peter ([[Vamsi Krishna]]) whose father also works in Royapuram [[BSNL]] like the Peter they are sponsoring, but is a 15 time champion boxer who is even nicknamed "Peter the Killer". Thinking that they are sponsoring the wrong Peter, the IT gang approach "Killer" Peter and offer to sponsor him, but he refuses. They reluctantly decide to continue sponsoring the Peter they are currently sponsoring.  Soon the boxing tournament starts and Peter somehow manages to win all the preliminary matches by fluke, by using a technique wherein he uses his nimble and agile body to escape being hit by his stronger and more experienced opponents, eventually causing them to inadvertently get [[Disqualification (boxing)|disqualified]] or [[knockout|knocked out]]. The media give a name for his technique: "Maan Karate", which in English means, "Deer Karate". Peter soon becomes known as "Maan Karate" Peter (to distinguish from "Killer" Peter) and becomes an Internet sensation overnight, winning a lot of fans. Due to Peter's rising popularity, the prize money is raised from 1,00,000 to 2,00,00,000, and [[AirAsia India|Air Asia]] sponsors the tournament as expected by the IT gang, who now feel that their dreams will come true with the Peter they are sponsoring after all.  Eventually, Peter enters the final of the tournament, where he is to face "Killer" Peter. He becomes upset at this development, fearing that he might be killed by "Killer" Peter and revealing to Yazhini that he is not a boxer . He tries to avoid fighting in the final through various means, none of which are successful. In a last-ditch attempt, he tries to convince "Killer" Peter to [[match fixing|"throw" the match]] so that he could win and impress Yazhini, but is verbally abused and physically assaulted by him in response. Hurt at the treatment which "Killer" Peter meted out to him, Peter begins to train hard for the final with the sole purpose of defeating "Killer" Peter. Meanwhile, unknown to him, the IT gang defect to "Killer" Peter's side after being offered 75,00,000 by "Killer" Peter's father-in-law Fernando ([[Ravi Prakash (Tamil actor)|Ravi Prakash]]), despite Nikita's reservations.  The final takes place on the day of Ayudha Puja. "Killer" Peter immediately gains the upper hand, pummelling Peter with heavy blows. However, Peter is not daunted and continues to put up a brave fight, but is severely weakened and is soon on the verge of being knocked out. A teary-eyed Yazhini, who has found out from Nikita that Peter is not a boxer, tries to convince him to call off the fight, but he refuses. Peter manages to fight back, eventually knocking out "Killer" Peter, causing a major upset. Peter wins the boxing tournament and dedicates the prize money of 2,00,00,000 to the astounded IT gang, oblivious to their treachery, but they deny the offer. He also publicly conveys his love to a sobbing Yazhini, who is relieved that he has survived.  The movie ends with a display of a portion of the newspaper the siddhar had materialised torn by Nikita and left at the Chandragiri forest several months ago. The portion shows a photo of Peter lifting the boxing tournament trophy.  
Madame Bovary (2014 film)
 The film begins as Emma ([[Mia Wasikowska]]), a young woman not yet 18, is packing up her belongings and preparing to leave the convent to marry the man her farmer father has arranged as her husband: country doctor Charles Bovary ([[Henry Lloyd-Hughes]]). But she becomes bored and miserable in the small, provincial town of Yonville. She spends most of her time alone, reading or wandering in the garden while Charles tends to patients.

Magic in the Moonlight
  In 1928, a globally famous [[Magic (illusion)|illusionist]], Wei Ling Soo, performs in front of a crowd in Berlin with his world-class magic act. As he walks off stage the film audience sees that he is actually a British man named Stanley ([[Colin Firth]]). He berates his employees and is generally curmudgeonly towards his well-wishers. In his dressing-room, he is greeted by old friend and fellow illusionist Howard Burkan ([[Simon McBurney]]). Howard enlists Stanley to go with him to the [[French Riviera|Côte d'Azur]] where a rich American family, the Catledges, has apparently been taken in by a clairvoyant and mystic, Sophie ([[Emma Stone]]). In fact, the son of the family, Brice ([[Hamish Linklater]]), is smitten with Sophie, and his sister Caroline ([[Erica Leerhsen]]) and brother-in-law George ([[Jeremy Shamos]]) are concerned Brice is considering proposing marriage. Howard says that he has been unable to uncover the secrets behind her tricks and he admits that the more he watched her the more he believed she really has supernatural powers. So he would like Stanley, who has debunked charlatan mystics in the past, to help him prove she is a fraud.  Howard and Stanley travel to the French Riviera, but Stanley is soon astonished by Sophie's ability to go into a fugue state and apparently pull out highly personal details about him and his family. Stanley witnesses a seance in which Sophie communicates with the deceased patriarch of the American family. A candle floats up from the table and Howard grabs it to try to discern what trickery is at play, but is astounded to find no apparent subterfuge. Stanley begins spending time with Sophie. He takes her to visit his aunt and they drive a convertible along the picturesque rocky [[corniche]]s.  When Stanley and Sophie visit his aunt Vanessa ([[Eileen Atkins]]), Sophie is seemingly able, after holding aunt Vanessa's pearls, to somehow relate secret details of Vanessa's one great love affair. This finally convinces Stanley of Sophie's authenticity and he has an emotional epiphany, feeling that his lifelong rationalism and cynicism have been misguided. When caught in a rain storm, they end up at an observatory that Stanley had visited as a child. After the rain subsides, they open the roof up and view the stars.  At a [[The Great Gatsby|Gatsby]]-esque party, Stanley and Sophie dance. As they walk together later that night, Sophie asks him if he has felt any feelings for her "as a woman". Stanley, who has admired her talents as a mystic and is grateful to her for opening his eyes to a new worldview, is taken aback and admits that he has not thought of her that way. She leaves upset. The next day Stanley holds a press conference to tell the world that he, who spent his life debunking charlatan mystics, has finally come to find one who is the real deal. The reporters drill him with questions, but the grilling is interrupted when he receives news his aunt Vanessa has been in a car accident.  Stanley rushes to the hospital, and in an emotional scene in a waiting room considers turning to prayer for solace. That is, if he now has come to believe in divination and mysticism, perhaps he should believe in God and prayer. He begins to pray for a miracle to save his aunt, but is unable to go through with it. The rationality that has been his whole life comes back and he rejects prayer, the supernatural and by extension, Sophie and her powers. He decides once more to prove she is a fraud.  Using a trick seen earlier in his stage act, Stanley appears to leave the room but stays to overhear Sophie and Howard discuss their collusion in what has been an elaborate ruse. He discovers that Sophie was able to know so much about him and his aunt because she and Howard collaborated to fool Stanley. Sophie was indeed a charlatan tricking the rich American family and was quickly discovered by Howard. Rather than unmask her and stop the ruse, he enlisted Sophie to help him one-up his best friend and rival, Stanley.  Stanley is initially angry at Howard and Sophie but decides to forgive them. In a conversation with his aunt Vanessa, who has recovered from her car accident, Stanley admits and fully realizes that he is in love with Sophie. He finds her and asks her not to marry Brice, but marry him instead. Sophie is taken aback and finds his haughty, awkward proposal unsuitable. She tells him she still plans to marry the wealthy Brice. Returning dejected to his aunt Vanessa's, Stanley further admits that he [[love at first sight|fell in love with Sophie at first sight]], and, saddened, is then surprised when Sophie, who had arrived before him, knocks a spirit knock. He proposes, she accepts with a spirit knock, and they kiss as the film ends.

In a long-standing bloody feud, two factions of a political party have been laying claim to a wall on which they can paint the portraits of their respective political leaders. Anbu, under the local leader of one of the opposing parties, Maari ([[Charles Vinoth]]), is determined to claim that wall for their own party. The other party chief is Kannan ([[Poster Nandakumar]]) and his son Perumal ([[Mime Gopi]]) who are hell bent in making sure that their opponents efforts go in vain. The painting of Kannan's father's face has been on the wall for 2 decades, since the start of the feud. The two parties and their supporters get into frequent clashes and scrapes. In the meantime, Kaali falls in love with Kalaiarasi  ([[Catherine Tresa]]) and she too reciprocates his feelings.  In a spur of motivation due to the upcoming elections, Anbu reserves the said wall for their party. Although the wall is in their area and technically theirs, the opposition ask Maari's party to give it up as the portrait of their patriarch had been there for quite some time. Moreover, since three deaths had previously taken place in connection to the wall, along with the deaths of members from both parties, people have started to consider the wall a bad omen. Anbu, bolstered by Kaali, however, declines. The opposing party members plan to assassinate both Kaali and Anbu. When henchmen are sent to kill Anbu and Kaali, they somehow escape and hide behind a van. They see Perumal, who doesn't notice them, talking through phone, giving orders to kill Anbu at any cost. In a fit of rage, Kaali kills him with a straight hit to head using a crowbar. Anbu and Kaali are told by Maari to surrender at Kanchipuram district court to avoid being killed by the henchmen. Also, the FIR report filed against them contains only Anbu's name. Anbu takes responsibility of the murder, despite Kaali being against it, and hopes to be released soon. However, just outside the court, some henchmen hack Anbu to death and injure Kaali seriously. Kaali slides into depression by guilt and swears revenge, but is advised against violence by Kalaiarasi, his parents as well as Maari. Kalaiarasi comforts him and brings his life back to normalcy and they get engaged. Maari promises Kaali that they will avenge Anbu together.  One day when Kaali and Kalaiarasi are at a restaurant, he notices one of the henchmen of Maari sitting at the next table. When he goes up to him to talk, he runs away in fear. Surprised, Kaali chases him. It is revealed that Maari has joined hands with the opposing party for political gain and it was he who had Anbu assassinated. Kalaiarasi, though reluctant to let Kaali pursue his revenge, lets him go. At a local meeting where Maari is being felicitated, Kaali spills the beans about Maari and the locals chase Maari out. In a final act, Kaali splashes paint on the wall thus ruining the portrait. Soon everyone follows suit. Maari plots to kill Kaali. However, Maari is betrayed by the touted successor of the opposing party when he tries to kill Kaali. Kaali, in a final fight sequence, subdues the henchmen sent to kill him and grievously injures Maari, who is soon killed.  Kaali and Kalaiarasi start teaching in the building whose wall was the cause of this blood feud. The wall now has a theme of children's education painted on it. Both the parties still wait to claim the wall soon.

 Across a college in [[Ooty]], Sreenath Prasad aka 'Seenu' ([[Varun Dhawan]]) fails his final exam by two marks. Eager to get a degree, he kidnaps the professor's daughter during her wedding and demands his professor([[Raju Kher]]) to give him two more marks in exchange for his daughter. Seenu accidentally lets go of her however while letting his parents in to his house, and his plan fails.  Although Seenu's father offers him a job at his auto stand, Seenu plans to get a degree at Tift College in [[Bengaluru]]. He leaves [[Ooty]] on a train headed for [[Bengaluru]]. On the train, he beats up a gang harming a group of teenage girls. When Seenu arrives in [[Bengaluru]], a friend of his who lives there reluctantly allows him to stay in his house.  Once Seenu arrives in Tift College, he prays to [[Krishna]]  ([[Salman Khan]]'s voice)  to concentrate on nothing but studies. However once he finishes, he sees a girl named Sunaina ([[Ileana D'Cruz]]) and gets attracted to her. He tries to get her attention, but she ignores him constantly. She tells him that she has been forced into marrying a corrupt policeman named Angad Negi ([[Arunoday Singh]]) since he tricked her father into shooting Angad's sidekick and friend Peter's ([[Rajpal Yadav]])arm. Angad's men chase Seenu until he beats up two of them and scares away the rest. Seenu goes to Angad to make a truce with him and leave Sunaina, but Angad (believing he cannot do it) gives Seenu a chance to try to woo Sunaina for up to three days. Seenu publicly tells Sunaina he loves her and tells her not to be afraid of Angad and his goons. She gains courage, scares off Angad's men, and falls in love with Seenu. Angad finds Seenu, finds out what happened, and attempts to shoot Seenu, but instead accidentally shoots Peter. The media quickly finds out and Angad gets suspended as a [[police officer]].  All seems well until Sunaina is kidnapped and taken away in a helicopter. Seenu learns from Angad that Sunaina will be taken to the mansion of Vikrant Singhal ([[Anupam Kher]]), one of Asia's most notorious gangsters. Vikrant's daughter, Ayesha ([[Nargis Fakhri]]), was on the [[Ooty]] to [[Bangalore]] train Seenu was in and was attracted by his impressive fighting skills. She told her father about the experience as well as her interest in marrying him. Angad and Peter told Vikrant's men that in order to get Seenu, they would have to take Sunaina to lure him to their place, forcing Seenu to marry Ayesha.  In the second half of the film, Seenu goes to Vikrant's residence in [[Bangkok, Thailand]]. He tricks Vikrant and his friend and associate Balli ([[Saurabh Shukla]]) into thinking that he wants to marry Ayesha. However, he requests that he is given ten days to get to know Ayesha before the wedding day, which Vikrant initially refuses until Ayesha tells her father to "do as Seenu says". Ayesha lets Sunaina wear any of her clothes because she has an "extra piece" for all of her clothing. Ayesha and Seenu spend the day together; later, Seenu tells Ayesha that she does not love him. When Angad and Peter come later, she then falls in love with Angad through a sheer coincidence.  Seenu and Sunaina use Ayesha's love for Angad as a way of solving their problem. Sunaina wears identical clothes to Ayesha; in result, Angad confuses Sunaina for Ayesha, making Ayesha believe that Angad loves her. The plan later fails, though, when Angad realizes this and tricks Ayesha once again into marrying Seenu. Angad is tricked by Seenu and Sunaina into kissing Ayesha, but Vikrant sees this and points his gun at Angad to shoot him, but Ayesha steps in between and stops him saying that she loves Angad. Seeing this, Angad realizes that Ayesha’s love for him is true and that Ayesha is the right girl for him, not Sunaina and decides to marry Ayesha. Vikrant realizes his daughter loves Angad and reluctantly tells Seenu that Ayesha will marry Angad. Seenu pretends to be agonized but celebrates later. Ayesha marries Angad, and Vikrant convinces Sunaina (who is also pretending to hate Seenu) to marry Seenu, by saying that he took 10 days to hatch a plan to bring Ayesha and Angad together, not to get to know Ayesha (not realizing that this is true!) Seenu and Sunaina are back together again.

Maleficent (film)
 Maleficent is a powerful fairy living in the Moors, a magical forest realm bordering a human kingdom. As a young girl, she meets and falls in love with a human peasant boy named Stefan, whose love for Maleficent is overshadowed by his ambition. As they become older, the two grow apart, and Maleficent becomes protector of the Moors. When King Henry tries to conquer the Moors, Maleficent mortally wounds him and forces him to retreat. As he lies dying, he declares that whoever kills Maleficent will be named his successor and marry his daughter, Princess Leila. Stefan visits Maleficent in the Moors. He drugs her, but cannot bring himself to kill her. Instead, he cuts off her wings with iron, which is lethal to fairies, and presents them to the king. Devastated by Stefan's betrayal, Maleficent turns the Moors into a dark kingdom. She finds a raven named Diaval to act as her wings, spy and confidant. She transforms him into different forms as needed, including human.  After some time, Diaval informs Maleficent that Stefan, now king, is hosting a christening for his newborn daughter, Aurora. Bent on revenge, Maleficent arrives uninvited and curses the infant princess: on her sixteenth birthday, she will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and fall into a deep sleep from which she will never awaken. When Stefan begs for mercy, Maleficent mocks him and offers an antidote: the curse can only be broken by true love's kiss. Fearing for his daughter's safety, Stefan sends Aurora to live with three pixies—Knotgrass, Thistlewit, and Flittle—until the day after her sixteenth birthday, while he destroys all the spinning wheels in the kingdom and hides their remnants in the castle dungeon. He sends his armies to find and kill Maleficent, but she surrounds the Moors with an impenetrable wall of thorns. King Stefan slips into madness and paranoia, trying to prevent the curse, even neglecting to see his wife on her deathbed.  Despite her initial dislike for Aurora, Maleficent begins to care for her when the bumbling and neglectful pixies fail to do so. After a brief meeting with the young Aurora, Maleficent watches over her from afar. When Aurora is fifteen, she encounters Maleficent. Knowing that she is being watched over, she calls Maleficent her "fairy godmother". Maleficent tries desperately to undo the curse but is unsuccessful, as the curse proves to be unbreakable by any means other than true love's kiss. In the forest, Aurora meets Prince Philip, and the two are attracted to each other. On the day before Aurora's sixteenth birthday, Aurora tells Maleficent that she would like to live with her in the Moors. When Aurora returns to the cottage, the pixies inadvertently tell Aurora of her past. Having learned of Maleficent's true identity, Aurora runs to her father's castle.  After a brief reunion with his daughter, Stefan locks her away in a room for her own safety while setting up a plan to kill Maleficent. However, the power of the curse draws Aurora to the dungeon, where a spinning wheel magically reassembles itself. She pricks her finger and falls into a deep sleep, fulfilling the curse. Maleficent, intent on saving Aurora, abducts Phillip and infiltrates Stefan's castle, but Phillip's kiss fails to awaken Aurora. At her bedside, Maleficent apologizes to Aurora and kisses her forehead. Aurora awakens, as Maleficent's motherly feelings towards her count as true love. However, as Maleficent and Aurora attempt to leave, they are ambushed by Stefan and his guards, with an iron net dropping on her. Maleficent transforms Diaval into a dragon, and he battles Stefan's guards, but he is eventually caught as well. Stefan taunts Maleficent, who is dizzy and sick from the iron, his former love for her fully gone, but before he can deliver a killing blow, Aurora finds her wings and releases them. They fly to Maleficent and reattach themselves. Maleficent carries Stefan to the top of the castle's highest tower and beats him easily and quickly in battle, but cannot bring herself to kill him. Stefan attacks her as she turns away, however, and both plummet entwined from the tower. Maleficent breaks away and Stefan falls to his death.  In the end, Maleficent returns the Moors to its former glory, and Aurora is crowned queen to unify the two kingdoms.

Jeff and his friend Adelle also go to the mall, as Jeff tells her about his belief that modern society has become soulless and a shallow facsimile of itself.  Jeff describes several of the people that they see at the mall and narratives what he imagines their back story to be: Donna, a bored housewife who obsesses over her attractiveness; Barry, a salesman who hates his business but stays in it because he understands it; Michael, a security guard who, after immigrating, becomes a widower and lives only for his job; and Danny, a married businessman who engages in casual sex.  Jeff and Adelle meet up with Beckett and Shel, and Beckett shares ecstasy with Jeff.  Beckett attempts to talk Jeff out of his crush on Adelle, to no avail.  When Danny is arrested (by the same cop who hassled Jeff) for peeping on Donna who forgets to lock the fitting room door while she changes clothes, Beckett and Shel leave to gawk at the scene.  Alone with Adelle, Jeff confesses to her that he has fallen in love with her, but she calls him unexciting and wanders off.

After Beckett and Shel leave to vandalize the mall, Adelle points out that she can do anything she wants to Danny.  She moves him to his own car, binds him in place with a seat belt, tightens his handcuffs, and molests him while forcing him to repeat, "I'm a pervert."  She leaves once he passes out.  Meanwhile, Jeff meets Donna in a bar, and after he tells her that she does not look old enough to have kids, she invites him to a motel room, where they have sex.  Unconcerned with what has happened at the mall, Donna merely asks for details so that she can craft a believable cover story.  Jeff wanders back to the mall, where he discovers Beckett and Shell taking pictures of Danny with their cell phones.  Jeff chases them away and offers to take Danny to a hospital.  Danny requests that he brought back to his home.  When Danny asks Jeff if he knows Adelle based on her description, Jeff says that she is not a friend.  Satisfied, Danny approaches his house, still handcuffed.  As Jeff walks off, he encounters Mal, who ended up wounded after a shootout with Michael.  Mal and Jeff talk briefly, and Mal requests that Jeff kill him.  Jeff refuses and calls him a coward who is willing to die but not to live.  As Jeff runs off, the cops gather for an assault on Mal's location.  As Donna returns to her boring life, Jeff quotes ''[[Steppenwolf (novel)|Steppenwolf]]'', saying that one day he will learn to laugh.  The film ends as he laughs.

Their drama group which was started in 1989, is celebrating its 25th anniversary and Manaar Mathai wants to perform a drama on this occasion. But Gopalakrishnan & Balakrishnan are not ready for this because their previous attempts in drama led them to nothing but problems. When they need a driver for their agency, they give an Ad in the news paper. But Mathai also gives an extra Ad which says "Heroine required" which leads a young woman named Nithya ([[Aparna Gopinath]]) and her friend Unni ([[Basil Joseph]]) to their agency. Balakrishnan and Gopalakrishnan see Unni as a potential driver replacement for their old driver Koshi ([[Shammi Thilakan]]) due to his fluency in English because most of their customers requesting for travels are from other countries and Unni, being fluent in English, would be able to help them. Meanwhile, Mathai sees Nithya as a potential lead actress for his upcoming play which would bring back glory to Urvashi Theaters and respect to the field of drama. One night, they get an unexpected visitor - Mahendra Varma ([[Biju Menon]]). Much to the relief of Balakrishnan, Gopalakrishnan, and Mannar Mathai, when he fell from the top of the building in the last movie on to the hood of Ramji Rao's car, he became mentally impaired and is always requesting for Beedi cigarettes. Later onward, the three decide to forgive Mahendra Varma for his wrongdoings against them, but discover other things as well. They discover that Unni and Nithya were framed for bank fraud back in the town where their college was and fled from police. To their horror, they discover that Nithya is the daughter of the bane of all policemen and authorities and a person that the three hoped they would never hear from again - her father was Ramji Rao ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]). However, Ramji Rao, after escaping with the money from the second movie, has given up his criminal ways and was baptized, becoming a Christian and soon marrying and having Nithya as his daughter. He was no longer Ramji Rao, but went by his pastor name of Kunjumon (meaning "little boy" in Malayalam). Another thing they find out is that Mahendra Varma has a twin brother named Hareendra Varma (also portrayed by Menon), an international criminal wanted for murdering an Italian diamond merchant for a rare diamond that let loose a light pattern on the wall when held up to light. Mahendra had been entrusted with the diamond by Hareendra but Mahendra had wandered off. Hareendra kidnaps the twin teenage daughters of Gopalakrishnan and Stella Fernandez (now living under the alias "Lakshmi") and demands the diamond. Mannar Mathai, Balakrishnan, and Gopalakrishnan realize that the bag that the diamond is in is under the possession currently of the local police S.I. and decide to get "Kunjumon" to resume his alias of Ramji Rao and steal it for them by faking that Nithya is in danger, but "complications" arise when Garvasees Aashan kidnap Nithya in order to force Gopalakrishnan to accept the lead actress that they pick out.

After graduating, Manjunath joins a petroleum company as a sales officer. He is posted in Lakhimpur Kheri, a remote district in rural Uttar Pradesh. One day Manjunath goes missing.  His friends panic, because they know that of late he had been very disturbed and was behaving strangely. He had become serious and scared. He was different from the Manjunath they knew in college, who was always jovial, fun-loving, friendly, and a great entertainer.  One of his friends finds him, but Manjunath is frantic. They send him back to his hometown. Manjunath's parents try to convince him to leave his job at Bharat Oil that is causing him stress. Initially he seems willing but slowly he realises that he doesn't want to be a quitter. (Manjunath believes that, being from a top institute in the country, he has been given an opportunity. As the eldest son of a mineworker, he has had a humble upbringing.)  He realises that the kerosene, mixed with diesel, is coming from ration shops — 'it's the poor people's kerosene'. In addition, he becomes conscious of the extent of pollution caused by burning adulterated fuel. He finds strength and comes back to fight, against his parents wishes.  There is a clear threat to his life, because he insists on doing his duty to stop petrol adulteration. This time, Manjunath is not deterred. He continues doing what he considers right, without worrying about the consequences. As a result, one night he gets brutally killed by the people who are harmed by his doing his duty. His family and friends suffer over his death. They wonder why he put himself in so much danger.  Slowly, the worst fears start coming true. Beyond the initial grief, no one wants to come forward to carry on the fight.  In the film, Manjunath is shown watching what happens after he dies. He is starting to feel that it is all pointless. He cannot watch his parents' tears any more: What was their fault? Maybe he should have compromised. But how can people not see what he has? What he fought was something very big and very important.  Suddenly, people who have no connection to him realise the importance of what Manjunath did and start trying to do something. Like novices, they search their way around: Their will is strong. They start getting help again from unexpected quarters. It is nerve-wracking, with dangers for everyone. Then, instead of one or two, there are a lot people helping. Manjunath, who has lost hope, realises that it's not all going waste.  He hopes and prays that they succeed.  The film cuts back and forth from a rock concert. The conflict of the story is not whether Manjunath lived or died, but if the effect of Manjunath lives or dies, and in the end that's the victory.

Troubled and with no leads, the two attempt to spy on Quini, the handsome and suave former boyfriend of Carmen. Quini, now dating another town girl, Marina, manages to sneak up on the detectives after they've followed him and attempts to threaten them with a knife. After disarming and sending him away, the two agree that Quini must be part of whatever is occurring. The problem proves to be even bigger after a drunk man named Castro tells the detectives about a similar case: his girlfriend, Beatriz, was close to Quini and the sisters, and was found dismembered in the marshes, her suitcase floating there.  Pedro and Juan continue to investigate, gradually unraveling secrets. It is revealed that the riverboats and marshes are being used to smuggle and transport [[heroin]], and that Rodrigo had stolen a [[Kilogram|kilo]] and sold it, getting him in trouble with the locals. However, the locals involved in the drugs seek out the detectives, revealing their participation in drug smuggling in full but claiming they had nothing to do with the sisters' deaths. One of the men does aid the investigation, however, by describing a white [[Dyane 6]] he saw at the church where one of the girls' purse was found. After digging through more victims' items, the two see a pattern of out-of-town job [[brochure]]s for women, eventually linking Quini to a man named Sebastian. Digging through Sebastian's past, they find a [[Arrest warrant|warrant]] out for him for the possible sexual molestation of a child, solidifying his chance of being the main culprit. Juan and Pedro deduce that Quini and Sebastian were luring the young women of the town, who were aching to leave and find their own independence through work, by passing these brochures around and then entrapping them into sexual slavery at a local [[hunting lodge]].  The waters grow murky, however, when Pedro becomes aware of Juan's past shooting of a girl at a protest during the Franco Era. Pedro is also angered after a possible third culprit, a local factory owner named Alfonso Corrales, is brushed over, most likely due to complex [[Political corruption|political ties]]. The two continue on though, eventually deducing Sebastian's cover as the watchman of the hunting lodge. Pedro attempts to tail his white Dyane 6, but loses him. With the help of a local poacher named Jesús, the trio finally chase Sebastian into the marshes. All three are shot by the sniping Sebastian, though as he is about to slay Pedro, Juan is able to sneak up and stab him, which he does repeatedly, in a state. After Sebastian falls dead into the swamp, Juan opens the trunk of the car to rescue a bruised but still alive Marina.  The town is brought peace after the case is solved, as well as by the local worker's union accepting a pay raise (which in principle, they felt was too low). All seems well for the detectives too, as Pedro sees a promotion and relocation closer to his own home and wife. On the final night of their stay however, Pedro receives photographs from a journalist who has helped on the case. Though Juan justified his shooting story by saying it was his former partner's actions, the journalist reveals him to have actually been a brutal enforcer for Franco's secret police force, and to have once been known as 'The Crow'.  In the morning, before they drive home, Juan asks a stoney-faced Pedro if they 'are good'. Pedro does not answer, and the two ride off to an uncertain future.

The Maze Runner (film)
  A teenager wakes up inside an underground elevator with no memory of his identity. A group of male youths greet him in a large grassy area called the "Glade" enclosed by tall stone walls. The boys ("Gladers") have formed a rudimentary society, with each assuming specialized tasks. Their leader, Alby, says that every boy eventually recalls his name but not his past. The boy learns that a vast Maze surrounding them may be the only way out. During the day, designated Runners search the Maze for an escape route, returning before nightfall when the entrance closes. No one has ever survived a night in the Maze.  While in a competition with another boy named Gally, the boy suddenly remembers his name: Thomas. The next day, he is attacked by Ben, a Runner who has been stung and left delirious by a Griever&nbsp;– deadly techno-organic creatures that roam the Maze at night. Ben is forced into the Maze and left to die, as there is no cure for his condition. Alby and Minho, the lead Runner, later retrace Ben's steps inside the Maze. Minho reappears at dusk dragging Alby, who is stung, but they are unable to reach the closing entrance in time. Thomas runs into the Maze to help, leaving all three trapped. Thomas lures a Griever into a closing passageway, causing it to be crushed. The trio manages to survive the night, returning the next morning.  The first-ever girl arrives in the elevator, with a note saying that she is the last one to enter the Glade. She recognizes Thomas, though he cannot remember her. Thomas, Minho, Frypan, Winston, and Zart enter the Maze, locate the Griever corpse, and remove a beeping mechanical device from inside it. Gally claims Thomas has jeopardized the fragile peace between the youths and the Grievers and wants him punished, but Newt, the group's second-in-command, instead designates Thomas as a Runner. Minho shows Thomas a hand-constructed model of the Maze based on previous exploration. The Maze's numbered sections open and close in a regular sequence. Thomas realizes that the device corresponds to a section within the Maze.  The girl, Teresa, has two syringes filled with an unknown substance. One is used on Alby, and he recovers from the Griever sting. Minho and Thomas venture back into the Maze with the device and discover a possible exit. A laser then scans the two, and the exit closes. Thomas and Minho start to run away as traps activated by lasers nearly kill them. That night, the Maze entrance does not close while others open, letting Grievers pour in. A massacre ensues as the Gladers struggle to fight back or hide. Alby, Zart, Clint, and several others are killed.  Afterwards, Gally punches Thomas and blames him for everything that happened. Thomas, who has been having disconnected memory flashes since arriving, stabs himself with a severed Griever stinger in an attempt to revive his memory. The others inject him with the last anti-venom. Unconscious, he recalls that he and Teresa worked for the organization that created the Maze, W.C.K.D.; the boys unknowingly have been test subjects for an experiment. Thomas awakens and shares this information with Newt, Minho, Chuck, and Teresa. Thomas then reveals himself and Teresa, confessing that they worked with W.C.K.D. and studied the boys for years.  Meanwhile, Gally has taken command and intends to sacrifice Thomas and Teresa to the Grievers to restore peace. However, several Gladers form a group and free them. They then approach the Maze in an attempt to find an escape, while Gally and a few others refuse to leave. Fighting Grievers as they go, Jeff and several other Gladers are killed. The Gladers eventually enter a laboratory strewn with corpses. In a video recording, a woman named Ava Paige explains that the planet has been devastated by a massive [[solar flare]], followed by a pandemic of a deadly virus called the Flare. The teens learn that they were part of an experiment studying for a cure. Paige is seen shooting herself on the screen as the lab is attacked by armed men.  Gally suddenly appears with a gun. Having been stung by a Griever, he insists they must stay in the Maze and aims at Thomas, but is pierced through the chest by Minho's spear, but not before Chuck is fatally shot. Masked armed men then rush in and take the rest of the group to a helicopter. It flies over a vast desert wasteland and approaches a ruined city. The scene ends with the supposedly-dead scientists meeting in a room. Paige notes that the experiment is successful; the survivors are now entering [[Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials|Phase Two]].  
Meaghamann
  The story begins in Goa where six dead bodies are washed ashore. The Goa Drug Lord Jothi ([[Ashutosh Rana]]) is responsible for this. The Police Department of India are unable to capture him for nearly a decade because not a single person has seen him in person as he is constantly on the move and has no permanent aides or accomplices.  Chitti ([[Mahadevan (actor)|Mahadevan]]) is in charge for the drug trafficking in and around Goa. One day, he receives a call from Jothi about a missing drug consignment. Chitti and his men are unable to hunt down the culprit. It is revealed that Shiva ([[Arya]]) is the mastermind behind the drug theft. We see that Shiva is working for Chitti as his most trusted henchman. Chitti, along with Shiva and his nephew Guru ([[Harish Uthaman]]), run an underworld drug empire in Goa.  In a turn of events, we see that Shiva is actually Arul, an undercover police officer who is assigned to expose Jothi and his entire drug cartel. He receives instructions from his higher officers Bharathi ([[Anupama Kumar]]) and Benjamin Vas (O A K Sundar), and he also informs them about all the activities of his gang from time to time. Arul is into this mission along with his best friend and colleague Karthik ([[Ramana (actor)|Ramana]]), who also takes a stage name as Maanik, and he works for Sharma ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), another drug lord from Mumbai, who is in possession of 1000&nbsp;kg of pure heroin and is presently, looking for a buyer.  The plan of Bharathi, Benjamin, and their team is to make Sharma and Jothi meet each other for the transaction of the 1000&nbsp;kg of heroin and then arrest them together. Arul informs Bharathi that initially Sharma and Jothi are planning for a trial with just 100&nbsp;kg of heroin, and that if all goes well, they will deal with the remaining 900&nbsp;kg. Bharathi and her team wisely plan to capture the huge bulk of 900&nbsp;kg of drugs along with Sharma and Jothi. So they have to leave the first trial transaction unmonitored. However, all plans go awry when Bharathi's jealous boss does not agree to her plan and conducts a raid for the trial transaction in the last moment. This exposes Karthik, and he is taken to Chitti's place and gets tortured by Guru and his gang to reveal the identity of any other man working with him.  Unable to bear the pain, Karthik reveals that Arul is the other undercover officer. Guru informs Chitti about Arul's true identity, and when they attempt to kill him, Arul guns down Chitti and starts eliminating all the gang members including Guru. Soon, Arul finds Karthik, but within moments, Karthik dies.   Jothi is now aware of the death of Chitti and his entire crew, and uses his influence to the police officers to bring Arul into his custody. So the police force and Jothi's men join hands and hunt for Arul. Arul, now all alone on this mission, still continues his own plan to expose Jothi and gets himself captured on purpose. Now that he has nothing to lose, he plans to play a final game of chance to meet Jothi face to face, earn his trust, and join as henchman again. Arul is the only survivor of the shootout at Chitti's place, and so only his account to Jothi will earn his trust.  Arul is brought to Jothi for the first time, and he is also able to cleverly convince him, but only up to an extent. He tells Jothi that his former partner-turned-archenemy Rane ([[Sudhanshu Pandey]]) is responsible for the drug theft (mentioned at the beginning), and shootout at Chitti's place. He says that all this while Jothi had been thinking that Rane was dead, but now Rane is actually alive and is plotting his revenge. Jothi is still skeptical, so Arul is given 2 days to prove Rane is alive and has done all these things. Arul succeeds by getting help from a prostitute ([[Sanjana Singh]]) whom he helped earlier. He also places all the stolen drugs at Rane's house and leads Jothi's men there, and they find the lost drugs. Jothi asks his men to kill Rane and his gang. Shiva cleverly does certain manipulations and kills Rane and his men and places his own guns in Rane's hands. This leads Jothi and his men to believe that Rane's gun and the one used in the shootout at Chitti's place are /the same. The gun is also sent for ballistic testing to check on Shiva's story, and they all believe that Shiva's story is true.  Soon, Jothi asks Arul to join his gang and meet him at a secluded place. When Arul waits for the opportunity to gun down Jothi, he gets beaten up by his men. It is then revealed that Usha ([[Hansika Motwani]]), his neighbor who has a huge crush on him, had been secretly recording videos of him on her phone for her to admire. But her phone is stolen and it falls into the hands of Jothi's men. They find whom Arul has been meeting and dealing with so far, and they come to know that he is also an undercover cop. As a result, Bharathi and Benjamin are assassinated by Jothi's men. Jothi and his men then beat Arul savagely, keep him bound in a harbor, and ask him the whereabouts of Sharma's remaining 900&nbsp;kg of heroin. Arul whispers the location and as Jothi comes closer to hear him, Arul spits out a blade at Jothi's eye. When all his men are distracted momentarily, Arul escapes from his captors and kills them, leaving Jothi alone, and arrests him. Since nobody alive has seen Jothi in person, his arrest is unavoidable, and no political influence will work out anymore.  As the credits roll, we see that Arul humbly rejects Usha's proposal and asks her to focus on her life. Arul then moves on to his next mission and kills Sharma and seizes the remaining 900&nbsp;kg of heroin.

Mega Shark Versus Mecha Shark
 A tugboat pulling a huge iceberg arrives at a port in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], when suddenly, the iceberg shatters and releases a [[megalodon]] from suspended animation. The Mega Shark begins its reign of terror by flipping the tugboat to the air until it crashes and decapitates the [[Sphinx]] hundreds of miles away in [[Giza]]. Following the incident, several countries around the world place their ports on lockdown and impose a ban on fishing, adversely affecting the world's economy as the megalodon terrorizes the seas. Meanwhile, rumors surface of the [[United Nations]]' proposal to develop a weapon to combat the shark.  At [[Pearl Harbor]], Jack Turner and Rosie Gray are assigned to pilot the Mecha Shark, a new prototype submarine that resembles the megalodon. Jack, however, is skeptical about the untested prototype, as it is not equipped with their special [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] named "Nero". Later, aboard the USS ''Charles Davis'', Admiral Engleberg is warned by Dr. Emma McNeil that the megalodon's aggression attributes to its search for a mate. After the [[USS Virginia (SSN-774)|USS ''Virginia'']] confirms the presence of the megalodon within the [[South China Sea]], the ''Charles Davis'' and the Mecha Shark head to rendezvous with the ''Virginia''. Rosie takes the Mecha Shark and hits the mega shark with a tracking projectile. The ''Virginia'' fires a torpedo that hits the shark. Rosie launches a torpedo toward the megalodon, but she inadvertently sinks the ''Virginia'' before the mega shark damages the prototype. Following the failed operation, Jack installs Nero into the Mecha Shark's computer. Meanwhile, the megalodon strikes the AR Event Horizon oil platform off the coast of Australia, triggering a devastating oil spill.  Rosie takes the Mecha Shark back underwater as she and Nero duke it out with the megalodon, but they discover a damaged oil pipeline in the area. Jack and Adm. Engleberg engage in a heated argument over the decision to either seal the pipeline or continue the pursuit on the mega shark. Rosie uses the Mecha Shark to seal the leak by crushing the damaged pipe before continuing her objective. The megalodon launches itself into the air to sink a commercial airliner, but the Mecha Shark rushes in to tackle it mid-air back into the ocean. In the ensuing battle, the tracking projectile falls off the megalodon's body. Rosie fires a torpedo toward the mega shark, but it uses its tail fin to swat it toward the ''Charles Davis'' fleet, sinking one of the ships. The Mecha Shark follows the megalodon into a trench; Rosie fires another torpedo that causes a landslide that sends the submarine offline and knocks Rosie unconscious. A few minutes later, Nero's system reboots and notifies Jack that the Mecha Shark is wedged between several rocks, but it manages to blast its way out of the debris. The megalodon attacks the USS ''James Stewart'' aircraft carrier, which is field-testing her high-frequency emitters. Jack and Adm. Engleberg tell the ''James Stewart'' crew to turn off her emitters; the attack is briefly halted, but the megalodon jumps to intercept a fighter plane and crushes the carrier in the process.  After the Mecha Shark returns to the ''Charles Davis'', Jack and Adm. Engleberg argue over putting an unconscious Rosie back in the field when Nero suggests it can control the submarine by itself. Mecha Shark returns to sea, but it is critically damaged by the megalodon. After Rosie awakens, she is summoned to Emma's research facility in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], where Emma reveals that the megalodon is headed toward [[Sydney]], a spawning ground of its species millions of years earlier. Sydney is promptly evacuated while Nero goes back online, yet Jack cannot pinpoint the glitch that caused its defeat. As predicted, the megalodon arrives in Sydney's shores; the Mecha Shark with Nero in control is once again deployed to engage it in battle. Nero once again malfunctions; this time, the Mecha Shark enters Drone Mode, a fail-safe system programmed to complete its task without the safety protocols. The megalodon tackles Mecha Shark and hurls it toward the [[Sydney Opera House]]. Jack rushes to Sydney and reunites with Rosie, but Mecha Shark goes back online and determines all humans in sight as hostile after soldiers point their guns at it. As the Mecha Shark goes into amphibious mode and terrorizes the streets, Emma calls Rosie and suggests to lure it back into the ocean and convince the megalodon to destroy it. Rosie rushes in to board the Mecha Shark to trigger the pulse generator. Meanwhile, the megalodon sinks the ''Charles Davis'', kiling Adm. Engleberg and everyone aboard. The Mecha Shark is blasted back into the water by a squadron of fighter planes. Jack boards a second shark submarine to board the Mecha Shark and get Nero back online. Jack and Rosie leave the Mecha Shark before the megalodon bites the left side of the submarine, triggering a dislodged torpedo which destroys both combatants in the explosion. Jack reveals to Rosie that he copied Nero's system into a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] before telling her they have some explaining to do to the Australian authorities.

Meanwhile, Alan ([[Stephen Plunkett]]) and his girlfriend Farrah ([[Mickey Sumner]]) are caught up in conversation in the aftermath of an ill-fated sexual encounter, preparing for a house party in their small Harlem brownstone apartment.  The guests include friends of Farrah from her job working at a New York modern dance company as well as Alan's co-workers from his job as a [[legal aid]] lawyer.  In the midst of the party, as Farrah tends to guests, she spots Mat seated in the living room and Alan and Mat make eye contact linking the two seemingly separate story lines.  At the party, Alan informs Mat that he is about to leave the next morning with Farrah for a vacation to [[Quebec]], where he intends to propose to his girlfriend.

Donald and Helen Truby are a married couple who have become sexually unsatisfied. Their teenage son Chris has been viewing pornography since the age of 10 with his preferences becoming more and more extreme to the point he is unable to become aroused by material deemed "normal" by society. Tim Mooney is a high school student and football star, of which his father Kent is very proud, who has become depressed in the wake of his parents' divorce and abandonment by his mother. He quits the football team and begins to spend all his time playing an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]]. He has also come to believe, referencing [[Carl Sagan]]'s reflections about the ''[[Pale Blue Dot (book)|Pale Blue Dot]]'', that human life is insignificant in context of the universe. Hannah is a high school girl who wishes to be famous one day. Her mother Joan helps her maintain an online modeling site where she posts inappropriate pictures of herself in lingerie for subscribers who request private photo sessions. Brandy Beltmeyer is a classmate of Tim's who is introverted and has her online content constantly monitored by her overprotective mother Patricia. Unbeknownst to her mother, Brandy has a separate [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]] she switches to while away from home and a secret [[Tumblr]] account she uses to express herself. Allison Doss is a friend of Hannah's who feels sexually inexperienced compared to Hannah and wishes to have sex with a boy named Brandon Lender. To make herself seem more attractive, she turns to dietary articles online to drastically lose weight.  After seeing a television ad for the website Ashley Madison one night, Helen creates an account and begins having multiple affairs, while Donald starts to regularly visit escorts after failing to initiate sex with Helen for almost two months. Chris enters a relationship with Hannah over the course of doing a school project together, and tries to condition himself to become aroused by "traditional means" of simply seeing her many sexts with him. Hannah meanwhile has auditioned for an acting competition that will land her a television role. Kent, feeling distant from his son, attends an online content awareness meeting held by Patricia in order to better understand Tim's interest in video games, while Joan also attends the meeting to learn more about what she is legally allowed to put on her daughter's website. Both are amused by Patricia's obvious paranoia and begin a relationship. Meanwhile, Tim and Brandy also begin a relationship, but Patricia initially intercepts their messages while Brandy is at home. Brandy tells Tim about her Tumblr account, and they soon become a couple, with Tim confessing that she makes him feel that everything is not pointless. While playing online with his friends, Tim sees a Facebook post by his mother showing pictures of her being happily remarried. When he shares this with his friends, they begin to post lewd comments, which he ignores. Allison is successful in having sex with Brandon while visiting a friend's house, but he treats the whole affair as casual and is clearly not interested in a relationship.   Allison collapses during school and is brought to the hospital, where she learns that her encounter with Brandon left her pregnant but she has miscarried due to malnourishment, both facts which shock her parents. When she informs Brandon, his only concern is people discovering they had sex. Hannah and Chris start to initiate sex, but Chris fails to become aroused. Hannah later tells her friends that they had sex, causing Chris to confront her. She admits she only saw him as her "best shot" to lose her virginity, and claims he has "sexual issues", causing them to break up. Joan learns that the competition has disqualified Hannah because of the website, even though her audition was the best. Donald accidentally discovers Helen's Ashley Madison account, and goes to the same bar she is having an affair at. Seeing she has been caught, she tries to discuss it with Donald the next morning, only for him to admit he has also been having affairs, and says it is better if they just ignore what they have done. Joan confesses to Kent about the website, and is distraught that her daughter's real chance to be famous has been ruined because of her poor parenting. Kent, shocked by the news, says it is best if they do not see each other. Patricia discovers Brandy's Tumblr page, and after scrolling through her conversations with Tim and seeing his own page covered in video game content, is overwhelmed with fear and confiscates all of her online privileges. Kent reads all the lewd comments on Tim's game, and confronts him about it. Tim brings up the pictures his mother posted on [[Facebook]], causing Kent to say she abandoned the both of them. He deletes the game and demands Tim play football next year, causing Tim to have a break down.  Joan tells Hannah about being disqualified from the competition, and says she has taken down the site, admitting she was wrong to support it. Hannah is furious, but Joan says she is still the parent. Allison is made to walk two miles to Brandon's house in the middle of the night in order to talk to him, but when she arrives she realizes how selfish he is and throws a rock through his window before leaving. When Tim attempts to reach out to Brandy for support, Patricia poses as Brandy, claiming she is bored of him and says she will block him if he texts her again. Despondent, Tim overdoses on his antidepressants. Brandy rushes to Tim's house, where she and Kent find him on the floor. They rush him to the emergency room, where he is successfully revived. While searching for Brandy, Patricia finds her at the hospital and figures out what happened. Bursting into tears after realizing her actions nearly caused Tim's death, she returns home and deactivates the surveillance device she uses to monitor Brandy. After reconciling with Tim and realizing how hard being a single parent is, Kent reconnects with Joan. The narrator closes the film by quoting the ''Pale Blue Dot'' while showing the Voyager satellite drifting through space.

The Midnight After
 Seventeen people board a Hong Kong minibus going from Mong Kok to Tai Po: driver Suet; Yau Tsi-chi and Yuki, who are visiting their respective dates; Fat, an aging gangster; Mook Sau-ying, a fortune-telling insurance salesperson; Shun, a computer technician; Pat and Bobby, a married couple; Blind Fai, a drug addict; Auyeung Wai, a music store salesperson; Lavina, a quiet, buck-toothed woman; Airplane and Glu-Stick, rowdy boys; and university students Tsing, Peter, Dawg, and Hung.  As the minibus enters a tunnel, Fat notices the traffic seemingly disappear, and several other passengers remark upon how quiet the streets have become.  The university students leave on the first stop, and one immediately becomes ill.  By the second stop, the passengers come to believe they are the only people remaining in Hong Kong.  They propose various explanations, though Mook insists destiny has brought them together to experience a paranormal event.  Before leaving, the passengers exchange phone numbers.  Yau and Yuki leave together, and as Yuki talks about missing her boyfriend, Yau sees a man in a gas mask, though he keeps this from Yuki.  After she leaves, Yau encounters the university students, all of whom have now become ill.  They beg him for help as they melt before him.  Yau swerves to avoid them on his bicycle as he speeds past, and the last remaining student curses him as he dies.  Yau crosses the tunnel to return home but finds nobody there.  Each of the passengers receives a phone call comprising noises and mechanical screeches.  They meet at a diner to discuss it, where Shun reveals he has performed audio analysis on it.  He decodes English phrases that Auyeung recognizes as lyrics from [[David Bowie]]'s song "[[Space Oddity]]".  No one understands its significance, though Mook continues to insist on a paranormal interpretation.  After each describes their background, Auyeung bursts into flames from the [[Explosion]] by his [[Electronics]]  and dies.  Spooked, Yau describes the man in a gas mask, though Yuki claims not to have been with him at the time.  Yau spots another man in a gas mask, and he, Bobby, and Fat chase after the man.  Before catching him, they discover Lavina's body, surmising that she was raped before dying of a possibly-contagious illness.  The man, revealed to be Japanese, claims through a mobile translation app to be there to save them and a former classmate of Yau's.  Yau denies knowing him.  As the Japanese man escapes, he says something about "fuku", which they speculate could be a reference to the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]].  Before returning with the others, Yau receives a phone call from his girlfriend, Yi, in which she claims he has disappeared for six years.  The call ends abruptly as she makes oblique references to [[Major Tom]] and [[Tai Mo Shan]].  Bobby suddenly dies shortly after Yau's return.  Fat sends Suet to retrieve and refuel his bus upon learning of Yi's phone call.  On the way, Suet is forced to kill a zombified Blind Fai with a cleaver.  On Suet's return, Glu-Stick accuses Airplane of raping Lavina, who was an attractive thief in disguise.  Glu-Stick says Lavina died mysteriously during her rape, but, undeterred by her death, Airplane continued assaulting her.  Disgusted, the others discuss banishing Airplane, though Pat demands Airplane be killed for spreading Lavina's infection and causing Bobby's death.  Yau reluctantly agrees, and each ritually stabs Airplane to death, including Glu-Stick.  While Shun disposes of Airplane's body, Airplane suddenly revives.  Shun argues his attack was the least vicious and offers to help Airplane get revenge on his killers.  Airplane agrees, only to be killed again by Shun.  As they board the minibus to go to Tai Mo Shan, the group sees more gas-masked people accompanied by [[Armoured fighting vehicle|armour]].  Two of the armour ram the minibus, but the damaged vehicle escapes and continues on its journey.  After becoming annoyed with Glu-Stick, they briefly banish him before allowing him back in, along with Fai, who is inexplicably still alive.  As they drive toward Tai Mo Shan, a red rain falls on the minibus, and several passengers experience regret at leaving the city.  
Midnight Hair
 A Mu moves with his wife, Le Xiaomei, who is two months pregnant, to a mountainside villa owned by his friend, A Ming. The villa is decorated with paintings of two boys playing [[string game]] and there is also a locked room A Mu claimed belonging to A Ming. Supernatural occurrences begin to haunt the couple, including a red doll that stalks Xiaomei, a music tape that plays a string game song, and most importantly, a ghostly woman with long hair and white dress. The doll is disposed of by A Mu at Xiaomei's request, while the paintings always resurface back whenever Xiaomei tries to remove it. A Mu also sees a woman in black robe who seems to watch him while going to work everyday.  One day, the two visit the orphanage that A Mu grew up in to become fundraisers. Xiaomei learns about a loner orphan in A Mu's generation named Xiaoshan who died when he was 10 years old. After a series of boxes containing increasingly threatening messages are left at his doorstep, A Mu installs security cameras around the house. That night, Xiaomei watches the footage to find a cloaked figure leaving the house. She decides to break into A Ming's room, finding more paintings of the boys and the disposed red doll. Spooked by the woman, Xiaomei runs away, pulling some of the woman's hair in the process, and falls off the stairs, causing her baby's miscarriage.  Arriving back at home from the hospital, Xiaomei forces A Mu to reveal the truth about Qingqing, his fellow orphan and childhood friend together with A Ming. A Mu and Qingqing maintain their relationship well to adulthood, but Qingqing apparently left him for a rich man when he struggled on money. She was subsequently killed by A Ming, who justified his actions due to her unfaithfulness. A Ming buried her body and showed it to A Mu the previous night, despite Xiaomei's claims about the hair. Another box is soon delivered to the couple, warning about not combing the hair during midnight, a trait of Qingqing. Xiaomei does just that and summons the woman in white, who tells her that A Ming does not exist.  From A Mu's orphanage, Xiaomei learns that "A Ming" is a nickname given to Xiaoshan, the son of two imprisoned thieves whose only friend in the orphanage was A Mu. One day, the two escaped from a locked room they were imprisoned in for robbery but slipped through the roofs. The dean chose to save A Mu over A Ming, as A Mu is her grandson born out of wedlock. She promptly gave offerings for A Ming, but suffered a heart attack and died with her face burnt. Xiaomei is visited by the woman in white, revealed to be Qingqing's younger half-sister, Yu Xiaohan. Xiaohan apologizes for the miscarriage and states that she wants Mu Kainan, A Mu's real name, to confess in his murder of Qingqing, the latter having supported Xiaohan's [[leukemia]] treatment and being the only family who supported her. She does this by haunting him, as "people would tell the truth if they are scared". A Mu arrives, exhibiting his [[dissociative identity disorder]] by constantly switching between his A Mu and A Ming's persona. In his A Ming's persona, he knocks out Xiaomei and bounds her, confirming his deeds including the murder of his grandmother. However, he is unable to kill her due to A Mu's memories of their relationship resurfacing. A Mu decides to commit suicide to prevent himself from harming Xiaomei even further.  Xiaomei visits Xiaohan at the hospital to inform her that A Mu left some money for her and Qingqing so she could pay her bills, wishing her recovery and saying that she is not alone anymore. Next she visits A Mu's orphanage and is horrified when she meets a new girl, Yangyang, carrying the red doll. Yangyang sings the string game song and a hand grabs the doll before the movie cuts off.

Million Dollar Arm
 [[J. B. Bernstein]] is a big-time [[sports agent]] who, along with his partner [[Ash Vasudevan]], recently formed their own company. Unfortunately, all of J. B.'s clients have retired, and he is unable to reel in star football player Popo Vanuatu. Desperate to find new clients, J. B. realizes [[India]], with over one billion people, has real potential for untapped baseball talent. He approaches investor Mr. Chang with his proposal—a talent contest staged in India called "Million Dollar Arm." Contestants score points by demonstrating they can pitch a baseball with speed and accuracy. Along with the prize money, two winners will be flown to the U.S. and receive coaching to become legitimate baseball prospects within two years. Chang commits to providing the funding, on the condition the prospects are ready within only one year. With no alternative, J. B. reluctantly assures Chang the winners will be ready for a major-league try-out within one year.  J. B. approaches veteran [[baseball]] [[Pitch (baseball)|pitching]] coach [[Tom House]] who explains that [[cricket]], the main sport played in India, and baseball have entirely different motions for [[Bowling (cricket)|bowling]] and pitching, and getting a fresh recruit ready for a try-out within one year is extremely unlikely, if not impossible. J. B. points how House has nothing to lose and everything to gain by taking up the challenge, and House agrees.  While Ash is holding down the fort in Los Angeles, J. B. flies to India. He is bewildered by the traffic, the overcrowding, and the lax way Indians conduct business. He is joined by the curmudgeonly Ray Poitevint, a longtime major league scout, and hires Amit Rohan as his interpreter. After lengthy try-outs in numerous cities, two youngsters emerge as the winners — [[Rinku Singh]] and [[Dinesh Patel]], and they are flown to the U.S. to begin their baseball training. The pair, who grew up in poverty in India and do not speak or understand English, are instantly overwhelmed by the sights and sounds of America, although when J. B. introduces them to [[pizza]], Rinku promptly develops a liking for it. Things soon come to a crunch when they are detained by hotel security for messing with elevator emergency controls, inadvertently getting themselves stuck and setting off the fire alarm. J. B. is subsequently forced to invite them to stay at his home. For their baseball training, J. B. dumps the pair by House and his staff while he runs off to close more deals. In being treated so, the pair feels like social outcasts. J. B.'s tenant Brenda Fenwick is the only person who genuinely seems interested in their well-being.  When J. B. takes the boys and Amit to a party thrown by Popo, whom J. B. hopes to sign, things get worse when Amit gets drunk after mistakenly drinking a punch with alcohol and Rinku becomes sick from [[overeating]] and as a result, both [[vomit]] on J. B.'s [[windshield]], forcing an enraged J. B. to drive them home, and forfeit the deal with Popo, who signed with someone else. Brenda calms him down and makes him realize he is treating the two boys like a business deal. The next day, J. B. trades in his [[Porsche]] for a [[Dodge Caravan]] and joins the boys for their prayers. Ignoring J. B.'s pleas of the two boys' lack of readiness, Chang insists his terms be fulfilled and the boys demonstrate their baseball skills one year from the time they arrived in the US. [[ESPN]], ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', and local media are joined by numerous major-league scouts to watch the boys pitch. The try-out is a complete disaster, as the pair is both very nervous and pitch without speed or control, failing to impress anyone.  Brenda convinces J. B. that the boys be given another try-out. Chang refused to go along with it, and no scouts are interested in wasting their time on another fiasco. All hope is lost until Ray arranges for J. B. to meet the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] head scout who was away in [[Puerto Rico]] for the first try-out, and agrees to come. Chang changes his mind and sees the second try-out of Singh and Patel. This time, J. B. insists the boys relax and have fun. The scouts are quickly impressed as the pair consistently deliver 90+&nbsp;mph [[fastballs]] thrown accurately, and both are offered a contract by the Pittsburgh Pirates.  
A Million Ways to Die in the West
 In 1882, in the town of Old Stump, [[Arizona]], a cowardly sheep farmer named Albert Stark ([[Seth MacFarlane]]) is dumped by his girlfriend Louise ([[Amanda Seyfried]]) as a result of his withdrawal from a gunfight. He prepares to leave for [[San Francisco]], believing that the frontier offers nothing for him. Meanwhile, infamous outlaw Clinch Leatherwood ([[Liam Neeson]]) robs and kills an old prospector ([[Matt Clark (actor)|Matt Clark]]) for a gold nugget. He orders his right-hand man Lewis ([[Evan Jones (actor)|Evan Jones]]) to escort his wife Anna ([[Charlize Theron]]) to Old Stump to lie low while he continues his banditry.

During the ensuing fight, Albert saves Anna from being crushed to death by two of the brawlers, and the two become close friends. They attend a county fair where Louise's new boyfriend, the haughty Foy ([[Neil Patrick Harris]]), challenges Albert to a shooting contest. Albert is defeated, but Anna steps in and defeats Foy. Foy mocks Albert, who angrily challenges Foy to a duel in a week's time. Anna then spends the week teaching Albert how to shoot.  During a barn dance the night before the duel, Anna slips Foy a [[Mickey Finn (drugs)|Mickey]]. After leaving the dance, Albert and Anna kiss before heading home. Upon breaking out of jail and murdering the sheriff, Lewis witnesses the kiss and reports it to Clinch. On the day of the duel, Foy arrives late and goes into convulsions from the [[laxative]] he had unknowingly drunk. Albert, who has decided that Louise is not worth fighting for, once again forfeits the duel. He retires to the saloon, but Clinch arrives and demands to know who kissed his wife. When no one comes forward, Clinch shoots a nearby cowboy ([[Ryan Reynolds]]). He reveals that Anna is his wife and threatens to continue killing unless his wife's lover duels him at noon the next day. Clinch later forces Anna to reveal Albert's name and then prepares to have sex with her, but she knocks him unconscious and escapes.  Anna returns to Albert's farm, where he angrily shouts at her for lying to him. Clinch pursues Anna to the farm; Albert helps her escape, then escapes himself. While fleeing, he is captured by a tribe of Apache Indians, who threaten to burn him alive. The Indians spare him when he reveals that he can speak their language. They give him a bowl of [[peyote]], which sends him flashing back to his birth and through painful events of his childhood before making him [[Epiphany (feeling)|realize]] that he loves Anna. Meanwhile, Clinch recaptures Anna in town, in front of Edward's ([[Giovanni Ribisi]]) house. Albert returns to Old Stump and confronts Clinch. He wounds Clinch with a bullet poisoned with rattlesnake venom before his own gun is shot out of his hand, but he manages to stall until Clinch fatally succumbs to the poison. Louise attempts to win back Albert, but he rejects her and instead happily enters a relationship with Anna. Albert also receives a bounty for killing Clinch and uses the money to buy more sheep.  Later at the Fair, the proprietor of a racially charged shooting game called "Runaway Slave" asks who would like to take a shot. [[Django (character)|Django]] ([[Jamie Foxx]]) steps up and shoots the man while commenting that "people die at the fair".

Miss Meadows
 Miss Mary Meadows is a young woman who works as a substitute first-grade elementary school teacher who enjoys taking long walks in her suburban neighborhood, wearing traditional clothing and tap-dancing shoes. Unknown to everyone, she is a secret vigilante who kills local thugs who accost her or when she witnesses them committing crimes. She always carries a small semi-automatic pistol in her purse and speaks in a childlike, innocent manner. She lives by herself in a small house and talks occasionally with her mother over the telephone about what she did during the day.  Investigating the vigilante killings is a local sheriff. He soon meets and develops an attraction to Miss Meadows due to her old-fashioned clothing and style of speech. When he begins to suspect that the woman he finds himself drawn to may be the suspect he is looking for, the sheriff is torn over whether to arrest her or protect her.  When Miss Meadows meets an ex-convict named Skylar, who she learns served time for molesting young children, she begins to fear for her young students' safety. When Miss Meadows approaches and threatens to kill Skylar if he continues hanging around the school or around her kids, he begins stalking her.  It is eventually revealed that all of the telephone conversations that Miss Meadows has been having with her mother over the course of the film are imaginary. As a young girl, Mary Meadows witnessed her mother's murder in a drive-by shooting outside a local church after attending the wedding of a family friend. This traumatic incident left Miss Meadows so emotionally scarred that she withdrew into a fantasy world in which she imagined that her mother was still alive, then began to go after and kill criminals whom she viewed as a threat to society.  The various criminals that Miss Meadows kills on-screen include a trucker who tries to abduct her at gunpoint in the opening scene, a young man who committed a mass shooting at a local diner, and the town's Catholic priest whom Miss Meadows finds sexually molesting a young boy.  When Miss Meadows learns that she is pregnant after a sexual encounter with the sheriff, she decides to accept his proposal to get married. On the day of the wedding, Skylar kidnaps Heather, one of Miss Meadows's students, from her house, forcing Miss Meadows to go to Skylar's house (wearing her wedding dress) to try to stop him, only to end up a captive herself. When she manages to free Heather and struggle with Skylar over her gun, the sheriff, passing by after leaving the church, sees Heather running from Skylar's house as she shouts for help. Meanwhile, Skylar takes Miss Meadows' gun from her purse, aims it at her and asks, "Do you really think you can save the world? Well, try saving your self first!" Just then, the sheriff arrives and fatally shoots Skylar in the head. Seeing Miss Meadows' gun still clutched in Skylar's hand, he notes "it has his prints now". He and Miss Meadows proceed back to the church.  One year later, Miss Meadows and the Sheriff are married; she still wears her tap shoes and he has taken up the [[accordion]]. Now parents to a baby daughter, they are content to be peculiar together. As Miss Meadows prepares to go out before dinner, the sheriff tells her "be careful"; she replies "I always am", leaves the house, and does one final little tap dance on the sidewalk.  
Mischief Night (2014 film)
  Kaylie (Brooke Anne Smith) is a beautiful high school senior who doesn't quite fit in. She's got a dark sense of humor, and a somewhat warped view of life that isolates her from most of her peers. Her best friend Daphne (Nikki Limo), on the other hand, is incredibly popular. It's Friday night, the night before Halloween, and Daphne has asked Kaylie to fill in and babysit for her at the Payton household. Daphne claims to be sick at home with the flu, but, unbeknownst to Kaylie, she's really headed out for a night on the town.  To help occupy her time while alone (aside from the baby) in this big house, Kaylie watches horror movies, drinks the Payton's booze, pops their pills, and starts a war with a roaming group of middle schoolers trying to vandalize the home.  There are many people out in the neighborhood. One of them, a creepy, and very kooky, old neighbor ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), knocks at the door, warning Kaylie to stay inside tonight and not answer the door for anyone. She immediately rejects his advice, answering the door for a costumed stranger who turns out to be Graham ([[Matt Angel]]), a classmate of Kaylie's who she has a crush on. Graham, it turns out, was expecting Daphne to answer the door. He's been visiting Daphne at the house whenever she babysits, which comes as both a surprise to Kaylie, and a devastating blow. Kaylie only liked two people in this world, Daphne and Graham, and now she's got nothing. When he leaves, she cuts herself, revealing a series of scars, and showing us that she is perhaps even more troubled than we knew. But there's one more person lurking the streets, and prowling the dark shadows surrounding the Payton house. It's a masked man (Marc Valera), carrying a large knife. We know nothing about him, only that he's eyeing Kaylie for the kill.  When Kaylie realizes he's out there, she begins to tease him and taunt him into confrontation. She appears to think he's just another prankster. When she is convinced he is quietly watching from behind the trees, she strips down to her underwear and swims in the Payton's pool. Things intensify quickly when Daphne shows up and is brutally murdered. The masked stranger then breaks into the house, attacking Kaylie, when she gives fights back, culminating in bashing him with a free-weight and sending him tumbling down the stairs. At that point, he takes off his mask to reveal the man underneath, and overpowers her.  It's within his power to kill her now, and instead of begging for her life, she encourages him to do it. The man, who is far less intimidating without his mask on, doesn't know how to react. He eventually decides against killing her, and sets her free. The two start talking, and soon a strange, twisted romance blossoms between them. They head into the neighborhood to cause a little mischief themselves, and gradually, over the course of the night, begin to reveal to each other what makes them tick.  Kaylie and the man make love, but when she asks him to stab her while they have sex, he becomes disturbed and goes outside to think. Meanwhile, the middle school vandals return to seek revenge on Kaylie and are brutally murdered outside the house.  Kaylie and the man have a final conversation in which the man explains that he has a family he must go home to and that he doesn’t have the strength to go through with killing anyone, as he had previously thought. They say goodbye and Kaylie slices the man’s throat with a carving knife, revealing that she has been the killer all along, responsible for Daphne and the middle schooler’s deaths. She explains that she was always unstable and that finding out about Daphne and Graham’s affair caused her to snap.  Later, the police investigate the crime scene and we learn that Kaylie has pinned all the murders on the masked man. Graham shows up, concerned for her well-being, and the two hug as Kaylie winks at the camera.<ref name=bloody></ref><ref></ref>

 Allyson Field is a young mother who is having a most unhappy Mother's Day. At first glance, she seems to have a life that many would envy. She is happily married to her loving husband Sean and they have three lively, adorable children. However, as Allyson types on her "mommy blog", she is beset with anxiety and feelings of unworthiness.

The Monkey King (film)
  The film is based on selected chapters of [[Wu Cheng'en]]'s classical novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'', and tells the story of how [[Sun Wukong]] rebels against the [[Jade Emperor]] of Heaven.<ref></ref>  The film opens with the [[List of Journey to the West characters#Bull Demon King.2C Princess Iron Fan and associates|Bull Demon King]] ([[Aaron Kwok]]) waging war on Heaven.  Much of Heaven is destroyed during the battle, and the Bull Demon King faces off against the [[Jade Emperor]] ([[Chow Yun-fat]]), the ruler of Heaven.  The Bull Demon King is defeated but before the Jade Emperor can kill the Bull Demon King, his sister and Bull Demon King's lover [[Princess Iron Fan]] ([[Joe Chen]]) intervenes.  She begs her brother to spare his life, saying that deities and demons can coexist peacefully.  The Jade Emperor agrees to spare the Bull Demon King for the sake of his sister but he feels the Demon King must still be punished for his actions, and banishes him, Princess Iron Fan, and the rest of the demons to Flaming Mountain.  Distraught over the destruction of Heaven, the goddess [[Nüwa]] ([[Zhang Zilin]]) sacrifices her body, turning it into magic crystals which rebuild Heaven as well as re-enforce the entrance into Heaven— the Southern Gate— so that it would destroy any demon who tries to pass through it.  In the aftermath of the battle, the Jade Emperor appoints his nephew [[Erlang Shen]] ([[Peter Ho]]) to guard the Southern Gate.  Erlang Shen finds the task beneath him and an insult to his abilities and resents his uncle for being given the duty.  One of Nüwa's crystals falls to Earth, landing on [[Mount Huaguo]].  Over time, life forms in the crystal, taking the shape of a monkey.  A nine-tailed fox approaches the crystal, and befriends the monkey inside.  The fox attempts to touch the crystal, only to have its paw burned before a mysterious force whisks it away.  Several years later, the monkey has grown up ([[Donnie Yen]]) to be very mischievous and playful.  One day, he is approached by a man named [[Subhuti]].  Earlier, Subhuti had been tasked by the [[Guanyin|Guan Yin]] ([[Kelly Chen]]) the Goddess of Mercy to train the monkey.  The monkey agrees to be trained by Subhuti, who takes him in and names him [[Sun Wukong]].  Wukong learns several mystic abilities such as being able to shape-shift himself, others, and even objects.  Subhuti tells Wukong his training is complete, and there is nothing else to teach him.  Wukong thanks his master before returning to Mount Huaguo.  Meanwhile, the Bull Demon King is planning to wage war on Heaven once again.  Having witnessed Nüwa's crystal fall to earth years before, he realizes the monkey is the one who can destroy the Southern Gate, which would allow him back into Heaven.  He also preys on Erlang Shen's anger and resentment towards the Jade Emperor.  Erlang Shen agrees to help the Bull Demon King in exchange for getting to kill his uncle and take the throne of Heaven.  All the while, the Bull Demon King keeps his plans secret from Princess Iron Fan, who is now pregnant with his child.  Wukong returns to Mount Huaguo to much fanfare from the monkeys.  During their celebrating, he is dubbed "the Handsome Monkey King," a title he relishes.  In awe of his new abilities, some of the monkeys are worried no one can protect them should Wukong leave again.  Wukong agrees with this and quickly leaves to bring the monkeys of Mount Huaguo weapons.  His journey takes him to the bottom of the Eastern Sea and the palace of the [[Ao Guang|Dragon King]].  At first, the Dragon King pretends to comply with Wukong's request but tries to have Wukong executed instead.  However, Wukong easily defeats everything the Dragon King throws at him.  Finally, annoyed by Wukong and frightened of his power, the Dragon King quickly agrees to give him what he wants.  Along with weapons for the monkeys, Wukong also steals an enchanted set of Phoenix armor for himself.  Before he departs, Wukong notices a large staff firmly planted in the sea.  The Dragon King explains that it is the [[Ruyi Jingu Bang|Ruyi Cudgel]] and that the sea was once harsh, violent, and constantly storming until a god placed the staff in the sea floor, calming it. Noticing the monkey's fascination, and thinking the task impossible, the Dragon King jokingly tells Wukong that the staff is his if he can remove it.  Wukong removes the staff with ease however, which immediately throws the sea into a violent storm.  The storm unleashes a massive tidal wave which threatens to drown Flaming Mountain, but it is frozen by Princess Iron Fan.  The Bull Demon King visits a young [[Huli jing|Vixen]] and asks if she'd like to meet her old friend again.  The Vixen shape-shifts into a nine-tailed fox, revealing she was the one who visits Wukong in the crystal.  The Bull Demon King was the one who whisked her away, claiming he saved her life— the Vixen's hand is still scarred from where she touched the crystal.  Meanwhile, the Dragon King goes to Heaven, attempting to find the Jade Emperor, only to be intercepted by Erlang Shen.  The Dragon King tells him of Wukong's destruction and demands the Emperor deal with it.  Erlang Shen shrugs him off, saying a mere monkey is should be no concern to the Emperor.  Instead, he sends his subordinate [[Nezha]] to arrest Wukong.  The Vixen arrives at Mount Huaguo where she is greeted by her friend.  Excited, Wukong spends the entire day showing her around the island. She introduce that her real name is Ruxue. As they wait to watch the sunrise that night, Wukong and Ruxue discuss their lifespans. Ruxue says that when she turns 200 years old, she will die.  Wukong vows he'll find a way to make her immortal.  As the sun rises, the pair is attacked by Nezha attempting to arrest Wukong.  During their fight, the Bull Demon King arrives and kills Nezha. Wukong expresses his gratitude to the Bull Demon King, accepting him as a friend.  The Bull Demon King appeals to Wukong's ego, calling him "the Great Sage Equal to Heaven," another title Wukong relishes.  He goes on to tell Wukong that a being of his power belongs in Heaven.  He continues to tempt Wukong by explaining all Heaven has to offer, including a way to make people immortal.  Recalling the promise he made to Ruxue, Wukong decides to go to Heaven and learn the secret to immortality for Ruxue and his other friends- not wanting any of them to die.  The Bull Demon King meets Erlang Shen to explain his plan.  Erlang Shen tells him that Wukong is in no way strong enough to destroy the gate.  The Bull Demon King explains that if Wukong can consume the Jade Emperor's elixir, it will increase his power a hundredfold.  In Heaven, Erlang Shen uses Nezha's murder to convince the Jade Emperor that Wukong is a demon and must be killed.  Subhuti arrives and intervenes, explaining Wukong is his former student and that's he's not evil, just misguided.  The Jade Emperor agrees to welcome Wukong into Heaven.  Wukong arrives at the Southern Gate, where Erlang Shen taunts him, calling him a demon, but Wukong passes through the gate unscathed.  While exploring through Heaven, Wukong meets the Jade Emperor caring for one of his dragon steeds.  Wukong helps the steed, impressing the Emperor.  While everyone is shocked by Wukong's lack of manners, the Jade Emperor is amused by his antics, welcoming the monkey into Heaven.  Wukong explains he wishes to learn the secret of immortality.  The Jade Emperor tells him that to learn such a secret will take a long time, but Wukong remains undeterred.  The Jade Emperor gives Wukong a position caring for the stables where his dragon steeds reside.  At first, Wukong is excited by the prospect, but he quickly grows bored when he finds the tight schedule the dragon steeds are kept on to be far too restricting.  Erlang Shen shows up and taunts Wukong by whipping the dragon steeds, telling Wukong that animals should know their place.  A brief scuffle erupts between the two before Wukong releases the dragons.  Erlang Shen chases Wukong through Heaven.  Wukong temporarily loses him in the Emperor's peach grove.  Enticed, Wukong begins to eat the peaches, only to be scolded by the maidens tending them, as consuming the peaches is forbidden.  The maidens surround Wukong, continuing to yell at and scold him until Wukong uses his powers to freeze them in time and flee.  Having witnessed the entire scene, Erlang Shen unfreezes the maidens and convinces one to paint Wukong in an extremely negative light, by claiming the monkey assaulted her.  The Jade Emperor intervenes, but Erlang Shen quickly realizes it's Wukong in disguise before he vanishes again.  In Flaming Mountain, the Bull Demon King is making the final preparations for his war on Heaven.  Princess Iron Fan walks in on him and realizes he had no intention of ever keeping the promise she made her brother.  He tries to console her, telling her he wants to get her to Heaven once more.  When that doesn't work, he angrily tells her that he's destined to wage war on Heaven like his ancestors before him.  Unable to change her husband's mind, Iron Fan watches heartbroken as the Bull Demon King goes through with his plan.  In Heaven, Wukong comes across a large kiln.  A maiden explains that that's where the Jade Emperor's elixir is made there.  The maiden then leaves, warning Wukong that just being seen there will get him into trouble.  Unknown to Wukong, the maiden was actually Erlang Shen trying to tempt Wukong as part of the Bull Demon King's plan.  Curious, Wukong approaches the kiln, only to be tied down and restrained by Subhuti.  Subhuti tries to convince Wukong to leave this place before he gets into any more trouble.  But it's too late; Erlang Shen arrives.  Wukong realizes that Erlang Shen had set him up.  As he beats and tortures Wukong, Erland Shen taunts him, challenging him to take the Elixir, but Subhuti tries to dissuade him, saying the flames of the kiln would kill him before he could try.  Wukong jumps into the kiln anyway.  Wukong travels through the flames to the core of the kiln and consumes the elixir.  Now more powerful, Wukong bursts through the kiln and fights Erlang Shen once more.  The fight is stopped as Erlang Shen flees.  Wukong quickly regains his senses and sees all the damage he's done.  Ashamed, he leaves Heaven.  Subhuti attempts to go after him but is stopped by the Jade Emperor.  Wukong returns to find Mount Huaguo in ashes and all his friends dead.  He finds Ruxue's body with a strange, shadowy substance around her neck.  The Bull Demon King arrives and tells him that Heaven's soldiers slaughtered everyone.  Wukong flies off in a rage and heads for Heaven once more.  A flashback reveals that the heavenly soldiers were actually demons in disguise.  The Bull Demon King explained to Ruxue that it would be Wukong's love for her that will lead to Heaven's destruction before killing her.  The Jade Emperor readies his armies for battle as Wukong arrives at the Southern Gate and destroys it as he enters Heaven once more.  He engages the heavenly army, pulling out his hairs and transforming them into copies of himself.  He takes out the heavenly army and faces the Jade Emperor.  Seeing how enraged he is, the Emperor tries to talk sense into Wukong, who refuses to see reason.  The Bull Demon King arrives in Heaven behind Wukong and begins laying waste to it.  Suhuti attempts to fight him, only to be killed.  As he watches his master die, Wukong notices the Bull Demon King conjure the same shadowy substance that was around  Ruxue's neck and realizes he was the one that killed his friends.  With newfound fury, Wukong attempts to fight the Bull Demon King, only to be knocked out.  He has a vision where he's approached by the goddess Guan Yin and he realizes his mistakes.  While Wukong is unconscious, the Bull Demon King fights the Jade Emperor once more.  This time, the Bull Demon King savagely beats the Emperor, knocking him unconscious as well.  Erlang Shen suddenly shows up to land the killing the blow on his uncle, but the Bull Demon King brushes him aside.  As he watches the Bull Demon King sit on the throne of Heaven, Erlang Shen realizes the demon was never going to keep his promise.  He attempts to fight the Bull Demon King as well only to be killed.  The Jade Emperor is saved once again, this time by Wukong who has regained his senses.  Wukong and the Bull Demon King engage in a fierce battle which destroys much of Heaven.  In a last ditch effort to kill the monkey, the Bull Demon King transforms into a giant, bull-like monster.  Wukong counters this by using his newfound powers to turn into a giant, golden monkey.  Wukong rips one of the Bull Demon King's horns off and throws him from Heaven, sending him crashing to earth.  Some time later, Princess Iron Fan gives birth to hers and Bull Demon King's son, [[Red Boy]].  They find the Bull Demon King who, having lost all his power, has been turned into a regular bull.  Iron Fan explains that this is the fate of evil men.  But despite this, they're still going to care for the bull because he's family and they love him.  Back in Heaven, the Jade Emperor and Wukong observe the damage done to Heaven.  Without Nüwa, the Emperor says that the repairs will take much longer.  Wukong decides to help the Emperor rebuild Heaven, but he is stopped by Buddha.  While Buddha agrees that Wukong must atone for his sins, but rebuilding Heaven is not his responsibility.  Buddha tells Wukong that his chance to atone will come 500 years into the future.  Until that time, Buddha will turn his hand into a mountain, and Wukong will remain there asleep.  Wukong agrees to this and is sealed into the mountain by Buddha. A short scene shows a white fox chasing a butterfly in a forest clearing.  The film ends 500 years later, with [[Tang Sanzang]] approaching the mountain before cutting to black, setting up for [[The Monkey King 2|the sequel]], which was released in 2016  
Monsters: Dark Continent
 Ten years after the events of the [[Monsters (2010 film)|previous film]], four closely knit friends from [[Detroit]]—Michael, Frankie, Inkelaar and new father Williams—are [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] soldiers deployed to the Middle East for their first tour as they must deal with the monsters and a new insurgency on the rise. They meet their team leaders, Forrest and Frater. Frater, who has already gone through nine tours, has become estranged from his wife and daughter, who he says is afraid of him. On their first mission, they investigate a farm house and interrogate the owner. During the encounter, one of the gigantic monsters approaches the group and they are forced to gun it down. Three months into their tour, the team receives a [[search and rescue]] mission for four soldiers who have gone missing along a particularly active area.  During a drive, the team's convoy hits a hidden [[improvised explosive device|IED]] which disables both vehicles, killing Forrest and two of their team. Williams, disoriented by the explosion, wanders onto another IED, which detonates, blowing his legs off. The group is then set under fire by insurgents.

After the bikes run out of gas, they continue eastward until they encounter a destroyed school bus. As Frater searches for water, Michael encounters a boy still alive. They briefly debate [[Euthanasia|euthanising]] him until they are rescued by locals, who feed them and give them water in gratitude for saving the boy's life. Michael wanders off with one of the women, and they witness one of the monsters spreading luminescent spores through the night time desert around them, while Frater visits the boy who succumbs to his injuries. Frustrated at their failure to save the boy, Frater angrily reminds Michael of their mission, and the two continue east toward a settlement their men would have gone to. However, they discover there that the soldiers they were meant to rescue had all been killed prior to their arrival. Now enraged by the futility of their mission and the lives lost, Frater snaps and kills one of the villagers. Michael is forced to shoot him to keep him from killing the rest of the family.

Monarch (film)
 ''Monarch''  is part fact, part fiction and unfolds around one night in the life of a hated king susceptible to assassination, and paranoid with the thought of his own mortality. The film is set in just one night when the injured Henry VIII arrives at a manor house closed for the season. Henry is without the power of his throne. He is vulnerable to those around him and to his own mental issues. He had left England financially and morally bankrupt; his collection of enemies became his only constant. In an interview John Walsh said “Often you can find out more about someone in a small time frame rather than you can if the two-hour film spans their whole life. Most bio-pics become little more than a montage of facts. If you confine a character to that time frame you can find out more about them.”<ref>http://irishpost.co.uk/london-irish-director-reveals-archive-henry-viii-film-tapes-almost-lost/#comment-364005</ref>

In July 1944, Claire Simone, a curator in occupied France, is forced to assist Nazi officer Viktor Stahl in overseeing the theft of art for either [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Führermuseum]] or as personal property of senior commanders such as [[Hermann Göring]]. All seems lost when she discovers that Stahl is taking all of her gallery's contents to Germany as the Allies approach Paris. Simone runs to the railyard to confront him, but can only watch as he departs aboard the train carrying the cargo.  Stokes' unit finds its work frustrated by Allied officers in the field, who refuse to endanger their own troops for the sake of his mission. James Granger finds that Simone will not cooperate with those whom she suspects want to confiscate the stolen art for their own country. The unit splits up to cover more ground, with varying degrees of success. British officer Donald Jeffries sneaks into occupied Bruges at night to save [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Madonna of Bruges]]'', but is killed in the attempt.  Richard Campbell and Preston Savitz learn that [[Van Eyck]]'s ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' was removed by the priests of [[Ghent Cathedral]] for safekeeping, but their truck was stopped and the panels taken. Eventually, they find and arrest Viktor Stahl, who is hiding as a farmer, when they identify the paintings in his house as masterpieces, at least one stolen from the [[Palais Rothschild#The Rothschild Collections|Rothschild Collection]].  In December 1944, Walter Garfield and Jean Claude Clermont get lost in the countryside and blunder into a firefight. Clermont is mortally wounded and dies when Garfield is unable to find medical help. Meanwhile, Simone reconsiders when Granger shows her the [[Nero Decree]], which orders the destruction of all German possessions if Hitler dies or Germany falls, and sees him return a painting looted from a Jewish family to its rightful place in their empty home. She provides a comprehensive ledger she has compiled that provides valuable information on the stolen art and the rightful owners.  Even as the team learns that the artwork is being stored in various mines and castles, it also learns that it must now compete against the [[Soviet Union]], which is seizing artwork as [[war reparations]]. Meanwhile, Colonel Wegner is systematically destroying whole art caches. Eventually, the team has some success, as it discovers at least one mine hiding over 16,000 art pieces. In addition, the team captures the entire gold reserves of the Nazi German national treasury.  Finally, the team finds a [[Altaussee#Nazi Stolen Art Repository|mine in Austria]] that appears to have been demolished. However, they discover that the entrances were blocked by the locals to prevent the Nazis from destroying the contents. The team evacuates as much artwork as possible, including the sculpture Jeffries died trying to defend, before the Soviets arrive.  As the war comes to an end in May 1945, Stokes reports back to [[President Truman]] that the team has recovered vast quantities of artwork and various other culturally significant items. As he requests to stay in Europe to oversee further searching and restoration, Truman asks Stokes if his efforts were worth the lives of the men he lost. Stokes says they were. Truman then asks if, thirty years from then, anyone will remember that these men died for a piece of art. In the final scene, set in 1977, the elderly Stokes replies "Yeah," while he takes his grandson to see [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Madonna of Bruges|Madonna]]''.

A Most Wanted Man (film)
 Issa Karpov, a political refugee from [[Chechnya]] who has been tortured by Russian security forces, enters [[Hamburg]], Germany, illegally.  Günther Bachmann leads a covert German government team that seeks to recruit local informants with ties to [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorist]] organizations. The disheveled Günther's polar opposite is his efficient right-hand associate, Irna Frey. The team learns of Karpov's presence and his suspected links to Chechen terrorists.  Bachmann's team is also tracking the activities of a local, respected, Muslim philanthropist, Dr. Abdullah, who the team suspects is funneling a small portion of his legitimate funds to Al Qaeda, though the team is unable to prove this. High-ranking German security official Mohr and American diplomatic attaché Sullivan both learn of these investigations and take an interest.  Bachmann is interested in watching suspects and "turning" informants higher and higher up the chain, while protecting the naïve who are caught up in the nefarious affairs of others. Mohr and Sullivan appear single-minded, and interested in merely capturing suspects, regardless of guilt or future usefulness. Bachmann has been disgraced in the past for an apparently serious failure, and shows signs of self-neglect, but is a sophisticated operative who understands Islamic terrorism, and distrusts politicians and the Americans.  Karpov contacts an immigration lawyer, Annabel Richter, who helps put him in contact with Tommy Brue, a wealthy banker whose father had long ago [[money laundering|laundered money]] for Karpov's father, of the Russian mafia. Karpov is the legal heir to a multimillion-dollar account long held by this bank, but Karpov identifies with his maternal Chechen, Muslim heritage and decides he no longer wants his father's dirty money.  Bachmann's team is able to [[Asset (intelligence)|turn]] Brue and Richter to their cause, using threats and seduction. Richter convinces Karpov to donate the funds to Abdullah's organization, in the hope that Abdullah will reroute some of the funds to a shipping company acting as a front for al-Qaeda. Bachmann plans to use this proof of guilt to turn Abdullah as well and ensnare those higher up in the terrorist organization. The plan is approved by the interior minister, along with the American who has become an apparent ally of Bachmann. Bachmann secures asylum for the innocent Karpov.  Abdullah does indeed route funds to the shipping company. Bachmann, posing as a taxi driver, picks up Abdullah with the goal of turning him into an informant without disrupting his life or family. As Bachmann drives away, he is ambushed by forces reporting to Mohr and Sullivan, who whisk away Abdullah and Karpov. Bachmann screams as Frey, Richter, and Brue look on in shock. Bachmann drives off, defeated.  
A Most Violent Year
 In 1981 New York, Abel Morales (Oscar Isaac) is the owner of an up-and-coming company which has suffered the hijacking of several trucks, each carrying heating-oil worth thousands of dollars. One driver, Julian ([[Elyes Gabel]]), is severely beaten when his oil truck is hijacked by two unknown assailants. Abel's wife, Anna Morales (Jessica Chastain), beseeches Abel to fight violence with violence, but Abel refuses. Morales and his company are under investigation by Assistant District Attorney Lawrence ([[David Oyelowo]]), who seems determined to expose price fixing, tax evasion, and various other illegalities committed by Morales and his competitors in the heating oil business.  As a way to secure financial independence for himself and trump his competitors, Abel, with the help of his attorney, Andrew Walsh ([[Albert Brooks]]), brokers a deal with a group of Jewish [[Chassidim]], led by Josef Mendellsohn ([[Jerry Adler]]), to purchase a fuel oil terminal on the East River. This will allow Morales' company to directly import fuel oil from barges and to store far more oil in the summertime when fuel oil prices are lower. He places a large [[down payment]] of 40% on the property with the agreement that he will close in 30 days—if he fails to do so, the Chassidim will sell the terminal to one of Morales' competitors and keep the down payment.  After moving into a new home, Morales prevents what appears to be an attempted burglary, but the next day one of his daughters finds a loaded handgun dropped in the bushes by the perpetrator. Suspecting this intimidation is coming from his competitors, he begins to confront them one by one; each one denies any intimidation and theft to drive him out of business. The head of the [[Teamsters]] encourages Morales to arm his drivers with handguns and fake permits that he can secure for him. Morales refuses, believing that such a move could bring down even more heat on his operation from the authorities and potentially ruin his legitimate business connections with a bank financing his business.  Returning to work after weeks of rehabilitation, Julian is again accosted by criminals, this time on the [[Queensboro Bridge]] in broad daylight. Carrying a firearm without Abel's knowledge or permission, he engages in a shootout with the hijackers, which results in the police arriving and chasing Julian and the other assailants, who all escape. This incident once again shifts Morales and his company into the spotlight of not only ADA Lawrence, but also the bank, which informs him that due to the impending criminal indictments and this unfortunate public incident, it can no longer finance his purchase of the terminal.  Desperate, and needing $1.5 million to close on the property, he approaches his competition, Saul Leftkowitz and his granddaughter, who agree to give him a $500,000 loan for 20% interest and equity in the company for the term of the agreement. He manages to scrounge up another $200,000 by taking out a mortgage loan against an apartment building that he and his younger brother own together. With time winding down quickly, he intercepts a radio call for help from one of his drivers, who states his truck is being hijacked. Being nearby, he pursues the stolen truck. Eventually catching up to and attacking one of the hijackers, Morales demands to know who the mastermind is.  The hijacker denies he was hired by anyone but reveals that he sold his last stolen shipment in [[Far Rockaway, Queens|Far Rockaway]]. Morales confronts one of his competitors, who has facilities in Far Rockaway, threatening to alert the federal authorities as the stolen fuel is marked. The competitor agrees to pay Morales more than $200,000 for stolen fuel oil.  As Morales is getting closer to his $1.5 million goal, he visits [[Italian-American Mafia|mafia]]-affiliated Peter Forente (Alessandro Nivola) to ask for another $600,000. Forente agrees to give Morales the loan, but on very unfavorable terms. Dismayed by having to leverage his company to such a high degree in order to secure the loan, Morales begins to inform his wife, only to learn she has been "skimming" from the company for years and has been hiding the money, which is sufficient to cover the amount of money that Forente had agreed to lend, in a secret account.  Having the money he now needs, Morales and Walsh pay off his creditors and secure the terminal. As Abel, Anna, and Walsh are looking over the property, they are approached by an angry Julian carrying a gun, who blames Morales for his problems, believing that he should also be entitled to some of Morales' good fortune. Despondent by his being a wanted man, Julian commits suicide in front of Abel, Anna, and Walsh. As the police show up with ADA Lawrence to investigate the suicide, Morales expresses that the broader investigations into his firm are hurting his business, and that they should find a conclusion at some point. Lawrence agrees in general terms and suggests that this new fuel oil terminal will propel Morales' business and give him "political influence." Lawrence then suggests that Morales might be able to help him with his higher aspirations. Morales claims that he has always done "the most right thing".

Mr. Peabody & Sherman
 Mr. Peabody is a gifted [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog who has an [[adopted]] 7-year-old young human son, Sherman. He tutors Sherman travelling throughout history using the [[WABAC machine|WABAC]], a [[Time travel|time machine]]. They visit [[Marie Antoinette]] in [[Versailles]] during the [[French Revolution]] in 1789. Getting caught in the [[Reign of Terror]], Peabody is nearly sent to the [[guillotine]] by [[Maximilien Robespierre]], but escapes with Sherman through the [[Paris sewers]].  In the [[present day]], Sherman attends the [[Susan B. Anthony]] School in [[New York City]] on his first day of school. His knowledge of the apocryphal nature of the [[George Washington]] [[Parson Weems#The cherry-tree anecdote|cherry-tree anecdote]] leads to a fight with Penny Peterson in the cafeteria where she puts him in a [[choke hold]]. Peabody is called in by Principal Purdy who tells Peabody that Sherman had bit Penny. He is also confronted during this meeting by Ms. Grunion, a [[Child Protective Services]] agent, who implies that Sherman's behavior is due to being raised by a dog. She informs Peabody that she will come to their home to investigate whether he is an unfit parent.  Peabody invites Penny and her parents over for a dinner party to reconcile before Ms. Grunion arrives. Penny calls Sherman a liar for claiming first-hand knowledge of history. Despite Peabody's contrary instructions, Sherman shows Penny the WABAC. Penny goads Sherman into taking her into the past, where she stays in [[Ancient Egypt]] in 1332 BCE to marry [[Tutankhamun|King Tut]]. Sherman returns to get Mr. Peabody's help. Peabody [[hypnosis|hypnotises]] the Petersons, and retrieves Penny by telling her [[Ancient Egyptian retainer sacrifices|the fate of a pharaoh's widow]].  The WABAC runs out of power, but Peabody is able to get them to [[Renaissance Florence]] in 1508 where they meet [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Penny and Sherman explore da Vinci's attic, finding his [[ornithopter|flying machine]]. Penny goads Sherman into flying it, which he manages to do before crashing. Da Vinci is thrilled the device works, but Peabody is upset that Sherman risked his safety and destroyed a historical artifact.  They again attempt to return, but a [[black hole]] forces them into an emergency landing during the [[Trojan War]] in 1184 BCE. Upset about learning what Ms. Grunion would do to him, Sherman runs off and joins the army of King [[Agamemnon]] in the [[Trojan Horse]]. During the final parts of the Trojan War, Penny is trapped inside the Horse as it rolls towards a cliff. Peabody rescues her, but apparently dies during the attempt.  Sherman pilots the WABAC to a few minutes before they left in the present to get Mr. Peabody's help to fix everything. As Sherman and Penny try to explain the situation, Sherman's earlier self shows up. Peabody tries to conceal the presence of two Shermans from the Petersons, then Grunion arrives. Then a second Peabody arrives from Ancient Troy. Grunion's attempt to collect both Shermans causes them to touch and begin to merge. Both Peabodys rush to assist, but they each merge back together amidst a cosmic shockwave. Grunion grabs Sherman to take him away, hurting him in the process. Peabody furiously bites Grunion, who then calls the [[New York Police Department|NYPD]]. Peabody, Penny, and Sherman race to the WABAC, but cannot time travel due to a rip in the [[Spacetime|space-time continuum]] caused by the merger of their cosmic doubles. Historical figures and objects from the past begin falling from the cosmic rip and into the present.  Mr. Peabody crash-lands the WABAC in [[Grand Army Plaza (Manhattan)|Grand Army Plaza]] at [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s statue's base. Historical figures and police officers quickly surround them. Grunion calls in [[animal control officer|Animal Control]] to collect Peabody. Sherman explains that everything was his fault, but Grunion contends that it is all because a dog cannot raise a boy. Sherman climactically shouts down Grunion, saying that if being a dog means being as loving and loyal as Peabody is, then he is proud to be a dog too. Penny, her parents, the historical figures, and others all make the same pledge. [[George Washington]] is able to grant Peabody a presidential pardon which is supported by [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Bill Clinton]].  As Peabody, Leonardo da Vinci, [[Albert Einstein]], [[Isaac Newton]], and Agamemnon try to figure out how to close the rip, Sherman suggests they travel into the future. Peabody and Sherman take off in the WABAC and undo the damage. The historical figures are dragged back to their respective times, with Agamemnon abducting Grunion back to his own time as she vows revenge on Peabody.  Sherman returns to school having made great friends with Penny. History, meanwhile, is contaminated with modern traits, while Grunion and Agamemnon get married in the Trojan Horse.  
Mukunda
 
Mr. Fraud
  The film begins with a flashback where two brothers Ravindra Varma ([[V. K. Sreeraman]]) and Mahendra Varma ([[Kalasala Babu]]) fighting for the royal family treasure along with their sons. During the fight, a prism from the idol of the goddess explodes. The brothers get frightened and immediately stop the fight. After conducting certain rituals, they find that the goddess is angry because of the bloodshed that happened and it is decided that the treasure will be locked for 41 years.  Present - a con man called Bhai Ji ([[Mohanlal]]) disguises as John Cliff and successfully loots 10cr from a wedding along with his assistants Abbas ([[Vijay Babu]]) and Priya ([[Manjari Phadnis]]). At that time, his acquaintance Javed introduces him to Nikhil Adharva aka Nikki([[Dev Gill]]) who tells Bhai Ji about the royal treasure and the story behind it. He shows him the list of royal family members who are inheriting the treasure. They are Ravindra Varma's sons Vasudeva Varma ([[P. Balachandran]]) and Sri Krishna Varma ([[Devan (actor)|Devan]]) and Mahendra Varma's sons Shekhara Varma ([[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]]) who is the royal head and Rajashekhara Varma ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]). Nikki tells that Rajashekhara Varma has moved to the court stating that the treasure should be given back to the government and used for helping the public rather than dividing among themselves. The case is pending in the court and this will be the right chance to steal it. Bhai Ji demands 500cr for doing the job and an advance of 250cr before doing it.  Meanwhile, the family makes tight security arrangements as they fear a heist and the police also sends Intelligence Officer Sajan([[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Sai Kumar]]). They appoint a private consultant named Sivaram from Jaipur to assess the value of the treasure but before he reaches there Bhai Ji kidnaps him and takes his place.  Rajashekara Varma takes Bhai Ji to the royal palace where he meets the other family members. Later, the cellar is opened and Bhai Ji begins assessing the value of the treasure. He realizes that this is the riskiest mission he has ever attempted. Meanwhile, Rajashekhara Varma is attacked by some goons and before they could kill him, Bhai Ji arrives, fights with the goons and saves him. Rajashekhara Varma thanks, Bhai Ji for saving his life but Sajan and Saraswathy have suspicions. Soon Nikki and Javed arrive along with the real Sivaram and meet Bhai Ji. He gives them video clippings of the treasures he shot and tells Nikki to make a replica of it. Nikki agrees and leaves. Meanwhile, Rajashekar has become friends with Bhai Ji and tells about Sarawathy and shows him the school run by her which is still under construction.  Bhai Ji and his assistants decide to find out a way to take the treasure from the cellar. He guesses that there should be a secret path behind the cellar that would lead to another exit after studying the architecture of several other palaces. In the night, the three of them go out to find the door. Bhai Ji enters the cellar and using a metal detector finds the passage and the exit point. Before leaving out of the cellar, he talks to the idol and tells that now there is a secret between them which is also known to someone else. Sajan accidentally tells the other family members regarding Saraswathy's past which only he and Rajashekara Varma knew. Saraswathy was raped by unknown people when she was only 12 years and Rajashekhara Varma had adopted her after that incident. He even instructed Sajan who was trying to find the culprits to close the case. Rajashekhara Varma's daughters and their husbands threaten him to withdraw the case he had filed or else they would file another case to re-investigate the issue.  An infuriated Rajashekhara Varma starts to hit Sajan and Bhai Ji intervenes. Sajan narrates the incident to Bhai Ji. Nearly 15 years back he was chasing a thief who had robbed a bank and on the way he encountered an unconscious Saraswathy. He takes her to the hospital and informs Rajashekhara Varma who was the local MLA. Though they try to find the culprits they don't succeed. So Rajashekhara Varma tells Sajan not to charge any case as it would affect her future and Rajashekhara Varma adopts her. Sajan also tells Bhai Ji that though he had a suspicion on him he is now convinced that Bhai Ji is innocent and that he has found out the people who were behind the attack on Rajashekhara Varma and that he was planning to meet them at night when a party will be conducted at the palace. Bhai Ji tells that it is dangerous for Sajan to go alone and he would accompany him, but Sajan refuses Bhai Ji's help. Saraswathy comes to the palace along with Rajashekhara Varma and tells the family members that they can do whatever they want, but her father wouldn't withdraw the case. Shekara Varma comes in defense of Saraswathi and promises her that no one will harm her. Bhai Ji is disturbed and when asked by Abbas and Priya he tells them that he was the thief that Sajan was chasing and on the way he saw three people chasing Saraswathy. He extended his hand to help her while he was driving, but she missed it. He became confused whether to stop and save the girl or run away as the police were right behind him. He decided to move away from there to avoid getting caught.  He tells them that from that day the incident used to haunt him and he was shocked to see the girl again. That night after the party, Nikki and gang arrive with the duplicate treasure and they begin the heist. Bhai Ji enters the cellar through the secret tunnel and Nikki places a GPS inside the boxes to make sure that Bhai Ji doesn't cheat them. After taking the treasure out, Nikki informs Bhai Ji that the final transaction will be in Jaipur and Abbas can come with them so that Bhai Ji can trust them. The next day Bhai Ji submits his evaluation report and before he leaves Police arrive there and informs them that Sajan has been murdered and arrest Rajashekhara Varma as he is the main suspect. Bhai Ji leaves for Jaipur. There, Javed and Nikki tells him that they are not going to pay him anything and he should return the 250cr back, if he wants Abbas back. Bhai Ji tells them that a few more people have to come there and tells them that he has brought the third party (unknown entity) that teamed up with Nikki and hired him for the heist. The unknown entity happens to be Shekhara Varma and his son Sudhakara Varma who was captured by Bhai Ji's man Bittoo ([[Stunt Silva]]) when they came to Jaipur for the final transaction. Bhai Ji tells Shekhara Varma that he knows well about him and he is not a simple person like others think but a cruel and wicked person. He tells him that it was the goddess which told him the truth. When Bhai Ji was searching for the door to a secret tunnel inside the cellar he finds an old bullet stuck on the walls and he realized how the prism broke. During the fight, when Vasudeva Varma was going to strike Shekara Varma with a sword, he secretly had a gun with which he shot at the prism.  Mahendra Varma found out about his son's evilness and lied to others about the goddess' wrath and locked the cellar as a punishment for Shekhara Varma. Though he was happy with getting one-fourth of the treasure he was upset when his brother Rajashekhara Varma filed a case and this prompted him to join with Nikki and plan a heist. Even he was the one who planned to kill Rajashekhara Varma so that if he dies Vasudeva Varma and Sri Krishna Varma would become the suspects and they will begin to distrust each other while Shekhara Varma can move forward with the case and extend the time for a heist. Bhai Ji knows that it was Sudhakara Varma who killed Sajan and Abbas had secretly shot the murder in his phone upon Bhai Ji's instruction and the visuals have been sent to the Police. A fight starts and after some time Abbas has Nikki at his gunpoint after Bhai Ji defeats him. Javed begs for mercy and Bhai Ji tells him to take the van having the treasure to a place along with Sudhakara Varma and Sivaram. After they leave he tells Nikki and Shekhara Varma that Abbas had planted a bomb in the Van and presses the button triggering a blast which kills the three of them and he shoots Nikki and kills him. Bhai leaves a gun back telling Shekara Varma that it was destiny that brought him there for the job and he had never stolen the treasure. Instead, he exchanged the treasure between the boxes along with the boxes and that he got 250cr for doing nothing. He also leaves telling that Shekhara Varma can choose his punishment.  Shekara Varma commits suicide by shooting himself. Two years later, the construction of Saraswathy's school is completed and Bhai Ji visits Saraswathy and Rajashekhara Varma. They thank him for all the help he did like funding for the school, helping Rajashekhara Varma to win the case and also saving him from Sajan murder case. Bhai Ji confesses to Sarawathy that he was the man who had offered his hand to save her, but couldn't do it and he tells them that this is his only confession. When Saraswathy asks him his real name, he tells her that she can call him Mr. Fraud.

 Agnes Brown ([[Brendan O'Carroll]]) is an independent market trader, selling fruit and vegetables on [[Dublin]]'s [[Moore Street|Moore Street market]]. It has been under attack from P.R. Irwin ([[Dermot Crowley]]), a TD (PRIC) who is in an arrangement with a ruthless Russian businessman who wants to put all the market stalls out of business and open a shopping centre on the site. Her stall is the next to be targeted, being sent a bill for unpaid tax left by her grandmother, and a man (working for Irwin) appears offering to buy her stall and make the bill disappear. Agnes nearly accepts, but Winnie (Eilish O'Carroll) reveals this news to the locals, forcing Agnes into defending her stall from the developers while they look for ideas on how to raise the money. Agnes' friend Philomena Nine Warts informs her that her grandmother, Mary Moccasin, was next to Agnes' grandmother at the tax office when she paid the bill and therefore no money is owed. Unfortunately Philomena's grandmother is hit by a bus on the way to the courtroom before she can testify.  Agnes' court case attracts a lot of attention from the media, portraying her as the greatest mother in Ireland. This leads her to go to confession, where she admits (unknowingly also to a Russian mobster) that she briefly put her children in care when her husband died, but continued to claim the child support money. This is used against her in the witness box during questioning by Irwin in court (Irwin being the opposing Barrister), and she runs out in shame. Eventually being found by the river by her daughter Cathy ([[Jennifer Gibney]]), she admits all in a tearful moment on the [[Ha'penny Bridge]], telling her how she told the nuns that she thought she could look after two of the six children, but when asked to pick she was unable to.  Meanwhile, Agnes' son Dermot (Paddy Houlihan) and his lifelong criminal best friend Buster Brady (Danny O'Carroll) try to get the receipt. After failing to break into the restricted area of the NRS they recruit a troop of blind trainee [[ninja]]s, led by Mr. Wang (also played by O'Carroll). The Russians have already found and destroyed the original receipt, but Buster and Dermot learn the receptionist that took the payment was blind, so that there exists a [[braille]] version of the receipt. They find it and let Agnes know, telling her [[Tourette Syndrome|Tourettes]]-suffering barrister ([[Robert Bathurst]]) to stall the case. After navigating air ducts out of the NRS, Agnes, Buster and Dermot are chased by the mobsters and the [[Garda Síochána|Garda]], jumping in the [[River Liffey]]. Agnes separates from the pair and returns with the "receipt" but it turns out Buster accidentally gave her a betting slip instead. At this point Cathy stands up and gives a speech on how special Moore Street and its market is, and her intention to run her mother's stall when her time comes, to Agnes' joy. After their pursuit continues in a Nissan Navara and finally a dash on a stolen horse, Buster and Dermot deliver the receipt to the court room just in time to have the case against Agnes dropped. They all celebrate by dancing on the steps of the courtroom.

Ray's best friend Gavin ([[Leigh Whannell]]), a small-time criminal working for local property owner/crime lord Pat Shepherd ([[John Noble]]), asks Ray to transport heroin on flight back. Ray refuses, but finds out his step-father is deeply in gambling debt, and his mother will be targeted if he does not pay up. He agrees to transport the heroin. In Thailand, while wandering through the markets, Gavin goes to pick up half a kilogram of heroin to bring back to Pat. Before he leaves, he purchases an extra half kilogram to sell on his own. At the hotel, Gavin hides the heroin in condoms, coercing Ray to swallow them. Upon their arrival at Melbourne Airport, Ray begins to panic and is eventually detained by customs officials. Believing that Ray is a drug trafficker, he is arrested by [[Australian Federal Police]] agents Croft and Paris ([[Hugo Weaving]] and [[Ewen Leslie]]). Ray's lawyer Jasmine Griffiths ([[Georgina Haig]]) tells Ray that he can only be held in a hotel room for four days.  During the four days, Ray tries to hold back his bodily functions to prevent himself from being convicted, aided by codeine, which constipates him. Gavin returns to tell Ray's mother Judy ([[Noni Hazlehurst]]) and stepfather John ([[Geoff Morrell (actor)|Geoff Morrell]]) that Ray has been arrested. They plan to head to the hotel to visit him, but John has a discussion with Gavin, revealing his participation in the drug scheme to get Pat to get rid of his debts.   Paris arrives at the hotel room to find Ray being tormented by Croft and a police guard. He kicks them out of the room and comforts Ray, giving him more codeine.   Gavin hides from Pat, but is found and beaten savagely for botching the heroin transport. Pat tells Gavin that Ray must be killed to prevent him from giving information to the police. Gavin heads to the hotel, where he persuades the guard to let him visit Ray, intending to stab Ray, but finds he cannot bring himself to do so. He is caught by Paris, who follows him to the rooftop. Paris reveals himself to be a cop out to make money from drugs, while Gavin explains the whole situation. Paris pushes Gavin from the rooftop and he hits Pat's Lithuanian guard Ziggy's car, killing him on impact. Ziggy dumps Gavin's body by the side of the road and leaves town.  Having witnessed Gavin falling off the building, Ray realizes that Paris is corrupt. He tries to tell Croft, but Croft doesn't believe it.  Croft goes to the judge and extends the sentence to ten days, despite Jasmine's pleas. She visits Ray and tells him that if he is ever released, he should testify against Croft and Paris for keeping him held against his will and their cruel behavior. She has given the information of the extended detention to a newspaper, but the newspaper is busy reporting the [[1983 America's Cup]] race.   After Pat steals his car, John drunkenly admits to Judy his part in the scheme and she kicks him out. John heads to Pat's bar, where he threatens to expose him to the police. Pat has John strangled by his Thai chef, Phuk.   In the middle of the night, Ray is unable to stop himself from defecating in his bed. After making sure the guard is asleep, Ray ingests the condoms again, gagging profusely and trying not to vomit, before the guard wakes.  Still insisting that Ray is hiding the drugs, Croft goes to the judge and finally extends the sentence to the maximum of 14 days. On the twelfth night, Ray puts his plan into action. He excretes one of the condoms and places some of the heroin in the beer of the police officer guarding him, putting him to sleep. He then excretes the rest of the condoms, and taking a coin from the police officer's wallet, starts to unscrew the back panel of the television.  Pat sings at Gavin's funeral. Judy, fearful for Ray's health, attempts to force-feed Ray his favourite meal cooked with heavy laxatives. Ray refuses to eat it and the police have to pull his mother off of him. The police eat the meal and are struck with intense diarrhea.  On the last night, the police officers are trying to watch the [[1983 America's Cup]] but the television is displaying static, so they call reception to have it repaired. On the morning of the last day, Paris furiously attempts to make Ray finally go to the toilet, but Paris discovers there are no drugs in his stomach contents. He attacks Ray, but Croft and another officer arrive before he can force Ray to swallow glass. An ambulance is called, and Ray hands Croft a photograph of Pat. A furious Paris trashes the hotel room looking for the drugs, and finds a hidden microphone in a flower vase. Paris realizes his threats and confession to Ray have been recorded, revealing his corruption, and Croft enters the room and arrests him while berating him, admitting that he bent the rules, but Paris broke them by killing Gavin. Croft has also sent police to arrest Pat, but the Thai heroin boss instructs Phuk not to permit the police to take Pat alive, and he is beaten to death as the police arrive. At the television repair shop where he works, Ray smiles as he looks at the televisions in the window where he hid the heroin.

Mune: Guardian of the Moon
  In an imaginary world, a small [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] were made by the first Guardians to warm up a small planet inhabited by different marvelous people. The Guardians follow generations after generations and preserve the harmony of the world. The people of the day and those of the night live in relative harmony, even though they are very different from each other. But in the depth of the planet, Necross awaits the opportunity to set darkness over the world.  The day is approaching when Sohone, the apprentice of Xolal, Guardian of the Sun and Leeyoon, the apprentice of Yule, Guardian of the Moon will take over from the present Guardians. On the day of their induction, the light of the Sun accepts Sohone as planned. Leeyoon however is avoided by the lunar Ewe that is responsible for choosing the Guardians. The Ewe chooses a Majestic Faun Boy named Mune instead. On the following night an upset Leeyoon is visited by pale snakes who stir up his jealousy and advise him to pit Sohone against Mune. Meanwhile, Mune has troubles maneuvering the temple of the Moon correctly: the temple leaves its path and interferes with Sohone. While Sohone leaves his temple to scold Mune, Necross sends his two imps to steal the Sun and bring it to him. Necross makes the Sun die off gradually. Night falls everywhere, and a distressed Mune is banished from his own people.   Mune and Sohone both set out on a quest to find the vanished Sun, accompanied by a young wax girl named Glim. Thanks to her knowledge in astronomy and the ancient stories of how the world came together, the group is able to pass the Great Blue Hole, a lake under which the great abyss opens that leads to the depths of the world. Mune watches over Glim since she could freeze and break in the cold water. While underwater, the group meets Phospho, one of the previous Guardians of the Moon. He wakes Glim up using his power and leads them to the entrance of the underworld, where Necross lives.   Meanwhile, Leeyoon takes Mune's place in the temple of the Moon, but he can't control it. The Moon wanes and crumbles into dust, causing the temple to go mad and start galloping everywhere. It ends up arriving in the underworld where Mune, Sohone, and Glim are. Mune, accompanied by Glim, takes care of the Moon while Sohone dives into the underworld to recover the Sun. Mune figures out that he can calm the temple of the Moon by using his magic glitter powers. Then, Leeyoon admits to him that the Moon is lost, but Mune and Glim go into the moon quarry of the world of dreams to carve a new crescent. The new moon is launched into the sky.  With this task done, Mune and Glim rejoin Sohone in the world of darkness. During this time, Sohone is surrounded by a mass of pale snakes who make fun of him and try to make him go mad with hatred. Sohone is saved by Phospho's intervention, who sacrifices himself to calm and free Sohone destroying the snake wall in the process. Sohone, Mune and Glim then confront Necross and his imps. Sohone is going strongly against Necross, who he doesn't manage to weaken. Mune finally gets rid of one of the imps. Glim finds the Sun and blows on it to revive its fire, but that causes her to melt. Mune begins to cry thinking she was gone. He then uses his Glitter powers to defeat Necross and realises that Necross is influenced by a pale snake, which he then pulls out and crushes. Necross regains his Guardian of the Sun appearance he had before getting corrupted by envy, then turns to stone.  The defeat of Necross leads to peace for the world, and the two young Guardians are able resume the normal trajectories of their temples. Mune also resculpts Glim, and the combined energy of the sun and moon at daybreak with Glim's held fragment of the moon revives her. Mune and Glim meet up and kiss each other before going around the world on the temple of the Moon.  
Muppets Most Wanted
  Following the events of [[The Muppets (film)|the previous film]], The [[The Muppets|Muppets]] find themselves at a loss as to what to do until Dominic Badguy suggests the Muppets go on a European tour with him as their tour manager. As the Muppets begin their tour, a criminal mastermind named [[Constantine (Muppet)|Constantine]], a near-exact double for [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] in appearance, escapes from a [[Gulag|Siberian Gulag]] and joins his subordinate Dominic to begin a plot to steal the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]].  Once the Muppets arrive in [[Berlin]], Germany, Dominic secures them a show at a prestigious venue. Frustrated with the group's incessant requests and [[Miss Piggy]]'s insistence they marry, Kermit goes for a walk at Dominic's suggestion. Constantine ambushes him and glues a fake mole onto his cheek then slips away. Mistaken for Constantine, Kermit is sent to the Gulag. Taking Kermit's place, Constantine's blunders in imitating him are covered by Dominic; however, [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]] knows the truth. After the Berlin performance opens with Constantine freezing at the audience, [[Scooter (Muppet)|Scooter]] has to introduce the show. Constantine and Dominic steal paintings from a museum while the Muppets perform. The next morning, [[Interpol]] agent Jean Pierre Napoleon and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent [[Sam Eagle|Sam the Eagle]] grudgingly team up to apprehend the culprit whom Napoleon believes to be his nemesis "The Lemur" - the number-two criminal in the world.  Meanwhile, Kermit has attempted several times to escape the Gulag but is thwarted each time by [[Prison officer|prison guard]] Nadya, who is not only aware of his true identity but is as infatuated with him as Miss Piggy is. Nadya orders Kermit to help organize the prisoners' annual talent show.  Following hidden instructions on the stolen painting, Constantine and Dominic divert the tour to [[Madrid]], Spain. Constantine allows the Muppets to perform whatever they wish, much to [[Walter (Muppet)|Walter]]'s confusion. During this show, Constantine and Dominic break into a museum and destroy a roomful of busts to find a key needed for their plan. Even though the performance is a disaster, the Muppets receive critical acclaim. Sam and Napoleon deduce that the connection between the crimes is the Muppet tour, and the pair interrogates the Muppets, only to find that they are too ill-equipped to be guilty. The instructions on the stolen key lead Constantine and Dominic to schedule the next show in [[Dublin]], Ireland.  In Dublin, Walter discovers that Dominic has been giving away show tickets and [[Bribery|bribing]] critics to ensure a packed house and rave reviews, while [[Fozzie Bear|Fozzie]] notices Kermit's resemblance to Constantine. They both realize that Constantine has taken Kermit's place and brought in Dominic as his accomplice. Constantine attacks Walter and Fozzie, but Animal fends him off and the three escape from the train to rescue Kermit. During the Dublin performance, Dominic steals a locket from a museum and Constantine proposes to Miss Piggy onstage; Piggy accepts, and the pair plan a ceremony to be held at the [[Tower of London]] in [[London]], England, where the Crown Jewels are kept.  Fozzie, Walter, and Animal reach the Siberian Gulag on the night of the performance, and Kermit uses it as a front to allow them, himself, and all the prisoners to escape the Gulag. Kermit, Fozzie, Walter, and Animal infiltrate the Tower as the wedding begins, and Dominic (with the help of Bobby Benson's Baby Band) manages to steal the jewels.  Kermit interrupts the ceremony, revealing Constantine's ruse, but the crook takes Miss Piggy hostage and flees to a helicopter, where he is intercepted by Dominic, who is actually the Lemur and intends to double-cross him. Constantine ejects him from the helicopter and tries to take off with Piggy, but Kermit jumps aboard and the rest of the Muppets climb atop each other to stop the escape. Kermit and Piggy knock out Constantine and both criminals are arrested by Sam and Napoleon. Nadya arrives in London to arrest Kermit for escaping. The other Muppets tell her that if she arrests him, then she will have to take all of them as well; she relents, allowing Kermit to go free. The Muppets perform at the Gulag with Constantine and the prisoners participating, ending the film.

My Old Lady (film)
 Mathias, a down-and-out New Yorker, travels to Paris to sell a large, valuable apartment he has inherited from his estranged father. Once there, however, he discovers an old woman, Mathilde, living in the apartment with her daughter Chloé.  Mathias quickly learns that the apartment is a "[[viager]]" — an ancient French system for buying and selling apartments — and that he will not actually be in possession of the apartment until Mathilde dies, and that until then he owes her a [[life annuity]] of €2,400 a month. All this is a surprise to him, since his father never told him and Mathias had language problems with the French lawyer.  Mathias has no money and no place to live, but Mathilde allows him to stay in the apartment with her if he pays rent. However, to pay for the next life annuity payment, he steals and sells furniture from the apartment and also asks a prospective buyer of his contract for advance payments.  Mathias discovers that Mathilde and his father had a long-lasting affair while both were married. Mathias and Chloé fall in love with each other after emotionally bonding over their childhoods.

Her only friends are the counterparts of [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Rainbow Dash|Rainbow Dash]], [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Applejack|Applejack]], [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Pinkie Pie|Pinkie Pie]], [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Fluttershy|Fluttershy]] and [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Rarity|Rarity]], who have formed a rock band called "the Rainbooms" to participate in the school's upcoming musical showcase. The five girls discover that the magic left over from Twilight's crown has given them the ability to grow pony-like ears, tails, and wings whenever they play their instruments.  Hoping to make a fresh impression, Sunset gives a school tour to three new students – [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Dazzlings|Adagio Dazzle, Sonata Dusk, and Aria Blaze]] – and informs them of the showcase, unaware that they possess magical singing voices. Calling themselves "the Dazzlings", the trio perform a song that turns the other students aggressive and competitive towards each other, convincing them to turn the friendly showcase into a [[Battle of the Bands]]. Sunset and her friends are protected from the song by their own magic, but fail to convince the bewitched [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Principal Celestia|Principal Celestia]] and [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Vice Principal Luna|Vice Principal Luna]] of the danger. Sunset remembers a book that magically copies whatever she writes in it to another kept by [[List of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic characters#Princess Celestia|Princess Celestia]], her mentor from the parallel world of Equestria, which she uses to send a message requesting Twilight's help.  Princess Celestia's book is delivered to Twilight's castle in Ponyville. Receiving Sunset's message, Twilight deduces that the Dazzlings are banished [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]] from Equestria that feed on negative emotions to fuel their singing powers for their goal of world conquest. Twilight uses the book's magic to reactivate the portal between worlds, allowing her and [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Spike|Spike]] to return to the parallel world. Twilight and the girls attempt to use the magic of their friendship to lift the Dazzlings' spell, but it takes no effect. Concluding that they must perform a musical counter-spell, the girls enter the Battle of the Bands to give Twilight time to complete the spell. The Rainbooms face hostility and sabotage from the bewitched bands throughout the competition, which raises existing tensions among Twilight's friends over conflicting aspects of their band.  Desperate for time in the semifinal round against [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#Trixie|Trixie]]'s band, Rainbow Dash performs an egotistical song to substitute the counter-spell and nearly transforms, which forces Sunset to ruin her performance to keep her from exposing their plan to the Dazzlings. Despite this, the Dazzlings intervene to allow the Rainbooms' advancement to the final round, goading a jealous Trixie into trapping the Rainbooms beneath the stage to take their place. Isolated for hours, Twilight's friends enter a heated argument that allows the Dazzlings to absorb their magic. Realizing that their constant infighting is interfering with Twilight's spell, Sunset convinces the girls to resolve their differences, while Twilight reasons that simply playing together as friends will make the counter-spell work.  Spike rescues the girls with assistance from [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls#DJ Pon-3|DJ Pon-3]], a student whose headphone music protects her from the Dazzlings' spell. DJ Pon-3 provides a sound system that the Rainbooms use to engage the Dazzlings in a musical battle. Overwhelmed by the Dazzlings' projected siren forms, the Rainbooms are joined by Sunset, who assumes her own pony-like form; with her help, the Rainbooms are able to destroy the pendants that provide the Dazzlings with their singing abilities, rendering the trio [[Tone deafness|tone-deaf]]. Returning to its harmonious state, the school drives the Dazzlings away and praises the Rainbooms. Twilight and Spike return to Equestria, while Sunset uses Princess Celestia's book to remain in contact with Twilight.  During the closing credits, a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] plays showing Sunset being accepted by the student body and performing as the Rainbooms' new lead singer and guitarist. In a [[post-credits scene]], the human world's version of Twilight Sparkle is shown investigating the strange activity around Canterlot High.

He needs to be accompanied all the time, companies hesitate to hire him, although he has excelled in academics, and he cannot impregnate women since he would fall asleep during sex. However, he can still hear whatever is being said when he is sleeping.  Indhiran creates a list with 10 goals he wants to achieve on his own. One day, he ventures out alone, which was one of his goals. When he is almost hit by a vehicle while crossing the road, his fear mounts and he falls asleep in the middle of the road. A passerby ([[Mayilsamy]]) makes him pose as an orphaned corpse and gathers money from onlookers for his burial. Meera ([[Lakshmi Menon (actress)|Lakshmi Menon]]), who passes by, takes pity and shells out almost five grands.  She later meets Indhiran in a mall and falls unconscious, seeing him alive. After clearing up the misunderstanding, they start dating and fall for each other.Meera makes one of the dreams of Indhiran come true (i.e.)getting a kiss from a beautiful woman by kissing him. But Meera's father opposes their marriage as Indhiran cannot give birth to a child. Meera urges Indhiran to find a way how he could stay awake. It dawns on Indhiran that he had never fallen asleep while taking a shower. Believing that her father will accept Indhiran only when his potency is proved, Meera and Indhiran have sex underwater in their pool, resulting in Meera becoming pregnant.  On a late night drive, Meera and Indhiran find themselves in an under-construction bridge. Their car is hit by another and the shock makes Indhiran doze. Meera is brutally attacked by four thugs. Indhiran can hear the entire incident but remains asleep. Meera falls into coma and her baby has been aborted. A heartbroken Indhiran vows to exact revenge on the perpetrators.  The narrative moves back to the present. Deciding to venge all by himself, Indhiran fails to testify to the police. Indhiran comes to know that the sound of the sudden obsacles make him sleep, to prevent this he buys a portable audio player and uses it with full volume. Enquiring Meera's friends, Indhiran first suspects Karthik ([[Rishi (actor)|Rishi]]), a rich but ill-mannered guy, whose marriage proposal was rejected by Meera. Indhiran confronts him, but he feigns ignorance about the incident.  Indhiran remembers that it were four persons, with one of them named Sekhar, and Sekhar's ringtone, while the police finds out that the offenders rode a red car. Indhiran stumbles upon a red car in a petrol bunk and enquires the driver who claims that the car was with a mechanic named Sekhar on the day the crime took place. At the workshop, he spots the mechanic who tries to abscond, recognising Indhiran, and a chase ensues leading them to a building under construction. Informed by Sathish, Karuna arrives there and kills Sekhar. He then slits himself and is admitted for treatment. Karuna then recollects.  Married to Karuna for two years, Kavitha ([[Iniya]]) was dissatisfied with her drunkard husband; she begins an affair with Aravind, a rich friend of Karuna. He spends a lot of money on buying her expensive gifts. Indhiran gains knowledge of this and advises Kavitha against it. It turns out that Karuna, to realise his ambitions of running a business in US, had been using his wife to manipulate Aravind. Citing Indhiran's confrontation, Kavitha bluffed to Aravind that if Karuna gets to know about the affair, he would kill them both. She suggested that the only way to solve it once and for all is to arrange the amount of  20 million Karuna needs to settle in the states. With him gone, they could enjoy being together. Aravind agreed to finance Karuna out of his lust for her.  Later, when Karuna and Kavitha are celebrating their success, Indhiran drops by unexpectedly. They mess up; Indhiran suspects them and informs Aravind who confronts the couple. When Aravind realizes that he had been cheated, he hits Kavitha in a fit of rage and she dies. Infuriated, Karuna retaliated and kills Aravind. Karuna arranges for disposing them with the help of the thugs and lies to Indhiran that Kavitha has eloped with Aravind. Since he assumed that Indhiran was responsible for the death of Kavitha, Karuna had planned to take revenge by making him suffer the same way and requested the thugs to rape Indhiran's girlfriend, Meera.  The remaining thugs insist Karuna to bring Indhiran to the same place where Sekhar was killed. Finding out that it was Karuna who had killed Sekhar, they beat him up. The thugs then remove the audio player from Indhiran who gets an adrenaline rush and dozes off. While the thugs are assaulting him, one of them breaks a water pump which splashes water all over and awakens Indhiran. He kills them all and finally Karuna too. Indhiran tells that he had seen Karuna killing Sekhar but had come with him only to locate the other thugs.  With all his wishes fulfilled, he has a new wish that he would make Meera recover soon. The final scene shows Indhiran hugging Meera who is tearful hearing him which shows that she is definitely recovering.

To earn Mac and Kelly's favor, Teddy invites them to join the party, which the couple agree to. At the party, Kelly meets Teddy's girlfriend Brooke Shy ([[Halston Sage]]) and Teddy shows Mac his bedroom, which includes a stash of fireworks and a breaker box that controls their power.  The following night, Mac tries his best to call Teddy but is unable to get in touch with him to ask him to keep it down so that their baby can sleep. Kelly convinces Mac to call the police and report the party as an anonymous person, but Officer Watkins ([[Hannibal Buress]]) identifies them to Teddy. Teddy feels betrayed that his new friends went back on their promise. The following day, Delta Psi constantly hazes Mac and Kelly, resulting in Stella nearly eating an unused condom after garbage from their party trash is dumped all over their lawn. The couple goes to the college [[Dean (education)|dean]] Carol Gladstone ([[Lisa Kudrow]]) and learn that the school has a three strikes policy before they intervene with punishment; burning down their old house was Delta Psi's first strike.  After failing to force the fraternity to move by damaging their house, Kelly manipulates Pete and Brooke into having sex and Mac gets Teddy to catch them. Teddy and Pete fight, which ends with a barbecue grill being rolled into the path of a passing car and injuring a professor, giving Delta Psi their second strike and placing the fraternity on probation for the remainder of the year, effectively ending their party plans. To acquire evidence of Delta Psi's hazing, Kelly and Mac hire a pledge nicknamed Assjuice ([[Craig Roberts]]) to stand up to Teddy to record him threatening retaliation. When Teddy instead shows him kindness, he reveals that Mac and Kelly hired him and also damaged their house. Teddy begins playing violent pranks on the couple.  Mac and Kelly send Teddy a counterfeit letter from Gladstone enabling them to have parties again, and Teddy begins planning their end-of-the-year bash. Once the party is in full swing, the Radners call Watkins to complain about the noise. Teddy discovers the random strangers sent by Mac, Kelly and Jimmy. After finding a flyer about the party and determining the letter is counterfeit, he stops the party just as Watkins arrives. Jimmy throws himself from the balcony to distract Teddy, allowing Mac and Kelly to sneak into Teddy's bedroom and restart the party using the breaker box. Teddy catches them and fights Mac, while Kelly lights one of the fireworks and shoots it at Watkins's patrol car, while Paula convinces one of the Frat boys to turn the breaker box, resuming the huge party while the police officer is still there. Teddy takes the blame for the party and convinces Pete to take the others and flee. Gladstone shuts the house down and Mac and Kelly return home, adjusting to their new lives. Jimmy and Paula also get back together.  Four months later, Mac is at an outdoor shopping mall when he runs into Teddy, who is working as a shirtless greeter at [[Abercrombie & Fitch]]. The two greet each other warmly and Teddy tells Mac that he is attending night classes to complete his degree. Mac takes off his shirt and jokingly acts as a greeter with Teddy.  Mac and Kelly later take pictures of Stella dressed in various costumes for a calendar. They get a call from Jimmy and Paula, who are attending [[Burning Man]] and invite the couple to come, including Stella. Mac and Kelly decline, accepting their new roles as parents.

New Initial D the Movie
 Initial D}} ===Legend 1: Awakening=== The movie opens with [[List of Initial D characters#Koichiro Iketani|Koichiro Iketani]] driving home on [[Mount Haruna|Mount Akina]], where he witnesses an impromptu battle between [[List of Initial D characters#Keisuke Takahashi|Keisuke Takahashi]] of the [[List of Initial D characters#Akagi RedSuns|Akagi RedSuns]] and a mysterious [[Toyota AE86|Toyota Sprinter Trueno AE86]] (known simply as the "Eight-Six"), which outmaneuvers and defeats Keisuke.  The next morning, at a gas station, Iketani invites his co-workers [[List of Initial D characters#Takumi Fujiwara|Takumi Fujiwara]] and [[List of Initial D characters#Itsuki Takeuchi|Itsuki Takeuchi]] to a meet with his street racing team, the [[List of Initial D characters#Akina Speed Stars|Akina Speedstars]], on Akina. Later that night, they find that the Akagi RedSuns and the Akina Speedstars were already there. Keisuke constantly wanted to hunt down and challenge the "monstrous" Eight-Six whereas [[List of Initial D characters#Ryosuke Takahashi|Ryosuke]], Keisuke's brother and leader of the RedSuns, uses the meet to initiate his plans to dominate the [[Kanto region]]. During their practice, the inept Speedstars are outmaneuvered by the RedSuns' advanced driving techniques; however, this does not stop Iketani from attempting to keep up. While doing so, he strikes a sharp bump on the road, making him lose control and crash.  The next day, Iketani learns that his boss, Yuichi Tachibana, reveals that the Eight-Six is a tofu delivery vehicle owned by [[List of Initial D characters#Bunta Fujiwara|Bunta Fujiwara]], Takumi's father. Iketani's desperately asks Bunta to be his replacement, though Bunta declines, claiming that he is too old to be Iketani's replacement. A few days later, Takumi asks Bunta to borrow the Eight-Six so that he can go on a date with his girlfriend, [[List of Initial D characters#Natsuki Mogi|Natsuki]]. Bunta eventually accepts, but under the condition that Takumi must go to Akina on Saturday night and defeat Keisuke in a downhill race. Unbeknownst to everyone else, it was Takumi who defeated Keisuke at that first encounter as he was returning home from the morning delivery run.  Takumi later arrives at the race much to the bewilderment of the Speedstars. After Takumi explains his reason to Iketani, he agrees to let Takumi race. At the race starts, Keisuke takes the lead, but Takumi's experienced driving skills allow him to catch up as the race goes on. Eventually, Takumi overtakes and defeats Keisuke by hooking his tires in the inside gutter at the five consecutive hairpins. After the battle, Keisuke tells Takumi to not lose any race until their rematch. Despite Takumi's claim that he is not a racer, Keisuke claims that Takumi's racing skills are part of Takumi's own pride before eventually departing.  The next morning, Takumi and Natsuki play around at a beach during their date, where Takumi realizes his experience regarding the previous night's race. As Takumi embarks on his next morning delivery, he prepares himself for the next battles to come.  In a post-credit scene, a black [[Nissan Skyline GT-R#R32|Nissan Skyline GT-R R32]], driven by the [[List of Initial D characters#Myogi NightKids|Myogi NightKids']] [[List of Initial D characters#Takeshi Nakazato|Takeshi Nakazato]], storms up Akina looking for Takumi's Eight-Six.  ===Legend 2: Racer=== The film opens with Takeshi Nakazato, the Myogi NightKids' leader, challenging Ryosuke Takahashi, the Redsun's leader on a downhill battle one night. Afterwards, Nakazato tells Ryosuke that he witnesses Takumi Fujiwara's gutter technique he used to defeat Keisuke Takahashi, and believes that he battling Takumi will make things interesting. However, Ryosuke believes that Nakazato's car is incapable of defeating Takumi's Eight-Six, much to Nakazato's chagrin.  The next day, Nakazato arrives at a gas station where he encounters Itsuki Takeuchi, who accidentally accepts Nakazato's challenge as he drives off. However, Takumi later refuses to accept because he is not a racer despite being persuaded by Itsuki. Meanwhile, Yuichi Tachibana overhears the situation and tells the Akina Speedstars why Takumi refuses to race. He referenced to Takumi how good Nakazato is and that no one would think he's a coward if he refuses. Later, Takumi changes his mind, but when he arrives home, he is shocked to discover that his father, Bunta, had already taken the Eight-Six with him. Takumi waits desperately, and realizes how much of a racer he already is.  Meanwhile, in Akina, the Akina Speedstars attempt to apologize to the NightKids for their mistake. Just as they did so, Takumi arrives in the Eight-Six, much to their relief. As the race starts, Nakazato takes the lead, whilst Ryosuke and Keisuke follow as spectators. During the race, Nakazato's AWD driving skills keep Takumi at bay. Unbeknownst to Takumi, Bunta tuned the Eight-Six's suspension, allowing Takumi to stay on Nakazato's tail. As they approach the five consecutive hairpins, Nakazato blocks the inside, prompting Takumi to try and overtake Nakazato from the outside. Eventually, Nakazato drives into the outside, causing Takumi to drive into the inside, overtaking Nakazato. Nakazato attempts to block Takumi again, but his car spins out, and hits the guardrail, making him lose.  The following day, Iketani's Nissan Silvia S13 has been fully repaired, and Iketani and Itsuki take it to Akina to test drive it. They were then ambushed by a posse of NightKids led by Nakazato's teammate, [[List of Initial D characters#Shingo Shoji|Shingo Shoji]], and his red [[Honda Civic (fifth generation)|Honda Civic SiR II EG6]]. Shingo then bumps Iketani's car, making him spin out. Takumi arrives and witnesses the situation as the NightKids drove off. Back at Akina's peak, Iketani demands Shingo's apology, which Shingo agrees if he loses his "Duct Tape Deathmath" challenge against Takumi, during which the driver's right hand is taped to the steering wheel. Shingo then admits that if Takumi loses, Shingo will overthrow Nakazato as the new leader of the NightKids.   As their race starts, Takumi's tape nearly causes him to crash. He then learns that steering less will let him clear corners faster. Shingo gets impatient with Takumi's inability to crash. So, he bumps Takumi's Eight-Six, making him spin out. However, Takumi manages to avoid crashing and regains control. Enraged, Takumi drives recklessly, even going as far as cutting corners and bumping guardrails. Takumi eventually overtakes Shingo by using his gutter technique. Shingo, refusing to lose, decides to end the race in a double crash, but Takumi countersteers in time and moves out of Shingo's way, causing Shingo to crash, and lose the race.  The next day, the film ends with Takumi receiving a bouquet of flowers at work, along with a card addressed to "Panda Trueno", which then happens to be a formal challenge issued from Ryosuke.  ===Legend 3: Dream=== The film starts with Takumi Fujiwara chasing down the NightKids street racers for making fun of Itsuki Takeuchi's new Toyota Corolla Levin SR AE85, which Itsuki believes is an Eight-Six, and outmaneuvers them. Afterwards, Itsuki tells Takumi that he is amazed when he discovers his newfound appreciation for the car.  The next day, Takumi's upcoming battle against Ryosuke Takahashi is fast-approaching. As Takumi and his girlfriend, Natsuki Mogi, go out on a date, Takumi reflects on how far he had been racing over the summer, and becomes curious about the outcome of Takumi's upcoming battle. That night, Takumi was seen driving Koichiro Iketani's Nissan Silvia S13. That same night, his father, Bunta Fujiwara, drives the Eight-Six with Yuichi Tachibana to test his newly tuned suspension in preparation for the battle.  The next night, Ryosuke Takahashi downgrades his white [[Mazda RX-7##Second generation (FC)|Mazda Savanna RX-7 FC3S]] to 260&nbsp;hp, which Ryosuke believes would give him the advantage and power he needs to defeat Takumi. Ryosuke then comments that this approach to the race makes him think back to his earlier days of racing, as the "Akagi's White Comet".  The next day, Natsuki becomes suspicious of Takumi's lack of interest in her. She later confesses to Takumi about a flashback when Takumi punched her ex-boyfriend two years ago for sexually exploiting her. She even apologizes to Takumi for not explaining it to him earlier, which Takumi accepts. Takumi and Natsuki then kiss. Later on, the Akina SpeedStars suspect that Takumi's interest in Natsuki causes him to zone out, so Itsuki drives Takumi to Akina later that night to help the latter regain focus on racing. While there, they witnessed an impromptu battle between Takumi's previous rivals, Keisuke Takahashi and Takeshi Nakazato.  On the night before the race, Ryosuke tells Keisuke that he will retire from street racing if he loses to Takumi, but will reaffirm his plans of dominating the Kanto region. Takumi arrives, and the race begins. Takumi starts in front, but is pressured by Ryosuke's driving skills being equally matched to Takumi's, especially at his gutter run. Eventually, at the Five Consecutive Hairpins, Takumi becomes overpressured, and enters the corner too fast, making him lose control, and allowing Ryosuke take the lead.  Eventually, Ryosuke's tires wear out, and Takumi manages to come level with Ryosuke. As they approach the final corner, Takumi tries to overtake on the outside. Ryosuke's tires cause him to slide outwards, allowing Takumi to take the inside and win the race.  After the battle, Takumi asks Ryosuke why he slowed down during the last section of the race, to which Ryosuke responds by telling Takumi the truth and accepts the defeat. He then tells Takumi not to be content with a small stage like Akina, and that there is a much bigger world out there.  A few nights later, Takumi is seen racing against an orange [[Toyota GT86]] as he races up the mountain on his morning delivery.  In a post-credits scene, Ryosuke is seen inviting Takumi to a battle as invitation to join Ryosuke's new team, Project D.

The news staff fret over the ethics of the footage but Nina is eager to break the story. In exchange, Lou demands public credit and more money. Police detective Frontieri questions Lou about his connection to the home invasion. He gives her edited footage of the home invasion, cutting out the parts with the gunmen. That night, he and Rick track down the gunmen; Lou plans to follow them to a more crowded public area, then call the police and record the ensuing confrontation. Alarmed, Rick demands half the money Lou stands to make, threatening to tell the police about Lou's crimes; Lou agrees. {| class="infobox" style="font-size:90%;" |- !

After the gunman's SUV crashes, Lou urges Rick to film the gunman, claiming he is dead. The wounded gunman shoots Rick through the glass and tries to escape but is shot by police. As Rick lies dying, Lou films him and tells him that he cannot work with someone who has leverage over him. Nina is awed by the chase footage and expresses her devotion to Lou. The news team discovers that the home invasion was actually a drug deal gone wrong; Nina refuses to report this information to maximize the story's impact. Police try to confiscate the footage for evidence but Nina defends her right to withhold it. Interrogated by Frontieri, Lou fabricates a story about the men in the SUV following him; Frontieri suspects he is lying, but cannot prove it.

Each of the ninja clans has a magic power, and the Lost Ninja Clan control electricity.  Fumitaka, a respected clan leader, believes that the disparate ninja clans are under threat by an external force.  He proposes that they band together to increase their chances of survival.  Though this is well received by the assembled clans, he is assassinated at the end of his speech.  Three witnesses step forward to identify Cage, the leader of the Lost Ninja Clan, as the assassin.  Confused and protesting his innocence, Cage leads his clan to safety as they fight through the hostile crowd.  Cage uses most of his magical power reserves to temporarily knock most of the other ninja unconscious.  The Lost Ninja Clan separate to explore the bunker; each fight off several opponents, though Mar is eventually overwhelmed and killed.  After they bury Mar, Trillion leads them to an elevator he scouted.  They fight through ninja commanded by Becker, head of a rival ninja clan that uses fire-based powers, and each clan accuses the other of being Fumitaka's assassin.

Nightingale (film)
  The movie begins with Peter Snowden, a man in his late 30s, recording a video of his confession to murdering his mother. He explains that she was unwilling to allow him, an equal contributor to their household expenses, to have the house to himself for the purpose of entertaining an old military buddy. He goes on to explain that he feels no guilt for the crime but does regret the amount of blood. Peter appears to be a type of YouTube vlogger as he admonishes himself that he can not upload this video and shuts the camera off.  The next day Peter sits at the kitchen table singing happily and enjoying a bowl of what appears to be [[Fruit Loops]]. And as he heads off to work he seems to forget for a moment that the previous night he murdered his mother because he calls to her closed bedroom door to let her know he's leaving. His face registers the new reality.  Peter returns from work venting about his day but reassures himself that no one will ruin his good mood because he is about to prepare a great meal because he deserves it. For the second time in the film we notice that Peter sings songs to himself that are more suited to the 1960s or 70s and are no longer current hits. And later his wardrobe will validate that he is stuck in another time period. Peter sits down to enjoy his meal but appears to be lonely as he sits at the dinner table. The next scene is Peter sitting in front of the television attempting to watch something but realizing he needs his glasses. As he checks his pockets and the cushions on the couch his facial expression lets us know he remembers where they are and that he dreads going to retrieve them. He quickly goes into his mother's room and comes out with glasses covered in his mother's blood.  The next scene introduces us to Edward. Peter practices calling Edward several times inviting him over for the dinner he was asking his mother to allow him which led to her murder. After getting the courage to actually dial the number he reaches Edward's wife Gloria. He makes small talk asking about the children and then asks to speak with Edward. After being told he was unavailable he leaves a message and begins recording for his online audience letting them know he has no expectation that she will give Edward the message. He decides that Edward will come to dinner on Friday even though they have not spoken. And even begins contemplating a menu.  The next day the doorbell wakes Peter and a package is left at the door. It is a makeup mirror his mother obviously ordered before she died. The mirror seems to represent her throughout the remainder of the movie. It resides on the kitchen table where his mother may have sat during their morning meals. And he speaks to it often as if it were her. He receives a call from his sister Vickie and we begin conversations with the outside world where he lies and deceives others about the whereabouts of his mother. He tells her that his mother is out and complains about the purchase of the mirror.  Peter, drinking and smoking, relishing in the good fortune of having the house to himself for the very first time begins a tirade of phone calls to Edward's answering machine. He shares how much he misses him and goes from pleading for a return call to cursing his wife Gloria for standing in the way of his friendship with Edward.  The next morning the scent of rotting flesh coming from underneath his mother's door begins to become unbearable and Peter stuffs a towel in the crack. Goes off to work and returns with an [[iPhone 5s]] and a [[bluetooth headset]]. That evening he retrieves the mail and notices a letter to his mother. After preparing a cup of tea and telling the mirror, or maybe mother to hold on, he opens the letter and reads it. Its from an old friend from Mobile, AL that lets Lillian, his mother know about the goings on in Mobile and responds to concerns she and her husband have about the last letter from Lillian. They pray Peter will meet a Christian woman to marry. And that Lillian should not love Peter more than God and allow him to do anything against God's will. The letter is so upsetting to Peter that he types a response from his mother to her friend Charlene Carruthers. The letter tells what a good son he is. That he takes excellent care of his mother and that he had his friend Edward over for a wonderful dinner for the three of them.  Peter decides to use his new iPhone to make another attempt to reach Edward and is finally successful. His joy is palpable when he turns his face to the wall and tells Edward how badly he's missed him. He explains that he's called for days and that Gloria has been preventing his calls from being received. He shares the news that his mother has "moved away" and that he wants him to come to dinner to celebrate. Miraculously Edward is available the same day he told his online viewers, Friday.  Now Peter has to prepare the house for his dinner guest and first things first, mother must be removed from the house. He wraps her in his grandmother's quilt, caresses her hand for the last time and drags her from the room. As he leaves we see a lock on the door as if Lillian had been afraid of Peter and locked her door to keep him out. He puts her in the trunk of the car along with a shovel and drives away presumably to bury her. The next day he calls his sister Vickie on his new phone and after explaining to her that their mother knows about the phone and that they are not paupers who can not afford it, he shares the good news that he and his mother are redecorating the house. We learn that their father left them 30 years ago and that Peter is not concerned about the costs of the work as it will just be billed to his master card. Peter vents to mother aka the mirror about his frustration with all the work he will have to do on the house and that this could have been done 10 years ago with the money from some settlement. A call from Mrs Carruthers from Mobile interrupts his lunch. And again he lies about his mother's whereabouts.  Peter tells his online viewers about his exciting dinner plans, possible menu items and thanks them for their comments. Then he introduces them in a later video to the tropical fish he bought for Edward to make his home a sanctuary for him. Adam and Eve are their names and Adam, the fish has just left his wife. We assume Adam and Eve the fish are Peter and Edward and that Edward will leave his wife and family to be with Peter. Peter goes through the house the next day looking for the espresso machine. He explains to his viewers that he and Edward love an after dinner espresso and explodes over his mother having hidden it from him out of spite. After unsuccessfully purchasing a new one over the phone because he has charged his master card to the limit and can not get approved for an increase. He finally locates the machine in the attic.  Sitting outside on the patio Peter finally shares with his viewers the story of meeting Edward. We find out that he was in the military with Edward. He explains that the military was too difficult for him which seems to mean he was discharged. That coupled with the murder and his medications leads the audience to a mental defect that may have contributed to his leaving the military. Peter eludes to a misunderstanding he and Edward had that they need to resolve, not sure if this was a lover's quarrel or unrequited love.  The next day Peter is painting the dining room and explaining to his sister Vickie why their mother does not want to talk to her anymore. He attempts to convince her to send him money for an airline ticket so they can send their mother to Mobile and visit Mrs Carruthers. Later that day Mrs Beasley from church calls to check on Lillian because she missed bridge at church. Peter explains she has been ill and rushes off the phone when the eggs he's cooking begin burning on the stove. Peter ends his night with prayer.  The next day, the BIG DAY, we see Peter with a new look. His hair is texturized like the gentleman wore in the 1960s and 70s reinforcing that he is out of date with his look. He begins singing around the house as he cooks, cleans and works out. He has another discussion with Vickie reaffirming that their mother wants nothing to do with her. He makes some final touches around the house and then begins getting ready. We see from his wardrobe that he hasn't been shopping in decades and finally decides on what looks like a suit he wore to prom. He walks down the hall looking cleanly dressed and quite dapper in a burgundy suit with white shirt and matching tie. And begins to wait for his guest.  After being 45 minutes or so late and updating his online viewers that he may have given him the wrong directions he decides to call Edward and check on him. Gloria answers the phone so he pretends to be a Mr Jones calling for business reasons. When she refuses to allow him to speak with Edward he begins to unravel, threatening her that he will not allow her to ruin what he has sacrificed so much for. And we see what may have happened when he murdered his mother. He takes a baseball bat and trashes the dining room, bashing a blue female statue until it is literally in pieces. Broken and emotionally drained he explains to Eve the fish that he now knows what must be done. And that he and Edward will be together, either in this world or the next.  Peter is awakened the next morning by the phone, his sister Vickie tells him that a murder has been reported on the news. He turns the TV on and hears that an African American female's body has been found and it is being considered a homicide. He tells her he must call her back and washes his face. His day is filled with multiple calls from Mrs Carruthers, Mrs Beasley, Pastor Barrons all asking about Lillian's whereabouts. He provides each with a different story or lie reassuring them that she is fine and visiting friends in Mobile AL. He later calls Gloria to apologize for his erratic behavior and violent threats the night before and announces he will be moving. He gets a suitcase and begins packing for a trip. He shares with his viewers that he and Edward are going on a trip west. They will live alone on a house in the country going to town for groceries in cowboy hats and boots. He is interrupted by a call from Edward.  He excitedly shares his plans for the two of them to run off together and finally be a couple. When Edward tells him something that devastates Peter. He attempts to call Edward back but goes straight to voicemail. We assume Edward tells Peter that they can not be together and that he no longer wants to hear from him. Peter's disappointment is overwhelming. He retrieves his packed suitcase from the trunk of his car, putting his clothes back in the closet and toiletries back in the bathroom. He cleans up the mess from his tantrum the night before, the wasted marinade and the contents of the refrigerator. Then sits to type a letter of apology and suicide to Edward. Peter retrieves a shoebox filled with returned letters written to Edward by Peter returned unopened. He gets all the medications from the bathroom and washes them down with a glass of brown liquor, then goes out to the car where he has taped a hose to the tailpipe and turns on the engine for the car to fill with gas. Unable to keep the pills down he throws them up and appears to decide not to commit suicide after all and turns the engine off.  He goes inside, showers and goes to bed. The next morning Robert Beasley from church comes by the house, or does he? Peter looks out the peephole of the door and the viewer sees no one there. There appears to be the shadow of a shoulder and it looks as if someone tries to break into the back door of the house but when Peter looks out the window to the front of the house there is no one there and no vehicle in the driveway. Leaving the viewer to question if there was anyone at the door at all. Peter then sits at the table to eat his breakfast but after seeing himself in the mirror, the mirror that also appears to be Lillian, he closes it and returns mother to her bedroom. As if saying goodbye. He returns to his viewers now bald and tells them about his brother Bobby's death. The camera pans to a memorial plaque dating Bobby's life from '62 to '81. Since Peter was only 6 in '81 it dawns on the viewer that the clothes Peter wears throughout the film must be those of his brother Bobby. He's been wearing Bobby's clothes throughout the film. Meeting Edward 18 years ago and knowing sincerely that he and his mother would be great friends and reconciling himself to the fact that he has now lost them both.  Peter receives one last call from Vickie where he seems to confess that his mother is dead. He tells Vickie that their mother "loved" her and gives her permission to contact the police now. He dresses in a button-down shirt, sweater and gets a shotgun from the cabinet outside. Makes his final recording to his viewers and announces that the police are inside the house and coming down the hall. He thanks his viewers for their comments and offers words of wisdom and advise to hug your children. He seems to resign himself to being killed by the police for appearing to be armed and dangerous despite the gun being unloaded. Then quotes a verse from Revelations: "He who testifies to the things says yes I am coming soon. Amen." He then shuts the camera off and waits for the police to enter the bedroom.

 Steve ([[Farhaan Faasil]]) is a college kid whose major concern in life is how to tell his childhood friend Anjali ([[Ahaana Krishna]]) that he loves her. He has an iPhone, is on Whatsapp all the time, goes out drinking with his friends and generally lives a carefree life made all the more secure by the fact that Steve's father George is a deputy superintendent of police in Thiruvananthapuram. This idyll is smashed when one day, Steve witnesses a stranger being attacked by men with scythes. Steve isn't able to stop them, but when the attackers leave their victim for dead, Steve takes the injured man to the hospital. It's here that he realizes there is more than what meets the eye. The man he helped is from a criminal gang and it's evident that George is very unhappy that his son has got mixed up in all this. Steve's misgivings intensify when he's called to the police station to identify the attackers in a lineup and none of the men he'd seen are in that lineup. On his way back from the police station, Steve spots one of the scythe-wielding men in a car and decides to follow him. The man whom Steve is following, Hari (Sujit Shankar), seems to be unaware of the college kid tailing him, but of course, that's not really the case. Two of Hari's men knock Steve out. When he comes to, Steve finds himself bound and gagged in a room that overlooks Hari's home. Things become murkier when Hari says he's going to let Steve go and Steve realizes that Hari knows his father. All Steve wants to do is the right and humane thing by the people he encounters, but his acts of kindness just serve to muddle up the situation he's in terribly. Steve realises George and the police force are somehow involved with the gangs and are playing sides, possibly to maintain a peaceful status quo. However, no matter how many times Steve asks, George won't explain to his son precisely how the police are handling the situations. Inevitably, Steve realises that the bad guys have human sides and the police have terrible secrets, but no one has answers to the questions that Steve has. The more he investigates this case in which he has unwittingly become a critical pawn, the more dangerous things turn for him. Aside from Steve, no one seems blameless and yet, he is the one who seems to be suffering the most. Although some of the sequences, like the one in which Steve follows Hari home, can feel a little tedious, the film's tension is sustained by the mystery of how the police are connected to the gangs and whether Steve will be able to find answers to the questions his father refuses to even acknowledge.

Noah (2014 film)
  As a young boy, [[Noah]] witnesses his father, [[Lamech (father of Noah)|Lamech]], killed by a young [[Tubal-cain]]. Many years later, an adult Noah is living with his wife [[Naamah (Genesis)|Naameh]] and their sons [[Shem]], [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], and [[Japheth]]. After seeing a flower grow instantly from the ground and being haunted by dreams of a great flood, Noah takes them to visit his grandfather [[Methuselah]].  They encounter a group of people recently killed and take in and adopt the lone survivor, a girl named Ila, as their daughter. Ila is treated for a serious abdominal wound and will survive, but Naameh determines that she will be unable to have children. Noah and his family are chased by the murderers and seek refuge with the [[fallen angel]]s known as the "Watchers", in whose territory Methuselah lives. The Watchers are confined on Earth as stone [[golem]]s for helping humans banished from the [[Garden of Eden]]. Methuselah gives Noah a seed from Eden and tells Noah that he was chosen for a reason. Returning to his tent that night, Noah plants the seed in the ground. The Watchers arrive the next morning and debate whether they should help Noah until they see water spout from the spot where Noah planted the seed. Once a forest grows instantly, the Watchers agree to help Noah and his family build an [[Noah's Ark|ark]].  After birds fly to the ark, Tubal-cain arrives with his followers and confronts Noah. Noah defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of Cain. Tubal-cain retreats and decides to build weapons to defeat the Watchers and take the ark. As the ark nears completion, animals of various species enter the ark and are put to sleep with incense.  With Ila having become enamored of Shem, Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth but, seeing the settlers selling their daughters for food, he abandons his effort and begins believing that the Creator wants all of humanity dead. Back at the ark, he tells his family that he will not seek wives for his younger sons. After the flood, they will be the last humans and there will be no new human generations.  Devastated that he will be alone his entire life, Ham runs into the forest. Naameh begs Noah to reconsider but, when he will not, she goes to Methuselah for help. Later, in the forest, Ila encounters Methuselah who cures her infertility. Meanwhile, Ham, searching for a wife on his own, befriends the refugee Na'el.  After it starts raining, Tubal-cain becomes angry that he was not chosen to be saved and incites his followers to make a run for the ark. Noah finds Ham in the forest and forces Ham to save himself, but leaves Na'el to die when she is caught in an animal trap one of the sinners set. Noah's family enter the ark except for Methuselah, who remains in the forest and is swept away by the rushing waters just as he finds a single, delicious berry to eat. The Watchers fight off Tubal-cain and his mob of followers, sacrificing themselves and ascending to heaven, their reward for protecting the by now somewhat crazed Noah. As the flood drowns the remaining humans, an injured Tubal-cain climbs onto the ark and solicits Ham, playing on anger toward Noah for allowing Na'el to die.  Ila discovers that she is pregnant as the rains stop and begs the Creator to let the child live. Noah interprets the ending of the rain to mean he must ensure the extinction of humans and, against his wife's protests, resolves that, if the child is a girl, he will kill her. Months pass, and Ila and Shem build a raft to escape Noah's resolve, but Noah discovers and burns it. Ila then starts feeling labor pains and gives birth to twin girls. In the meantime Ham has called Noah telling him the beasts are awake and eating each other. Tubal-cain emerges and attempts to hit Noah. Noah and Tubal-cain engage in combat. Shem promises Ila that Noah will not harm their daughters and goes to stop him. He attacks Noah as Tubal-cain falls to the ground only to be knocked out. Tubal-cain eventually forces Noah to the edge of the raft, but Ham kills him with a dagger before he can shove Noah in the ocean. Noah picks himself up and immediately goes to find Ila and the babies. He is confronted by his wife who lies and tells him it was a boy but he does not believe her. He goes to find Ila on top of the ark, she cries and tells him to wait to kill them until she can calm them down as she doesn't want them to die crying. Noah prepares to stab Ila's twins, but he spares them upon looking at his granddaughters and only feeling love.  Upon exiting the ark on the new land, a shameful Noah goes into isolation in a nearby cave, making wine in which to drown his sorrows. Ham expresses disappointment for his father's current state of unseemly drunkenness and nakedness before leaving his kin to live alone. Having reconciled at the behest of Ila, Noah blesses the family as the beginning of a new human race and all witness waves of immense celestial rainbows.  
Non-Stop (film)
 Alcoholic [[Federal Air Marshal Service|U.S. Air Marshal]] Bill Marks boards a British Aqualantic Airlines [[Boeing 767]] from New York City to London. He sits next to Jen Summers, who has switched seats so she can be by the window. After takeoff, Marks receives a text message on his [[secure phone]] stating that someone will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a specified bank account. Marks breaks protocol and consults Jack Hammond, the other air marshal, who dismisses the threat.  Marks, however, has Summers and flight attendant Nancy monitor the security cameras while texting the mysterious person to try to identify him.  When Hammond is seen using his phone and suddenly goes to the rear toilet, Marks confronts him. Hammond first offers him some of the money. When Marks turns him down, Hammond attacks. During the ensuing fight, when Hammond reaches for Marks' dropped gun, Marks has to break his neck, killing him. This happens exactly at the 20-minute mark. When Marks checks Hammond's phone, it reveals that someone texted that he knows what is in Hammond's briefcase. Marks finds cocaine in it.  Marks alerts the [[Transportation Security Administration|TSA]], but TSA agent Marenick informs him that the bank account is registered in his name and accuses Marks of being the perpetrator. At this point, the pilot dies, apparently poisoned, at the 40-minute mark. Kyle, the co-pilot, convinces Marks that he's innocent.  Marks searches the resentful passengers. One of them uploads a video in which Marks accuses and manhandles schoolteacher Tom Bowen, convincing the rest of the world that Marks is the perpetrator. Meanwhile, Kyle is instructed by the TSA to divert to Iceland. Marks persuades a programmer named Zack White to write a computer virus to make the hijacker's phone ring. The phone rings in passenger Charles Wheeler’s suit pocket, but he denies it is his. As Marks roughly questions him, he suddenly dies, foaming at the mouth, at the 60-minute mark.  While smoking in the first class lavatory, Marks discovers a hole drilled into the wall which offers a clear shot to the pilot's seat. He then inspects Wheeler’s body and discovers a dart. He asks a passenger who used the toilet recently if anybody used it after her; she replies that Summers did. Marks accuses Summers of being the hijacker. Summers gets upset, as she had stood by him. She manages to convince Marks of her innocence.  In the meantime, two Royal Air Force [[Eurofighter Typhoon|Typhoon]] fighter jets meet the plane, to escort it to a military base in Iceland. The passengers watch a television news report claiming that Marks is hijacking their flight. The hijacker then texts that a bomb will explode in 30 minutes. Marks realizes that the bomb bypassed the security checks, and finds it in Hammond's cocaine briefcase. When some passengers attack Marks, Bowen stops them, believing that the bomb is the first priority. Marks convinces the others of his innocence, and has them move the bomb beside a rear door and surround it with luggage to direct the blast outward, while everybody moves to the front of the airplane. Marks tells Kyle to descend to 8,000 feet, as the current pressure differential would rip the airplane apart if the bomb exploded. However, the pilot of one of the escorting jets refuses to let Kyle deviate from his course.  Marks, watching a passenger’s phone video (the news video), notices Bowen making contact with Wheeler, planting the secure phone. Unmasked, Bowen runs to the rear. Marks chases after him, but loses his gun to Bowen in a fight. White reveals he is Bowen's accomplice. Their goal was to frame Marks, thus ruining the reputation of the Air Marshals Service. Bowen wants revenge for the service not preventing the death of his father on [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] and, as a result, believes that "security is the country's biggest lie" and its exposure is necessary to get it addressed. Marks persuades White, who is more in it for the money, to try to disarm the bomb, saying that he could not survive parachuting out at this altitude. However, Bowen shoots White. Just then, Kyle suddenly descends steeply against orders. That distraction enables Marks, with Nancy's help, to kill Bowen. White recovers and attacks Marks, still wanting to jump out of the aircraft. Marks subdues him, then runs from the rear of the airplane just as the bomb goes off, killing White and blowing out the door. Despite the damage, Kyle manages to land the plane safely. Marks is praised as a hero. He and Summers make plans for the start of a possible future together.

He pleads with the court to be granted [[parole]], explaining that he is a changed person. The court denies parole, claiming that he is not trustworthy enough. On the way back to prison, a frustrated Colin outwits the policemen in the car, [[murder]]s them both, and escapes with the van.  In [[Atlanta]], Terri Granger ([[Taraji P. Henson]]) is home with her young children. Her best friend Meg ([[Leslie Bibb]]) suggests that Terri relax and not stress herself with her children and husband Jeffrey ([[Henry Simmons]]). Meg knows that Terri's relationship with Jeffrey has been taxing. Hence, Meg tells her not to worry and that she will visit her at night for a 'girls' night' to cheer Terri up. Jeffrey arrives home just long enough to pack his things and visit his father, abruptly leaving Terri with their two children.  Colin stalks his ex-fiancée Alexis ([[Kate del Castillo]]) and witnesses her meeting another man at an outdoor cafe. She greets the man with a hug and joins him at a table. Colin follows her home where they argue violently, resulting in him murdering her in fury. Later, Colin is driving on a dark road in a terrible storm and loses control of his car, crashing it into a tree. Walking down the road, he notices one house with the lights on, and it is Terri's. He rings her doorbell and asks her if he can use her phone to call for a [[tow truck]]. She is at first apprehensive, but she gives him the phone. They engage in [[chit chat]], and, feeling more comfortable with the stranger, she invites him inside. Terri reveals that before she married and had children, she was a criminal prosecutor for the District Attorney's office. Colin tells Terri that he just broke up with his fiancée because she was cheating on him.  Meg arrives at the house and is shocked to see Colin. When she inquires about where he lives, he is evasive. Later, the three talk and share glasses of wine. When Terri leaves momentarily to comfort her baby, Meg and Colin are left alone. Colin excuses himself for a cigarette break. Meg follows him into the garage, smokes with him and resumes her inquiries about him. Colin suggests that he is having an [[extramarital affair|affair]] with Terri, but Meg doubts Terri would not have previously confided this. Meg bluntly tells him that his story "doesn't add up" and declares that she will find out the truth. She begins to call out to Terri, but Colin quickly grabs a shovel and bashes Meg in the head with it, killing her.  Terri returns to the hall after putting her baby to bed and is surprised to see that Meg is not there. Colin tells Terri that Meg left, but Terri is suspicious, especially when she sees Meg's umbrella in the stand. Terri realizes that Colin is not the nice person that he appeared to be. Alarmed, she rushes to the kitchen to call the police, only to find out that Colin has disconnected all the wires and hidden all of her knives. She realizes that she and her children are in danger, and she rushes to her daughter Ryan's bedroom, finding Colin playing with the child. As they walk out of Ryan's bedroom, Terri hits him with a [[fire extinguisher]] and sprays him in the face with it. He falls down the stairs, and she runs to get her children, but as she leaves Ryan's room, she sees that Colin has recovered. He tells her to put the children back in their rooms and reveals his gun. Terri obeys him (including taking her clothes off in his presence). In a brief moment where she strikes him unconscious, she manages to flee to her home office where there is a [[fax machine]]. She dials 911 for help. Colin recovers and discovers her in the office. He yanks the phone out of her hand just as she finishes her call. She begs him to leave, explaining him that the police are coming, that his blood is all over her kitchen (because she managed to cut him). Colin forces her to take the children into her vehicle and drive away with him. While walking out of the garage, Terri sees Meg's dead body on the floor.  Tearfully, Terri asks him why he is doing this; Colin replies that she will see for herself soon. He refuses to tell her their destination. As they pass a police car on the road, Terri flashes her headlights when she thinks Colin is not looking, hoping to catch their attention. The police car forces them to pull over, and a young policeman questions them. He requests that Terri step out of the vehicle, which she does. He asks her if she is all right, to which she is forced to reluctantly agree because Colin is alone with her children in her vehicle. The policeman senses her reluctance, but before he can do anything, Colin steps out of the car and shoots him dead. He shoves Terri back into the vehicle, and they resume their journey.   Colin makes Terri drive to Alexis' house. She panics when she sees Alexis' dead body in the bedroom. As she tries to find the [[first aid kit]] in the house, the high winds from the storm cause Terri's [[car alarm]] to activate. Worried that the noise will attract attention, Colin binds her hands behind her back and her feet with medical gauze while he goes to check on the car. As Colin exits the house, Alexis' phone rings. Terri manages to answer the phone and is surprised to hear the voice of her husband Jeffrey, who is calling Alexis to find out why she has not arrived at the hotel for a [[extramarital affair|rendezvous]] with him. Terri realizes that he was not out of town with his father after all and has been having an affair with Alexis. Terri also realizes that the encounter with Colin was not so random and that Colin wants revenge on Jeffrey because of his affair with Alexis. Terri tells her surprised husband the truth and has him call 911. She misleads Colin into thinking that she and her children have escaped. When Colin discovers her, she attacks him, grabbing his gun and shooting him until he falls out of a window, dead.  The police arrive with Jeffrey. He tells Terri that he is sorry and that Alexis meant nothing to him. Terri punches Jeffery in the face and walks away. Sometime later, a much more confident Terri returns to her career and has moved into a new house with her children.

Miller's boss criticizes his idealism as financially unsound, and when Miller writes an unsolicited memo on an unrelated case on the Gambizzi crime family, Alan Emmerich, one the partners at the law firm, fires him. Roger, Miller's friend and a fellow paralegal, initially commiserates with Miller, but returns to the office in order to work late. Emmerich sends everyone else, including Miller's girlfriend, Anna, home early due to a technical problem with the firm's Internet access.  As Miller leaves the building, he sees a man in a suit set down a briefcase. A different man then picks up the suitcase and enters an elevator.  Curious, Miller follows the man with the briefcase, only to see him produce a pistol from the briefcase and murder Janine, a lawyer. Panicked, Miller hides from the killer in the bathroom, where he discovers the body of a security guard. When he alerts Roger to the danger, Roger objects to Miller's plan to save Emmerich, as Roger does not believe that Emmerich would do the same for them. Regardless, Miller instructs Roger to contact the authorities as he tries to find Emmerich. Before Roger can make the call, the killer finds and strangles him. As Miller's recharging cell phone chimes, the killer realizes that there are more people left in the building than he anticipated.  Miller uses his knowledge of the building's security to evade capture and eventually discovers Emmerich in an office with a woman who Emmerich identifies as Lorraine Gambizzi. When the killer breaks into the room, Gambizzi grabs a pistol, but the killer is able to shoot her first. Not noticing Miller, who hides, the killer spares Emmerich's life and orders him to stay in the office. When the killer leaves, Miller surmises that the killer is a Gambizzi hitman sent to kill Lorraine, who was going to testify against her husband. With her death, Miller hopes the killer will leave. However, the killer attempts to gain entry into the record room, a reinforced vault that Miller and Emmerich use as a safe room. Using Miller's recharged cell phone, the killer draws Anna back to the building and taunts Miller with this fact.  The killer takes Anna hostage as soon as she arrives. Drawn out of the vault, Miller attempts to trade his access card for Anna's life, but the killer reneges on the deal, wounding Emmerich as he shoots at them. Now with access to the records, the killer starts a fire, only to realize that Miller tricked him into accepting a fake access card. Locked in the vault as the records burn, he chokes and falls unconscious. Miller enters the room to extinguish the fire, after which he realizes that the killer has recovered. As the killer beats Miller, Anna knocks him out with a fire extinguisher. Emmerich recovers the killer's pistol and kills him with it. Before he dies, the killer whispers a code to Miller.  Curious about the killer's last words, Miller investigates further and discovers that Denning likely targeted Roger for assassination because of his own whistleblowing about how the law firm was intending to throw the Denning case. When he confronts Emmerich, Emmerich begs him to destroy the evidence, as Emmerich believes the pharmaceutical company to be more powerful and ruthless than any crime family. When Miller refuses, Emmerich commits suicide. As Miller and Anna leave the building, the killer's earlier accomplice, now revealed to be a police officer, alerts his superiors, and a hitman outside the building radios that he has visual confirmation of Miller.

[[Red squirrel]] Andie ([[Katherine Heigl]]) and glory hogging [[Eastern gray squirrel|gray squirrel]] Grayson ([[Brendan Fraser]]) compete with Surly and Buddy to scavenge from a peanut cart manned by Lucky ([[Scott Yaphe]]) and Fingers (James Rankin) who are casing a bank. The squirrels' efforts inadvertently end with the cart's propane tank exploding in the park after its cord was bitten by Fingers' pug Precious ([[Maya Rudolph]]). The runaway cart ends up destroying and burning the tree, where the animals store their food. Surly is banished and Buddy follows him.  In the city, they find Maury's Nut Shop. Adjacent to the bank, it is a criminal hideout used by Lucky, Fingers, their boss Percy "King" Dimpleweed ([[Stephen Lang]]) and Knuckles, who plan to break through the wall and replace the bank's cash with nuts. King's girlfriend Lana ([[Sarah Gadon]]) believes King has gone straight and the nut store is legitimate.  Raccoon sends Andie and Grayson to the city to find food, but they get separated when a street rat approaches them. Andie recovers Fingers' dog whistle, which Knuckles threw out and Surly had used against Precious, and threatens to dispose of it if Surly does not share the nuts he is going to take. Surly accepts and unwittingly befriends Precious after threatening her with the whistle. Andie informs the park community of the plan. Raccoon reluctantly goes with the plan and assigns Mole ([[Jeff Dunham]]) and the Bruisers to go with her.

When Andie does not believe him, Surly leaves after Grayson reunites with them.  After fending off street rats who work for Raccoon, Surly and Grayson chase the criminal gang's getaway truck, which carries Raccoon and the other animals.

King and Knuckles use the dynamite inside the empty truck to blow up a police barricade at a dam, but the police shoots the tire on the truck that falls from the dam. It explodes after Surly gets himself and Andie off it, and they fall into the river below. Surly makes it to a log, but finds out that Raccoon, King and Knuckles survived the explosion. Raccoon tries to kill Surly, but the nuts' weight begins to break the log. The animals arrive to rescue them, but Surly, deciding to be selfless in order to protect his friends, lets go of the log and falls into the waterfall with Raccoon. The park community now sees the good side of Surly, and mourns him.  The nuts make their way to Liberty Park. King and his associates are arrested as Lana breaks up with King. Andie and Buddy are still mourning over Surly, and when Precious learns what happened, she has Buddy come look at an unconscious Surly near the river. Doleful to see Surly lifeless, Buddy says his first two words: "best friend". Surly wakes up and hugs Buddy. Afterward, Precious leaves to meet Lana, who plans to run Maury's Nut Shop. Finding Surly alive, Andie embraces him and suggests to tell the other animals of his heroism. However, Surly declines, yet gains a willingness to work with others, and goes into the city with Buddy, allowing Grayson to take credit for the nuts making it to the park.  During the credits, the animals and humans dance with an animated [[Psy]] as he performs "[[Gangnam Style]]".

Devereaux interrogates Federov, demanding to know the name of the CIA operative involved in the operation. Federov, filmed by Filipova's phone, admits it was Hanley, not Weinstein; and Filipova confirms it. Mason arrives at the hotel but Devereaux and Filipova escape after he knocks out Mason and leaves him Fedorov's recorded confession. However, when Mason and Celia arrive in Langley to present the evidence, they realize that Weinstein has been replaced by Hanley. Devereaux calls Lucy, his and Ulanova's daughter; Hanley answers the phone, having kidnapped her. Devereaux convinces Filipova to go to a train station and wait for him. There, she goes to a public computer to write her story regarding Fedorov. Devereaux meets with Hanley and Mason, stating she will be waiting at a bus station. Mason is tasked to go and recover her. Alexa finds Filipova at the station; but is knocked unconscious by her, who returns, finishes typing and sends it to the press. Hanley reveals his intention to blackmail Federov after he becomes the President, forcing Russia to join [[NATO]] <nowiki/>against the [[Middle-East]]. Celia, Mason's CIA partner, finds the kidnappers' location and he rescues Lucy. He returns to Hanley and helps Devereaux kill Hanley's men and subdue Hanley.

October 1 (film)
 The film opens with images of a young lady being raped by a seemingly unknown man. Inspector Danladi Waziri (Sadiq Daba) is summoned by the British colonial military to present a draft of his findings on the series of virgin killings that has occurred in Akote. The film flashes back, as Inspector Waziri narrates his story on his observations and experience from his arrival in the town of Akote; he is warmly received by Sergeant Afonja (Kayode Aderupoko). On arriving the village square, Danladi notices the villagers celebrating a horse-rider, who is later noted by Afonja to be Prince Aderopo (Demola Adedoyin). He just returned from the city, as the first university graduate in the community. Danladi observes physical and circumstantial similarities in the deceased virgins, and deduces it must be serial killing. Danladi and Afonja continue in their investigations; the officers interrogate Agbekoya ([[Kunle Afolayan]]), who is the owner of the farm where the last lady was killed. Agbekoya denies any knowledge of the events that led to the killings and is subsequently freed by the inspector Waziri due to a perceived language barrier between them.  After being cautioned by the Oba about his late night movements, Prince Aderopo visits the village bar, where he meets his childhood friends, Banji (Femi Adebayo) and Tawa ([[Kehinde Bankole]]); the trio discuss the coming independence and their pasts. One of the guards assigned to protect the prince deserts his post to spend some time with his lover, close to a stream. Afonja and Danladi question the traditional priest, Baba Ifa (Ifayemi Elebuibon) on their way out of the bar; he responds to their questions proverbially and says that the killer will continue to kill until he is satisfied. The next day, the dead body of the lover of the guard who fled his post is discovered. Danladi orders the arrest of Baba Ifa, which Afonja outrightly refuses to carry out; he is thus suspended from his job and replaced by his deputy, Corporal Omolodun (Fabian Adeoye Lojede). Corporal Omolodun, however, is eventually killed by the serial killer after trailing him along the bush-path, following the discovery of another body, this time of an [[Igbo people|Igbo]] girl. The girl's father, a farmer Okafor ([[Kanayo O. Kanayo]]), along with his tribesmen, capture a travelling [[Hausa people|Northerner]], claiming that he is responsible for the death of his daughter. The accused man is taken into custody by the police, but still maintains his innocence. Danladi informs his superiors that he will be closing the case, since he has found the killer. As he is about to transfer the Northerner away from Akote, Okafor throws a machete at him, piercing his heart. Even with his dying breath, the man insists he didn't kill the girl. Okafor, who repeatedly affirms his actions as doing what a real man would do, is taken into custody. At night, the officers gather to celebrate the Inspector's impending departure following the presumed victory over the killer. Dandali is persuaded into drinking against his will. On his way out he hears someone whistle a tune he was earlier told by the Northerner to be from the killer.

Once Upon a Time in Shanghai (2014 film)
 Possessing unique super strength and martial arts skills since childhood, Ma Yongzhen ([[Philip Ng]]) travels from his hometown to Shanghai to seek a livelihood. There he meets a man from his hometown, Niu Sanguang, who asks the village leader, Master Tie, to feed and give housing to Ma, because he feels an obligation to take care of him. To celebrate his arrival, Niu brings Ma to the Peony night club, owned by a major gang leader and one of the four leaders of a faction called the Axe fraternity. There, he sees rising gang boss Long Qi ([[Andy On]]), whose ruthlessness and powerful martial arts skills have put the four gang leaders of Shanghai’s reigning Axe fraternity on notice and pushed their territory from four even parts of Shanghai to just only half of it under the Axe fraternity and half under his own reign. Long Qi beats the rival gang leader to death, and sends another back with a message: that the club, now named Paradise Night Club, would mark the border of his and the Axe fraternity's territory, further reducing their land holdings.  Ma Yongzhen tries to find a job at the pier. He arm-wrestles everyone and wins easily, proving his extreme strength. Finally, a local gangster comes and challenges Ma to an arm-wrestle. He says that if Ma can last one minute against him, he would hire him; Ma gives a counter-offer of three minutes, but if he lasts, the gangster must hire two of his friends as well. The gangster agrees, and Ma wins, earning three people jobs for eighty cents a day.   Back at the village, Ma is pressured by an acquaintance to sell a package of opium, that he mistakenly brings home instead of a package of imported Japanese tea. He tells Ma that one small package of opium could sell six to seven hundred silver dollars, an enormous sum, but Ma is only interested in making honest money. Ma tells him to return the package, but he doesn't do so. That night, the gangster who hired Ma comes to the village to find the package of opium. He threatens to kill a young girl, and is about to cut her head off when Master Tie and Ma beat up the gangster and his men, keeping the village safe.   Later on, Ma takes the opium and returns it to the gangster, while questioning if that amount of opium was worth a person's life. The gangster replies by saying it was not just worth one - it was worth more than the whole village combined. Ma fights with him and his hooligans, and beats them all up. The police come and arrest the gangsters, and seize the opium. Inspector Wang of the police department tells the Japanese and the Axe federation that the opium cannot be returned to them, making their relationship on edge.   Both youths possess insanely good martial arts skills. Ma righteously challenges Long Qi over his criminal activities at the pier with a duration of a cigarette in which if Ma won, he could have the entire truckloads of Opium for himself. Ma won the fight but instead of taking it and selling it out, he burnt the Opium right in front of Long Qi and Long Qi is impressed by Ma’s stalwart character and martial arts skills. Soon, Long Qi offers to be Ma’s benefactor.  Ma doesn’t wish to be a criminal, but uses his connection with Long Qi to snag honest jobs for himself and his friends. Eventually both youths become good friends, and bond. Long Qi persuades Ma to join him to fight against the Axe fraternity but is refused by Ma.   Meanwhile, the chairman of the Japanese chamber of commerce, Hashimoto Hiroichi, tries to gain Japanese influence in Shanghai. He first approaches Long Qi, and proposes to form an alliance, which he claims is for their mutual benefit in trade, but in actuality is a stepping stone for Japanese domination in Shanghai. Long Qi sees through his cover, however, and asks Hiroichi about his real intentions. He then laughs at Hiroichi's propositions and translates them as bribing him, who is in the way of Japanese control over Shanghai, so that he can betray his own country. Hiroichi asks why Long Qi stole his shipment of opium, at which he replies that it felt good and he wanted to do it for no reason - just like the massacre of the Northern Chinese provinces during the Japanese invasion of China. Hiroichi has no choice but to leave, after accomplishing nothing.  Angered by Long Qi's rejection, Hiroichi goes to see the leaders of the Axe fraternity, to whom he also proposes an alliance, this time, to kill Long Qi. Holding a grudge against him for botching the Axe fraternity's drug trade and claiming their territory, the Axe leaders start planning his assassination.   Ma, helplessly watches as Long Qi dies, and Master Tie is brutally murdered which eventually leads him to embark on a path of vengeance. He kills the leaders of the Axe fraternity, and defeats several samurai, as well as the man who killed Master Tie. Finally, urged by his fiancee, he fights the Japanese gang leader. During the fight, they seem evenly matched, but soon, enraged by the murders of almost everyone he has built a relationship with, Ma Yongzhen charges towards the Japanese man. His fist simultaneously kills the man, while the man's [[katana]] pierces through his shoulder.  After Ma escapes, he is arrested by the police. Before he lets himself be handcuffed, his fiancee tells him that he is the only family she has left and will wait until the end of time for him to come back to her.  
The One I Love (film)
 Confronted with the potential end of their marriage, Ethan ([[Mark Duplass]]) and Sophie ([[Elisabeth Moss]]) are seeing a therapist ([[Ted Danson]]) regularly.  After asking them to each play a note on a piano, he identifies a disconnection in their relationship and suggests they take a weekend retreat to a large, secluded estate. The couple decides to try anything to save their marriage and agree to go.  Once at the estate, Ethan and Sophie make themselves comfortable, smoking some marijuana to relax. Sophie goes to the guest cottage and, while there, has sex with Ethan. Sophie returns to the house to find Ethan asleep. When she mentions the sex they just had, Ethan claims he cannot remember the event, so Sophie, annoyed that Ethan could ruin an otherwise romantic evening with a poor joke, goes to bed alone.  Ethan, instead, curls up in the guest cottage.  During the night, Sophie joins him in remorse, apologizing for her behavior and falling asleep next to him.  The next morning, she makes him eggs and bacon for breakfast. Ethan makes note how odd it is that Sophie is cooking bacon for him, as she notedly hates the smell of bacon and would always refuse to cook it.  Ethan, suspicious, returns to the main house where Sophie has no memory of joining him in the guest cottage, nor of relenting on her distaste of bacon.  Ethan quickly derives that something unusual is going on: when in the guest house cottage, each of them met a [[doppelgänger]] of the other, one who was convincing enough to pass without suspicion.  By visiting with Sophie II (Moss), Ethan is able to establish that their doppelgängers cannot or will not leave the guest cottage; by barging in on Sophie's session with Ethan II (Duplass), he determines that the doppelgängers disappear when both (original) spouses are in the guest cottage together and that the doubles are idealized versions of the spouses they imitate. Ethan and Sophie agree to take advantage of these strange circumstances, though Ethan sets ground rules, including a rule of "no intimacy" and spend only fifteen minutes at a time with them.  Ethan accumulates evidence that there is a mundane explanation for what's going on: some of his clothing is missing, and he receives several voice mails from friends and family, answering calls, made in his voice, asking about details of his past.  Sophie, meanwhile, asks Ethan II why he cheated on her in the first place. Ethan II says that it was a moment of weakness, and promises to make it right. Sophie has started to develop feelings for Ethan II and goes to the guest cottage to seduce him. Ethan discovers this by quick sleight of hand: claiming to take the car to the store, he instead enters the guest house and assumes the place of his doppelgänger. Sophie seduces the original Ethan, unbeknownst to her.  The next morning, Sophie once again seeks refuge with Ethan II, and Ethan I deliberately disturbs them by entering the guest cottage.  As they argue, they find Sophie II and Ethan II awaiting them in the main house.  The four spend a bizarre social evening together, and it becomes clear that Ethan II and Sophie II know they are playing a role. Ethan II also reveals Ethan I's duplicity at the guest cottage, further turning Sophie I against him. Ethan II conspires to lock Ethan I in the guest cottage for the night.  There, Ethan I finds a computer with files for different couples that include sound recordings of voices, and locates a file labeled 'Sophie & Ethan' (presumably Ethan II and Sophie II), learning to imitate him and Sophie I.  Sophie II visits Ethan I in the guest house the next morning and explains what has been happening. The residing couple (Ethan II and Sophie II) must drive a wedge between the visiting couple, causing the visiting couple to fall out of love. The residing couple, presumably having worked out their differences through the shared imprisonment, can then leave, and the visiting couple is in turn trapped within the estate until new visitors arrive. Ethan II, she reveals, is planning to leave with Sophie I as he has fallen in love with her. However, Sophie II would rather conspire against him than see her husband leave with another woman. To execute this plan, Ethan I hides in the bathroom of the main house while Sophie II asks to borrow some of Sophie I's clothes in preparation for a hike the three are taking, emerging in the exact clothes that Sophie I is wearing.  Ethan then confronts Sophie and explains what he has been told. Ethan II discovers their clandestine meeting and after wrestling with Ethan I, attempts to convince Sophie I to flee with him.  When she refuses, he decides to run away, figuring this is his chance to finally escape the retreat grounds, even if he has to do so alone.  Ethan I pursues him, but without need: Ethan II hits an invisible barrier and collapses to the ground unconscious from the impact. Each Sophie has an opposing reaction to the incident, one seemingly distressed for Ethan II lying on the ground and the other slowly smiling at Ethan I as she waits for his next move. Ethan I, realizing this is their chance to escape, grabs the smiling Sophie judging solely by her facial expression and makes a run for the car. The Sophie left behind is last seen left by the side of the road, kneeling over Ethan II who is still unconscious and whose prognosis is unclear. She looks up only a short while with a blank stare to watch Ethan and Sophie drive away from the estate.  Ethan and Sophie drive straight to the therapist's office demanding answers, but find it abandoned with only a piano in the centre of the room.  The two call it a day, seemingly deciding to wash their hands of everything that has happened, and head home. The following day, Ethan and Sophie are home in bed. After some playful banter, he asks what she plans on making for breakfast.  Calling back from downstairs, Sophie casually replies eggs and bacon. Ethan takes a moment to consider the meaning of Sophie cooking bacon, either he has brought back Sophie II or Sophie I has changed. Ethan appears to come to some peace with his own conclusion and he heads downstairs to join her for breakfast.

Nick, the webmaster of a fansite dedicated to Jill, is crushed when Chord, Jill's manager, informs him that she has not only failed to invite him to the film's publicity but also canceled the contest.  Chord remotely sends Nick a link to his laptop that opens a live stream.  Chord explains that he has hacked into Jill's cell phone and activated the microphone and camera without her knowledge.  Although uneasy about invading her privacy, Nick goes along with Chord's plans to spy on her.  By eavesdropping on her phone conversations, they learn that she will secretly meet her agent, Tony, with whom she is having an affair, at the same hotel in which Nick is staying.  Chord directs Nick to use preexisting high end surveillance equipment to spy on Jill and Tony.  As he watches them, Nick is briefly contacted by a trio of hackers who address him as Nevada.  Jill leaves Tony's room.  When Nick's lights spontaneously turn on and Tony can see the camera pointed at his room, Nick panics as Tony leaves his room to investigate.  Chord orders Nick to use a Taser to incapacitate Tony.  Feeling that he has no choice, Nick agrees.  Nick initially refuses to tie up Tony but does so once Chord threatens to stop helping him.  Suspicious of why all this equipment is available in his hotel room, Nick questions who Chord really is; Chord ignores him and guides him out of the hotel by hacking into its security system.  Chord blackmails Nick into further compliance by revealing that the entire contest was a hoax, and Chord now has video proof of Nick's crimes.  Chord forces Nick to follow Jill to her house, and he is contacted once again by the trio of hackers, who believe Nick to be a famous hacker.  They offer to help him in his latest hack, and Nick recruits them to counteract Chord.  Meanwhile, Chord hacks into Jill's PC when she goes home.  When Nick refuses to send her PC a file, Chord demonstrates that he is capable of sneaking into Jill's house and killing her.  The file turns out to be a live feed of Tony's torture by electric current.  Horrified, Nick attempts to bargain with Chord for Tony's release, but Chord only tortures Tony further.  Chord forces Nick to give commands to Jill through her PC, and Nick demands that she reveal her naked breasts.  Satisfied with the resulting video, Chord breaks the connection.  Nick frantically attempts to warn Jill, but she is kidnapped by Chord.  With the help of the hackers, Nick pursues Chord.  However, once they realize that Chord is apparently the master hacker Nevada, their loyalties are torn.  Although they continue to help him, they warn Nick that Nevada is the best in the world and a veteran of numerous anarchist operations, though none have resulted in physical harm to anyone.  The hackers later discover that Chord has killed Nevada and taken his place.  After both Nick and Chord throw off the police, Nick crashes his car, and Chord shoots him.  Chord hacks into the entire Internet, and virtually every website is replaced with a teaser of Jill's revealing video.  When the site goes live, Chord explains that instead of a sex tape, she will be killed live on the Internet unless her fans immediately close the browser window.  The site's traffic increases dramatically, and Chord fakes her death at an abandoned factory.  Jill plays along with Chord and says that she understands the point about society that he is making; however, when his guard is down, she flees.  Nevada reveals to Chord that he is still alive and has been impersonating Nick the whole time.  The real Nick was safely hidden in Nevada's car trunk, and the whole scenario was an operation designed to flush out Chord.  Nevada and Jill escape to safety in a bunker before explosives blow the factory, killing Chord in his own trap.

He writes 100 reasons in a book and sings them all together once (Inthakante Vere - Version 1). On the birthday of Prabha, Venky takes her out to a nice dinner and proposes her. She replies that though she likes him and treats him as her best friend, she cannot accept his proposal as she is only 19 and can't take such a big decision at that age. She asks him to continue their friendship and they can take a decision later. Venky is offended and reacts telling her that  he is new to "Delhi culture" with flirtatious and temporary relationships.  Annoyed, she leaves the restaurant and Venky's efforts to apologize her fail completely as she leaves for Delhi the next day. After Venky narrates his story, both Venky and Uday say good bye to each other and part for the night. Next morning, Uday and Sirisha meet and all attempts by Uday to impress her fail. She decides to seek another alliance and to choose the best between the two. Then, Uday and his broker decide to send Venky's photograph as the new bridegroom.

Guru (Harish Koyalagundla), a NRI who befriends Venky during the temple visit.  Venky persuades Guru to pose as the prospective bridegroom, so that Prabha can reject him and go back to Uday.  When Prabha reaches home, she comes to know that bridegroom was Venky and not Gurumurthy. She wants to meet Venky and propose to him as she grew to cherish their relationship over the past few years. Next day, Uday and Venky sit in a coffee shop where Uday gives Venky a Bluetooth device and a smart phone for communication. Using that, Uday plans to seek Venky's real-time help while conversing  with Prabha. When Uday goes to bring the phone's charger, Prabha meets Venky and proposes him.

When she meets Venky at Necklace road and proposes to him, he rejects her and she leaves dejected. Next night, Uday goes to Prabha's house with a bouquet when she is about to spend a little quality alone-time. But this time, neither Venky's phone signals work, nor his phone's battery has sufficient charging. Thus, Uday can seek Venky's help only for a few moments and when the phone call ends, Uday proposes to prabha on the spur of the moment and tries to present her a ring. The plan backfires and Prabha asks Uday to leave her house. After leaving the house, Uday enlists the help of Venky again and sings a song praising her beauty (Inthakante Vere - Version 2). She is impressed and agrees to marry Uday. When Prabha wears the ring given by Uday, Venky is dejected and leaves home. At home, Venky is advised by his mother ([[Pragathi (actress)|Pragathi]]) that Uday is using him as a scapegoat. She advises him to resign from his job and win back Prabha. When Venky reaches the office next morning, his colleague Kalyani tells him that he is selected as the news reader for the evening news bulletin. He goes to Uday's chamber and submits his resignation. When he is about to leave Venky's office to meet Prabha, Uday beats him up and ties him to a chair and covers his mouth with a tape. Then, Uday selects Vamana Rao as the evening bulletin news reader. However, Kalyani who saw Venky entering Uday's chamber doubts Uday. Uday and Prabha meet up at a shopping mall and start to watch UB TV's first ever news bulletin. Venky at Uday's chamber causes a fire in the room with a cigarette lighter to garner attention and  is rescued. Kalyani sends him to read weather telecast and when he is visible on screen, his parents and his uncle and aunt at Vishakhapatnam are happy for him. He then reveals the whole truth and proposes to Prabha telling her that he visited Vishakhapatnam every summer vacation since he met her though she never returned. Before Uday can stop Prabha from leaving him, he is attacked by Guru who locks him up in a restroom at the shopping mall. With the help of Guru, Prabha reaches UB TV office and after a small quarrel, Venky and Prabha unite. Before Uday can fire Venky, he is stopped by his father. Because of all these developments, the TRP's of UB TV cross TV9 and Venky becomes highly popular.  Uday makes Venky the news reader of evening bulletin and he assigns Vamana Rao to Teleshopping.

However, she decides to go over to his house to seduce him instead. She is horrified to meet Mark's wife, Kate ([[Leslie Mann]]), whom she'd originally assumed to be Mark's housekeeper. While initially hostile, the two women befriend one another. Kate then discovers that he is still seeing another woman, who she thinks is Carly secretly continuing her previous relationship with Mark. After another fight, they discover together that Mark is seeing a third woman: Amber ([[Kate Upton]]).  Carly and Kate follow Mark and travel to The Hamptons, where they stay at the house of Kate’s brother, Phil ([[Taylor Kinney]]). The duo run into Amber on the beach, and the two women inform her that Mark has been cheating on all of them.   All three women then decide to take revenge on him together. Kate spikes his smoothies with estrogen pills to swell his nipples and has their dog lick his toothbrush before soaking it in their toilet; and adds hair-removal cream into his shampoo. Carly spikes his water with a laxative to cause him to defecate heavy diarrhea. Amber uses an ugly drag queen sexual partner against him.

Later, when Mark goes to the Bahamas on a supposed business trip, Kate decides to follow him there and expose him.

She reveals how she, as a CEO, has returned all of Mark's embezzled money back to the companies he had robbed from, which saves both of them from prison time but leaves him bankrupt, much to his shock and hysterical outrage. Mark's business partner, Nick ([[David Thornton (actor)|David Thornton]]), then arrives and acknowledges Kate’s work after firing him.  The three women all applaud each other, as Mark excuses himself from them, fuming. With his furious anger and rush to leave, he smashes into an empty glass room which drastically cuts himself and rips his clothes.

Debbie becomes possessed and hangs herself with Christmas lights inside her home.  Laine attends Debbie's wake with her boyfriend Trevor, younger sister Sarah, friend Isabelle, and Debbie's boyfriend Pete. The five friends meet at Debbie's house and use her Ouija board to try communicating with her. Strange things happen, and a presence smashes Pete's hand and face into a mirror. Later, the friends start finding the phrase "hi friend" (a message communicated during the Ouija board session) written in different places, like Isabelle's car window, a tunnel wall, Pete's desk, and Laine's computer. Thinking Deb is trying to communicate with them, the group has another Ouija session. They then discover that they are actually in contact not with Debbie but with a spirit calling itself "DZ." Laine sees the image of a little girl with her mouth sewn shut. The girl warns them to run because her mother is coming. Laine sees an old woman, and everyone flees. Laine later learns that Deb found the Ouija board in her [[attic]] and played alone.  Isabelle is possessed and killed by being smashed into her bathroom sink and cracking her skull open. Laine and Pete search Deb's attic and find a box of old photographs that belonged to the previous residents. While researching the previous family's history, they learn of a little girl named Doris Zander who went missing, and whose mother was suspected in her disappearance. Laine visits Doris' sister, an old woman named Paulina, who is now committed to a [[psychiatric hospital]]. Paulina explains that her mother was a medium and used Doris as a vessel for the dead to speak through. Their mother went mad and sewed Doris' mouth shut before killing her. She tells Laine that there is a secret room in the house where Laine must find Doris' hidden body and unstitch her mouth in order for the girl to banish their mother. The remaining friends go back to the Galardi house, where Laine finds Doris' corpse and cuts the stitches on her mouth. Doris' mother's spirit protests, but Doris' spirit appears and chases away the ghost of her mother. Pete becomes possessed and is killed in his home, appearing as a soulless ghost with his mouth stitched up.  Laine revisits Paulina and realizes that the old woman, revealing that she was in allegiance with Doris, intentionally lied. Doris was the evil entity all along and her mother was trying to stop the friends from summoning her.<ref>The prequel film ''[[Ouija: Origin of Evil]]'' reveals that the spirit inhabiting the body of Doris is actually that of a Police man named Marcus.</ref> The Morris's grandmother, Nona, advises the sisters to destroy Doris' body and the Ouija board at the same time. Doris' ghost throws Trevor into a swimming pool covered with a plastic canopy, trapping and drowning him. Laine and Sarah return to the Galardi house cellar, where Doris captures Sarah and prepares to sew her mouth shut. Laine plays the Ouija board alone to draw the spirit's attention. Doris starts possessing Laine, but Deb's ghost appears to help Laine defeat Doris. Sarah throws Doris' body into the furnace, and Laine throws the Ouija board, stopping the [[paranormal activity]]. Later, Laine finds that the [[planchette]] has mysteriously appeared back at her home in her bedroom, and as she sees through the planchette the film ends.

Out of the Dark (2014 film)
 In 1992,  Dr Contreras Sr. prepares to abandon a [[finca]] in Santa Clara, [[Colombia]]. He attempts to burn a number of files, stashing them in the dumbwaiter when he hears noises around the house. On the second floor, he is chased by what appears to be a group of children, falling to his death when he is pushed from the balcony.  Twenty years later, Sara and Paul move from the [[United Kingdom|UK]] to Santa Clara with their daughter, Hannah. Sara is to be the new manager at a paper mill that her father Jordan owns. They move into the finca, which is owned by the company. The small family adore the finca, though Hannah is frightened by the open dumbwaiter in the wall of her room.  Shortly after their arrival, Sara and Paul attend a dinner on the opening night of the Los Niños Santos festival, leaving Hannah in the care of her nanny, Catalina. Strange occurrences begin to occur around the finca, and a sleeping Hannah is woken by the door of the dumbwaiter snapping open. Seeing her favorite stuffed toy, Hannah climbs into the dumbwaiter to retrieve it, becoming trapped.  Arriving home, Sara and Paul discover Hannah, ill and developing a rash. Catalina uncomfortably mentions that she believes there was a ghost in the house and is fired by Paul. Over the following day, Hannah ails, her rash worsening, and the couple agree to take Hannah back to the UK for proper medical care.  That night, as a storm brews, children who wear stained and dirty bandages appear and kidnap Hannah, taking her away through the jungle. The police are sceptical of Sara and Paul's account, and a frustrated Paul searches for Catalina, desperate for answers.  Catalina takes Paul to the church where he sees one of the children, following the boy back to a shanty house where he finds the parents of a boy who vanished mysteriously twenty years ago. Prior to his disappearance, the child exhibited the same symptoms as Hannah. Meanwhile, Sara notices a drawing Hannah made of the dumbwaiter and investigates. Falling to the bottom of the shaft, she discovers the files of several children who died of mercury poisoning.  Separately, Sara and Paul make their way to the old paper mill where they meet and search for Hannah. Jordan aids in their search, crawling through a pipe to be confronted by the children, who begin to remove the bandages covering their burn-like rashes. He is attacked by the children because of his hiding the dead bodies instead of telling the police and the children's families about their deaths. He then sees Hannah and makes his way to her.  Cradling his granddaughter, trickles of mercury emerge from her rashes and are absorbed by Jordan's body. Surrounded by the children, the mercury streaming from their bodies, he dies. Hannah awakens, now healthy, in her mother's arms.  Over the credits, children play in a school named for the shanty town the missing children had lived in. Hannah is a student, and Catalina is now a teacher.

Outpost 37
 In 2021, aliens called "Heavies" invade Earth and make quick gains against a disorganised response from various nations.  When the United Nations is disbanded and a united military front, the USDF (United Space Defense Force), replaces it, the aliens are driven off Earth, though thousands of their troops are left behind.  A series of defensive satellites is thought to protect Earth from a second invasion.  In 2033, two embedded journalists accompany reinforcements to a demilitarised zone between Pakistan and Afghanistan where Outpost 37, one of the last USDF outposts, is located.  After a period of hazing, the reinforcements settle into life at the outpost.  Local villagers assault the outpost, and a soldier explains they had no problems until recently, when he believes that the continued violation of their sovereignty has soured relations.  Although the soldiers are victorious over the villagers, one soldier is wounded and sent off to recuperate.  Their requests for supplies are denied, but they receive a replacement for the wounded soldier in the form of Hans, a German national who volunteers to serve with the mostly American group.  Later, Saleem, a local who is very loyal to Outpost 37 after they rescued him, reports that villagers have complained of animal mutilations.  The captain sends several soldiers back with Saleem to determine the cause.  An angry villager says mortar fire killed his animals, but the soldiers deny this.  As Saleem translates for them, a seemingly dazed villager approaches despite the warnings.  He explodes when the herder speaks to him.  From a hill above them, a Heavy opens fire, and the soldiers fall back.  Saleem notices that North, one of the soldiers, is missing, and they mount an unsuccessful search.  Video evidence from North's recovered helmet reveals that he was abducted by the Heavies.  Concerned that the Heavies have changed their tactics to include ambushes and abductions, the captain leaves the base to discuss the situation with his superiors.  He orders them not to leave the base under any circumstances.  A private military contractor approaches the base and claims jurisdiction, and the soldiers are forced to back down when their orders confirm this.  Unable to mount their own rescue mission, they deploy a drone and, during routine reconnaissance, discover that Saleem is in danger.  They violate their orders to save him and take a Heavy prisoner in the process.  The captain is furious when he returns; he kills the Heavy and demands they cease their attempts to save North, an action that violates orders. Saleem volunteers to help. When he visits the base, Saleem seems dazed and uncommunicative.  He opens fire on the soldiers and kills one before the captain kills him.  In interviews, the soldiers express shock that Saleem would betray them. Omohundro, the medic, discovers an incision at the back of Saleem's head.  To find answers, the soldiers leave for Saleem's village. There, they discover North, near-unconscious and wounded. They take him back to the base, where he falls into a coma. One of the soldiers recognises his rhythmic blinking as a code, and they translate it as a series of coordinates. When they attempt to question North, he wakes and chokes the captain, hysterically demanding that the captain kill him; he does.  Omohundro discovers an incision at the back of his head and recovers an implant, which he suspects may have been a mind control device.  During the next attack by insurrectionists, Omohundro examines their heads to also find incisions. Overwhelmed, the soldiers abandon Outpost 37 and blow it up.  In violation of orders, the soldiers investigate the coordinates.  There, they find an alien structure.  Several soldiers fall back into the structure under fire from mind-controlled locals and Heavies, where they discover the contractors and several missing villagers.  Although several soldiers and one of the journalists are killed, they destroy the structure and free the villagers from the effects of mind-control.  The remaining journalist reveals that the structure was designed to defeat the USDF satellite system and allow resupply of the Heavies.  For foiling this plan, the soldiers are given commendations, but the journalist expresses doubt that their sacrifices will ever be understood by the apathetic public.  A short scene after the credits shows many of the survivors of Outpost 37 at a later time with advanced prosthetics as they engage in an all out fight against a second invasion.

Paddington (film)
 In the deep jungles of darkest [[Peru]], British geographer Montgomery Clyde happens upon a previously unknown species of bear. He is about to shoot it to take back a specimen to the United Kingdom when another bear playfully takes his gun away. He learns that this family of bears is intelligent and can learn English, and that they have a deep appetite for [[marmalade]]. He names them Lucy and Pastuzo. As he departs, he throws his hat to Pastuzo and tells the bears that they are always welcome should they wish to go to [[London]].  Several years later, the two bears are living in harmony with their nephew when an earthquake strikes their home, forcing them to seek shelter underground. After being trapped by a falling tree, Uncle Pastuzo is unable to reach the shelter in time and dies from his injuries. The next morning, Uncle Pastuzo's hat is found by his nephew. Aunt Lucy encourages her nephew to go and find solace in London, and stows him away on a cargo ship, after which she says she will move into the Home for Retired Bears.  The young bear reaches London's [[London Paddington station|Paddington Station]], where he meets the Brown family, who take him home temporarily and name him after the station. Henry Brown, the father and a devoted risk analyst, does not believe a word of why he's here and is adamant that Paddington stay only one night while they find a place for him to live permanently, but his wife Mary - a story illustrator - and their two children find him endearing, as does family relative and housekeeper Mrs. Bird.  Paddington thinks he can find a home with the explorer who found Aunt Lucy and Uncle Pastuzo, but does not know his name. Since there seems to be no word of his expedition anywhere on the [[Internet]], Mary takes Paddington to Mr. Gruber, an antique shop owner who discovers that the hat bears the stamp of the Geographers Guild, but the Guild says that it never sent a member to explore darkest Peru. With the help of Henry, Paddington infiltrates the Geographers Guild archives and discovers an expedition to Peru was undertaken by Montgomery Clyde. He uses the city's phone books to track the addresses of all the "M. Clydes" in London.  Meanwhile, the hateful museum [[Taxidermy|taxidermist]] Director Millicent Clyde captures, kills, and stuffs exotic animals to house in the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. When she becomes aware of Paddington, she immediately sets out to hunt him down. The Brown family departs for the day, leaving Paddington home alone. Scheming with the Browns nosy next-door neighbor Mr. Curry, Millicent sneaks in and attempts to capture Paddington; he manages to defend himself, but inadvertently starts a fire in the kitchen in the process. Disbelieving Paddington's statement of Millicent's capture attempt, Henry states that he must move into a new home as soon as possible and Mary reluctantly agrees.  Feeling unwanted at the Browns, Paddington leaves and attempts to track down Montgomery Clyde himself. He finally locates the house, only to learn that Clyde died years ago, and that Millicent is his daughter. She resents her father for losing his job and membership with the museum; out of a change of heart, he refused to bring a valuable Peruvian bear specimen home, even though it would have made his family wealthy. Millicent is determined to succeed where her father failed and capture a Peruvian bear so she can become rich and famous herself. She tranquilizes Paddington and prepares to stuff him, but when Mr. Curry discovers her true intentions, he informs the Brown family and they rush to save Paddington. They rescue him, and Paddington subdues Millicent by throwing a marmalade sandwich at her which Uncle Pastuzo left in his hat for emergencies. This attracts a huge flock of pigeons, distracting her, as Mrs. Bird opens a roof hatch and pushes her off the roof, trapping her on a flagpole.  In the aftermath, the Browns allow Paddington to move in with their family and Millicent is sentenced to [[community service]] at the [[petting zoo]] her father opened after he lost his job. Paddington writes to Aunt Lucy saying he is happy and has finally found a home.  
P-51 Dragon Fighter
 Some time before [[World War II]], a [[Nazi]] [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition had found a dragon's egg and hatched it, setting about to breed more. These dragons are able to reproduce [[Parthenogenesis|parthenogenically]], with one dragon able to reproduce many times, as can each of her "daughters". The dragons themselves are controlled by ''[[Vril]]'', Aryan witch women who are psychically connected to the dragons and can command them.   In 1942, Dr. Heinrich Gudrun ([[Ozman Sirgood]]), a Nazi [[cryptozoology|cryptozoologist]] in charge of the dragon breeding program, code named "Skyward", arrives with his brood. The adult dragons and the vrill are intended to regain air superiority in the [[North African Campaign]] to support the [[Afrika Korps]], under the command of Field Marshal [[Erwin Rommel]] (Robert Pike Daniel).  To combat the dragons, an American general is dispatched with orders to put together a squadron made up of the best [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] fighter pilots that are available, led by Lieutenant John Robbins (Scott Martin), the only survivor of the first fighter squadron to encounter the dragons. General Ward (Thom Rachford) forms the "Ghost Squadron", so named because it does not officially exist.   In their [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s, the squadron leads the dragons into a trap made up of numerous flak guns. The guns shoot down two while one of the pilots manages to shoot down a dragon and mark the location before he runs out of fuel and is himself killed by the dragons. Lt. Robbins and three of his buddies go to the shoot-down site to see what they can learn and are captured by German soldiers, who take them to see Field Marshal Rommel.  The Herr Feldmarschall is very dubious about the dragons. He is not only uncertain that the vrill can keep the dragons under control, but he has serious reservations about the loyalty and ultimate objectives of Dr. Gudrun. Furthermore, he has learned that once in a very long while, the parthenogenic females will lay an egg that hatches out a male dragon. These incredibly rare males are so powerful that the legends say they herald the end of the world.  Rommel explains this actually means the fall of a civilization, saying that one male dragon had laid waste to the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian Empire]], and another had accelerated the fall of the [[Roman Empire]]. He is afraid that a male egg is developing in Dr. Gudrun's incubator complex, hidden under a mountain.  Rommel gives Robbins the location of the incubator and explains how it can be taken out from the air. The key is that the Field Marshal has an inside man who can open an air vent that lead directly into the incubator. All the Allied pilots have to do is put a bomb down the vent, and the incubator and the eggs will be destroyed. Armed with this information, an air attack with an accompanying British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] ground mission is planned. General Anderson (Harwood Gordon) obtains a [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortress]] bomber from an antisubmarine squadron to handle the problem of a down-the-stack shot.   The Ghost Squadron, escorting the Fortress, keep the Nazi dragons at bay long enough for it to bomb the incubator and destroy the eggs. It turns out the "inside man" is actually a woman — one of the vrill is Dagmar (Pernille Trojgaard), a British agent. Gundrun releases Asuzaka, a gigantic male dragon but is incinerated by the dragon. During the aerial battle, only Lt. Marks (Stephen Suitts) is unscathed as each pilot rams a dragon to halt the attacking force of dragons. When it is thought that Lt. Robbins is also killed, a SAS ground party, however, locates him and bring him back to the headquarters hospital where he reunites with nurse Rachel McKee (Stephanie Beran).  With all the dragon eggs destroyed and the adult dragons killed, the war will proceed with conventional weaponry.  
OzLand
 Two men, Lief (Ratkovich) and Emri (Payne), wander through the fields and abandoned homes of a [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[Kansas]] searching for food. Lief, the younger of the two and the only one who can read, finds a copy of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and begins to treat the novel as if it were historical nonfiction, using their surroundings as proof. Leif comes to question whether OzLand is "home" as described by [[Dorothy Gale]], while Emri suggests every day is a journey through "home".  
Pannaiyarum Padminiyum
  The movie begins with a young man ([[Attakathi Dinesh]]) buying a car and he says that his inspiration is from a Pannaiyar (landlord) in his village and his love for a vintage Fiat PAL Premier Padmini car.  Pannaiyar ([[Jayaprakash]]) is a wealthy and respectable man in his village. Pannaiyar and his wife Chellamma([[Tulasi (actress)|Thulasi]]) are kindhearted and broadminded people who are responsible for introducing essential modern technology like Television, Radio, telephone,etc., to their villagers. The villagers also enjoy the liberty of using all these items with his permission. The couple have a married daughter Suja([[Neelima Rani]]), who is greedy and whenever she visits her parents, she makes it a point to return to her house with whichever device she finds pleasing to her eye.  Pannaiyar visits his close friend Shanmugam([[Pithamagan Mahadevan|Mahadevan]]), who owns the then latest (now  vintage) [[Premier Padmini|Fiat PAL Premier Padmini]] car. Pannaiyar is smitten by the beauty of the car and becomes an ardent admirer. He enjoys the ride like an excited kid. Soon, Shanmugam also comes to his house and to Pannaiyar's surprise and  happiness, says that he will leave the car for a couple of months under Pannaiyar's care since he is going to visit his pregnant daughter. Pannaiyar happily agrees and from then on, he stands in front of car dusting it and admiring it for hours at a time. Since he doesn't know to drive, he appoints a local young man Murugesan ([[Vijay Sethupathi]]) as driver and the comical household servant Peedai([[Bala Saravanan]]) as the cleaner. Pannaiyar and Chellamma treat them like their own sons. School going kids often swarm around the car asking for a ride in the front seat and one little boy in particular is very much interested, so Peedai jokingly asks him to bring five rupees to get a front seat ride and the boy starts saving his pocket money sincerely day by day. Like all the other facilities belonging to Pannaiyar, the villagers also get the opportunities to use the car for their emergency purposes. On one such day, when Murugesan is helping a family at a funeral, he comes across a beautiful girl Malarvizhi([[Aishwarya Rajesh]]) among the mourners. He is attracted to her instantly and after a bit of pursuing, she also falls for him and they start to love each other.  As days pass by, Panniyar, Chellamma and Murugesan become more and more attached to the car and are dreading to part with it if at all Shanmugam comes to take it someday. Chellamma is the sensible person out of the three, so she distances herself and on one occasion she refuses to even get in the car and when Pannaiyar asks why, she replies that she will get into the car only on the day when Pannaiyar drives it. So Pannaiyar is determined to learn driving and asks Murugesan to train him. Murugesan fears that he will have no job with the car if Pannaiyar starts driving, so he delays and procrastinates as much as he can. So Pannaiyar's driving progress is very slow. One night, Chellamma requests her husband to learn driving before their wedding anniversary so that they can go to the temple together and he obliges.  Meanwhile, Shanmugam's daughter ([[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]]) unexpectedly visits them and says that her dad suddenly died and requests him to give some property documents that her father left under his care. Pannaiyar is shocked to hear about the loss of his friend, at the same time he feels sad to part with the car. But when he is about to hand over the keys and documents, she says that let the car remain with him as a remembrance of her dad and she leaves it behind. Pannaiyar, Chellamma and Murugesan are overjoyed to hear this and gift her with money as a blessing. Now that they are the proud owners of the car, the Pannaiyar family is content and certain heartwarming incidents also change Murugesan's mind and now he wholeheartedly plans to train Pannaiyar to drive. One small accident happens while training and due to rough handling, the car starts to have minor glitches and starting troubles from then on.  One day, Pannaiyar's daughter Suja comes home and when she sees they have bought the car, she fights with her parents and says that a third person like Murugesan is using the car for driving around his girlfriend and demands that she wants to take it to her house. Unable to refuse, Pannaiyar halfheartedly lets her take it, much to the disappointment of Murugesan and Chellamma and Pannaiyar also feels bad that now their wedding anniversary plans are also ruined because of that. But exactly on their wedding day, as the family is preparing to get into a bullock cart to go to the temple, they see an irate Suja coming to their house with the villagers pushing the car back into their house. She says that she and her husband just missed death by inches in an accident because the car suddenly stopped and scolds her father for giving a useless old car. Chellamma steps in and scolds her and Suja storms away angrily leaving the car behind. Murugesan, Pannaiyar and Chellamma dismiss Suja's unnecessary tantrum and are rather pleased that their car is back. They try to start the car but unfortunately it wouldn't start. In utter frustration, Peedai jumps over the car and sits on the bonnet and suddenly it starts.  Finally, as per their earlier plan, Pannaiyar manages to drive successfully and take his wife Chellamma in his own car to the temple on their anniversary. Meanwhile, the little boy who saved money to get a front seat ride sadly leaves out of town for higher studies without his wish being fulfilled. That boy now turns out to be the young man ([[Attakathi Dinesh]]) who bought the new car at the beginning of the movie. He visits his hometown and still searches for the car in Pannaiyar's house.

Paisa (film)
 A minister of Andhra Pradesh Cabinet named Kalamoorthy is removed from his post after the Central Bureau of Investigation proves his involvement in Liquor Mafia and the Election Commission of India declares the first by election after the main elections of that term in that constituency. While a senior ruling party leader Saradhi (Bharath Reddy) is willing to spend 25 crore for the election, other senior members ask Sanyasi Naidu ([[Charan Raj]]) to shell out 50 crores and if he wins in the by election, he would become the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. Since it is his ambition to rule the state, Sanyasi Naidu accepts to spend 50 crores. With the help of his trusted aid, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), Sanyasi Naidu brings 50 crores to India through Hawala transaction into Old City in Hyderabad. The ACP is tasked with transporting the money to the constituency. On completion of the task and if Sanyasi Naidu becomes the Chief Minister, then the ACP would be promoted as Inspector General (IG) of Police. The ACP goes to the Old city to collect the amount and the money is wrapped in big black plastic bags and is placed in the Deck lid of a Black Innova.  Another story runs parallel to the above plot. Prakash ([[Nani (actor)|Nani]]) is a model of an Old city sherwani firm who dreams to become rich. He has such an obsession for money that he pronounces his name as Pra'cash' often. He has two friends, Tabar ([[Akbar Bin Tabar]]), a cab driver and Gokul. Noor ([[Catherine Tresa]]), who also works in the same firm, is in love with him. However, as Prakash is in love with Sweety (Siddhika Sharma), the daughter of Sanyasi Naidu, Noor decides to leave him and marry an old sheikh in order to solve her family's financial problems on the pressure of their creditor and the local don Yadav (R.K.). But Prakash does not know that Sweety is Sanyasi Naidu's daughter and Sweety is not aware of Prakash's intentions and takes his advances lightly. When Prakash comes to know about Noor's marriage, he beats the sheikh, Yadav and his men in disguise and takes away Noor along with his friends. The two plots converge here as Prakash escapes in that Black Innova along with Noor and his friends while the ACP is left injured severely. Neither Prakash nor his companions are aware of the money in the car.  To save Noor, Prakash arranges her stay in Sweety's house to which Sweety accepts. In the meantime, Sanyasi Naidu calls his henchmen to Hyderabad to kill the ACP and find the money. Another gang of Sanyasi Naidu is approached by Saradhi who tells them to find the 50 crores and distribute it among themselves and this stint makes the other gang turning into Saradhi's henchmen. The ACP makes a deal with Encounter specialist Daniel (Raja Ravindra) to find the money and share it between them equally. Prakash comes to know that his phone is missing and is in the Innova and goes to the parking lot along with Tabar in the latter's cab. There Prakash finds the money in the deck lid and shifts the bags into the deck lid of the cab. Tabar and Prakash go to the place where abandoned vehicles are kept and there Prakash and Tabar see the money. The keys are with Prakash and both go away from there. Meanwhile, Daniel and his sub-ordinate go to the parking lot and find only a part of the money in the Innova's deck lid. While they are informing about it to the ACP, Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen kill him and see the photo of Daniel in the caller image when he dials again.  Daniel arrests all the Old city youngsters along with Prakash and Tabar and Daniel's sub-ordinate (Duvvasi Mohan) asks all of them about the money. Meanwhile, the Local MLA intervenes and all of them are released. Just as Prakash and Tabar leave the station, Saradhi's henchmen attack Prakash about the money and Prakash manages to beat them and escapes with Tabar. After an inquiry with the local Qazi, Daniel comes to know about Yadav's presence in the only marriage that happened on the day of missing of Innova. Yadav's men steal the cab from the new area and while Prakash and Tabar blame each other of stealing the money, Yadav makes a call to Prakash and threatens to sell the cab if he does not bring Noor today. But Yadav is unaware of the money in the cab. When Prakash, Tabar and Gokul see Yadav's men with the cab, they try to attack them but Daniel arrests Yadav's men and Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen rob the car. While Prakash, Tabar and Gokul chase them on a bike, they hit the car of Daniel and since Daniel knows that Prakash is also involved in the robbery of Innova after beating Yadav's men at the spot, Prakash and Tabar are arrested. They are tortured and when Daniel tries to shoot Prakash, Tabar tells that the money is in his cab. Tabar is shot by Daniel and Sanyasi Naidu's men kill Daniel and his sub-ordinate and kidnap Prakash. Gokul reaches the spot and takes Tabar along with him whom Prakash believes to be dead.  Sanyasi Naidu sees Prakash and threatens to kill Noor who is present in his house if he doesn't tell the place where the money is. Then Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen inform him that the cab is at the place where they robbed it as there was no petrol in it to drive. Prakash goes there along with Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen and is informed by Sweety that he is going to be murdered after they reach the spot. Prakash beats them up and refuels the cab. He goes to Yadav's place where Tabar and Gokul are being held. He calls Sanyasi Naidu to come there along with Noor if he wants him. Meanwhile, Prakash leaves petrol cans open inside the cab and plans to explode the cab once the petrol leaks. The two parties meet each other and while everything is going smooth, Saradhi's henchmen arrive along with Sweety and threaten Sanyasi Naidu to kill her if Prakash and the 50 crores are not handed to them. Prakash and Sanyasi Naidu are not at all happy as Yadav is now aware of the money's presence and Prakash displays the money in the deck lid. He locks it and throws away the key. In the chaos that ensues, Sweety's life is endangered which worries Sanyasi Naidu.  Once Sweety and Noor are saved, the petrol starts leaking profusely and Prakash throws a burning stick on it which blasts the car and the entire money is burnt into ashes. Sanyasi Naidu is a reformed man. Prakash marries Noor and goes to Dubai along with his friends. There when his friends blame Prakash for burning the money, Prakash replies that before reaching Yadav's place, he took 50 lakhs from the lot and replaced it with white papers. Out of the 49.5 crores, he donates 45 crores to Saheli, an organisation established for the welfare of poor women in old city to ensure that there is no financial problem to the old city families among which Noor's family is also one. The rest 4.5 cores are retained by Prakash with which he starts a very successful Sherwani business in Dubai with his wife and friends as employees.  
Pandavulu Pandavulu Tummeda
 In the Andhra Pradesh-Karnataka border, there are 2 villages named Pandavapuram and Kauravapuram. Dharmanna ([[Giri Babu]]) is the Head of Pandavapuram village who is considered as the latest descendant of the Pandavas while Suyodhana ([[Mukesh Rishi]]) is the Head of Kauravapuram village who too is considered as the latest descendant of the Kauravas. As expected, Dharmanna is a good Samaritan while Suyodhana is a dangerous criminal who runs a quarry business. Similar to the tale of Mahabharatha, here in this film too, Dharmanna and Suyodhana play the game of cards in which Suyodhana fails which makes him to follow the stipulation of the game - No celebration, marriage and any good events should not be conducted for 14 years. This leaves Suyodhana swearing vengeance and exactly after 14 years, by manipulation, Suyodhana wins the game and asks Dharmanna to give his daughter's hand with his youngest son's marriage. Thus to ensure his daughter Honey ([[Hansika Motwani]])'s safety, Dharmanna sends her to Bangkok along with his friend and his friend's daughter. There she stays with Satya ([[Raveena Tandon]])'s family and starts working with her sons Vijay ([[Manchu Vishnu]]) and Gopal ([[Vennela Kishore]]) in a successful boat business.  On a separate note, Naidu ([[Mohan Babu]]) is a tourist guide in Bangkok and his three sons Ajay ([[Manchu Manoj]]), Varun ([[Varun Sandesh]]) and Lucky ([[Tanish]]) are fit for nothing cons. Naidu, who is a very disciplined man, keeps on punishing them for their misdeeds. On the other hand, Vijay turns into a very short tempered man if one raises a finger towards him and always, in any case, Vijay keeps on breaking those fingers pointing him. Gopal is a stuttering person while Lucky is a dumb person. While Vijay and Gopal emotionally blackmail Satya that they would have been happy if their father was there, Ajay, Varun and Lucky would emotionally blackmail Naidu that they would have been happy if their mother was there as she would support them and defend Naidu. Including Honey, only Naidu and Satya knew that the five men are orphans and Naidu, Satya sacrificed their love to raise them and still remained unmarried as their marriage was put on hold during their young days by Satya's father Subba Rao ([[Dasari Narayana Rao]]) as Naidu was a poor man then. Honey somehow manages to unite them and gets them married and makes arrangements to bring all the five men under one roof. Satya's sons and Naidu's sons keep quarreling always till they come to know that they are orphans. They conceal the fact before their new parents that they knew about their identity in order to not to hurt them. Vijay is in love with Honey and when Honey is going to propose him, Suyodhana's son-in-law Siddha ([[Raghu Babu]]) reaches Bangkok along with his men and forcibly takes her back to Kauravapuram in India.  The new family comes to know about the game of cards, its stipulations and consequences from Dharmanna's friend which makes Naidu to promise Dharmanna that he would bring Honey back to Pandavapuram without any violence. Thus with reference to the Virata Parva of Mahabharata, the whole family enters Suyodhana's house in disguise. First Naidu and Varun enter into the good books of Suyodhana's elder sons Guna (Supreet) and Gana (Bharani) and then enter the house as Graharaja, a powerful astrologer and Upagraharaja, his assistant. Satya, Lucky and Gopal enter the house as Satya Menon, a Malayali cook and her assistants. Vijay makes an entry as Gambler Gopi, a skilled gambler and fan of Suyodhana. Meanwhile Suyodhana's Brother-in-law Bapure ([[Brahmanandam]]), a Telugu freak and over suspicious person and his westernized daughter Kuchala Kumari ([[Pranitha Subhash]]), KuKu for short whom Bapure wishes to turn into a Traditional Telugu girl. Finally Ajay makes an entry in a female attire as Mohini, Gambler Gopi's sister-in-law who loves Gopi. Ajay in the disguise of Mohini makes Guna, Gana and Honey's wouldbe Gaja fall for her charms and KuKu who knows Mohini's real identity is in Mutual love with Ajay. Though Bapure is fond of commenting and complaining on people, Graharaja fixes him in such a situation that if he does it, he would die the next moment. On the day of marriage of Honey and Gaja, Mohini creates a brawl between the three brothers and fakes her death.  In order to escape from the clutches of Mohini's brother Mohan, a police officer, Graharaja advises to Suyodhana to conduct the marriage of Gopi and Honey so that Mohan, who is a police officer would punish Gopi for Mohini's death. Mohan turns out to be Ajay in a police uniform and since Suyodhana's family does not know about Ajay's identity, they remain silent. The marriage is conducted and after the rituals get completed, the drama is exposed to Suyodhana's family by Guna as he finds out that the corpse of Mohini thrown in the well was a doll. Naidu is shot with a gun by Suyodhana at Naidu's arm which makes the five furious. A riot happens in which Naidu and his sons emerge victorious. Finally Bapure is forced to accept the marriage of Ajay and KuKu after he comes to know the truth since the couple is in love.

Parasyte: Part 1
 Mysterious aliens called "Parasites" suddenly begin their invasion when some of them infect humans by entering their brain. One of them attempts to enter the brain of high school student Shinichi Izumi, but resorts to infecting his right hand after failing to bypass his headphones. Thanks to this way of entry, Shinichi retains his human consciousness, unlike the other victims. After his initial shock, Shinichi befriends the parasite and names him "Migi" ([[Japanese language|Japanese]] for "right").  The parasites terrorize humanity by secretly killing them as sources of food. Shinichi himself has to fend against the parasites who are disgusted of the fact that his body exhibits two consciousnesses. One of the parasites also possesses Shinichi's teacher, Ryoko Tamiya; however, Tamiya is a lot more reasonable and is interested in studying the humans' way of life, which she does by becoming impregnated with fellow parasite Mr. A. Tamiya explains that despite having parasite parents, the baby she carries is a normal human.   When Mr. A's attack on Shinichi fails and results in his vessel's destruction, he transfers his consciousness to Shinichi's mother, Nobuko. Nobuko returns home and mortally injures Shinichi, although Migi manages to save him by using his essence to renew his heart, essentially infecting Shinichi's entire body with Migi's particles. Since then, Shinichi's personality starts to merge with that of Migi, namely, being apathetic to emotions; this results in Shinichi's estrangement from his girlfriend, Satomi Murano.   Meanwhile, an underling of Tamiya, Takeshi Hirokawa, runs for mayorship in order to set up the town for the parasites' interests. Another parasite, Hideo Shimada transfers to Shinichi's school and initially acts friendly, but when a student discovers his true identity, he massacres the students. Shinichi is able to kill Shimada, who is left to his fate by Tamiya due to a disfigurement that Satomi causes, which makes him unable to control himself. Tamiya gives Shinichi the location of the Mr. A-possessed Nobuko before leaving the scene. At their meeting, Nobuko is able to overcome her parasite's consciousness long enough for Shinichi to safely kill her.  The epilogue details Hirokawa's successful run for mayorship, the appearance of the mysterious parasite Goto, as well as Shinichi's visit to Satomi at the hospital, where an unknown individual records him talking with Migi.

At the same time, Len and Mia, a married couple, experience trouble in their own relationship.  Len, a depressed and unemployed writer, struggles to find direction in his life.  He confesses to his sister, a nurse named Sarah, that he has taken his wife, Mia, for granted until recently.  Mia, an accomplished lawyer, has just successfully represented Andy, a scientist of some renown, from accusations of selling trade secrets to a research facility in the 1970s.  Anna, worried about visions that she has had recently of a looming apocalypse that involve a young girl, confides in Rick, Len's best friend, that she fears she may be suffering from [[schizophrenia]].  Andy, Erik's grandfather, insists that he take more money, but Erik refuses, as he wants to prove that he can make it on his own.  Misunderstanding Erik's motives, Andy accuses Erik of being too good to take his money, as it was made through the production of biological weapons.  Although Andy admits that he knew that the research was likely unethical, his wife, Esther, brushes off his guilt and says that the money kept their daughter alive long enough to give birth to Eric.  Meanwhile, the situation in the Middle East worsens considerably.  Biological weapons are at first rumored to have been deployed, then proven.  Although the United States urges calm, Europe suffers massive casualties as [[trade winds]] blow the toxins westward.  Andy, aware of the worst-case scenarios, urges Sarah to take appropriate precautions when she attends to him and his wife.  Sarah in turn alerts Len, who takes Mia into their basement.  As panic spreads through the country following loss of contact with the East Coast, Rick attempts to purchase a survival kit.  When he comes up short of money, he grabs one and begs to be given a chance for survival; the owner shoots him as a looter.  Andy and Esther survive through the use of oxygen tanks.  Esther, an optimist, believes that Erik and Anna have survived somehow, but Andy, a realist, insists that they must be dead.  Flashbacks interspersed with Andy's and Esther's argument show Erik and Anna playfully flirting, having sex, and celebrating the news that Anna is pregnant.  The flashbacks end with the apparent deaths of both Anna and Erik as they lie in bed.  Andy and Esther set out to the local hospital to recover more oxygen tanks, where they discover Sarah's body.  Discouraged, Esther begins to lose the will to live, but Andy encourages her with the knowledge that they have each other.  At the same time, Len and Mia debate whether they should commit suicide together.  Len is hurt by Mia's admission that she failed to discourage a coworker from falling in love with her, but he argues they have real chance to survive.  Mia mocks Len's "[[Adam and Eve]]" scenario where they rebuild civilization, but Len begs her to stay with him; Mia tearfully pauses on the basement stairs.  In the final scene, the young girl that Anna saw in her visions earlier is depicted finding Anna's ring and showing it to her mother.

The Pact 2
 June Abbott ([[Camilla Luddington]]), a [[Crime scene cleanup|crime scene cleaner]], finds an order to clean the residence of Ellie Ford, a woman murdered by a serial killer that mimics the [[modus operandi]] of the "Judas Killer". She receives a ring from her boyfriend, Officer Daniel Meyer ([[Scott Michael Foster]]). June, who has a troubled relationship with her alcoholic and smoker mother, Maggie ([[Amy Pietz]]), whom Daniel blames for burdening June, is questioned by the demanding FBI agent Terrence Ballard ([[Patrick Fischler]]) about Ellie Ford. Ballard reveals that June is adopted by Maggie; her birth mother was Jennifer Glick, Maggie's sister and the first victim of the Judas Killer. Ballard gives June the personal effects from Jennifer Glick before he leaves, which includes a Bible. The Bible has photos of Jennifer Glick, the "Judas Killer" (Charles Barlow), and Charles' sister.  June has a heated argument with Maggie, who refuses to disclose anything. After cleaning Ford's apartment, June is haunted by a silhouette of Judas and has a vision where Maggie is killed by a woman. She races to Maggie's house to find her dead body.  Ballard becomes suspicious of June, especially when he learns that she had an argument with Maggie before. June sneaks to Maggie's house and finds a Bible page, almost getting caught by Ballard in the process. The page highlights a quotation about [[Judas Iscariot]] and was torn from Jennifer Glick's Bible. After reading articles about Charles' niece and killer, Annie Barlow, whom Daniel had researched, June contacts Annie ([[Caity Lotz]]). The two try to ask the assistance of Annie's psychic friend, Stevie ([[Haley Hudson]]), but the latter states that she cannot help and that she and her brother, Giles, will move out of town. Though the two decide to end the search, Annie agrees to cooperate further when she realizes that June's father might have been her uncle, Charles. Going back to June's house, the two are greeted by Daniel.  June and Annie conduct a [[séance]] in the attic and call out Ellie's and Maggie's spirits, who whisper about the "Pink Room" to Annie. Seeing June injured after the contact, Annie decides to go to Ellie's apartment by her self. She manages to take several photos, but is mortally wounded by someone. Before she dies, Annie manages to send the photos to June. From the photos, June heads to the "Pink Room", an erotic photo studio. She learns that Ellie was a model there, though the photographer is unknown. Going back home, June is confronted by Ballard, but is later contacted by Daniel who tells her that Ballard is the killer. She manages to tie him up until Daniel arrives, despite his protests. Opening up Daniel's closet, June finds Ellie's ring and photos, realizing that he is her photographer and thus her killer.  Daniel admits that he is the copycat killer and that Charles speaks to him, telling him that June should continue the Judas legacy. June and Daniel have a cat-and-mouse chase across the house. While searching for June, Daniel admits that he gave her Ellie's ring to propose, but was too nervous. Daniel tries to kill June by shooting through a closed door, but she bludgeons him with a bat instead. She heads downstairs to deal the final blow to Daniel before he is able to shoot Ballard, finally killing him. Ballard is taken to the hospital while June is freed from suspicion. She receives a call from Stevie, the latter panicky telling her that Annie left her a message: "it is starting again".  The camera pans to the mirror in front of June, showing Charles standing behind her.  
Penguins of Madagascar
 In [[Antarctica]], three young penguin brothers—Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico—defy the laws of nature to save an egg the other penguins believe to be doomed. After saving it from a pack of [[leopard seals]] and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into their new member, Private.  Ten years later (after the events of the [[Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted|previous film]]), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into the [[United States Bullion Depository|United States Gold Depository]] at [[Fort Knox]] in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called "Cheezy Dibbles" in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is constantly described as being the "secretary/mascot". Suddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to [[Venice]], [[Italy]] by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who removes his human disguise and reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their cuteness had him shunned from every zoo and aquarium across the globe.  Rico swallows Dave's collection of [[snowglobes]] along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen. When cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an [[Arctic]] elite undercover interspecies task force agency called "The North Wind" consisting of their leader, a [[gray wolf]] whose name is classified (in which Skipper mistakenly calls him "Classified" throughout the film), a [[harp seal]] demolitionist named Short Fuse, a [[polar bear]] named Corporal, and an intelligent [[snowy owl]] named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.  At their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends the group to their most remote base (which happens to be on [[Madagascar]]) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the [[Sahara Desert]] before making their way to [[Shanghai, China]], which they mistake for [[Dublin, Ireland]]. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to their current location and make their way to the zoo. Disguising himself as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, Private himself is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island though, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. Meanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge.  Skipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to [[tactical formation|regroup]] due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at [[New York City|New York]] with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off more of Dave's henchmen, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.  Private is left partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their next adventure.  In a [[mid-credits scene]], the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole, much to King Julien's delight.  
Pawn Sacrifice
 The film starts with an adult [[Bobby Fischer]] (1943-2008) in a paranoid state, worried he is being spied upon by the Soviets. The film flashes back to Brooklyn when Fischer was 6 years old; he is shown even then feeling a general sense of paranoia. His mother, a Russian immigrant, supports his general fears, telling him she thinks a socialist revolution could begin in the U.S. and that they are being spied upon.  He immerses himself in chess study and becomes an expert chess player. His mother, worried that chess is becoming his obsession, takes him to an adult chess club. He impresses the resident chess master and is accepted as a student. His coaching leads him into the world of professional chess championships, and he soon becomes the youngest grandmaster ever. Personal tensions lead to frequent outbursts. He enters a championship match in Bulgaria where he senses that they are trying to isolate him, and alleges collusion, which he feels makes it impossible for a non-Soviet player to win the championship. He quits the tournament and ends his professional career.  When he returns to the U.S., a lawyer says that he will help him modify the tournament rules, offering his services free of cost to give Fischer a fair chance to win future tournaments. Fischer re-enters the world of professional chess. He selects [[William Lombardy]], a former [[World Junior Chess Championship|World Junior Chess Champion]] who was a Catholic priest, as his second. Lombardy tries to calm Fischer's excessive demands, which leads Fischer back to winning tournaments.  He overcomes most of the grandmasters across the world and gets close to the world championship, becoming a celebrity with the American public, which makes him overconfident. He then loses to [[Boris Spassky]], the current world champion.  It is the height of the [[Cold War]] era, and the U.S. is desperate to challenge Russian dominance in the world of chess. The White House closely monitors his progress. The pressure to win every game drives Fischer towards psychosis. His sister suspects that he is under severe mental stress, fearing for his life because he might defeat Spassky.  Reporters and fans all assemble at [[Reykjavík, Iceland]] to witness the historic [[World Chess Championship 1972]] match between Fischer and Spassky. Fischer is easily distracted by small noises like someone coughing in the audience, rolling cameras, or the pawns on the chess board, which leads him to make extreme demands for silence and fewer distractions. Spassky concedes to all his demands to make sure the match continues so that he can win the 24-game match in the right spirit.  Bobby loses the first game, and doesn't show up for the second, therefore losing by forfeit. Finally, he wins the third game using unconventional tactics. Americans are thrilled with Bobby's victory. Game four is a draw, but Fischer wins game five after Spassky himself begins showing signs of paranoia. With the match now more interesting, experts speculate that the next game will determine the outcome of the tournament. In game six Fischer plays using an opening he has never played before, surprising the audience and winning. Spassky expresses amazed admiration and rises to lead the applause from the gallery. Fischer ultimately goes on to win the match, but his delusions have destroyed him emotionally, and he goes into self-imposed exile.

Entering the full moon phase, SEES prepares to fight another Shadow Arcana. They are approached by Takaya Sakaki and Jin Shirato, who introduce themselves as Strega  and reveal that they have come to stop them from eliminating the Dark Hour. They trap them and ask if they truly want the Dark Hour to end. The combined Arcana Chariot and Justice appear and attack. Aigis momentarily gains the advantage by using her Orgia Mode, but quickly overheats, and the rest of the group is weakened by poison gas left by Takaya. Shinjiro Aragaki rescues them by destroying the gate to the area, allowing the poison to disperse, and Makoto destroys the two Shadow Arcanas.  At the end of their summer vacation, SEES goes to a summer festival, where Ken bonds with Shinjiro. Entering a new semester, Aigis transfers to Makoto's class. Makoto, Aigis, Yukari, Junpei, and Fuka share their thoughts about what they will do after the Dark Hour ends. Makoto starts to become afraid that he will lose the meaning of his life if the Dark Hour disappears. This causes Makoto to become hesitant in fighting the Arcana Hermit, frustrating Shinjiro, who loses control of his Persona. Ken recognizes Shinjiro's berserk Persona as the one that killed his mother, realizing that Shinjiro is responsible for his mother's death. On October 4, Ken and Shinjiro are not present for the mission against the Arcana Fortune and Strength. Remembering that October 4 is the date of Ken's mother's death, Akihiko and Mitsuru reveal that two years ago before leaving SEES, Shinjiro's Persona went out of control and accidentally killed Ken's mother. Akihiko attempts to reach Ken and Shinjiro and defuse the situation, but is stopped by the Arcana Fortune and Strength.  While Makoto and the others are fighting against the Shadow Arcanas, Ken declares that he will kill Shinjiro, but they are interrupted by Takaya, who reveals the Persona Suppressants that Shinjiro has been taking have been slowly killing him, making Ken's revenge pointless. With Akihiko's help, Makoto eventually defeats the two Shadow Arcanas and hurries to where Ken and Shinjiro is. Ken, losing his will to live, lets Takaya shoot him, but Shinjiro sacrifices himself and takes the bullet instead. By the time Makoto and the others arrive, Shinjiro's wounds are already too severe and he orders Ken to keep on living before dying. On October 7, Shinjiro's funeral is held at Gekkoukan High, and only Akihiko is absent throughout the funeral.  After the ending credits, Ryoji Mochizuki is seen standing at the Moonlight Bridge.  
Petals on the Wind (film)
 Ten years after escaping from Foxworth Hall, the surviving Dollanganger children - Cathy, Chris, and Carrie - attend the funeral of their adoptive father, Paul Sheffield, who took them in. They are still traumatized by their grandmother's abuse and their mother's betrayal, which led to the death of Carrie's twin, Cory. Meanwhile, their grandmother, Olivia, is an invalid after having suffered a stroke a couple of years prior. Corrine has avoided all contact with her children and begins to renovate Foxworth Hall so she can take full ownership of the mansion.  Cathy has become an aspiring ballet dancer, Chris is in medical school, and Carrie is enrolled in an elite high school, but is constantly bullied for her small size. Cathy meets and is attracted to Julian Marquet, a fellow dancer. On their first date, he invites her to go to New York with him to try for a leading role in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', which she accepts. Later that night, Cathy and Chris admit that they still have feelings for each other and give into their passion, making love. However, Cathy insists they must find others to love and live normal lives. The conversation reveals that Cathy was pregnant with Chris' child, conceived from their first sexual encounter while they were imprisoned, but [[miscarriage|miscarried]]. Although Chris says he can never love anyone but her, Cathy leaves for New York with Julian the next day with hopes of starting afresh with him.  Chris begins a relationship with Sarah Reeves, the daughter of his boss at the hospital where he works. Cathy's relationship with Julian quickly deteriorates as he shows a dark and abusive side. When she attempts to leave, Julian threatens to kill her and Chris. He drops her during ballet try-outs and injures her leg, ruining her chance of getting her desired role. She manages to sneak away to see Chris graduate from medical school, but denies anything is wrong when he sees her black eye. Cathy returns to Julian after he shows regret for having abused her and helps her get the role of [[Romeo and Juliet|Juliet]] by putting glass in the original dancer's shoes. Cathy agrees to let Carrie stay with her and Julian to escape the relentless bullying at school. During the ballet, Chris catches Julian touching Carrie and a violent confrontation ensues. Julian drives off and Cathy goes with him. Cathy reveals she is pregnant with Julian's child, which causes an already erratically driving Julian to have an accident. Julian dies and Cathy is injured, but alive. Ten months later, after the birth of her son, Jory, Cathy opens her own ballet school.  Carrie meets and falls in love with a local minister named Alex, who proposes. Carrie is unsure about being a minister's wife, recalling their grandmother's statement that all ministers are evil, but Cathy tells her to forget the past and look towards the future. Carrie encounters Corrine at a charity gathering and invites her to the wedding, but Corrine denies Carrie as her daughter. The next morning, Cathy and Chris find that Carrie has committed suicide by consuming poison-laced doughnuts (the same technique that was used to kill her twin). Cathy vows revenge on their murdering mother, despite Chris warily trying to talk her out of it. She hires Corrine's husband Bart Winslow as her attorney, under the guise of reviving the Sheffield estate, with the intent of seducing him. Bart is instantly attracted to her and they begin an affair.  Pressured by his boss, Chris proposes to Sarah and she accepts. However, the day before the wedding, Chris admits to Cathy he still loves her and doesn't want to marry Sarah. Cathy tells him that while she still does love him, she wants him to move on with his life, as their relationship can't lead to anything. Despite this, the two irresistibly end up sharing a passionate kiss. Sarah walks in and, horrified, ends her engagement with Chris, who is fired from his job as rumors of the incestuous relationship spread.  Chris asks Cathy to bring Jory and start a new life with him in California, where no one will know them. However, Cathy reveals that she is pregnant with Bart's child and intends to finish what she started. Chris decides to go with her to finally confront their mother and they sneak into Foxworth Hall on the day of Corrine's Christmas party. Cathy encounters her grandmother and confronts her about her religious hypocrisy and abuse towards her and her siblings. Undeterred, Olivia tells her that while she can abandon the family she will nevertheless forever be "the devil's spawn." During the party, Cathy reveals her identity and her mother's crimes to the stunned guests. Corrine initially denies everything, but Bart is suspicious and Olivia refuses to defend her. Corrine finally admits to everything, but insists she never intended to kill Cory or have the children put in the attic, defending her actions on the basis that her father would have rejected her and left all of them out of his will. Cathy then publicly reveals her pregnancy caused by Bart.  Corrine blames Olivia for forcing her to put the children in the attic. Olivia counters that the children are abominations and didn't deserve to be born. She gives Corrine a trunk of her old possessions, which when opened reveal the skeletal remains of Cory. Corrine has a mental breakdown and sets the bed and her mother on fire. Bart rushes in to save Olivia, but they both die in the flames. Cathy and Chris escape and watch Foxworth Hall burn to the ground.  Six years later, Cathy and Chris are now married and happily living in California with Jory and Bart Jr. under the surname Dollanganger. Corrine is institutionalized and deemed incompetent to stand trial for her crimes.

Following the end of [[World War II]] and the liberation of the concentration camps, Nelly returns to Germany with her friend Lene. Here, Lene takes Nelly to a reconstructive plastic surgeon. Although Nelly tells the surgeon that she would like to look exactly as she used to, he is unable to recreate her old face completely and Nelly is disappointed with the final result.  Lene finds an apartment for her and Nelly. Since Nelly's family members all died during the war, Nelly has inherited a considerable amount of money. Lene suggests to Nelly that she collect the money and that the two of them travel to Palestine. She believes they will be safe there and can help with the creation of an independent Jewish state.  Although Lene warns Nelly that her husband Johnny may have been the one to betray her to the Nazis, Nelly denies this possibility. She leaves the apartment at night to find him. She finds Johnny working in a nightclub called Phoenix. Johnny fails to recognize her, yet says later that she bears an uncanny resemblance to his late wife, Nelly. In order to obtain his wife's inheritance, he asks Nelly to impersonate his wife.   Johnny slowly transforms Nelly into an image and performer of her previous self before her arrest. Nelly goes along with Johnny's plan and keeps her true identity concealed, telling Johnny that her name is Esther. Although Lene continues to warn Nelly that Johnny was possibly complicit in her arrest, Nelly maintains a romantic view of the relationship. As Esther, she questions Johnny about his feelings for his wife and his behaviour at the time of her arrest. Johnny avoids answering most of Nelly's questions, wanting her to concentrate on learning to impersonate his wife. Johnny tells Nelly that he plans to stage her "return" from the camps within the week, and invites several of the couple's old friends to meet her with him at the train station.  After spending several days with Johnny, Nelly returns to the apartment she shares with Lene. Here, the landlady informs her that Lene has killed herself, leaving behind a note for Nelly. In this note, Lene admits to Nelly that she knows that Johnny divorced Nelly the day before her arrest. She includes a copy of the divorce decree, which forces Nelly to accept Johnny's betrayal.  Nelly keeps this knowledge a secret, meeting Johnny and their old friends at the train station as planned. Later, at the home of one of the friends, Nelly invites the group to listen to her sing, accompanied by Johnny on piano. As Nelly sings, Johnny recognizes her voice and sees the number tattooed on her arm when she was a prisoner in the concentration camps. He stops playing the piano, recognizing Nelly as she finishes the song and walks away.  
The Pirate Fairy
  Zarina ([[Christina Hendricks]]), a very smart and inquisitive pixie dust-keeper fairy, is amazed by the magic behind pixie dust and is determined to find out all that it is capable of. She secretly experiments with some blue pixie dust, creating pink pixie dust; making things grow wildly out of control; which causes an accident in Pixie Hollow. So her supervisor Fairy Gary prohibits her from being a dust-keeper or working with pixie dust in any capacity. In sorrow, Zarina takes her experiments and runs away from Pixie Hollow.  One year later, Pixie Hollow is celebrating the Four Seasons Festival, with performances from fairies of all the seasons. During the show, Tinker Bell ([[Mae Whitman]]), Silvermist ([[Lucy Liu]]), Iridessa ([[Raven-Symoné]]), Rosetta ([[Megan Hilty]]), Fawn ([[Angela Bartys]]), and Vidia ([[Pamela Adlon]]) spot Zarina flying around the audience and using some strange pixie dust to summon several poppies that cause everyone to fall asleep, except Tink and her friends who take cover. After Zarina is gone, they realize that she stole all of the blue pixie dust, the only way to make the yellow dust that the fairies use to fly, so they go after her to get it back.  They follow Zarina to the coast, where it is revealed that she became the captain of a pirate crew, including a young James Hook ([[Tom Hiddleston]]), who is apparently the cabin boy. The fairies manage to retrieve the blue dust for a moment, but Zarina gets it back after throwing some multi colored pixie dust at them that switches their talents. Tinker Bell is now a water fairy, Silvermist a fast-flying fairy, Fawn a light fairy, Iridessa a garden fairy, Rosetta an animal fairy, and Vidia a tinker fairy, much to her horror and disgust. They struggle with their swapped talents as they search for Zarina and the pirate ship, in the process meeting a baby crocodile which takes a liking to Rosetta with her new animal talent.  They find the ship and sneak in, where they overhear Hook talking about how the pirates met Zarina after drifting off course, and she became the captain with the promise of making the ship fly so that they could plunder anything without getting caught. The ship arrives at Skull Rock, where the fairies discover the pirates' camp and a mysterious Pixie Dust Tree, which Zarina has grown using the [[pink]]-colored pixie dust she invented.  The fairies attempt to retrieve the blue pixie dust, but are caught when Iridessa loses control over her nature talent and reveals their location. Tink tries to convince Zarina to return home to Pixie Hollow, but she refuses as no one appreciated her unusual talents with dust. With the fairies now captured, the pirates begin making regular flying pixie dust. Hook, curious about what it's like to fly, convinces Zarina to use some on him, and he begins to fly. After joyfully flying around the cave, Hook double-crosses Zarina and traps her in a lantern, revealing he is the real captain of the pirate crew and that he has merely been using her to get the pixie dust for his own purposes.  Tinker Bell and the others attempt to escape their prison without any success, until the baby crocodile Rosetta befriended arrives and releases them. The fairies attempt once more to retrieve the blue pixie dust and almost succeed, before being confronted by Hook, who threatens to throw Zarina into the sea unless they hand the blue pixie dust over. Tink willingly gives the pixie dust up, and Hook sprinkles it over the ship before throwing Zarina into the water anyway, leaving the fairies to rescue her.  As the pirates sail towards the Second Star to start their thieving, the fairies return and use their switched talents to defeat the pirates and turn the ship. Zarina attempts to retrieve the blue pixie dust from Hook, who chases after her. Zarina manages to gain a speck of blue pixie dust which she then throws at Hook, who starts flying crazily as the two kinds of pixie dust react to each other. As the fairies fly away, Hook swears revenge on them and is attacked by the baby crocodile, who has swallowed a clock. Zarina returns the blue pixie dust to Tink and her friends, before preparing to leave. However, Tinker Bell offers her a chance to return to Pixie Hollow and she accepts, helping her friends sail the ship back to Pixie Hollow, where the other fairies are waking up with no recollection of what happened.  Zarina is about to promise not to tamper with pixie dust again, but is instead convinced by Tink to show off her astoundingly profound pixie dust abilities, giving Tink and her friends back their original fairy talents, allowing them to put on a beautiful performance for the audience at the Festival. Everyone rushes over to congratulate them, particularly Zarina, whose unusually strong and rare talent of pixie dust alchemy is finally accepted so that she can be who she really is.  In an extra scene during the end credits of the film, a drifting Captain Hook comes across a ship named The Jolly Roger. One of the crew members, Mr. Smee, rescues him.

Pikyaw
 Saref, an [[encantada]] - [[aswang]] [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] creature, told her companions of the coming of the [[Lunar eclipse|red moon]] in four weeks. She adds that their revenge on the dwarves is at hand. The monsters, consisting of Albion, Craston, Kaeg and Agas are apparently happy of this development. They were later deployed by Albion to various points of Calixto, a parallel world inhabited by Ilonggo folk creatures.  As this was happening in Calixto, two boys, Abet and Nathan, who lived in [[Iloilo City]], Calixto's parallel world, cut class to play Pikyaw (an antiquated Filipino game) against Marco; a bully who is believed to be the best in the game. Along the way, they met Tyrone after Abet accidentally ripped Tyrone's bag. Abet and Nathan escaped the scene as Tyrone shouts for them to replace his bag. Meanwhile, two dwarves, Unico and Auros, were discussing between themselves of the potentials of Nathan and Marco as champions who they'll bring to Calixto and help them on their fight against Albion. Unico was very happy of getting two big and agile children, but Auros seems to be focused on Abet and his good heart. During the climax of the exciting Pikyaw game between Nathan and Marco, Tyrone came over the playing field with his mother so they can force Abet to replace his bag. While this exchange was going on, Auros alerted Unico that the champions have now gathered and it is time for them to take the champions to Calixto.  A bright light suddenly enveloped the playing field. Abet, Tyrone and Marco find themselves alone with the dwarves who began to tell them of the plan to restore Calixto, but the conversations was cut off due to Auros' inability to keep the connection. The heroes then find themselves inside the University of Iloilo - PHINMA's campus where they defeated Agas and took his stick, which is actually the weapon for Abet. They were able to discover the plan of Albion to abduct Rebecca, Tyrone's househelp, and were able to stop it. The heroes fought with Craston and Kaeg to protect Rebecca from Albion, from which they recovered the [[Sword]] of the [[Philippine mythical creatures|Mahentoy]] ([[Cyclops|Cyclopes]]) and the [[Bow and arrow|Bow]] of the [[Encantada]] ([[Fairies]]). After this, they hid at [[Jaro Cathedral]] where they met Unico.  Unico explained that Albion (or Terrence as he is known in Iloilo) was one of the children that they took to Calixto as a playmate. This is not an unusual event in Filipino folklore: dwarves abducting children with special abilities/characteristics as playthings. The abduction is supposed to be temporary since the dwarves will have to bring the children back to their families to avoid detection. However, the situation changed when Terrence found a plate of [[black rice]] and began to eat some. According to folklore, once you eat food from Calixto, you won't be able to go back until the next [[selenelion]], a rare phenomenon where the moon becomes red due to a lunar eclipse occurring at dawn or dusk. The dwarves, realizing that they have a rare opportunity to keep Terrence, passed up on several chances to bring him back to [[Iloilo]]. Terrence resented the dwarves for not doing anything to bring him back and left the dwarves. He rechristened himself as Albion, and with the support of the other folk creatures, set out on revenge against the dwarves.  Saref was able to follow the heroes at Jaro Cathedral and fought with Tyrone and Marco, who took the Bow of the Encantada and the Sword of the Mahentoy, respectively. Their new weapons were able to spawn them new armor as well, and they held Saref off while Abet, Rebecca, and Unico escaped. During the escape, Unico found out that Abet holds half of the weapon of the dwarves: the Sticks of the [[Dwarf (Germanic mythology)|Dwarves]]. Unico persuaded Abet to help Tyrone and Marco and gave him the other half of the weapon. When Abet combined the two weapons, he became Lakan, the champion of the dwarves, proficient in the use of [[Arnis]], a Filipino martial art. The three were able to fight off Saref and bound her to the Jaro Belfry. Saref told them that they were too late to save Calixto, since the red moon has appeared and Rebecca isn't saved. It turned out that Saref was trying to save Rebecca from the dwarves.  Unico revealed to Rebecca that Calixto's happiness depended on the dwarves' ability to control the [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] of Calixto. The dwarves' happiness will reflect on Calixto's, therefore their need to take Rebecca as replacement to Albion. Nathan, now the champion of the [[Kapre]]s wielding a heavy ax, stalled Unico's plan until he was stopped by Abet, Tyrone and Marco. Nathan was helped later by Craston, Kaeg, Agas and Saref. Behind them is Albion, who took Rebecca and Unico. He knocked Unico unconscious and asked Nathan to start the ceremony: kill him and save Rebecca, which will stop the dwarves' system indefinitely. Nathan was later disarmed by Abet, Tyrone and Marco. Albion retaliated and held off Tyrone and Marco and forced Abet to kill him. Abet, left without any choices, changed to Lakan and proceeded to give Albion the killer blow.  Rebecca, realizing that Calixto will not return to normal, interrupted the whole ceremony and sacrificed her future, accepting her fate as Albion's replacement. Albion was adamant that the ceremony continue and persuaded Rebecca not to do it, for she will never be happy in Calixto. Rebecca dismissed this, believing that making others happy is enough to make her happy. After that, Albion reverted to his old form and he returned to Iloilo, together with Abet, Tyrone, Marco and Nathan.  The four children, after making amends and discovering a new bond of friendship, played Pikyaw together as Terrence, now a 46-year-old man, walks by.

The driver's cousin, who was in the car that day tells Siddharth that she saw the actual car that hit Bhavani that day and that it was not green but red. Siddharth then goes back to the auto driver and asks him to differentiate between red apples and green ones, which he cannot since he is colour blind.  Finally realising that he is the killer, Siddharth goes to tell Bhavani's father the truth. The ghost tries to stop him, but he still reveals the truth. Over-ridden with guilt, Siddharth tries to commit suicide.

He manages to get the thief's cassette recorder. On the same day in [[Bruges]], an Indian Hindu woman Jaggu ([[Anushka Sharma]]) meets a Pakistani Muslim Sarfaraz ([[Sushant Singh Rajput]]) and falls in love with him. Jaggu's father ([[Parikshit Sahni]]) objects to their relationship citing religious differences. He consults [[Godman (India)|godman]] Tapasvi Maharaj ([[Saurabh Shukla]]) who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her. At the wedding chapel, she is heartbroken when she receives an unsigned letter, believing it is from Sarfaraz, calling off the marriage due to cultural differences.  Jaggu returns to India and becomes a TV reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the "missing" God. She saves him when he attempts to take money from a collection box, earning his trust. The alien tells her that he is a researcher from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing, religion, or verbal communication. They transfer ideas by holding hands. The alien learned to fit in among humans by wearing clothes and using money stolen from "dancing cars".  In a flashback, after being accidentally hit by a truck, the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), who takes him along with his troop.

Bhairon suggests him that his thief may be in Delhi. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behavior, people assume he is drunk and call him "peekay" (Hindi for drunk). The alien names himself PK. People tell him that only "God" can help him find his remote. PK sincerely practices [[Religion in India|Indian religions]] attempting to find "God", to no avail. He later discovers that Tapasvi has his remote, who claims it was a gift from God, and refuses to return it. Jaggu promises PK that she will recover his remote and he can go back home.  PK conjectures that Tapasvi and other godmen must be dialing a "wrong number" to communicate with God and are advising the public to engage in meaningless rituals. Jaggu encourages the public to expose [[Pious fraud|fraudulent godmen]], by sending their videos to her news channel. This "wrong number" campaign turns into a popular mass-movement, to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief and contacts PK, telling him that he sold his remote control to Tapasvi. PK realises that Tapasvi was a fraud all along and that it was not a "wrong number". Bhairon informs him that they will come to Delhi, but both die in a terrorist attack. The attack is later declared by Tapasvi's group to be stated as protecting their Gods.  Tapasvi decides to confront PK on-air. Tapasvi asks PK what the "right number" is. PK says that "God that created us all" is the only concept people should believe in and that the other "duplicate Gods" are artificial. Tapasvi argues, saying that PK is trying to take people away from their Gods and that they will not stand for their Gods being taken away. He claims he has a direct connection to God and refers to his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to try to prove that Muslims are liars. PK disagrees. PK realises that Sarfaraz did not write the letter to Jaggu.  Jaggu contacts the [[List of diplomatic missions of Pakistan#Europe|Pakistani Embassy]] in Belgium where Sarfaraz worked part-time. The embassy tells her that Sarfaraz still loves her, and is now living in [[Lahore]]. Jaggu and Sarfaraz reconnect, and Tapasvi is forced to return PK's remote. Meanwhile, PK has fallen in love with Jaggu but refrains from telling her because she loves Sarfaraz. Having filled multiple audio tapes with her voice alone, he takes two suitcases full of tapes and extra batteries when leaving for home. After his departure, Jaggu publishes a book about him.  One year later, PK returns to Earth on a new research mission on human nature with several other members of his species.

Unfortunately, his engine's [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] becomes damaged because Dusty routinely operates the engine beyond its design limits. With that particular model of gearbox now out of production and none available anywhere, Dusty's mechanic Dottie fits a warning light to his control panel to ensure he doesn't damage his gearbox any further. No longer able to race and faced with the possibility of returning to his old job as a crop-duster, Dusty goes on a defiant flight and tests his limits. In doing so, Dusty exceeds his limits and makes a forced landing at Propwash Junction airport, causing a fire.  The residents [[firefighting|put out the fire]] with some difficulty, but the accident leads government inspector Ryker to [[eminent domain|condemn]] the airport for inadequate firefighting personnel. Aggrieved at his carelessness, Dusty offers to undergo training to be certified as a firefighter to meet the necessary regulations to reopen the airport. To that end, Dusty travels to Piston Peak National Park where he meets a fire and rescue crew under the command of a helicopter named Blade Ranger. The leader of an efficient unit, Blade is initially unimpressed by the small newcomer and Dusty's training proves to be a difficult challenge.  Maru, the team's mechanic, replaces Dusty's original undercarriage with two pontoons fitted with retractable undercarriage wheels for his new role as a firefighter. During training, Dusty learns that Blade was formerly an actor who played a police helicopter on the TV series ''[[CHiPs|CHoPs]]''. Later, Dusty is devastated by a call from his friends at Propwash Junction noting that all attempts at finding a replacement gearbox have failed and that his racing career is over.  Lightning in a thunderstorm over a forest near Piston Peak starts several spot fires which unite into a serious forest fire. The team fights it and seem to have extinguished it, but later, during the grand reopening of the park's lodge, visiting [[VIP]]s fly too low and make air eddies which blow embers about, creating a larger fire, and thereby forcing the need for an evacuation.  A depressed Dusty's education in the midst of the large fire falters to Blade's frustration and things come to a head when Dusty makes a forced landing in a river during a fire dispatch and is swept through the rapids with Blade trying to extract him. Eventually, the pair make it to land, and Dusty confesses his physical disability, to which Blade advises Dusty not to give up. They shelter in an abandoned mine while the fire passes. The situation is complicated in that Blade also is damaged from protecting Dusty in the fire, and is temporarily grounded for repairs. While Blade is recuperating, Dusty learns from Maru that Blade's co-star Nick Lopez from ''CHoPs'' was killed during a stunt gone wrong on set that Blade was helpless to stop, so he decided to become a firefighter to save lives for real.  The national park's superintendent, Cad Spinner, selfishly diverts all the water supply to his lodge's roof sprinklers to prevent the lodge from burning, and so prevents the firefighters from making [[fire retardant]] for their own duties. With only their pre-existing tank loads, the firefighters manage to help the evacuees escape the fire while Dusty is alerted that two elderly campers named Harvey and Winnie, that he met earlier, are trapped on a burning bridge deep in the fire zone. He races to the scene and is forced to push his engine to the maximum to climb vertically up a waterfall to refill his water tanks to drop water to save the campers, as the only other surface water near is a river too shallow and twisty and rocky for him to scoop from. Meanwhile, Blade shows up and assists Harvey and Winnie by holding up the bridge. Dusty successfully drops water and extinguishes the fire, allowing the campers to escape just before the bridge collapses, but his overstressed gearbox fails completely and his engine stalls. He tries to glide through the trees to make a safe landing, but one of his pontoons hits one of the trees and he crashes.  Unconscious, Dusty is airlifted back to base where he [[coma|wakes up five days later]] to find that ranger Jammer is now in charge of the park, to much delight. Maru tells him that not only has his structure been fully repaired; he has built a superior, custom-refurbished gearbox for his engine to allow full performance once again. Impressed at Dusty's skill and heroism, Blade certifies him as a firefighter. Propwash Junction is reopened with Dusty assuming his duty as a firefighter, celebrated with an aerial show with his new colleagues from Piston Peak.  During the [[post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], it is shown that Cad's misconduct resulted in his [[demotion]] and reassignment as a [[park ranger]] in [[Death Valley]].

Nikki, keeps telling him that he would soon realize the presence of supernatural beings. At first, Kunal is confused and scared, and his fears are confirmed when he comes to know his boss, i.e., the Pizza restaurant owner Mr. Kapoor's ([[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]]) pregnant wife is possessed by a spirit. Meanwhile, Nikki becomes pregnant. One particular day, Kunal goes out to deliver a pizza to a customer and returns to the restaurant in a state of shock while covered in blood; he is apparently injured, keeps constantly muttering Nikkis name, and seems to be worried about her. When his boss questions him, Kunal explains that he had been to deliver a pizza to a customer named Smitha ([[Dipannita Sharma]]) in a bungalow and recounts the events that happened at the bungalow. Smitha requests Kunal to wait downstairs while she goes upstairs to retrieve change. Almost immediately, there is power failure, which alarms Kunal. While waiting downstairs completely alone in the dark, Kunal hears a loud unidentifiable noise from the bedroom upstairs. Going up to investigate, he finds Smitha murdered suspiciously and notices one slice the pizza he had delivered to be missing, suggesting that there may be somebody else in the house. Horrified, Kunal makes a dash for the door only to realize that it has been locked from the outside. Further more when the murdered woman’s husband ([[Arunoday Singh]]) arrives, he at first believes he stumbles upon his wife having an affair. Through his cellphone Kunal communicates with him and explains his situation thoroughly instigating Mr. Ghost to aid him on how to get out of the house. Moreover, Mr. Ghost suddenly disappears from the front entrance, and is found by Kunal inside the house mysteriously murdered in the same room as his wife, with two slices of the pizza now missing. Also, Kunal encounters the couple's child "Anjali", identical to the name of the spirit allegedly possessing Mr. Kapoor's wife. Kunal tries everything he can to get out of the house including trying to break down the sealed doors leading outside, to using the house phone which happens to work even though the line is dead. Kunal manages to contact Nikki using the phone and gets her to contact to the local police to come and rescue him. The door bell rings, and Kunal finds Nikki outside. He sees the ghost couple behind Nikki and asks her to move, but is attacked by the ghosts. When a couple of policemen arrive at the bungalow, Kunal believes that Nikki had requested them to help him, but they reveal that four people had been killed in that house - Smitha, Mr. Ghost, their young daughter and a girl named Nikki, implying that she is Kunal's girl friend, Nikki. The police disclose that Kunal is a suspect regarding the murder case and attempt to arrest him. Confused and in tears, Kunal does not believe the policemen and attempts to escape the clutches of these police men in order to go in search of Nikki. While trying to escape, Kunal witnesses the police getting dragged into the house and being killed. At this juncture, Kunal, in a horrified state, runs back to the restaurant. While Kunal is not convinced that Nikki is dead, his friends at the restaurant and  Mr. Kapoor start realizing that they had never seen Nikki; they also observe that Kunal's home does not have any evidence that he lived with Nikki. Further, it is revealed that the haunted bungalow had witnessed the untimely deaths of a married couple, their daughter, and two policeman, whose ghosts Kunal had earlier interacted with. Meanwhile, Kunal seems to continue his search for Nikki, has constant health issues, and seems to be disturbed by ghosts and supernatural entities.

She decides to take few candies, when she notices the packet containing diamonds. Kunal and Nikki decide that stealing those diamonds would improve their life style and support their baby. So, they concoct a clever story in which Kunal convincingly "forgets" the Pizza bag at the "haunted" bungalow which Mr. Kapoor would never enter into, thanks to his fear of supernatural powers. Meanwhile, Nikki packs and plans to go somewhere away from that city and decide to settle abroad. Kunal says that before going away from there he wants to deliver the last pizza of his life and gets a phone call. Kunal, after the phone call, goes to deliver a pizza to a house and he encounters a series of events similar to the story he had narrated. Inside, he meets a little girl identical to the "Anjali" he had described in his story. Kunal is locked inside the home with "Anjali" curiously looking at him.

Plague (2014 film)
 Society breaks down after a virus causes the infected to turn into cannibalistic killers.  When Evie's husband John becomes separated from the rest of the group during an attack, the survivors fall back to their emergency shelter.  Gary and Evie want to wait for John, as they all agreed they would do in such a circumstance, but Bob becomes increasingly impatient.  Citing the realities of the situation, Bob says they must assume John is dead and leave for a more permanent shelter.  Although Bob backs down, he later takes the group's car, rifle, and supplies by force.  When Gary objects, Bob  shoots him in the head, killing him. Sammy, the group's mechanic, and Marge, Bob's wife, leave with him. They leave Evie behind.  John finally arrives. He is angered to find that Evie has 'allowed' the others to leave with all their supplies.  Evie's protestations are cut short when Sammy returns on foot, delirious and obviously infected.  John shoots her as she begins to transform.  John and Evie attempt to survive on their own but are besieged by zombies.  As John is about to commit suicide, a stranger named Charlie saves them.  John greets Charlie with suspicion and explains they have nothing he can steal.  When Charlie explains he wants nothing more than their companionship and offers to share his supplies, Evie welcomes him.  As the three come to trust each other, John explains that he is a former college professor and Evie is a schoolteacher.  Charlie introduces himself as a family man who has lost his family.  With Charlie's resourcefulness and skill, the survivors slowly increase their quality of life, though Evie remains bitter about John's previous suicide attempt.  When she accuses him of being self-obsessed, Charlie tells her that he can provide for her better than John.  Evie becomes uncomfortable, but Charlie pushes for a relationship.  John suffers a serious asthma attack, and Evie begs Charlie to find medicine.  Charlie insinuates that he knows where to find it, but he will only retrieve it if Evie submits to sex.  Desperate, she does.  As John and Charlie later talk, Evie searches through Charlie's belongings and finds evidence that he lied about having a family.  John initially dismisses her concerns and says that they need Charlie to survive.  They run him off when Charlie reveals that he keeps a former lover, who has since become infected, chained in his car to observe.

John bandages her, but she struggles to stay conscious.  Charlie's car breaks down near the extraction point.  Drawn by John's yelling to alert the military forces he assumes must be near, zombies begin to converge on their location.  John pushes for them to continue on foot, but Evie is unable.  After urging her to stand several times, John eventually gives up and hands her a pistol.

Pompeii (film)
 The film opens with scenes of plaster casts of the victims of [[Pompeii]] as quotes on the destruction are made.  In [[Britannia]], 62 AD, a tribe of [[Celts|Celtic]] horsemen are brutally wiped out by Romans led by Corvus ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]). The only survivor is a boy named Milo, whose mother was killed personally by Corvus. The boy is captured by slave traders. Seventeen years later, in [[Londinium]] in 79 A.D., a slave owner named Graecus ([[Joe Pingue]]) watches a class of [[gladiator]]s battle. He is unimpressed until he sees the grown Milo ([[Kit Harington]]), a talented gladiator the crowds call "the Celt". Milo is soon brought to Pompeii with his fellow slaves. On the road, they see a horse fall while drawing a carriage carrying Cassia ([[Emily Browning]]), returning after a year in [[Rome]], and her servant Ariadne ([[Jessica Lucas]]). Milo kills the horse to end its suffering and Cassia is drawn to him. Cassia is the daughter of the city governor Severus ([[Jared Harris]]) and his wife Aurelia ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]). Severus is hoping to have the new [[Titus|Emperor Titus]] invest in plans to rebuild Pompeii but Cassia warns him of Rome becoming more corrupt. A servant named Felix ([[Dalmar Abuzeid]]) takes Cassia’s horse Vires for a ride only to be swallowed up when a quake from [[Mount Vesuvius]] opens up the ground under him.  In Pompeii, Milo soon develops a rivalry with Atticus ([[Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje]]), a champion gladiator who, by Roman law, will be given his freedom after he earns one more victory. The gladiators are shown off at a party where Corvus, now a Senator, tells Severus the Emperor will not invest in his plans but he himself will. It is revealed Cassia left Rome to escape Corvus’s advances. When an earthquake causes some horses to become anxious, Milo helps calm one down. He then takes Cassia on a ride, telling her that they cannot be together. Returning to the villa, Corvus is ready to kill Milo (not recognizing him from the village massacre) but Cassia pleads for his life. Milo is lashed for his actions and Atticus admits respect for his rival as they prepare to face each other at the upcoming festival.  In the [[Amphitheatre of Pompeii]], to punish Milo, Corvus orders him killed in the first battle and wicked trainer Bellator (Currie Graham) convinces Graecus to sacrifice Atticus as well. The two men, and other gladiators, are chained to rocks as other gladiators come out as Roman soldiers, to recreate Corvus’s victory over the Celts. Working together, Milo and Atticus survive the battle; Atticus realizes the Romans will never honor his freedom. During the battle, Corvus forces Cassia to agree to marry him by threatening to have her family killed for supposed treason against the Emperor. When Milo and Atticus win, Cassia defies Corvus by holding a “thumbs-up” for them to live and he has her taken to the villa to be locked up. Claiming an earthquake is a sign from [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], Corvus has his officer Proculus ([[Sasha Roiz]]) fight Milo one-on-one. Their battle is interrupted when [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|Mount Vesuvius erupts]], creating massive tremors that cause the arena to collapse, sending Milo and Proculus crashing to the dungeons. Milo opens up the gates to allow his fellow gladiators a chance to attack; Proculus escapes while the gladiators kill Bellator. Seeing Corvus fallen under a collapsed beam, Severus tries to kill him, but Corvus stabs him and escapes.  The eruption quickly darkens the sky and causes flaming debris to rain down upon the city as the populace tries to flee to the harbor. One fireball destroys and sinks a ship, killing the escaping Graecus. Aurelia tells Milo that Cassia is at the villa before dying. Milo races to the villa and manages to save Cassia, but Ariadne is killed when the villa collapses into the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Corvus and Proculus kill civilians blocking their path to safety. Atticus tries to reach the harbor, but a [[tsunami]] created by the volcano smashes into the city, destroying the harbour and the outer walls and smashing several ships. In the ensuing chaos, Atticus saves a mother and her young daughter, the trio running safely into the inner city as a ship brought in by the tsunami blocks the water from flooding the inner walls. Reuniting with Atticus, Milo suggests searching the arena for horses to escape. As the gladiators face Roman soldiers at the arena, Cassia sees to the bodies of her parents, only to be abducted by Corvus. Atticus has Milo chase after the chariot carrying the two while he faces off against Proculus. In the following duel, Atticus is mortally wounded, but he manages to break the blade and uses it to stab Proculus in the neck.  Milo chases Corvus across the city, both barely avoiding fireballs and collapsing roads and buildings. Cassia manages to free herself with a splinter before the chariot crashes into the [[Temple of Apollo (Pompeii)|Temple of Apollo]]. Milo and Corvus duel as a [[lava bomb|fireball]] destroys the temple. Cassia chains Corvus to a building as Milo declares that [[Celtic deities|his gods]] are coming to punish the Senator. Milo and Cassia ride off as a [[pyroclastic surge]] races down the volcano's slopes and into the city, incinerating and killing Corvus. As the surge approaches the arena, Atticus proudly meets his fate and proclaims that he dies a free man before the surge consumes him. At the city outskirts, the horse throws off Milo and Cassia. Milo tells Cassia to leave alone, realising the horse isn't fast enough to carry them both. Instead, she sends the horse off, not wanting to spend her last moments running as she knows that they will not survive or outrun the surge. Milo kisses Cassia as the surge engulfs them. The last shot is of the duo's petrified bodies, locked in an eternal embrace.

As an adult she applied for a program called "Space Corp," which promised women the chance to go to space while providing astronauts with intimate [[R&R (military)|R&R]], but she was later disqualified because of a medical condition which had never before been revealed to her, but which greatly interested a man named Robertson.  Jane later bumped into a man who said he was waiting for someone. The two eventually fell in love with each other, but one day, the man disappeared. In time, Robertson approached Jane, revealing that Space Corp was really a part of the Temporal Agency, and this agency now wanted to recruit her. They broke off contact when it was discovered that Jane was pregnant with her ex-lover's baby. While performing a [[Caesarean section]], doctors discovered Jane was [[intersex]], with internalized male sex organs, as well as female sex organs. Complications during the birth forced them to remove her female sex organs, and as a result, she had to undergo a [[gender reassignment]] and begin living as a man. Furthermore, the baby was stolen by a mysterious man. Ever since, John has been living a bitter life, writing fiction as "The Unmarried Mother."  The agent offers to take John back in time to the day that Jane met the man who would later become her lover and leave her, so John can take revenge and kill the man for ruining his (Jane's) life. In return, John will take over the agent's job for whatever duration he wishes. The agent reveals his time-travel device, and the two jump to that day in 1963. John intends to kill his past lover prior to the moment when the lover first meets Jane. While waiting, John encounters Jane, and as they begin talking, John realizes that he is the man who later becomes Jane's lover. The baby born from this "self-fertilization" is stolen by the agent, who uses the time machine to take the baby to the orphanage, 18 years earlier in 1945. Therefore, Jane, John, and their baby are the same person, revealing a [[predestination paradox]].  The agent goes to 1975 New York, where he helps the burned man from the beginning of the film. The agent returns to 1963, a few months after he dropped John off. He convinces John that John must leave Jane behind, and he uses the machine to take them both to the Temporal Agency. John now takes over the agent's job, so the agent can retire in 1975 New York, close to the day of the Fizzle Bomber's attack. Upon arrival, the agent's time-travel device does not decommission itself as planned and can still be used. He has been ordered to check a launderette at the moment the Fizzle Bomber will be there. The Fizzle Bomber turns out to be the agent's own future self, now suffering from [[psychosis]] as a result of excessive time travel. The Fizzle Bomber insists that his actions have saved and will save more lives than the lives lost, and that they ultimately lead to the reinforcement of the Temporal Agency. He tries to convince the agent that the only way to end the cycle is for the agent to spare the bomber's life, unlike the Fizzle Bomber did in his past as the agent. The agent denies he will ever become the Fizzle Bomber and kills his future self.  The film finally reveals that in 1975, John is the man who travelled to New York and was burned while disarming a bomb. His subsequent facial reconstruction significantly changes his appearance, and it is now clear that Jane, John, the agent, and the Fizzle Bomber are the same person. This agent's creation was orchestrated by Robertson to create an agent who has no ties to time. This "perfect" temporal agent was responsible for both his own conception and death; he has driven the predestination paradox to its limit.  ===Timeline=== {| class="wikitable sortable" |- !

In an attempt to save a dreaded gangster named Ganguly ([[Sampath Raj]]), he loses his life and Ganguly is kidnapped by Baldev's allies Kundan ([[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]) and Rajeev ([[Penmatsa Subbaraju|Subbaraju]]). The Home Minister Jayavardhan ([[Mukesh Rishi]]) is concerned about Ganguly being apprehended. Upon hearing the news of Baldev's death, his mother loses consciousness and is admitted to the hospital. Jayavardhan promises to the people that he will apprehend Ganguly bhai and offers his resignation if he is not successful doing the same. The media and the people comment on how an honest man like Jayvardhand had a really bad brother. (At this point in the direction of the movie, the viewer is made to believe that Baldev Sahay is the brother of Jayavardhan).  Meanwhile, in Hyderabad, Tirupathi, a look-a-like of Baldev Sahay, is a happy-go-lucky guy whose sole aim in life is to become a police officer. He lives with his brother-in-law Animutyam ([[Brahmanandam]]) who is a circle inspector and every now and then, he steps into Animutyam's shoes to live his dream, albeit for a short period of time. To change his fortunes, he approaches Nirupama ([[Hansika Motwani]]) who claims to be a trader in gemstones relating to astrology, which can change a person's fortune but in reality she is just a con-woman. She gives him a ring which actually has no powers.  Tirupathi ends up helping his brother-in-law to apprehend a dangerous criminal. However, Animutyam takes all the credit at the press meet which Tirupathi also attends. Animutyam later reveals that he had rejected Tirupathi's application to the police academy and that he resents him. By chance, Jayavardhan notices Tirupathi on the news. Just when it looks like his dream will never come true, Tirupathi is approached by Jayavardhan to take the place of Baldev and pretends as a person with noble intentions to put Ganguly in Jail. Tirupathi accepts it and visits Kolkata. He is posted to [[Kalighat]] and impersonating as Baldev, frees Ganguly from Kundan and Rajeev. He takes Ganguly to Jayavardhan. Jayavardhan stabs Tirupathi, severely injuring him. Jayavardhan reveals to Tirupathi (and the audience) that Ganguly is his actual brother and not Baldev as he had made him believe. He leaves Tirupathi to his fate. Kundan and Rajeev later track him down and treat him. When he recovers, they narrate the story of Baldev to Tirupathi.  Kundan and Rajeev were appointed as Baldev's assistants by the commissioner of Anti-Corruption Bureau A. K. Mishra ([[Prakash Raj]]) to acquire proofs of Baldev's corruption. Baldev is always accompanied by Venkat ([[Brahmaji]]), a corrupt police officer along with Kundan and Rajeev everywhere he goes. He meets Ganguly and makes a deal with him for a huge ransom to handover Tiwari ([[Uttej]]), the only witness in the murder case of ACP Gautham ([[Adithya (actor)|Aditya Menon]]) and his family who were killed by Jayavardhan's brothers Ganguly and Chotu on the former's order. In the meantime, he falls in love with Vaishnavi ([[Regina Cassandra]]), a philanthropist who too reciprocates it later. To get the proofs of Baldev's corruption, Kundan and Rajeev conduct a raid on his house where Vaishnavi is also present, who is livid on Baldev for maligning the goodwill of Aasha Foundation managed by her. There Kundan and Rajeev find a flash drive with a list of many police officers whom they suspect of being involved with Baldev in his corruption scam. However, they are surprised that even they are on the same list.  Baldev's uncle then reveals the truth behind Baldev. Baldev's mother ([[Vinaya Prasad]]) wants to see him as a police officer and is admitted in a hospital for an important surgery. Baldev pays 1 million as fees for the surgery but at the selection, he is asked to pay a bribe of 1 million which is most common for all candidates according to the seniors. Baldev returns dejected but lies to his mother that he is selected to make her happy. Next morning, Baldev receives posting orders and he rushes to the hospital to show the same to his mother and uncle. But his mother is announced dead as she wished to forego the surgery to make Baldev a police officer. Baldev then vows to turn a corrupt police officer to pay the money on behalf of the honest candidates who are about to join police force without their knowledge because of which they would not resort to corruption, which was the reason for his mother's death. After this incident, Baldev and Vaishnavi get engaged.  Meanwhile, Baldev kills Chotu and arrests Ganguly for the murder case of ACP Gautham, with Tiwari serving as the chief witness. When he is about to present Ganguly and Tiwari in the high court, Venkat sells the evidence documents for a huge bribe along with the information regarding Tiwari and Baldev. Acting upon this information, Ganguly's goons kill Baldev's uncle and then proceed to attack Baldev and Tiwari at the court. However, Vaishnavi and Tiwari are killed in the hit while Baldev escapes. Baldev then retaliates and kidnaps Ganguly from Venkat's custody with the help of Kundan and Rajeev. In the process, he meets with a car accident at a hilly area and his car explodes, killing him.Tirupathi, now realising the truth, decides to set things right.  Jayavardhan, meanwhile, provides falsified evidence against the incumbent Chief Minister by claiming him to be the one who was backing Ganguly Bhai the whole time. After this incident, the Chief Minister is forced to step down and subsequently is arrested. Jayavardhan then gives his nomination for the post. Meanwhile, Ganguly Bhai despite being imprisoned starts operating his crime regime from within.  Tirupathi rejoins the force and goes to Jayavardhan's house and makes a deal with him so as to keep his post provided that he, Tirupathi, turns a blind eye to all the activities of Ganguly bhai. Tirupathi then becomes close to Jayavardhan's PA (Posani Murali Krishna) who gets agitated after he is insulted by Jayavardhan at a particular incident. Tirupathi introduces him to Nirupama and gets her to give him a ring to change his fortunes. However, it is, in fact, a camera embedded inside the fake gemstone with a microchip to capture audio. With the help of this ring, Tirupathi exposes Jayavardhan's corruption and evil designs to the media.  Jayavardhan gets cornered and runs away "underground" along with his brother. In the process he kidnaps Nirupama, Rajeev, Kundan and Animutyam's Family. Meanwhile, A K Mishra, who has been following up this case with close interest unearths the fact that Baldev and Tirupathi are one and the same. Right before the car explosion, Baldev, is thrown off the car and falls onto a freight carrier, rendering him unconscious. The truck carries him to Hyderabad and he is taken to the hospital. Animutyam is given the case. Animutyam's wife had lost her brother, named Tirupathi, long back in her childhood and has been searching for him ever since. Animutyam, realizing that the person in front of him is suffering from amnesia, decides to pass him off as his wife's brother to keep her happy but mainly to ensure that he wouldn't have to spend huge amounts of money for her search. Mishra reveals this fact to Jayavardhan and Ganguly and warns them that if Tirupathi comes to know of the truth, then they shall be even more sorrier than they are now. Tirupathi crashes into the strong hold of Ganguly Bhai and kills him and arrests Jayavardhan.  Kundan, Rajeev and everyone else decide not to reveal the truth to Tirupathi/Baldev and thus spare him the anguish over his uncle's and fiancé's death. Tirupathi later marries Nirupama and lives happily ever after in Kolkata while still posing as Baldev Sahay.

Prelude to Axanar
 The film is presented as an episode of a [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] documentary pertaining to the Four Years War with the [[Klingon|Klingon Empire]], narrated by noted historian John Gill (who appeared in "[[Patterns of Force (Star Trek)|Patterns of Force]]") and featuring interviews of actual participants on both sides. It begins on [[Stardate]] 2241.03, two decades before ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'', with the war's opening battle at Arcanis IV, a prosperous Federation colony along the Klingon border. The Klingons, who did not consider the Federation to be a worthy adversary, maintained the initiative for the first six months of the war, with a number of victories under the leadership of their supreme commander, Kharn. The [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] diplomatic delegation under Ambassador [[List of minor recurring characters in Star Trek: Enterprise#Soval|Soval]] (who appeared on ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]''), overseeing negotiations with the Klingons, are left with little room to maneuver.  In response to the losses suffered in the war, Starfleet appoints a new Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Marcus Ramirez, who pledges in a fleet-wide broadcast to defend "the dream of the Federation" against the Klingons' commitment to its destruction. Ramirez oversees the creation of the ''Ares''-class cruisers, Starfleet's first warships, to counter the Klingons' mainstay, the D6 battlecruiser. The introduction of the ''Ares'' turns the tide against the Klingons, who begin to give Starfleet its due as a worthy opponent, and particularly take notice of Garth of Izar (who appeared in "[[Whom Gods Destroy (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Whom Gods Destroy]]"), the captain of the prototype USS ''Ares''.  To counter the ''Ares'' cruisers, the Klingons order the construction of a newer and more advanced battlecruiser, the [[Klingon starships#D7-class|D7]], that would restore the Klingons' technical and military advantage. In response, Starfleet begins developing their own next-generation heavy cruiser, the [[List of Starfleet starships ordered by class#Constitution class|''Constitution''-class]], but construction falls behind schedule. To gain more time to finish their new heavy cruiser, Starfleet approves a plan proposed by Garth to fight the Klingons at Axanar, the planet where Kharn's spies have reported the ''Constitution'' prototypes (revealed to be the ''Constitution'' and the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|''Enterprise'']]) are being built. The film ends on Stardate 2245.1, just before the battle at Axanar, when the first three D7s enter the war.

She reluctantly tells Paul that Beth has dropped out of college and fallen in with local drug dealers. Paul offers to pay Angela $500 to take him to New Orleans, Beth's last known location, and identify her dealer, Eddie.  When Angela points out one of Eddie's friends, Paul demands Eddie's location. The man refuses and attacks Paul, knocking him to the ground. Paul viciously beats the man and his two friends. Although disturbed by the show of violence, Angela helps Paul set up a meeting with Eddie through a cell phone that they take from his friend. At a club, Eddie denies any knowledge of Beth and ignores Paul's threats until his uncle, who witnessed Paul kill seven armed men twenty years ago, convinces Eddie to talk. Eddie says that Beth has moved on to harder drugs than he supplies and lives with a local drug kingpin known as The Pharmacy. Paul pays Angela the $500 he promised her and tells her to return home, but she refuses, as she wants to know what has happened to her friend.  Paul reluctantly accepts her continued help.  Two thugs trail Paul and attempt to force his car off the road. Paul instead causes them to crash, and he interrogates the passenger, who reveals that he works for local crime-boss Omar.

Paul tells her that he used to be a mob hit man for Omar, but the escalating violence caused him to question his loyalty. In a botched attempt to kill Omar, he accidentally killed Omar's wife and daughter instead. Now, Omar desires revenge, and Paul knows that Omar will stop at nothing to use his daughter to get to him. Paul makes arrangements with an old friend and former partner, Sam, to keep Angela safe while he recovers weaponry stashed with an old contact and confronts The Pharmacy.  The Pharmacy reveals that Omar has paid him to detain both Paul and Beth. Paul disarms one of the thugs, kills everyone in the room but Beth, and shoots his way to safety. Back at Sam's penthouse suite, the two reminisce about their exploits while waiting for an assault from Omar. Omar's men capture Beth, and Paul leaves to rescue her. At Omar's business, Paul defeats several waves of henchmen before facing Omar himself. Omar demands to know why Paul murdered his family and threatens to kill Beth in retaliation. Paul says that they were simply collateral damage and offers to let Omar live if he gives up Beth. Mark, Omar's bodyguard and adviser, engages Paul in hand-to-hand combat; the two seem evenly matched, but Paul finds a gun and kills Mark. Beth elbows Omar in the ribs and escapes from his grasp, freeing her father to take a shot and kill Omar. Beth and her father are reunited again.

Pride (2014 film)
  Based on a true story, the film depicts a group of [[lesbian]] and [[gay]] activists who raised money to help families affected by the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|British miners' strike]] in 1984, at the outset of what would become the [[Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners]] campaign.<ref name="indiewire"></ref> The alliance was unlike any seen before and was ultimately successful.<ref name="indiewire" />  Gay activist [[Mark Ashton]] watches the news about the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|miners' strike]], before setting off to join the [[Pride London|Gay Pride Parade in London]]. Joe Cooper, a 20-year-old student from [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]] who is exploring his own homosexuality, goes off to watch the Gay Pride Parade, but before he knows it, he is involved with the small group of Gay and Lesbian activists led by Mark. The group plan their protests and actions from [[Gay's the Word (bookshop)|Gay's the Word]], a bookstore, run by gay couple Gethin and Jonathan. Mark explains that the gay community is not harassed as much by the police the last days, because the police have found a new target: every day, the miners clash with the police violently, and many miners are arrested and beaten up. And just like the gay community, they are treated with hostility from the public and the government, and the subject of a smear campaign by the tabloid newspapers. Mark announces the forming of the "[[Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners]]" to help raise money. Many activists however refuse to join because of past experiences with discrimination and aggression from miners against the gay community. The LGSM thus consists of "six gays and a dyke" who start raising money immediately; Joe will be their official photographer. Their actions prove a success.   The [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] however is reluctant to accept the group's support due to the union's public relations' worries about being openly associated with a gay group. Frustrated by the lack of response, the activists instead decide to take their donations directly to a mining village. Gethin explains most mining villages are in Wales, so with a map in hand they pick a random village. They call the community centre in [[Onllwyn]], a small mining village in [[Wales]], and to their excitement, the support group there accepts the donation of the LGSM. Dai Donovan, spokesperson for the miners in Onllwyn, comes to London to meet their new allies, only to discover that "L" does not stand for London and LGSM is a gay and lesbian group. He admits he has never met gay people before, to which Mark responds that he has never met a miner before. Dai quickly realizes the importance of an alliance between the two communities. When announced to give a speech to thank the gay community for their support, the gay and lesbian crowd is at first sceptical and even hostile. However, with his eloquent speech he wins the hearts and minds of the crowd.   In Onllwyn, [[Siân James (politician)|Siân James]] is starting as a volunteer at the community centre. She overhears the Women's Support Group debating whether to invite LGSM to their village. Despite her husband Martin urging her not to stand out too much on her first day, she speaks out to invite the LGSM, which leads to her becoming a member of the Women's Support Group. It is soon clear that some are unwilling to let the gays come over. The anti-gay sentiments are centred around Maureen Barry, who vehemently opposes the gay and lesbian support from the start, inciting her two sons to protest against them coming to Onllwyn. When the LGSM arrive in Onllwyn, they are met by a silent and hostile crowd; Mark's clumsy speech worsens the situation (at one point he says that "when one in five people is gay, so is one in five miners, so at least one in five of you is happy to see us", which leads to villagers walking out immediately). The next day, the LGSM is taken on a sightseeing tour around the countryside by Siân and Cliff Barry. In the distance, they see police cars, which means the miners are again arrested, a form of harassment by the police against the miners. Jonathan explains to Siân that the police are acting unlawfully, and that they cannot arrest the miners without evidence. Siân barges into the police office to demand the miners, among other her husband, be released immediately. Back in the community centre, the miners are celebrating their release. When explained that they owe their quick release to the gays and lesbians, most miners now regard the LGSM as allies. That evening in the community centre, the gays and lesbians in turn see the sense of community among the villagers, letting go of their own prejudice about the miners. Spontaneously, Mark announces that the LGSM will organize something spectacular to collect even more money and make the government meet the demands of the miners, although he has no idea as yet.  Maureen Barry, bitter about the miners and support groups embracing the gays and lesbians, contacts a tabloid about the LGSM. The next day, the miners from Onllwyn are greeted by police and fellow miners with cat calls and comments, and read the front page article. The National Union of Miners urges the Onllwyn support group to sever ties with the LGSM. A meeting will be arranged on whether the support of the LGSM should be accepted or not. Mark and the group see their chance: being called 'perverts' in the tabloid, they decide to adopt the term for themselves, and instead use it for the grand idea. A music festival, with the title "Pits and Perverts", will be organized in the [[Electric Ballroom]] in [[Camden Town]]. At first no record label is willing to have their artists play at their festival (at one office, after being told that "the label does not have gay artists", Mark writes the phone number of the [[Switchboard (UK)|Gay and Lesbian Support Hotline]] under the pictures of two artists, "in case someone might need it in the future"; the pictures feature prominent gay artists [[Elton John]] and [[Soft Cell]]). In the end, [[Bronski Beat]] announces it will perform at the festival. Members of the Men's and Women's Support Groups from Onllwyn and other villagers that are interested are coming over to London. The festival is a huge success. Afterwards, the villagers are taken on a tour along the bars and discos of London, which results in the villagers and the gays and lesbians becoming even closer friends.   The next day they hurry back to be in time for the meeting. Upon arrival, they discover the meeting was rescheduled to 12:00 PM instead of 3:00 PM, resulting in the decision to sever ties with the LGSM. Cliff and Martin, lacking the eloquence of Dai, were not able to stand up to the others, let alone have the meeting cancelled. Siân and the other women confront Maureen, who tells that the LGSM is only supporting them to push forward their own agenda on gay rights. Siân then empties the bag of money on the table, showing the thousands of pounds raised at the festival. Disillusioned, the LGSM and villagers part and go home. From the money, the Women's Support Group buy a new red van to transport the miners to the protest rallies. The red van has prominently displayed on the side that it was donated by the LGSM.   In March 1985, the Miners' Strike is over. The miners of Onllwyn gather to go back into the mines. Joe visits the village to see them go off to work. He sees Mark, who has alienated himself from the LGSM during a personal crisis of fear over his HIV status. Mark confronts Joe about him hiding his activism and homosexuality from his parents. When Siân drives Joe home in the red van, his family has just gathered to celebrate the christening of his nephew. Joe's mother panics upon seeing the van and demands Siân move it from their property. Joe confronts his parents and leaves them, finally choosing for himself.  At the 1985 Gay Pride Parade, the LGSM and the Lesbians Against Pit Closures are asked to walk in the back of the line with the other fringe groups, because the organisers want to keep out any political signs. The LGSM is disappointed at first, until the red van arrives, with several of the villagers, to show their support in turn. The organisers of the parade announce that they will now have to walk in front of the parade because they are with too many people: hundreds of miners, led by the National Union of Mineworkers, arrive to show their solidarity. In the closing scenes, the comment says that the miners led the Gay Pride Parade. In 1986, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] incorporated rights for gays and lesbians in their party programme, due to pressure from the National Union of Mineworkers.   While the film focuses primarily on LGSM, there are several smaller plot threads:  * One is devoted to the women-only splinter group [[Lesbians Against Pit Closures]].  * The growing awareness about HIV and AIDS is another thread, with Mark being confronted with an ex-lover being infected and dying, whilst he himself distancing himself from the others because he suspects he is infected as well. Jonathan explains later to Siân that he is the second person diagnosed with HIV in the UK and the impact HIV and AIDS have on the gay community. * Joe's growing involvement in the activist group and his [[coming out]], resulting in him leaving home and breaking ties with his parents and family. * The [[LGBT rights in the United Kingdom#An equal age of consent|inequality in age of consent]], exemplified by Joe. * Gwen, the elderly woman who becomes good friends with the lesbian members of LGSM. * Siân becoming more aware of her own talents, and realizing with the help of Jonathan that she can be more than just a mother and housewife. * Gethin reconciling with his Welsh background and his mother, who he has not seen in 16 years because she could not accept his homosexuality. * Hostility towards the gay community: [[Gay's the Word (bookshop)|Gay's the Word]] is targeted by vandalism several times, Maureen and her sons oppose the acceptance of the LGSM by the Support Group, and Gethin is beaten up and taken into hospital.

Private Number (2014 film)
 Michael Lane, a moderately successful author, experiences writer's block while working on his second novel.  A recovering alcoholic, he credits his wife, Katherine, with saving him from losing everything.  He is tempted to return to drinking when the stressors in his life pile on: he does not get along with his next-door neighbor, Mitch; Katherine wants a baby; he has been subject to a series of prank calls; and he is under pressure by everyone to complete his novel.  He confides to his [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] sponsor, Jeff, that he has recently begun experiencing hallucinations again despite his lack of drinking.  Jeff, a psychologist, suggests that the stress in his life may be to blame.  The prank calls continue to wake Michael and Katherine at night, and when an apparent intruder trips their alarm, they contact the police.  Sheriff Stance, who dislikes Michael, dismisses their concerns and insinuates that Michael has begun drinking again.  As pressures on Michael continue to mount, the main character of his previous novel, an English knight, taunts him, and he experiences grisly hallucinations of murdered people.  Michael becomes increasingly tempted to return to his drinking, egged on by the knight.  He only stops himself by looking at a picture of his wife and remembering a pledge to stay sober.  When friends Mary and Bill are over at their house, their son Mason discovers the Lanes' voicemail and plays back the messages left by the crank callers, who repeated the question, "Remember me?"  When Mason refuses to stop playing the messages, Michael strikes him and becomes entranced by the voicemail, from which he claims to hear secret messages when played in reverse.  When Bill and Mary confront him, he initially ignores them while translating the messages, then beats up Bill.  Distressed, Katherine tells him to seek professional help.  After seeing further hallucinations that night, Michael finally drinks an entire bottle of whiskey.  When Katherine finds out, she tells him that she is leaving him.  Michael insists that they are being haunted and that he needs her help.  As Katherine is about to leave, Detective Taylor stops her and jokes that his research into their crank calls has led him to believe they may be of paranormal origin.  Suddenly realizing that Michael may be right, Katherine returns to him, and they research a local unsolved case that involves a serial killer.  Taylor confirms that the names Michael has heard on his voice mail are the killer's victims but cannot help any further, as Sheriff Stance has sealed the case's records and warned him to back off.  Michael hires a local computer repairman to hack into the police records, where he discovers the serial killer uses a different standardized psychological M.O. in each killing.  The sixth and final M.O. has yet to be used, and Michael becomes convinced that the victims' ghosts want him to stop the killer before he strikes again.  The crank calls from the ghosts continue unabated, and Katherine becomes mysteriously ill.  Frustrated, Michael shouts at the ghosts and demands to know who killed them.  Voices from his phone stun Michael as they tell him he did.  Michael initially denies it but experiences a series of flashbacks, where he remembers murdering the victims and planning Katherine's murder.  Before he could finish his plan, he suffered head trauma when one of his victims fought back.  He stumbled out of her house with her manuscript, and, because of his amnesia, assumed that he had written it.  As the memories come back to him, he returns to his previous killer personality and attempts to murder Katherine; the knight once again encourages him.  As she hides from him, the police arrive and take him prisoner.  During the subsequent interrogation, Sheriff Stance threatens to kill Michael.  When Stance backs down, Michael laughs, calls him weak, and says he has only just begun.

The Prophet (2014 film)
  Set in [[Lebanon]] during the [[Ottoman Empire]], Kamila, a widowed mother, works as the housekeeper for Mustafa, a foreign poet, painter, and political activist being held under house arrest. Mustafa is guarded by the soldier Halim, who has a secret crush on Kamila. Kamila's daughter, Almitra, has stopped talking due to her father's death, and has become a troublemaker who frequently steals from local merchants. Almitra has [[seagulls]] for her only friends; she even seems able to talk to them by making birdlike noises. Halim's pompous Sergeant arrives to tell Mustafa that he is now free, but he must board a ship to his home country by day's end. The Sergeant escorts Mustafa to the ship, and Mustafa spends the time conversing with Kamila, Almitra and Halim, as well as with the townspeople, who regard him as a hero. Mustafa's conversations, range in topics from freedom, parenthood, and marriage, to working, eating, love, and good & evil are animated by the movie's many directors in their own unique styles.  Once everyone reaches the ship, the army imprisons Mustafa in a fortress instead of allowing him to board. The commanding officer labels Mustafa's writings as [[Sedition|seditious]], and demands that he retract his statements. Mustafa refuses, asserting that his writings are not seditious. Thus, the commanding officer sentences Mustafa to death by firing squad the next morning unless he disavows his writings. That evening, Kamila, Almitra and Halim try to help Mustafa escape. Almitra sees Mustafa through his prison cell window, and talks for the first time since her father's death. Mustafa refuses to try to escape, giving his final animated poem, this time on the topic of death. But he asks his friends to return to the house and rescue all his paintings and writings before the army can destroy them. The next day, Mustafa again refuses to renounce his writings as he is being led to the firing squad in the fortress's open yard. A large flock of seagulls surround him as he is being placed in position. Over at the house, Kamila and Almitra save all of Mustafa's writings and drawings right before the army arrives, and they hide in the woods. Then suddenly they hear loud gunfire and see the flock of seagulls fly out of the fortress. But Almitra insists that Mustafa is all right. As she sees the flock circle around the now departing ship, Almitra sees Mustafa's spirit aboard the ship sailing for home.  
The Purge: Anarchy
 On March 21, 2023, the media credits the annual Purge, a 12-hour period wherein all crimes are legal without authorities intervening, as an economic success. Everywhere, people prepare to either barricade themselves indoors or commit acts of violence. The nation's impoverished population is no longer seen as people, but as living garbage, whom the wealthy denounce as only living to serve their needs. However, before the sixth annual purge begins, a successful anti-purge [[Resistance movement|resistance group]] led by Carmelo Johns and his partner, the Stranger from the [[The Purge|first film]] – revealed as "Dwayne" – hijack government feeds to denounce the New Founding Fathers and their actions.  In [[Los Angeles]], working-class [[waitress]] Eva Sanchez returns home to her 17-year-old daughter Cali and terminally ill father Rico, who also despises the New Founding Fathers. As Eva and Cali prepare to barricade themselves into their apartment, Rico retires to his room to be alone as the Purge starts. As the Purge alarm sounds, Rico slips out to a waiting [[limousine]], leaving a note for his family revealing that he has sold himself as a Purge offering in exchange for $100,000 to be paid to Eva and Cali after the Purge. Eva and Cali are distraught by this situation.   Married couple Shane and Liz visit a grocery store, only to be ambushed by a masked gang of bikers. As they drive away to avoid them, their car breaks down, as the biker gang had cut their fuel line. Meanwhile, an off-duty [[Los Angeles Police Department]] sergeant, Leo Barnes, plots to kill Warren Grass, a man who had inadvertently run down and killed his son while [[Driving under the influence|driving drunk]] not during the Purge, and was acquitted on legal technicalities. Barnes drives out into the streets with an armored car and several weapons, posing as a [[vigilante]].  As Shane and Liz try to find safer hiding places, the purge commences. Eva and Cali are attacked by their lustful [[Building superintendent|superintendent]] Diego, who felt insulted in the past by Eva, but he is gunned down by a paramilitary platoon, which captures the women to offer them to their leader Big Daddy for his own personal purge. Leo passes by the scene and rescues them after killing the troops and wounding Big Daddy. They find Shane and Liz hiding in Leo's car. The group flees just as Big Daddy fires at them, damaging the vehicle. After Leo's car breaks down, the group flees on foot, and Eva promises Leo a new car from her co-worker, Tanya, in exchange for Leo’s protection. As they navigate the hostile streets, they find evidence that the anti-Purge group has been gaining the upper hand against the Purgers, discovering a paramilitary van surrounded by soldiers who were shot to death by the resistance fighters. After freeing Shane from a trap and taking guns from the abandoned truck, they head to the subways. There, a [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnic]] Purging gang invades the subways and sets hiding people on fire, causing chaos. Shane is wounded, but the group manages to escape after he and Liz destroy the gang's [[all-terrain vehicle]] and its [[propane]] tank with the salvaged [[submachine guns]], killing the entire gang.  After running for their lives, Eva unknowingly signals a [[traffic camera]] to identify them to the paramilitary troops who pick up the location of Tanya's apartment building. The group reaches Tanya's house, but learns no car is there. Tanya's family takes them in, offering dinner and medicine. However, Tanya's sister Lorraine proceeds to murder her sister for sleeping with her husband. The group leaves the family to their fate, only to be captured by the masked gang who ambushed Shane and Liz earlier. This gang reveals that they had no intention to kill the group and are selling them off to an auction, taking them to a theater where upper-class Purgers bid them for [[human hunting]]. After the group is forced into the arena, Leo subdues and kills a Purger, taking his weapon and [[night vision device|night-vision glasses]], using the devices to overpower and kill several other attackers, providing their arms to Shane and the others before the head Purger, Janice, calls in security to suppress the uprising; Shane is shot and killed by security forces. As Liz mourns Shane’s death, the anti-Purge group attacks the compound, killing the security forces and remaining Purgers; Liz chooses to stay with the resistance fighters to retaliate against Shane's murderers, while Leo, Eva and Cali leave; Leo [[carjacking|carjacks]] Janice, holding her at gunpoint and threatening her before leaving in her car.  Leo, Eva, and Cali drive up to a suburban neighborhood, and stop at the home of Warren Grass. Leo reveals that Warren killed his son while driving drunk exactly one year earlier, but got off on a technicality (possibly because it occurred during the purge). After telling his story, he ventures into the house, threatening Warren and his wife. Later, Leo exits the house covered in blood, only to be shot by Big Daddy, who reveals that the New Founding Fathers have secretly dispatched [[death squad]]s to increase the body count because the purge eliminates too few of the lower class, possibly due to purgers murdering those they have personal grudges against and not just random people. Just as he is about to kill Leo, Warren appears and kills Big Daddy with a point-blank headshot, revealing that Leo chose to forgive and spare him. As Big Daddy's death squad appears, sirens blare to signal the end of the purge (making Big Daddy's death legal and sparing Leo). Warren drives Eva, Cali, and Leo to the hospital as news and police helicopters fly over the city.

Punjab 1984
 The film starts with a scene on 4 June 1984, during [[Operation Blue Star]]. A group of pilgrims are locked inside a room in the parkarma, mostly elderly, women, and children, who are dying of dehydration and hunger due to the Army refusing the evacuation of Pilgrims from the Golden Temple Complex. The pilgrims are finally able to open the door locking them in. One of the women in the room, a mother of a newborn who hasn't eaten or drunk in two days, proceeds to go under fire to bring water for the pilgrims from the sarovar. However, one of the elderly pilgrims, Bachan Singh Maan, stops the mother and volunteers to bring water for her child. When he comes out of the room as the firing stops, just when he dips in the sarovar, Indian Army machine gunners kill him.  The story flash forwards to September 1986, where Satwant Kaur ([[Kirron Kher]]) is living alone and spends her days sitting outside the area police station. Satwant Kaur now feeds poor children and her son's Hindu best friend Bittu. It's revealed that Satwant's son, Shiva went to work in the field one year ago and never came back. To cope with the loss, Satwant treats Bittu as her son, much to the jealousy and anger of his Hindu parents. Bittu moves on to take Satwant Kaur to a Human Rights Lawyer who is known to have found many boys who were kidnapped by the [[Punjab Police (India)|Punjab Police]] and keeps a record of the boys who were killed in [[fake encounters]].  The story then flashes back to 1984, a day before [[Operation Blue Star]]. Shivjeet, or Shiva ([[Diljit Dosanjh]]), is a college going young adult who is an avid fan of [[Kuldeep Manak]] and loves Jeeti ([[Sonam Bajwa]]) his classmate. Jeeti also reciprocates his feelings. Shiva is having a land feud with his corrupt and drug-addicted cousin Jaggi, who is best friends with the village Inspector Deep Singh Rana. In enters Inspector Deep Singh Rana ([[Pavan Malhotra]]), a sadistic, apathetic, police officer who kills innocent Sikhs and Hindus for rank promotions and under orders from the Central Government. While facing Jaggi and Rana, Shiva guarantees that none of them can plough his land while he's still alive. At home, Shiva has an argument with his dad because his dad is a law-abiding and court-going man while Shiva believes that none other than the almighty guarantees his rights. Satwant Kaur reveals to Shiva of her knowledge of his secretive dating of Jeeti. In the morning, Bachan Singh leaves for Amritsar.  When Shiva, Bittu, and Satwant wake up in the morning, they find out that all of Punjab is under Military Rule and that there is an indefinite Curfew upon the entire state. There is an entire media blackout, with the only news coming from the Military Radio Channel, which is only referring to [[Operation Blue Star]] as a minor incident occurring in Amritsar. The entire state is at a standstill while everyone is listening to the Radio updates on the situation in Amritsar. Meanwhile, Bachan Singh is trapped in the Darbar Sahib complex. Against Army orders, the village gurdwara announces that in reality, the Army has invaded Darbar Sahib with tanks and gunner helicopters and the entire city of Amritsar is being shelled. Bittu and Shiva then proceed to sneak their way to Amritsar on their tractor to try to find out whats happening. They encounter an Army blockade on the road to Amritsar, where countless people are pushing against the barricade to make their way to Amritsar, just as Shiv and Bittu are. In the entire situation, Shiv is rifle-butted by soldiers and countless protesters have been killed.  After the Operation, Bittu, Satwant, and Shiva go to the Emergency Police Station, to try to find out the whereabouts of Bachan Singh. The police officers treat them badly as it's found out that the government declared Bachan Singh a terrorist who took up arms against the state and executed him. The next person in the line of people at the Police Station, whose brother was also at the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]], was meanwhile declared a peaceful pilgrim killed in "cross fire." When Bittu asks for Bachan's remains, the Police say that the Army already incinerated all evidence of the "terrorists."  Shiva has now left college, doesn't use his radio any more due to the broadcast of Operation Blue Star coming on it, and spends his days working and mourning on the farm to cope with the loss of his father. To help cheer Shiva up, his mother places the radio in the courtyard and talks about selling it. The reverse-psychology works and Shiv starts playing Kuldip Manak songs loudly on the radio while going to the fields. While working in the fields, Rana shows up and changes Shiv's radio's channel to the News, which is informing of a "terrorist" attack in [[Tarn Taran Sahib|Tarn Taran]], with the police looking for the culprits. Shiv's mute friend immediately runs to Satwant Kaur's house, where she doesn't understand what he's trying to say until the boy makes the sound of a "kutti," referring to the stopper on a "Halt" Well system, meaning one thing: Shiv's in trouble.  The story flashes back to 1986, where the Human Rights Lawyer asks Satwant to check the record of the youth killed in fake encounters. Fortunately, Shivjeet is not in the album or list of those killed. Satwant and Bittu then go to the local politician Darshan Singh Poonpuri, a peace loving separatist, who vows to help them find Shiv.  When Bittu comes Home, his parents scold him for staying out and helping someone else's parent's instead of his own. His parents also accuse him of helping out a "terrorists" mother in a time where Hindus are being targeted. Bittu replies that it is going just as bad for the Sikhs as it is for the Hindus. Jeeti's aunt and uncle attempt to convince her to marry someone else, since it isn't sure if Shiva is alive or not.  When Satwant Kaur goes to the Police Station as she does daily, a news reporter from a prominent news outlet tries to interview and record her story. However, the stationed police officers find out from their superiors that the Human Rights organisation has found out about Shivjeet and has taken the case to the central government. Rana comes outside and beats the journalist brutally and shamelessly beat the elderly Satwant Kaur to near unconsciousness.  One of the police officers working for Rana, also known for haven killing many innocents, secretly comes to Satwant Kaur's home to reveal to her what really happened to Shiva: Shiva was picked up and beaten to unconsciousness while being "interrogated" for "terrorism." Later, Rana and the police officer who has come to Satwant tried to kill Shiva and 4 other youth in a fake encounter, successfully killing two. Shiva refused to run in front of the Police and was able to overpower Rana and escape with Taari ([[Rana Ranbir]]) and Pinda. When the Police Officer tries to leave, Satwant Kaur requests that he eat at her house, returning the favour that he did upon her and so that when her son is ever in a condition like this, someone may feed him too. The Cop leaves in shame after realising what his actions have been and while leaving, tells Satwant Kaur where Pinda might be.  When Bittu and Satwant Kaur go to the police station where Pinda might be, the police inspector tells them that he never heard of said lad. Bittu and Satwant Kaur then proceed to Pinda's house, whose family tell them that they haven't seen Pinda in a year themselves. While leaving, Satwant requests Pinda's family that if Pinda ever comes by, do ask him about Shivjeet. Right before they leave the gate, Pinda's mother stops them and reveals that they were lying; In fact, Pinda was tortured by the Police when he was captured after his escape and was crippled. He is currently living in hiding in their house, after his parents bribed the Inspector that Satwant talked to earlier. Pinda immediately recognises Satwant as Shiv's mother, since Shiv always talked about her. Pinda begins to talk about what happened.  One year ago, after escaping the police, Shiv, Taari, and Pinda went into hiding on Taari's relatives farm and began telling each other how they all came into police custody.  Taari was a Separatist poet and journalist for a couple of Print Magazines and News Papers. Taari was friends with Rebel Sukhdev Singh Sarhali ([[Manav Vij]]), due to which Taari was arrested under [[Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act|TADA]]. However, the real reason Taari was arrested was so that he couldn't write more Revolutionary Poetry. The Police subsequently crippled his writing hand. Shivjeet then recalls that he recited Taari's poems in college for multiple school projects.  Pinda was a college going young adult who beat up a man who was [[Eve teasing|eves teasing]] his girlfriend. The man he beat up turned out to be the son of a Police Inspector, who arrested Pinda. When Pinda was given a chance to apologise and spare himself, the police ordered him to get a [[rakhri]] tied on his wrist by his girlfriend, accepting each other as brother and sister.

The Pyramid (film)
 During the 2012–13 uprisings in Egypt, an archaeological team discovers a vast pyramid buried  below the surface. Further examinations of the pyramid's apex reveals that the structure is three-sided, unlike any pyramid previously discovered. They locate a tunnel leading into the apex of the pyramid. While breaking into the opening, a large amount of toxic air is released, poisoning a worker. Soon after, Egyptian authorities order the team to leave the site because of a violent uprising in nearby Cairo. Team leader Dr. Miles Holden (O'Hare) and his daughter Nora argue over whether to obey the order. They eventually agree to send in a NASA-supplied remote-controlled [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] vehicle – nicknamed Shorty – to enter the pyramid and document its interior.  While examining a small portion of the structure, Shorty is attacked by an unknown creature and goes offline. After a heated argument between Dr. Holden and Zahir (Amir K), the portion of the team that has remained at the site decide to enter the pyramid to recover Shorty. After finding only a piece of the rover, they discover the wire tracing their way back out was cut. Realizing they may be lost, they enter a room with an unstable floor that collapses beneath them. The team scramble to their feet and look around them. As they begin to become heated with one another, a sudden fall of debris injures team member Zahir, as it crushes his leg beneath a large stone chunk that is unmovable. Sunni (Nicola), another team member reporting on the find, attempts to climb up a long narrow opening but is attacked by a terrifying creature hidden at the top and falls back down. Nora notices scratches as if from claws across Sunni's cheek. Forced to leave Zahir behind, they look for another way out. Within moments, they hear Zahir's screams and return to find only a bloody trail leading up the wall, where he'd apparently been dragged off; his severed leg left pinned under the rock. His girlfriend Nora is left bewildered and distraught, and the team begins to lose hope of escape.  They are pursued through a narrow tunnel they attempt to escape through by a pack of the same creatures Sunni encountered before, which have an emaciated feral cat-like appearance. An Egyptian soldier, Shadid, who had found another way into the pyramid rescues them in time, pulling them out of the tunnel. After shooting a few of the creatures, he peers into the tunnel and is suddenly seized by a larger creature and pulled inside, snapping his back in the process (due to the small opening of the shaft he was pulled back through). Left to fend for themselves, the team soon comes upon a carved mural that depicts passages from the [[Book of the Dead]] and its guide to immortality – Anubis's weighing of the heart for access into the afterlife. A few jump-scares later, Dr. Holden accidentally triggers a sand trap and most of the team manage to escape. However, Sunni (during the chaos) is bumped from behind by the cameraman Fitzie (Buckley) and falls into a spike pit, impaling herself through her chest lower abdomen and leg. She is immediately pounced upon and torn to pieces by some of the feral cats. Dr. Holden throws a lit flare into the pit which scares away the cats, and the team lower themselves down. While racing against the dwindling light of the flare, the crew attempt to help Sunni. Unfortunately, they are not quick enough, and as they try to pull Sunni off the spikes, she suffers from a seizure and damages her internal organs. Sunni succumbs to her injuries and the team is forced to retreat by the return of the cats.  Forced to keep moving, the team finds a burial chamber which contains the corpse of an explorer (with a ring engraved with a [[Freemason]] symbol) who had been trapped in the pyramid roughly during the late 19th century. A journal he left behind details a possible escape route from the burial chamber. Dr. Holden begins to explain the map when suddenly a clawed hand stabs through his chest, tearing out his heart. Nora and Fitzie flee, but after realizing they're trapped, they return to find Dr. Holden still alive tied to a large scale, just like previously depicted on the mural. They quickly hide, just as the large creature reenters the room. Nora recognizes the creature as the Egyptian god [[Anubis]], half jackal and half man, who is seen weighing Dr. Holden's heart in an ancient ritual to determine his worthiness to enter the afterlife. Miles Holden is deemed unworthy and dies when Anubis eats his heart.  After Anubis leaves, Nora and Fitzie decipher hieroglyphs in the chamber that indicate the pyramid was constructed to imprison Anubis, who is seeking to reunite with his creator, [[Osiris]]. They find an air shaft with a ladder left behind by the soldier Shadid, but as they attempt to escape, Anubis sees and pursues them. Nora climbs up first and Fitzie follows, but midway up the ladder he is grabbed from below and dragged to his death. Now alone, Nora continues to scramble up the crumbling ladder and reaches the top, but just as she does so, is captured by Anubis and dragged back down. Tied to an obelisk, she uses a blade hidden in her hand to slowly cut through her bonds before Anubis can finish his ritual. Once free, she wounds Anubis, who is then attacked by a horde of the scavenger cats allowing Nora to escape. Exhausted and traumatized, she finally climbs her way to freedom and collapses just before clearing the pyramid's exit (looking like the proverbial 'light at the end of the tunnel'). She awakens sunburned and injured, only to discover an Egyptian child playing with her camera. He looks questioningly at her, and she pleads for him to help her. Unable to understand her (as he does not speak English) the boy has no time to react before Anubis suddenly appears from the dark behind the boy. Lunging at them both, Anubis presumably kills them.

The Quiet Ones (2014 film)
 In 1974 a student attends the class of Oxford University Professor Coupland, who wishes to prove that the supernatural does not exist. Coupland shows a video of a possessed boy and explains that research will be done to find a cure for this kind of disorder. One of his students, Brian McNeil, is invited to film the experiment process and joins Coupland, his two assistants Krissi and Harry, and their subject Jane Harper, a young woman who generates strange phenomena and has been abandoned. Jane is generally kept locked in a room with loud rock music playing during the daytime to prevent her from sleeping in the hopes that the regime of sleep deprivation will result in increased activity.  Once his funding is taken away by an exasperated College Board that is both annoyed about the disturbances he makes and his lack of results, Coupland and his assistants settle in an isolated house in the countryside to keep experimenting on Jane. Her negative energy takes the form of "Evey", an infant doll-like creature only Jane sees. Coupland instructs Jane to transfer her negative energy into a physical doll so they can destroy it. The further the researchers drive Jane to insanity with their methods, the stranger things get around the house. Brian is upset by the way Jane is treated and the lack of ethics in the experiment. Evey's [[Ghost|apparitions]] become increasingly aggressive, and Jane begins to harm herself. There are also indicators that any attempt to harm Evey harms Jane.  Coupland refuses to stop the inhumane experimentation. He is irrevocably convinced that "Evey" is merely a conventionally treatable, parapsychological disorder in Jane's head, but the others become convinced over time that Evey is a true malevolent, supernatural force. Brian and Jane become closer and share a kiss. When the group experience another attack by Evey, Brian goes to Oxford, where he discovers that a symbol that was marked into Jane is from a cult who worshiped a Sumerian demon. They performed experiments on a young girl a few years ago; their leader believed that Evey Dwyer, a girl with clairvoyant abilities, was the one to bring their "idol" into the physical world. Everybody in the cult died in a house fire that Evey set, including Evey herself. Brian returns and tells them about the cult, certain that Evey is a [[Demon|demonic presence]] who is [[Demonic possession|possessing]] Jane. He convinces Harry and Krissi, but Coupland denies his theory and responds that Evey must be a figment from Jane's past rather than a demonic force.  After a heated argument, the group are marked with the same symbol Jane had. An unknown force murders Krissi and Harry. Jane realizes that she was the little girl that supposedly died in the house fire; she was born with clairvoyant powers and had set the house on fire to kill everyone. The authorities changed her name to Jane to give her a normal life, and that's why all her negative energy is manifesting; Evey is not a demon, she is Jane's real identity (one who can't escape the trauma of her past life). Jane/Evey then attacks Brian, only for them both to be knocked out by Coupland. When Brian wakes up, he sees Coupland give Jane a lethal injection, as he thinks stopping her heart long enough for the negative energy to dissipate will permanently cure her. However, before Coupland can prove his theory, Brian saves Jane and subdues Coupland. Once revived, Jane locks him out of the room and commits suicide by setting herself on fire.  The screen cuts to film footage, showing Brian sitting in a chair, holding a camera. Somebody asks him what happened and how everybody died. Brian explains that everything that happened was captured on film. The person says that there is nothing on the film, and that everything in the house, including the films, were destroyed by the fire. Brian laughs manically and his hand starts to smoke, just as Jane's did.

When Karthik's father ([[Nassar]]) goes to Dhanunjay's house to ask the same, he gets insulted. Dhanunjay plans to be a mayor and Karthik decides to teach him a lesson and marry his daughter. Firstly, he kills the possibilities of Dhanunjay becoming a mayor. Later he joins Indu’s college to somehow convince her for the marriage, where he encounters Bhagyam ([[Pranitha Subhash]]) who falls in love with him whom he misunderstood as Dhanunjay's daughter. Conflicts arise between Karthik and Indu. By the time he comes to know that Indu is his cousin and not Bhagyam, he has broken up with Bhagyam because of Indu's revenge.  Karthik ends up challenging Dhanunjay, who then approaches a gangster Obul Reddy ([[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]). Indu acts as if she loves Karthik so that she can escape from there and find her lover whom she never saw. That person helped her friend elope with her lover on the night of her marriage and neither Indu nor that person knows each other's features and looks. On seeing Karthik's photograph, Obul Reddy asks his whereabouts as he was that person who helped his brother's fiancée who actually was Indu's friend who eloped with her lover that night. Meanwhile, Karthik and Indu escape from there and on learning her love story, Karthik decides to help her and gives up his word given to his mother. Meanwhile, Karthik saves Peddi Reddy ([[Jaya Prakash Reddy]]) from Gangi Reddy's ([[Nagineedu]]) men and Indu poses as Karthik's lover who eloped with him as her parents did not approve their marriage and also a gangster is looking for them. As an act of gratitude, Peddi Reddy takes them to their house where they are kept in safe custody. But shockingly they find out that Obul Reddy is Peddi Reddy's son and Indu's friend actually was Gangi Reddy's daughter.  The person who helped Gangi Reddy's daughter that night from her marriage was Karthik himself and he is unaware that the person who spoke to him in a phone to help that girl was Indu. Indu is unaware that Karthik was that person whom she loves. Dhanunjay uses this situation and introduces Nandu as that person who actually is the son of a rich millionaire with whom Indu's marriage was planned by him. Obul Reddy and his brothers bring a liar named Raju ([[Bramhanandam]]) and misrepresent him as the person who helped the bride run away that night. But he is not killed instantly as the bridegroom, Obul Reddy's brother Bulli Reddy ([[Sravan]]) who is in a coma due to Karthik, has to kill him once he recuperates. He is cheated on several occasions by Karthik, who meanwhile manages to create a good impression in Indu when he unites Gangi Reddy and Peddi Reddy, thus rescheduling the marriages, and saves Nandu from Peddi Reddy when he broke the house's ancestral statue by taking the blame himself. Indu proposes Karthik to marry her and declares that she cannot live without him.  But he is not in a position to accept her proposal as Dhanunjay warned him before that if he makes Indu fall in love, he would reveal that Karthik helped Gangi Reddy's daughter to escape thus breaking the newly formed bond between the two families. Thus he rejects her proposal and sacrifices his love for the welfare of the two families. After an unexpected fight with Obul Reddy, Karthik is confronted by Peddi Reddy and Gangi Reddy, who now know the truth. They forgive him and the marriage of Peddi Reddy's daughter happens as scheduled, with Karthik and Indu getting married in the presence of their parents on the same day at the same venue. The families of Gangi Reddy and Peddi Reddy are united and all are happy except Dhanunjay.

This catches the attention of a sleazy director, Rocks (Parvin Dabas) who decides to make a movie on the haunting. He signs an ex-porn star, Sunny Leone (Sunny Leone) as the lead actress and decides to shoot the movie in the same house where the MMS was recorded. Sunny, who takes an instant liking to the script, seeks permission to meet the real Ragini (Kainaz Motivala), (who is now in a mental asylum), to get a better in-depth look of the character she wants to portray. But the meeting goes horribly wrong when Ragini stabs herself brutally in the neck. Later, the cast and crew arrive at the haunted house to shoot and strange things begin to happen, especially to Sunny. Elsewhere, Dr. Meera Dutta (Divya Dutta), a psychiatrist who specialises in cases for which science has no answers, takes up Ragini's case. After going through old news paper clipping and video tapes of Ragini, she finds the truth regarding the haunting. She finds out that the ghost haunting the house, in life was a married woman with two daughters and a son. She was more attached to her son, because she had conceived him after much difficulty and praying. One day, the boy and his two sisters were playing hide and seek when the boy slipped into a well and drowned. This drove his mother insane and caused her to embark on a desperate quest to resurrect him from the dead. A Baba who claimed to perform black magic arrived and convinced her the only way to bring her son back was to sacrifice both of her daughters. The insane mother agreed and the Baba chopped off the daughters' heads. He put the sword in her hands, told her to close her eyes, and chant. While she did that he stole all of her money and ran. When the villagers finally arrived, they assumed that the mother was practising witch craft and punished her by hanging her from a tree, stoning her, and burning her alive. The woman survived, finally dropped from the tree, and after cursing them all, killed herself by stabbing herself in the neck with the rattle-toy her son used to play with. Dr. Dutta then rushes to the shooting location to inform the cast and crew to abandon their shooting and leave the house immediately. But it is too late as the ghost has already possessed Sunny and started killing the film's cast and crew by either luring them into having sex or killing them by catching them off guard. Only the scriptwriter Satya (Saahil Prem) and actress Monali (Sandhya Mridul) are left alive. As Dr. Dutta, Monali and Satya attempt to drive the ghost out of Sunny, Monali gets killed. Afterwards, when Satya accidentally steps on the rattle toy with which the woman committed suicide prior to becoming a ghost, it causes Sunny temporary pain, and thereby forces the ghost to temporarily leave Sunny. Dr. Dutta realises the toy's importance and urges Satya to destroy it. Eventually the ghost is destroyed along with the rattle. And Sunny, Satya and Dr. Dutta leave the house, having exorcised the ghost and solving the mystery behind the haunting. At the end of the movie a rocking chair is shown rocking back and forth and a child's voice is heard, signifying that there is still a ghost in the house. 
The Raid 2
   Two hours after the events of the first film, Jakarta crime boss Bejo executes Rama's brother Andi who took over from Tama, a gang boss operating under Bangun. Rama meets  Lt. Bunawar, head of an internal investigation unit. He sends Bowo for treatment but has Lt. Wahyu executed. Bunawar assures Rama it was to protect him from crooked cops like Wahyu, saying courts cannot fix the problem. Testifying would only endanger him and his family. He asks him to go undercover to expose Reza's and other police officials' dealings with the Bangun and Goto crime syndicates. Rama agrees after Bejo murders Andi. Bunawar tasks him to infiltrate the underworld, befriending Bangun's son Uco. Using the alias "Yuda", Rama is told to assault the politician's son responsible for putting Uco in prison. Bunawar can arrest him and befriend Uco. In a riot a year into Uco's prison term, several assailants attempt to kill him. They are led by Benny who betrays Uco's trust before Yuda saves him. When Yuda is released two years later, Uco takes him to meet his father, who hires him out of gratitude. He proves his value to the family through his work under Uco and his father's consigliere Eka.  Uco is frustrated with his limited role in the organization and is furious when a bar girl calls him a "debt collector". When he leaves the room, Rama plants a bug in his wallet. Bangun meets the hitman Prakoso, who assassinates another of Bangun's targets.  Bejo invites Uco to dinner and tells him he has his eye on Gotos' controlled land. He shares rumors of a plot to turn Reza and others against his father. Bejo brings the assailants from the prison riot. Uco kills them. He notices a gang tattoo on Benny's wrist. They hatch a plot to start a gang war to disrupt the truce between the two families. Uco can prove himself to Bangun; Bejo can profit from carving up Hideaki Goto's territory. Uco lures Prakoso into an ambush. Prakoso is killed by The Assassin. Uco lies to his father saying the Japanese were responsible. Bangun will not counterattack. Frustrated, Uco phones Bejo saying "Just do it." Bejo's hitmen – Hammer Girl, Baseball Bat Man, and The Assassin – kill several of Goto's men, sparking a gang war between the families.  Rama is attacked during the conflict. He defeats the assailants and discovers a police ID on one of the attackers. When the families meet to reconcile, Uco lashes out in anger, embarrassing Bangun into conceding territory. Rama learns from Lt. Bunawar the attackers were Reza's corrupt cops sent after him. He receives a call from Eka to save Uco. Bangun beats Uco when they return to his office. While Yuda is on the way, Bejo and The Assassin barge in with a mob of henchmen. Revealing his betrayal, Uco kills his father and shoots Eka. Before Bejo can finish him off, Yuda arrives and Eka flees. The Assassin subdues Rama. Bejo commands his men to get rid of him. Eka follows. In a car chase several vehicles are destroyed before Yuda is rescued and driven to safety. Ryuichi informs Goto and Keichi that Reza was seen entering Bejo's restaurant. Goto tells Ryuichi to "take care of him". Ryuichi tells him Bejo is not alone. He informs him of Uco's betrayal of his father. Goto declares war against Bejo, Uco, and Reza. When his son Keichi interjects, Goto responds, "They're not cops anymore. They're in my world now." A bleeding and exhausted Eka tells Rama he knows he was also undercover. Rama calls Lt. Bunawar, who informs him the gang war escalated. The police commissioner was shot dead. Bunawar claims Eka "went rogue" and ten honest cops died. He informs him that Reza, the true objective, is meeting Bejo and Uco at the restaurant. Rama breaches its warehouse and fights through Bejo's men.  Bejo and Uco meet Reza to discuss terms against Goto. Still shaken from his act of patricide, Uco discovers the bug in his wallet. Uncertain who planted it, he notices Bejo has the same  tattoo as Benny, suggesting the prison attack may have been another attempt to spark a gang war. Uco sits in shock realizing he has been used. Rama defeats Bejo's three hitmen and disrupts the meeting carrying The Assassin's pair of karambit. Bejo attempts to shoot him. Uco grabs another gun and shoots Reza dead. He shoots Bejo, before turning his gun towards Rama who throws the karambit at Uco then stabs him. Uco dies in his arms. Rama limps from the premises and encounters Keichi, Ryuichi and their men sent to attack the meeting. While Lt. Bunawar drives to the site, Keichi smirks as he shares a silent dialogue with Rama. Rama is heard saying, "No...I'm done."  
Rage (2014 film)
 Paul Maguire and his buddies Kane and Danny live a life of crime. One night, they ambush a Russian mobster, intercepting him when he’s on his way to drop off money to his boss. The take is much larger than they imagined; along with a Russian gun called a [[TT pistol|Tokarev]], they get away with a briefcase full of cash. It’s enough for Paul to leave the life of crime and go legit, but their crime sets off a bloody protracted war between their Irish crime family and the Russian mob. Paul instructs his friends to hide the money until things calm down between their outfit and the Russians. In spite of several casualties on both sides, their plan works well; five years after stealing the money, Paul, Kane and Danny meet to split up the take.  Over the next twenty years, Paul uses his share to slowly build a legitimate construction empire in Mobile, Alabama. He marries a beautiful, ambitious woman named Vanessa and is a doting father to his teenage daughter Caitlin. His former mob boss, O’Connell (who uses a wheelchair), has allowed him to go legit and stays on speaking terms, but he remains friends with his buddies Kane and Danny, who haven’t had his luck when it comes to reforming. One night Paul and Vanessa are heading to a charity dinner, leaving Caitlin at home to hang out with her friends Evan and Mike. At the dinner, a Mobile P.D. Detective St. John approaches Paul, who is used to being hassled for his former life of crime. But the Detective isn't hassling him; something has happened to Caitlin.  Evan and Mike tell the police and Paul that they were watching TV with Caitlin, when several masked men barged in and took her. They fought – but the men overtook Mike and Evan. Convinced the kidnapping is long-overdue retaliation for the crimes of his youth – specifically his run-in with Ivan, Paul ignores the police and mounts his own investigation.  Paul's patience with the police ends completely when Caitlin's body is found in a storm drain. After her funeral, O'Connell strongly suggests that Paul allow the police to handle the investigation, reasoning that Paul was allowed to walk out of the mob, and therefore he should stay away from mob methods.  Paul and his buddies shake down and rough up anyone they can find who might be connected to Chernov, the legendary mob boss whose money they stole seventeen years earlier and whom they think was involved in Caitlin's murder. O'Connell pleads with Paul to stop his rampage, but he refuses. Vanessa, who initially backed her husband's search, now fears he's becoming the killer he once was. But there exists another possibility: perhaps he has always been a violent man and can never truly leave that life behind.  After executing some of Chernov's men and wrecking their businesses, Paul's buddies are targeted by Chernov. When Kane is captured and tortured, he tries to get Chernov to admit to killing Caitlin as revenge for the heist decades ago.  Chernov is perplexed, but also angry that Paul did the long-ago crime, as the Russian mobster they killed turns out to have been Chernov's brother. Meanwhile, Paul thinks Danny had to have talked because the friend is directly working for O'Connell once again, and Danny uses drugs and parties and may have talked and not remembered. He confronts Danny, accuses him of ratting, and knifes him in a moment of wrath.   Chernov arranges a meet with O'Connell, explains Paul's part in starting the long-ago gang war, and demands O'Connell exact discipline. O'Connell refuses to listen to Chernov on general principles, and the resulting shootout leaves Chernov as the only survivor.  Paul finds a Tokarev pistol in his closet, a relic from the robbery that started the war years ago. He finally gets the real story from Mike; drinking and horsing around with his guns that night, Mike accidentally shot his daughter, then created the kidnapping story in a panic. After an inner struggle, he allows Mike to live and walks away. Returning home, Paul phones his wife, apologizing and saying things will be over soon, as Chernov and some of his surviving men enter his house. He then tells her the story about the first time he killed, when someone gave him a knife in a barfight. He admits he has nightmares about it, where his older self tries to stop the violence and instead can only watch helplessly. Suddenly, Paul is shot and killed.

This was an opportunity that had been denied to her, so she wanted it desperately for her son.

He was extremely fond of his family and tried to do his best to fulfill his wife’s aspirations. When Gogol started being rejected school after school, a despondent Mitali took the advice of her friend and kept a tuition teacher to teach Gogol. But soon Mitali got disappointed by the young teacher’s casual attitude and decided to teach Gogol herself. Mitali’s desperation worries Laltu and he decides to try every means to fulfill his wife’s aspirations. He even approaches a tout and is willing to pay him a handsome amount if he can procure admission for his son. The tout claims that he can get his son admitted to any school they desire for a fee of Rs. 10 Lakhs. To Laltu, it was an exorbitant sum. He does not know how to procure that amount. Should he terminate his fixed deposits? But that was the only savings he had! On the other hand, he could not bear to see the disappointment on his wife’s face each time their son was rejected. The family decides to go to [[Bolpur]], in the district of [[Birbhum]], West Bengal, where Mitali’s parents resided. It was a special occasion as her brother was returning home from abroad, after a long time, along with his foreigner wife. The holiday turned out to be most interesting as Jennifer, the brother’s wife, was keen on adapting to traditional Bengali customs, learning the language and insisting on speaking in broken Bengali. In fact, she called Mitali’s insistence on getting her son admitted to an English-medium school and learning the English language as ‘linguistic imperialism’. While Gogol spent a wonderful holiday with his grandparents and his new aunt, Mitali was anxiously waiting for the interview call for her son. When it finally arrives, they rush back home. The three of them attend the interview, but this time, Mitali felt it was Laltu who had ruined her son’s chances by giving ludicrous answers to the questions put by the school’s interview board. Mitali is furious with Laltu. But she is not the one to give up hope so easily. She readies herself for the final bid. On the advice of another parent, Mitali decides to enrol herself along with her husband in a school that coaches parents to conduct themselves at interviews. Laltu is very reluctant at first, but finally gives in to his wife’s persuasions. What follows is poignant as well as hilarious as Laltu tries to learn the language, etiquette and build up confidence to face the toughest of situations. The teacher of the coaching school was a wonderful lady who held their hands and taught them not only how to conduct themselves at interviews but also face difficulties and recognise the worth of life itself! Does Gogol finally get through the interview? Will Mitali be able to fulfil her dreams or does she learn a greater lesson from all this and the importance of her child’s well-being? Gogol, her five-year-old, who loved the song of birds, the flight of kites, the rustling of the leaves, the wide expanse of the blue sky, was his sensitive soul being crushed by the ambitions of his parent? Does Mitali finally look deep into her son’s eye and realise what makes him truly happy? Does she finally follow her heart? Many such moments are captured in the story as it hurtles towards a dramatic climax.

Rampage: Capital Punishment
 Immediately after committing his rampage in Tenderville, [[Oregon]], Bill Williamson disappeared and had been living off the grid for years with the money he stole from a bank during the massacre. The video recording of his rants about violent population control had since garnered millions of views and turns Bill into an Internet sensation. In the present day, Bill uses the stolen money to finance yet another killing spree, purchasing a number of weapons, including two fully automatic, military-grade [[Close Quarters Battle Receiver|Mk 18 Mod 0 carbine]]s, and constructing homemade explosives. After making final preparations for the killing spree, Bill shaves his head clean, dons his suit of body armor, and sets the interior of his house on fire. He drives to an alleyway and uses its cover to shoot several random pedestrians undetected, before trying to enter a bingo hall, only to leave after finding it is closed.  Bill then travels to a television station in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he blows up his car and enters the building. Inside, he shoots the security guard and several employees with the carbines. He then holds the survivors, including news anchorman Chip Parker, hostage and forces them to a basement at gunpoint. He kills one of the hostages when he disregards one of his orders. Bill later gives Chip a disc and instructs him to go upstairs and air the contents of the disc nationwide, then return with a camera crew so they could do a live interview with him. Chip agrees and leaves the basement, where he relays his instructions to the responding police officers. However, while trying to air the disc, he accidentally slips and breaks it. He returns to the basement and tells Bill what had happened, and an agitated Bill gives him a duplicate of the disc.  While Chip is gone, Bill criticizes one of the hostages for her personal life before killing her. He is then confronted by another hostage, who reveals herself to be the sister of one of the people he killed at Tenderville. When she expresses her intent to kill him, Bill forces a reluctant male hostage to beat her. Eventually, the contents of the disc are aired on live television; in it, Bill rants in a video recording about how the current system is flawed and that the U.S. government is manipulating American citizens and events for the sake of wealth. The video ends with Bill appealing to the American people to retaliate violently against politicians and the wealthy in order to restore society. Meanwhile, the officers manage to contact Bill's father with the intention of using him to appeal to Bill.  Chip returns to the basement with a camera crew, including an undercover police officer, and gives Bill a cellphone with his father on the other end. Mr. Williamson tries to appeal to Bill, then reveals his mother died after a car accident, as a result of medication she had been taking for depression following Bill's first killing spree and disappearance. At that moment, Bill becomes suspicious of the undercover officer and kills him, then abruptly ends the conversation with his father. Using hidden security cameras he implanted earlier, he notices SWAT teams converging on the basement and remotely detonates explosives, killing or incapacitating the officers. At Chip's urging, Bill commences with the live interview, during which he becomes more specific about his rants in the disc and also espouses his opinions about killing innocent people. Asked if he regrets not being there when his mother died, he gets visibly upset but replies that his aim is bigger than family, and that it is about the survival of humanity. He then reveals his intention to die along with Chip before shooting him in the arm and releasing the other hostages.  Bill immediately engages a SWAT team in a shootout before fleeing into the building's ventilation system, leaving behind a gas bomb. Just as the SWAT team discovers the bomb, it detonates, destroying the entire station and killing everyone inside, including Chip and the officers. Bill is then shown to be alive and well, watching a report of the station's destruction on his phone. As he does this, he spots a young girl reading a book and criticizes her for reading one. Bill then gives her a pistol and instructs her to use it to kill her parents and then herself before sending her off with a look of satisfaction on his face.

After they arm themselves with knives and kill two infected men and a monkey, the old woman is separated and Lucas volunteers to find her while Guzman and Ángela go to the Captain and Nick for help.  Ricarte gives up with nothing left to do to stop the infection and then decides to pursue the "protocol." Just before doing so, his assistant informs him of receiving the uploaded footage. Ricarte witnesses Tristana inserting a worm-like parasite into Ángela. He attempts to extract the parasite by forcing surgery on Ángela, who pleads that she doesn't know what he's talking about, but before an incision can be made, the captain's assistant who is now infected breaks in and bites Ricarte's assistant which allows Ángela to escape. Ricarte and his team then go to search for Ángela but then seals himself away after the cook is released and attacks his team only to be attacked by Ángela, who bites him, telling him to scan his blood and see for himself that he is mistaken. Guzman, Lucas and Nick then try to find weapons and a way to restart the ship. Nick then tells them that Ángela is alive so Guzman goes to find her while Lucas and Nick head to the boiler room.  Ricarte proves Ángela's theory when his analysis returns negative. Still, Ricarte is convinced that Ángela is tricking them so Guzman asks Ángela if she is, but then she asks Guzman if he has been tricking them all along. It's revealed that Ángela passed the parasite into Guzman during her rescue. Ricarte then sets the ship to self-destruct and escapes while Guzman traps Ángela below.  Lucas is then killed by the infected in the boiler room and Nick finds Ricarte, who has a lifeboat. Nick asks for Ángela but Ricarte tells him she's as good as dead. Nick knocks him out, takes the lifeboat and searches for her. He later finds her, and both kill the infected monkeys with a boat-motor. They hide from the infected in the cafeteria and then are attacked by Guzman. The parasite possessing Guzman then attempts to reinstate itself into Ángela but she kills Guzman with a harpoon gun thanks to Nick. Ángela and Nick leave the boat as all the infected chase after them. Ángela jumps into the ocean and Nick follows, escaping as the ship explodes. Underwater, the Parasite, still alive, is devoured by a predatory fish.  During the credits, Ángela and Nick are shown in a cab, having made it home.

Reaper (film)
 A young, attractive, and cunning hitchhiker (Beesley) stumbles into a mysterious town where a dangerous, supernatural killer is on the loose. Consequently, she is forced to team up with a group of intimidating drifters and criminals (Trejo, Jones, Busey, Jurdi) in order to survive and defeat the "Reaper".  In a news bulletin, it is revealed that a former cult leader escaped the electric chair and has now returned as a supernatural serial killer named Reaper, wreaking havoc on a small county and targeting those he believes to be sinners.  In parallel, we meet Natalie, an attractive hitchhiker ([[Shayla Beesley]]) trying to catch a ride on a dry, desolate road. She gets picked up by alcoholic salesman named Bill ([[Jake Busey]]), but his car breaks down and they wind up at a motel. Bill and Natalie check in as newlyweds, with a creepy, religious motel owner ([[Justin Henry]]) in the midst.  Bill starts to get intimate with Natalie after she begins to flirt with him. She spikes his cup of Jack Daniels with a sleeping pill. She plays pseudo-bondage games with him, ties him up, and takes his wallet as well as his car keys. She leaves and locks the door behind her. The creepy owner walks down the hall, then the Reaper attacks and kills Bill with a scythe, while the owner begins to say a prayer. Natalie calls her mother, finds out that her mother needs money for her surgery, or else the bank will cancel her hospice. Natalie says to her that she will get the money and pay for the operation.  She stops in at a diner to get something to eat. Rob, a mean mob boss ([[Vinnie Jones]]), realizes that his slick, young protege, Brad ([[James Jurdi]]), has been botching his tasks. After threatening him with a large knife, Rob gives Brad a final chance and throws him some money to finish up a pending deal. After witnessing Brad flirt with a waitress and tip her handsomely, Natalie sets her sights on him, first tampering with his wheels, then running him over. Feigning concern, she runs out of the car, makes small talk with a smile, then offers him a ride. Some sexual foreplay ensues, but she convinces him to get her a drink from a liquor mart, then zooms off with his money and gun and leaves him in the dust.  Later on, the tables turn when Natalie finds out that Brad is a drug mule, and his associate, humble truck driver Jack ([[Danny Trejo]]), his dealer, are at the same motel she was taken to by the latter (which is also where she started off with Bill). Two hit men then enter the motel, where they get killed by the Reaper. The motel owner tries to rape her when she tries to call the police. The Reaper arrives and kills him. Jack and Brad decide to help Natalie, but a policeman named Officer Banks ([[Christopher Judge]]) arrives to question them about what has happened.   Officer Banks takes them into custody, but the Reaper arrives, luring Banks to follow him with a shotgun. Rob, fed up with Brad's inability to close the deal, decides to go after him. Banks starts to taunt the killer out of hiding, entering room after room. Natalie and the others are locked in the supply closet for their safety. After searching the motel, Banks gets killed by the Reaper. The trio escape from the supply closet, and decide to work together to fight the Reaper.   They try to escape by using Jack's truck, but she tells them that she removed the distributor cap from the vehicle. Brad and Natalie decide to put their differences aside and locate the money and the drugs. Meanwhile, Rob arrives at the motel, while Jack decides to confront the Reaper. Brad is cornered by Rob and is about to meet his doom, but Natalie saves his life by dropping a fire extinguisher on Rob's head. Rob survives, slaps Natalie around, and is about to off her when Brad kills him with his own knife. Just when it looks like they have made it out safe and Jack pulls up in the truck, Brad shoots Jack and makes clear that he wants all the money and the drugs for himself and is going to strand Natalie behind as payback for robbing him earlier. Moments later, he is killed by the Reaper.  Natalie tries to escape but is captured by the Reaper, then taken to a church where he brings his victims. He starts to torment her, planning to send her to hell. At the last minute, Jack (who survived his gunshot wound) returns and drowns the Reaper in a bucket of water, saving Natalie's life. Jack dies but not before telling Natalie to start her life all over again. She calls her mother to let her know she's on her way to see her. Natalie takes off in Jack's truck, then picks up a female hitchhiker who asks about Natalie's story. She smiles, asking how much time she's got and then drives off into the sunset.  After some credits, it is revealed that the Reaper survived and rises to his feet, presumably on his way to continue reaping.  
The Reconstruction of William Zero
 After accidentally causing the death of his son, geneticist William Blakely wakes in a house tended by a man who introduces himself as his twin brother.  His brother explains that William was involved in a car crash.  William can remember nothing of his life and must be taught basic concepts, such as how to walk and respond to knock-knock jokes.  Together, they watch old footage of William and his twin as children.  Though William does not recognize his estranged wife Jules, he is entranced by her.  William's brother is finally called to return to work at Next Corp, and he leaves William alone in the house for the day.  At work, William's brother is revealed to be the real William Blakely – William 1.  He stole material from the lab to create a clone, William 2.  His assistant, Baxter, tells William 1 that their test subjects have been dying after mere weeks.  Before William 1 can do anything further, his boss, Dr. Archer, takes him to see several security agents, who accuse him of stealing the lab materials.  Dr. Archer supports him, but the security agents remain suspicious.  At the same time, William 2 explores the house and discovers enough evidence that he becomes confused about his origins and identity.  Further confusing William 2 is a phone call apparently from a haggard-sounding version of William (who is later revealed to be the original William, William Zero) who apologizes for leaving him and promises to return.  William 2 angrily confronts William 1.  After interrogating William 1, William 2 ties him up and leaves to find Jules, who he hopes can explain further.  Although overwhelmed by his first experiences in the world, William 2 quickly adapts and locates Jules.  He awkwardly reestablishes contact with her, though she initially rejects him, as she feels abandoned and left alone to deal with her grief.  William 2 secretly follows her around the city and becomes more smitten with her.  Meanwhile, William 1 escapes his bonds and kills a Next Corp security agent who was investigating the house and its grounds.  William 1 recovers a pistol from the agent's body and uses it kill Dr. Archer.  William 1 quickly returns home and pretends to be bound.  When his clone arrives, he convinces William 2 to take over his life, as William 1 does not wish to return to it.  William 2 reluctantly agrees, and goes to work at Next Corp, where he learns that the animal test subjects are second generation clones.  Baxter explains that cloning a clone causes extensive genetic problems, and William 2, who is experiencing the described symptoms, realizes that he must be a second generation clone, too.  Before he can return home to further question William 1, a security team detains him for further questioning.  Baxter, dubious about the company's ethics, frees him and traps the security team.  After growing increasingly suspicious of his neighbor's activities, Lester confronts William 1.  William 1 invites Lester inside, and, after pushing him down a flight of stairs, explains his origins.  The original William Blakely, William Zero, was so overcome by guilt and grief that he abandoned his wife and created a clone, William 1, to replace him.  However, William 1 felt abandoned by his creator once William Zero disappeared.  As he struggled through life with no help, he became bitter and disillusioned, eventually attempting suicide.  Unable to face his own broken life, William 1 created a clone to replace him – freeing him to seek vengeance on William Zero and the world.  After killing Lester, William 1 lures Jules to the house, planning to kill her to spite William Zero.  Although confused by his cold demeanor compared to William 2, Jules does not suspect anything.  William 2 arrives before William 1 can kill Jules, and he tells Jules that he loves her.  After the two embrace, William 2 attempts to dispose of William 1's body, only to be confronted by William Zero.  Knowing he will soon die, William 2 convinces William Zero to return to his wife and promise never to leave her again.  William Zero tearfully agrees, and they arrange for his death to be faked.  Some time later, William Zero is shown together with Jules and his now-cloned son.

The Scorpion leaves behind his stylized pistol as a way to escape dehydration.  Pardo pulls the trigger three times but survives.  In the present, he targets the former drug gangs that he once served, giving them an ultimatum to either repent or die.  As a result, he becomes known as the Redeemer.  When the Scorpion discovered Pardo is still alive, he chases after him.  Pardo comes upon a villager, Agustin, menaced by thugs.  After killing his attackers, they hide from the gang's retaliation in the house of Agustin's friend Antonia.  Agustin explains that he found a bag full of money and took it to a local church to donate.  Pardo offers to trade the money back to the gang in return if they leave the town.  Though they refuse to leave, they agree to bargain once the money is recovered.  When they realize that Pardo is the Redeemer, they keep him under heavy guard while several men fetch the money.  They fail to find the money, and Pardo kills all the men in the room before they can shoot him.  The gang's boss, an American named Steve Bradock, dismisses his henchmen's fears and orders them to kill Pardo.  Pardo returns to find that Agustin has given the money to Antonia to help her son get an operation.  Pardo initially refuses to allow her to keep it, but he relents after she unknowingly reminds him of slaughtered family.  Agustin and Antonia watch as Pardo engages in his ritualistic Russian roulette, and Antonia tells him that he must accept his dark side and forgive himself rather than looking to God for a sign that he has been forgiven.  Knowing that the entire gang must be killed if they allow Antonia to keep the money, Pardo researches the gang's next drug deal, where he defeats one of Bradock's assassins.  Meanwhile, the Scorpion arrives in town and kills anyone who gets in his way.  Realizing that both the Redeemer and Scorpion are in town, Bradock's second-in-command urges him to flee.  Instead, Bradock kills him, promotes underling Piedra, and demands that his men come up with a cool-sounding nickname for him, too.  After Pardo clears out a warehouse, Piedra and Pardo engage in a duel.  After Pardo wins, he learns from Piedra the location Bradock's headquarters.  There, Pardo realizes the Scorpion has already killed Bradock.  The Scorpion knocks him out.  When Pardo awakes, he sees that Agustin and Antonia are both prisoners.  The Scorpion reveals that he has been killing all the people that Pardo has helped, which he says proves the futility of Pardo's redemption.  The Scorpion demands Agustin to play Russian roulette; when he refuses, the Scorpion wounds Antonia and finally kills Agustin.  The Scorpion demands Antonia play under threat of Pardo's death, but Pardo points out that the Scorpion would never kill him without making him suffer.  Both Antonia and the Scorpion are disarmed, and the two men face off.  Pardo defeats the Scorpion, and Antonia hands him the stylized pistol.  Instead of killing him, Pardo apologizes for killing his son and gives the Scorpion back his pistol, saying that it is all he can do to reunite the Scorpion with his son.

He takes the builder lobby into confidence and tries to bribe the judges, public prosecutor, etc. On the other hand, his seniors are also fighting tooth and nail to convict Sharma in the case. They arrange for false witnesses and they also raise a lobby to influence the judge. Waze is countering these moves by killing the false witnesses lobbying to change the judges.  Back in flashback we see Rege comes out of the vehicle and witnesses the murder of Agarwal builder. The others in gang vouch to kill him, but M bhai is against the idea and spares Rege. M Bhai drops his men off at Rege's farmhouse and tells Rege to go to the bar and forget everything that has happened. Rege is seen at the whore-house extremely drunk. He is picked up by Sharma's men and brought to the police station where he is interrogated and threatened with violence. Rege is extremely scared and repents for what he has done. However, Sharma comes to the station and reasons with Rege privately in congenial manner to spill everything that happened with M Bhai's gang. As Rege reveals the events, Sharma realizes M Bhai could still be at Rege's farmhouse. Sharma's men head over with Rege and capture M Bhai and his men, who are soon after executed in a crop field. Rege feels guilty and foolish as Sharma lets him go home. But in the climax, it is revealed that Sharma killed Rege just to complete his century (100) of encounters when Waze persuades him by telling him that,"Sachin Tendulkar had waited for a year to complete his century of centuries". The final scene shows Rege's mother crying in front of his pictures and "Happy Birthday" playing in background as Rege is killed on his birthday.  In the present day, Pradeep Sharma is under arrest for disobeying his police superiors orders and abusing his power. He is periodically interrogated and derided by a panel of chief inspectors. Waze attempts to gain favors with lawyers, politicians and judges to appeal his case. He is eventually acquitted of all charges.  <ref name="dnaindia.com"></ref>  
The Rendlesham UFO Incident
 A message indicates that the following amateur footage was recovered from a stolen laptop.  Gus, a metal detector enthusiast, takes his girlfriend Sally and her videographer friend Jake with him to search for buried treasure in Suffolk, England.  Gus discourages them from taking many supplies, as they will not be gone long.  As Gus describes the various metal detector models and history behind the hobby, Jake expresses more interest in filming Sally.  When they stop in a local pub, Jake flirts with Sally and asks if she is truly serious with Gus; she replies that she is.  Jake points out a newspaper that describes the [[Rendlesham Forest incident]] and says that is why he is interested in exploring the area.  As they drive to their first site, they see dead horses by the side of the road.  Their initial searches come up empty, and the trio move on to a private property whose owner they had previously contacted.  The owner is nowhere to be found when they arrive at his house.  Undeterred, Gus insists they prospect on his land without permission.  Jake agrees despite his misgivings, and the three wait until nightfall to begin.  When Gus takes a nap, Sally and Jake discuss their history, and Jake teases her over a drunken kiss that she would rather forget.  Gus later leaves a message for Jake on his camera in which he tells Jake that he is aware of Jake's crush on Sally.  In the Rendlesham Forest, the three hear strange noises and encounter otherworldly lights.  Gus, a skeptic, rejects paranormal explanations and suggests that it is local kids playing a prank.  Sally and Jake counter that it could not have been controlled by humans.  When Gus notices low-flying jets, he says that they saw experimental [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] drones.  When the others ask how he could know this, he admits that he has knowingly brought them onto MoD land illegally.  Tensions are further heightened when their car disappears and they find a shack that contains surveillance pictures of them.  Military aircraft continue to fly over them, and one helicopter crashes.  Now concerned for their safety, the three begin panicking.  Gus leads them via his GPS device, but they never encounter the road.  Gus becomes sullen and quiet, and Jake takes them deeper into the forest, hoping to emerge from it after following a straight line.  After another encounter with the strange lights, Jake and Sally lose Gus.  Jake convinces her that they can best help Gus by bringing back a search party.  Soon after, they encounter a road.  Overjoyed, they follow it to a seemingly abandoned American Air Force base.  As they explore it, they find evidence that it was involved in the 1980 UFO incident.  In a hangar, Jake and Sally are surprised to see Gus on a surveillance camera and rush to find him.  Following loud, unearthly noises from deeper within the hangar, they encounter a UFO as it prepares to lift off.  As Jake yells incoherently at it, Sally explores an adjoining room, where she finds Gus' body amidst several others.  Jake and Sally flee the base as the UFO rises, only to be confronted by several more UFOs outside the base, each of which is  making the same unearthly noises.  As Jake surveys the skies, Sally screams and collapses.  Jake runs over to her as several helicopters fly around the UFOs.  After checking her body, he tearfully apologises to her, climbs a hill, and raises his arms to the UFOs.  He is bathed in a white light and disappears.

In 2007, Randy Fullmer, an ordinary guy with a cat, decided to turn his lifelong hobby into a full-out obsession.  To launch his adventure he did what anyone else would do — he quit his high paying dream job at Disney, leaving behind a successful 20-year career of creating major motion pictures such as ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' and ''The Emperor's New Groove''. It seemed to make so much sense at the time! With Disney in the rear-view, he launched his self-proclaimed "Mad Plan", crafting small-batch [[bass guitars]] full-time.  From a beginner's electrifying success to near break-down, this is a beautiful, honest and inspirational portrait of a passionate craftsperson who walked headlong into a foolhardy dream ... a true tale of a life unwound and restrung.  
Rio 2
 [[Spix's Macaw]]s Blu and Jewel and their three children—Bia, Carla, and Tiago—are living happily [[Rio de Janeiro|in the city]] until Jewel realizes that her children are becoming more like humans. Meanwhile, Blu's former owner, Linda Gunderson and her [[Ornithology|ornithologist]] husband, Tulio are on an expedition in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] and, after a fall down a waterfall, discover a quick-flying Spix's macaw that loses one of its feathers. When word gets out about this through television, Jewel believes that they should go to the Amazon to help find the blue macaws. While the kids are ecstatic, Blu is uncertain, but he is pressured into going along. Rafael, Nico and Pedro decide to come along. Luiz attempts to follow but fails. Blu brings a [[fanny pack]] full of supplies, one of which he uses mostly is a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], much to Jewel's displeasure.  Meanwhile, the leader of a group in a line of [[illegal logging]] named Big Boss, discovers Linda and Tulio's expedition to find the macaws and orders his henchmen to hunt them down to avoid disruptions to their work. Also, Blu and Jewel's old [[Archenemy|nemesis]], Nigel the [[sulphur-crested cockatoo|cockatoo]], has survived the plane crash from [[Rio (2011 film)|the first film]], but he is now unable to fly and is working as a [[fortune teller]]/[[con artist]]. When he sees Blu and his family flying overhead, he immediately decides to seek revenge on them. He enlists two minions to help him in his plans; a silent [[anteater]] named Charlie and a [[poison dart frog]] named Gabi, who is in love with Nigel. Blu and his family use a boat to get to the jungle (with Nigel's first plan of revenge being inadvertently foiled by Charlie); and when they arrive, they find nothing. However, they are eventually taken to a flock of blue macaws that are hiding in a secret paradise land. There, they meet Jewel's stern long-lost father, Eduardo, his older sister Mimi, and Jewel's childhood friend, Roberto. Eduardo seems unimpressed with Blu's domesticated human behavior.  While searching for the macaws, Linda and Tulio are eventually trapped by the loggers. Meanwhile, Blu does his best to fit in with the flock, as his family and friends are doing, although the flock (especially Eduardo) are against humans and all things human. Meanwhile, a disguised Nigel plans to kill Blu at the new [[Carnival]] show after landing in an audition hosted by Rafael, Nico, Pedro, and Carla. When Blu tries to pick a Brazilian nut for Jewel, he accidentally tries to get it in the territory of the Spix macaw's enemies, the [[scarlet macaw]]s, led by the hostile Felipe. Blu inadvertently causes war between the two tribes for food when he accidentally hits Felipe with a twig. The war turns out to be just like football (soccer), and Blu accidentally costs the flock the food when he scores an [[own goal]].  Blu visits Tulio and Linda's site, where he discovers that it has been majorly disturbed. After discovering the loggers are destroying the jungle, Blu sends Roberto (who followed Blu) to warn the flock as he saves Linda and Tulio. Blu persuades the macaws to defend their homes, and they easily outmatch the loggers with help from the scarlet macaws and the other animals. Big Boss tries to blow up the trees as a back-up plan, but Blu steals the lit dynamite. Nigel goes after Blu, and reveals himself as they are falling down when he tugs on the dynamite.  After the dynamite goes off, Blu and Nigel engage in a battle while tangled in vines. Gabi and Charlie try to help Nigel by shooting Blu with a dart that has Gabi's poison on it, but it accidentally hits Nigel, who gives a [[Shakespearean]] death speech before seemingly dying.  Gabi, in a [[Romeo and Juliet]]-style, tries to commit suicide by drinking her own poison and the pair are seemingly dead. However, Bia reveals that Gabi isn't poisonous at all (she was lied to by her parents that she was). Nigel tries to attack Blu one last time, but Gabi showers Nigel with affection against his will. Meanwhile, Big Boss is eaten by a [[boa constrictor]] he encountered.  With the flock now under Linda and Tulio's protection, Blu and Jewel decide to live in the Amazon with their kids and friends, though still agreeing to visit Rio in the summer. Meanwhile, Nigel and Gabi are captured by Tulio, and are both sent back to Rio. Luiz finally arrives in the Amazon, and Charlie joins the birds' party.

Ben tries to subdue him but is unable to, so James arrests him.  Ben asks to be taken home before he receives a call from Angela. He tells her about his stressful day, before Angela says that James plays poker with a guy named Crazy Cody, along with telling him that 1-26's are a code for annoying situations for new-comers as a joke. He then goes into the police station and sees Cody laughing with James and his partners Santiago and Miggs.  Upset at James, Ben refuses to go home and instead takes a 1-26 call to respond to a disturbance at a strip club, where two men get into a [[mexican standoff]] with James and Ben, which Ben thinks it's another joke call, so he fools around. James subdues the men, and the two are then tipped off about a gun deal involving Omar's men. Ben then confronts James about the 1-26's. James receives a call from Santiago in the car, when he finds out that Runflat had turned himself in, Ben says how Runflat's brother in the park said that Runflat had just got out of prison. James then contradicts, saying that Runflat hadn't been in prison for over two years, leading to another clue.  The men go to talk Runflat's other brother, J, trying to find out the location of the gun deal, during the confrontation, Ben accidentally shoots J, who subsequently reveals that the deal will take place at an old abandoned warehouse at 9 PM.  James decides to infiltrate the warehouse with Santiago and Miggs, after leaving Ben behind in the car. James is then betrayed by Santiago and Miggs, who turn out to be crooked cops working for Omar. James is then tied up, just when Ben witnesses. Santiago not only mocks James, but also criticizes him for his unsociable, egocentric personality. As the deal begins, Ben enters pretending to be Omar (since no one has ever actually seen the real Omar). Having successfully fooled the crooks, Ben then wreaks havoc at the deal, and right as Ben is about to leave with James, the real Omar appears. A shootout ensues, and many of Omar's men are killed. Ben reveals his sharp reflexes and extensive knowledge of battle (a result of his video game experience). James and Ben take the money meant for the deal and escape right before the warehouse blows up because of Ben's grenade that hit a box of explosives and destroys James's car. Unbeknownst to them, Santiago, Miggs and Omar all escape.  Santiago and Miggs arrive at Angela's apartment and tie her up. As she was playing one of Ben's video games, Ben's fellow players hear the confrontation ensuing between Angela, Miggs and Santiago from Ben's headset. At the hospital after being shot in the leg, Ben receives a call from the fellow player, and tells James that there's something going on at the apartment. After seeing some dirty cops arrive at the hospital, James takes Ben and leaves to go to the apartment, along with Omar's money. James then injures Miggs, before getting into a fight with Santiago. As Santiago is about to shoot James, Angela knocks him out with a frying pan. Ben gets knocked out by Omar in a fight, before Omar takes the bag of money and Angela, and leaves the apartment.  James follows Omar and Angela and confronts them. Right as Omar is about to shoot James, Ben slides over a car and kicks him, and James shoots Omar twice, injuring him. Police arrest Omar, Miggs and Santiago, and James finally gives Ben his blessing.  In a mid-credits scene Ben and Angela are engaged, and Ben is weeks away from graduating from the police academy.

Rob the Mob
 The film opens with two small-time crooks [[Thomas and Rosemarie Uva|Tommy Uva]] (Pitt) and Rosie DeToma (Arianda) getting high and robbing a florist on Valentine's Day. Tommy holds up the cashier with a pistol while Rosie waited in the car she inherited from her father. Tommy is arrested and sent to prison for 18 months. In the meantime, Rosie gets a job at a [[debt collection agency]] run by Dave Lovell (Dunne), who went to jail for bilking major companies out of $800,000 through fraudulent invoices. Lovell reformed his life and mainly hires ex-cons at his firm. He is happy to give Tommy a job and a second chance. Tommy is restless and instead of following the call script, he often counsels people on how to defraud Lovell's company.  When Tommy sees some mafiosos in his neighborhood, he grows enraged. He calls them fat old guys living off their reputation, and he resents the way the mafia treated his father. Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Tommy's father started his shop with a mafia loan, and he suffered frequent beatings when he was late with payments. Tommy's mother and brother still run the shop, but his mother blames Tommy's criminal activity for breaking her husband's heart and leading to his death. Whereas, Tommy blames his father's death completely on the humiliation he suffered at the hands of the mafia.  Tommy skips work one day to attend the trial of [[John Gotti]]. He watches [[Sammy Gravano|Sammy the Bull's]] testimony, and he perks up when Sammy explains that no guns are allowed in mafia social clubs. He cases one of the clubs that Sammy mentioned, and then he pitches the idea to rob the club to Rosie. He explains that it will be safe since no one will have a gun, and that the mafia would never call the cops to report the crime. He gets an Uzi, which he does not know how to use. Rosie reluctantly shows him how to load it, and agrees to the plan.  During the robbery, Tommy shoots the Uzi wildly in the air, eventually convincing the mafiosos to hand over their jewelry and cash rolls. He also humiliates them by messing with their hair and making them simulate sexual intercourse with each other. He leaves the club by shooting up the walls and saying, "This is for Frankie Uva". Rosie and Tommy are thrilled with their score, but the mafia are furious. Sal (Rispoli) consults with his boss, Big Al Fiorello (Garcia), about what to do. Big Al wants the duo found and scared, but not killed, because of the heavy scrutiny on the mob due to Gotti's trial.  Tommy and Rosie eventually run out of money and rob another club. Tommy humiliates the mobsters this time by making them strip to their underwear. FBI Agents have the club under surveillance, and they are stunned at the sound of gunfire. When Tommy flees, the mobsters chase after him out of the club. Agent Frank Hurd (Whaley) photographs several of them standing on the street in their underwear looking bewildered.  Hurd shares the story with ''[[New York Post]]'' columnist Jerry Cardozo (Romano), even reluctantly agreeing to let Cardozo publish one of the pictures. It becomes a front-page story, and a deep humiliation to the mob. Tommy and Rosie convince Lovell to skip work one day and attend the trial with them. Lovell is as enthralled by Sammy the Bull's testimony as they are. Sammy mentions another social club (The Waikiki). On the way back to the office, Lovell notices an Uzi under a blanket in the back seat.  When Tommy robs the Waikiki club, he is dismayed that there are only three very old men in there playing cards. One of them, Joey D (Young) begs for his wallet back, claiming it is a gift from his dead wife. In the wallet, Tommy and Rosie discover a list of the entire mafia organization, including names, ranks, phone numbers, and addresses. They decide to warn the mafia that they have the list, because they feel it is insurance against retribution. Rosie even calls Big Al at home to warn him that they have the list.  Big Al is furious at Sal, who explains that Joey D had the list because Sal thought no one would think such an old man had such an important piece of evidence. The list is essentially a phone tree, meant to function as a pass by mobsters who get arrested. The mobster under arrest calls the guy with the list to signal he will not be cooperating with authorities, and the guy with the list notifies everyone on it so that they can know the authorities are bluffing if they say that the arrested mobster has turned into an informant. The FBI has always wanted such a document because it undermines the standard mafia defense that they are not a real organization.  Big Al summons everyone to a meeting and puts out a contract on Tommy and Rosie, who have become known as "Bonnie and Clyde". Meanwhile, Rosie calls Cardozo to complain that he has underreported the number of clubs that they robbed. She sets up an interview with Cardozo, and after initially protesting, Tommy joins her in talking to Cardozo. His profile of the couple only humiliates the mafia further, but it draws far too much attention to Tommy and Rosie. After reading the article, Lovell warns Rosie about the danger she is in.  One day when Sal is driving through the neighborhood, he nearly runs into Tommy and Rosie, who he recognizes because of their car. He follows them to their apartment, and he is stunned to find they live 3 blocks from the first club they robbed. He tells his underlings where they live, and orders them to kill them.  The FBI infiltrates Tommy and Rosie's apartment and makes a copy of the list, which they use to arrest Big Al. Cardozo is outraged to learn that the FBI will not give Tommy and Rosie any protection for the role that they played in the investigation. Cardozo tries to give airline tickets to Mexico to Tommy and Rosie. He warns them that they are in way over their heads. Tommy and Rosie claim they have a plan. They drive into Manhattan to view the [[Rockefeller Center]] Christmas tree and the holiday windows on Fifth Avenue. At the end of their day, they are ambushed in their car and killed.  A photo of Tommy and Rosemarie Uva is displayed over some final title cards, which claim that the list they stole led to several mob convictions.

RoboCop (2014 film)
  In 2028, multinational conglomerate OmniCorp revolutionizes warfare with the introduction of robotic [[Peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] capable of maintaining law and order in hot spots such as [[Vietnam]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Iran]]. Led by CEO Raymond Sellars, the company moves to market its technology to domestic law enforcement, but the passage of the Dreyfus Act, forbidding deployment of drones in the United States, prevents this. Aware that most Americans oppose the use of military systems in their communities, Sellars asks Dr. Dennett Norton and his research team to create an alternative. The result is a proposal for a [[cyborg]] police officer. However, Norton informs Sellars that only someone who is stable enough to handle being a cyborg can be turned into one, and some candidates are rejected.  A [[Detroit Police Department|Detroit]] police detective, Alex Murphy, is chosen after he is critically injured in a car bomb explosion arranged by crime boss Antoine Vallon in revenge for Murphy's investigation into his activities. Norton persuades Murphy's wife Clara to sign off on the procedure. Upon waking up and realizing the extent of his transformation, Murphy flies into a rage and escapes from the lab, but Norton shuts him down and brings him back to the lab. As Norton reveals to Murphy that the only remnants of his human body are most of his head (excluding parts of the brain), his respiratory organs, his heart, and his right hand, Murphy is disgusted, and asks for [[euthanasia]]. Norton reminds Murphy about his wife's and son's patience, and convinces him to live on. During combat training with trainer Rick Mattox, Murphy proves unable to compete with the standard OmniCorp drones in efficiency. Norton alters his programming to make him more efficient by having drone programming take over his actions, but make him think they are his.  This increases his efficiency dramatically, but also makes him less [[empathy|empathetic]] due to his human nature being bypassed.  Shortly before he is to be publicly unveiled, Murphy has an [[emotional breakdown]], forcing Norton to remove his emotions. During the ceremony, RoboCop identifies and apprehends a criminal in the crowd. He goes on to reduce crime in Detroit dramatically, simultaneously increasing public support for repealing the Dreyfus Act. Aware that Clara has begun to ask questions, Sellars orders Norton to keep her away from her husband.  Clara nevertheless manages to confront RoboCop, telling him of their son David's nightmares. The experience leads Murphy to override his programming and access the previously sealed files on his attempted murder. From them, he learns his son was devastated after witnessing the explosion. Murphy pursues Vallon's gang to exact revenge. He takes heavy damage from their armor-piercing weapons, but manages to kill the boss and his men. Murphy returns to the station and joins with his old partner, Jack Lewis, to confront the two corrupt cops who betrayed him to Vallon, shooting one and tazing the other. Learning that the [[Chief of police|Chief of Police]] was also involved, Murphy moves to arrest her, but is remotely shut down by Mattox.  With the help of Pat Novak, a pro-OmniCorp talk show host, Sellars uses the incident to get the Dreyfus Act repealed. Clara goes to the press and angrily demands to see her husband. Fearful of being exposed, Sellars orders Mattox to destroy RoboCop while he's being repaired. Norton is able to reach him first and reveals the truth. RoboCop narrowly escapes from the building just as it undergoes lockdown.  Murphy returns and storms the building, fighting his way through the [[RoboCop (franchise)#ED-209|ED-209]] drones sent to stop him, while Lewis and his fellow police arrive to hold off the rest of OmniCorp's forces. Mattox subdues Murphy and prepares to finish him off, but is killed by Lewis. Murphy then makes his way to the roof where Sellars is waiting for a helicopter with Clara and David as hostages. Murphy's programming initially prevents him from arresting Sellars, but he overcomes it long enough to kill Sellars despite being severely wounded.  OmniCorp's parent company, [[Omni Consumer Products (RoboCop)|OCP]], shuts down the project. The [[President of the United States|President]] vetoes the repeal of the Dreyfus Act based on the testimony of Norton, to Novak's anger. Murphy's body is rebuilt in Norton's laboratory, and he waits for Clara and David, who are coming to visit him.  
Robot Overlords
 Not long after the invasion and occupation of Earth by a race of powerful robots wanting human knowledge and ingenuity, humans are confined to their homes. Leaving without permission would be to risk their lives. Monitored by the electronic implants in their necks, the robot sentries are able to track the movement of humans in order to control them. If any person attempts to exit their home, they are given warnings by the robot sentries to return their home. If he or she does not comply within ten seconds, they are killed.  At the beginning of the film, a teen going by the name of Sean Flynn ([[Callan McAuliffe]]), is seeking his father, who went missing not long after the robots invaded, sending out hand-drawn lost posters hidden in tennis balls and fruit. Later, Connor, a friend of Sean's, is seen attempting to repair his [[Playstation]], when Nathan, a young boy, accidentally shocks Connor, while a girl named Alexandra watches. The group discovers that Connor's implant has been turned off by the electrical shock, and then perform the same procedure on each other to stay outside without being tracked down. The group enters a local museum before Sean suggests that they go look for his father, Danny ([[Steven Mackintosh]]) at the school, where the files on all the people are kept. They discover that Danny is still alive, having been moved to a hotel, but are then caught and brought to a room with a deep scanner after their implants reboot. Here, Robin Smythe ([[Ben Kingsley]]) asks them how they turned off their implants. When they refuse to answer, Sean's uncle is brought in, and receives a black implant, before being subjected to a deep scan, a painful process that searches through all of a person's mental faculties before rendering them unable to eat, causing them to die in a few days. When the children still refuse to answer, Sean is also given a black implant before being subjected to a deep scan. In the midst of it, Sean insults Smythe, causing him to accidentally interrupt the deep scan, allowing Sean to escape the deep scanner alive. A few seconds later, Nathan, who had been left outside, bursts in with a makeshift fireworks launcher and frees the other children. The children hide in a bowling alley, where they turn off their implants once again before running to the hotel. When a large robot walks by, the four children hide next to a doorway, where Sean inadvertently controls the robot.  The children then meet Monique, a woman who wants to know how to turn off the implants. In exchange, the boys meet Morse Code Martin ([[Roy Hudd]]), who has had his implant removed by a watchmaker, and also tells the children to go to Stonehenge. However, an announcement reveals that Sean's mother, Kate, has been taken a prisoner in the area headquarters, a castle. With Monique's help, the children successfully get to the castle. However, they are caught by a large robot. Sean then discovers that he can take control of the robots because of his black implant, after discovering that the large robot responds to his movement.   Meanwhile, Smythe is speaking with Kate about how he and she could live together before an alarm goes off. Smythe leaves to go see what has happened. A few moments later, a young guard is tricked into giving the keys to the door to Kate. Meanwhile, outside, Sean appears to have been caught by the large robot, with Smythe scolding him. Sean then turns the large robot's weapon on Smythe and his team, forcing them to drop their weapons, which are picked up by the other children. Kate suddenly dashes by on a horse, causing Smythe and his team to follow. This opens the line of fire for two clankers, insectoid robots with a top-mounted weapon, which destroy the large robot, forcing Sean to hide behind it. One of the clankers then jumps down and prepares to fire at Sean, before Sean takes control of the robot and uses it to destroy the other, before commanding the clanker to deactivate. The children then track down Kate, before heading to Stonehenge, deciphering a message written in graffiti to find the location of a human camp, an old tin mine. Meanwhile, Smythe is told by Mediator 452, a recurring character in the film, that a large number of deep scanners are arriving and that Smythe will be the first to be scanned if Sean is not captured by the time that they arrive. Sean and his friends are seen arriving at the human camp, where Sean is reunited with his father. The small group has their implants removed.  The next day, the robots descend on the community seeking Sean, who is quickly discovered to be missing. Sean is seen reinstalling his black implant, before mentally controlling a robot craft that rams and destroys the cube, the local robot mothership, halting the invasion. He narrowly escapes the impact. He interfaces with a damaged Mediator, a robot in human form, and mentally sends commands to end the invasion of the Earth, destroying the robots and their craft. The film ends with jubilation as the local population celebrates in town. In the closing scene, Sean looks up at the stars.

Rocky & Bullwinkle (2014 film)
 Desperate to finally kill Rocky and Bullwinkle and have them as trophy heads for his rumpus room, Fearless Leader assigns his spies Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale a new mission: to use a robotic female moose to seduce Bullwinkle, and inevitably destroy him (as well as Rocky in the process). Boris controls the robot’s actions through the interior.   When Rocky and Bullwinkle return to Frostbite Falls after escaping from a Mayan temple, they are rewarded with a special day of their honor at a town ceremony, in which Bullwinkle is immediately smitten with Boris’ robot disguise. The two spend time together, with Boris constantly attempting to kill Bullwinkle, only to bring himself bad luck. Meanwhile, Rocky feels isolated from his best friend and follows them wherever they go, until he discovers Bullwinkle has proposed to the robot moose. The narrator tells us to wait for the next part called "Another Fine Moose You've Gotten Me Into!!" or "The Man in the Iron Moose!"  In "Bullwinkle's Poetry Corner," Bullwinkle reads a poem which is actually a rap song by [[Eminem]] (whom he formally introduces by his birth name, Marshall Mathers III), entitled ''[[Superman (Eminem song)|Superman]]'', only to stop reading it after just three words, due to the fact it had swear words in it (which he had been caught by surprise with). Getting embarrassed and finding no way to finish the rest (and trying, to no avail, to try and find another work of his to read), Bullwinkle then skips it, ends the sketch early, and says next week he will read "the complete works of Mr. [[50 Cent|Fifty Cents]]".  Back in story arc, Rocky arrives to crash the wedding on a cruise ship, but Bullwinkle and the robot moose have already been wedded and Bullwinkle dances with the robot to [[Jimmy Soul]]'s  [[If You Wanna Be Happy]]. Rocky then discovers it was Boris who lured Bullwinkle away with romantic gestures, and tries to stop him only for Natasha to intervene by challenging him to a duel. Boris eventually gets fed up with the act while getting hit with a bowling ball and evacuates leaving the robotic bride to explode and kill Bullwinkle. However, he falls back down after finding out his parachute has been taken by Fearless Leader, and falls into the ocean with Natasha. Rocky is able to save Bullwinkle in the last minute, knocking the robot moose off the ship to explode into Boris and Natasha’s faces, before the two spies are immediately eaten by a shark. Bullwinkle makes amends with his buddy and they swear never to let anything come between them again, only for Rocky to fall in love with a female explosive mechanical squirrel. In a mid-credits scene Fearless Leader tries to find his bowling ball and he asks his mother if she saw it in which she replies "Did you look in your killer robot?".

Sam then makes his way to his own home and finds the media coverage is interfering with his daily life, and he eventually succumbs to alcoholism, as far as showing up intoxicated at his firm; acting erratically and kissing his receptionist in a drunken state, for which his employer is advising him to take time off to better cope with the situation.  Two years later, Sam has removed himself from his former life and  is now living on a sailboat on a lake, far from home, having taken a job as a contractor's assistant and for the most part drinking away his free time. His habits are causing habitual lateness and annoying his employer, who cautions Sam about repeated lateness. Getting up to relieve himself from the side of the boat has caught the chagrin of the governing board of the lake and the "wrath" of Alaird Dupree (because it is openly visible to other tenants and the small seafood restaurant nearby), the agent acting on behalf of the board. It is clear he dislikes Sam, and the feeling is very much mutual. Going for a drink with some coworkers after his day of working, he hides the details of his previous life and his true identity from everyone, even making up humorous stories about his past. (He tells his coworkers that he "fingered" Gotti and is in the protection of the Federal Witness Protection Program), Sam notices that "The Trill" tavern hosts open mic events for musicians.   Returning to the marina, he encounters Emily waiting for him, who says she is moving to Tulsa and is now the mother of a new son. She requires his signature to place their former house up for sale. She has also brought the remainder of Josh's possessions—demo discs, instruments and gear—which Sam emphatically states he has no room for on his tiny sailboat. Emily tells him she was certain he would want it because they had played together since Josh was younger. Hours pass after Emily leaves. He tries his best to ignore the collection of his son's possessions over a meal. He storms over to where Emily had left it beside the road and begins to place it in a dumpster but stops, noticing the notebooks and discs, and begins to listen to them back on the boat, and read through the collection of lyrics and writings Josh left behind. He even begins to teach himself some his son's material. After work the next day, Sam decides to perform "Home", one of Josh's songs, at The Trill, and catches the attention of Quentin (Anton Yelchin), a young guitarist who was excitedly moved by the performance.  The next day, Quentin brings Sam coffee and food and discusses the previous night performance, stating he believes there are other songs, and if there are, they could perform them together. Sam declares he is not interested, and continues to listen to more and teach himself his son's material.  Quentin tries again the next day and shows him an alternate arrangement possibility for the song. The two end up sharing a meal and playing instruments together for the rest of the night. Sam neglects to tell Quentin that he was not the piece's actual author. At the end of the night, Quentin gets Sam to agree to perform together at The Trill, adding more and more to each arrangement, including a percussion section in the way of Aiken. The next day, Sam is introduced to Del (Laurence Fishburne), the owner and operator of the local music supply store, who reveals that he is selling his business and plans to retire and tour by motor home with his wife in his later years. Quentin shows Sam the 1978 Gibson Les Paul hanging in the store, but is unable to afford it (a source of good-natured joking between Quentin and Del). Upon leaving the store, Sam watches a staged meeting between Quentin and Willy, a bass guitarist, in hopes that they can include him in their performances, but Sam is resistant to starting a band. The next day, the quartet meeting to practice in Quentin's garage beneath his apartment, and Quentin is very evasive about his own past. The group, now complete, has impressed The Trill owner (played by director William H. Macy) who asks them to perform regular Saturday nights as house entertainment, to which the band agrees—even Sam, reluctantly. The new name, “Rudderless”, quickly gains notoriety and local fame. Meanwhile, Quentin is revealed as extremely shy of the opposite sex, which Sam attempts to help him through, though Quentin finds the advice generally unhelpful.  Sam arrives at Quentin's apartment one afternoon and meets his mother, Joyce, who Sam mistakes as an older prostitute after seeing Quentin hand her a small amount of cash as they hug. Quentin is embarrassed because his mother has had issues with (unspecified) responsibilities, even spending his junior year of high school living in a car, and has vowed never to lower himself to that level of poverty again. At the mall, Sam buys Quentin new clothing to give him a style, and develop confidence from it. It does help a little, and Quentin begins to enjoy the attention Rudderless has gained him.  Following the show, as the band members are to go to a party, Sam sees Kate—now calling herself by her middle name, Ann, who shames him for playing the songs in public. The next day, Sam visits Josh's grave and finds it vandalized as Josh Manning is revealed to have been the killer in the  school shooting incident where he died. Emily arrives with cleaning supplies, and implies its a fairly regular occurrence, and the two parents begin to clean off the graffiti from the headstone. Afterward, the two share some tequila, and its revealed that today is Josh's birthday. Emily tells Sam that a couple of the other parents have reached out to her to forgive them for Josh's actions, but Sam still appears to be in denial.  Emily insists that they had acted properly in their parental roles and they have nothing to feel guilty for and that Josh had to have been mentally ill to carry out such an act of violence.  Continuing to drink into the Saturday he is scheduled to work, Sam goes to his job and, finding a yard hammock, falls asleep. His employer finds and fires him. Sam assures him that he had already quit and walks away. Later that day, the other members of the band arrive with girls, and spend the afternoon on Sam's boat. As Sam goes below, the other members plead with him about a local block party they have been invited to play, and its entirely possible it could lead to bigger and better opportunities for Rudderless in the way of airplay and exposure. But Sam is reluctant, now knowing that Josh's songs would never be accepted when people find out the truth of their authorship.  Sam visits Del the next day to acquire a new amplifier tube, and finds Del and wife Tina having gotten the RV stuck. Sam manages to get it out onto the street. Del asks him why he will not play the show, and Sam begins to question why he is really doing all of this. He arrives at Quentin's garage and insists that the song Quentin wrote will be the final song, finally pushing him out of his comfort zone.    Feeling good about the outcome, Sam makes his way toward the street stage and is surprised to find Kate/Ann talking to the other three members on the stage, presumably telling them the actual origin of the songs they all assumed Sam wrote.  She confronts him and tells him that the incident and her association with it had so interfered with her life that she had to change her name and leave school.  She had been pursued and harassed by people and media alike, asking humiliating questions, even suggesting they had been members of a cult. Quentin asks Sam if it was true, and Sam acknowledges the truth for the first time. Quentin outright refuses to play the material and strikes Sam as he is walking away despite the other two trying to persuade him to play the material one time only, and then move on. Sam again goes into a drinking binge and returns home to the marina to find the Board had the area sealed with a chain link fence. Sam attempts to climb it and falls over to the opposite side, breaking the guitar neck of his guitar strapped to his back, ruining it.   The next morning, the scheduled sailing regatta Alaird warned him about is loudly underway. The sailboat procession is disrupted by Sam playing the 1812 Overture on his electric, sailing directly into the course of the other boats, and casting some over the sides of their own craft, for which Sam is arrested. He calls Del to bail him out and is surprised when Del tells him he knew who he was the entire time, but did not know the songs were written by Josh. The next day, Sam visits the site of the shooting, and finds the erected memorial identifying the shooting victims by name. Sam breaks down in tears of grief over the guilt of Josh's actions, but finally accepts that he has lost his own son despite what he has done. Sam then visits Emily, bring her Josh's discs, and says that one day, the new baby will want to know who his half brother was beyond what history will paint him to be.  Sam then visits Del's store and discovers Quentin has discarded his instruments, telling Del to sell them on consignment. Sam then asks if the offer on the store was a "good offer", implying that Sam would be interested in buying Del's store. He then goes to visit Quentin at the donut shop where he works, and implores him to continue playing and writing even if it is without Sam. Sam tells him that he found performing Josh's material addictive, offering catharsis to his life and the bond with Josh. He concludes the visit, having brought back Quentin's guitar cases. One contains the Les Paul that Quentin so long idolized and wanted.  Finally, Sam performs the songs he had been working on, first admitting and telling the audience who Josh was, what he had done, and that he had written the song he was about to play. Closure for Rudderless lets us see Sam has been replaced by a new guitarist. Del has been given Sam's sailboat (presumably in payment), and Emily finally decides to listen to Josh's music.    Sam completes the song, including (presumably) improvised lyrics about missing his son in the song's climax and leaves the stage.

The Royal Tailor
 The film starts with a modern-day press conference, in which Jo Dol-seok is introduced as the only royal tailor, who single-handedly revolutionized the fashion of Korea's [[Joseon]] dynasty. Before one of his works is shown, the scene changes to the kingdom of [[Joseon]], where a different story is told: Jo Dol-seok has tailored clothes for three generations of kings before finally becoming the head of the [[Sanguiwon]], the department responsible for the royal attire. Jo was born a commoner, and looks forward to upgrading his social status after serving the royal family for thirty years. Careful to use the traditional rules and patterns, Dol-seok denies the Queen's request when she asks him to replace the king's robe that was accidentally burnt by a [[gungnyeo]] (female attendant). He insists that to do so would be against court customs, but also simply impossible in the short time before the robe is needed. Anxious to cover her mistake, the Queen looks for a designer elsewhere. She is introduced to Lee Gong-jin, a young designer whose good looks and expertise at making unconventional [[hanbok]]s have charmed many women in the capital. He invented the bell-shaped design of hanboks and introduced new colors. Gong-jin falls in love with the Queen at first sight and uses his extraordinary gift as a tailor to save the dress. He subsequently becomes a tailor at the Sanguiwon and begins a prosperous career. He repeatedly uses his craft to support the Queen, who is at risk of being dethroned and replaced because she and the King - who never visits her - have no children.  Soon Dol-seok becomes jealous of the young designer's talent, whose creativeness he cannot rival with his use of the traditional shapes. He fears his own position will be undermined. He lets the King use him to frame Gong-jin for attempting to assassinate the King. The King then tries to lay the blame on the Queen for inciting the young tailor, but Gong-jin saves the Queen by claiming he acted on his own motives. Even when the young designer awaits his execution, the head tailor vows to have his name erased from history. Only when Gong-jin is dead, not only the queen, but eventually also Dol-seok silently mourn his death.   At the end of the film, women of Joseon are seen wearing Gong-jin's bell-shaped, merrily colored hanboks. In the last shot, Gong-jin's design of the queen's royal ceremonial dress is shown at the modern press conference, but as was hinted in the first scene, it is wrongly attributed to Jo Dol-seok.

Sabotage (2014 film)
 John "Breacher" Wharton is the leader of the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]]'s Special Operations Team, which consists of James "Monster" Murray, Monster's wife Lizzy Murray, Joe "Grinder" Philips, Julius "Sugar" Edmonds, Eddie "Neck" Jordan, Tom "Pyro" Roberts, Bryce "Tripod" McNeely and "Smoke" Jennings.  During a raid on a cartel warehouse, Smoke is killed, the team steals $10 million and hides it in the sewer while blowing up the rest to cover their tracks. The money disappears, and their superior Floyd Demel suspends them while the DEA investigates the team for the theft. After several months without any confessions or evidence of their participation, the team is reinstated.  Pyro is killed after an unidentified stranger tows his trailer onto a railroad crossing while he is unconscious and is rammed by a train before he can escape. [[Atlanta Police Department|Atlanta Police]] homicide detective Caroline Brentwood and her partner Darius Jackson are assigned to the case and interrogate Pyro's teammates.  Brentwood notes Neck is aggressively avoiding interrogation, and Breacher accompanies her to Neck's house, hopeful he will cooperate. When they arrive, they find him nailed to the ceiling and disemboweled. Brentwood recognizes the execution as the ''[[modus operandi]]'' of the cartels, leading Breacher to assume the cartel is hunting the team over the stolen money.  Breacher and Brentwood visit Tripod, who left the DEA after being suspended, and find him dead after a shootout in which he killed an assailant Breacher identified as a cartel enforcer. Monster later visits Brentwood, who is suspicious of Breacher. Monster tells her that Breacher's family was kidnapped by the cartels, who videotaped their murders and later sent the tape to Breacher along with the severed body parts of his wife and son. Breacher spent months searching for his family's killers before the team convinced him to move on. Brentwood apologizes to Breacher, and they have sex.  Jackson traces the dead enforcer's cellphone to a cartel [[safe house]], which is raided by Breacher and his team, but the enforcers are not there. They are later found dead at the bottom of a river near Tripod's house, and Detective Brentwood realizes that they were killed before Pyro and Neck, meaning someone is framing the cartel for killing their team members.  Breacher reunites the team to tell them what happened, and Lizzy lashes out and reveals she's been having an affair with Sugar. Grinder confides in Brentwood that they stole the money. Breacher and Brentwood meet with Grinder in a local restaurant and Lizzy kills Grinder using a sniper rifle. Lizzy and Sugar have been behind the murders of their teammates. Lizzy is putting together her gear to leave the country with Sugar when Monster figures out she's behind the murders. He destroys Lizzy's passport to prevent her from leaving the country, and Lizzy attacks him with a knife, killing him.  Breacher and Brentwood go to Lizzy's house and find Monster's body stuffed in a refrigerator. Lizzy calls Breacher, pretending to be alone, and arranges a meeting at a parking garage. Breacher goes there with Detective Brentwood, who ducks down in the car, unseen. Lizzy and Sugar ambush Breacher, and Brentwood assists Breacher. Lizzy and Sugar drive away, pursued by Breacher and Brentwood. After a lengthy chase, Sugar and Lizzy's car crashes into a tow truck, the ramp decapitating Sugar.  Breacher and Brentwood confront a dying Lizzy, who accuses the team of stealing the money behind her back, motivating her to seek revenge. Brentwood is puzzled, assuming Lizzy had stolen the money. Breacher tells the dying Lizzy that he took the money. Lizzy tries to reach for her weapon and Breacher kills her. The local cops arrive and Breacher disappears.  Weeks later, Breacher is in Mexico, where he uses the stolen money to bribe a corrupt police official into helping him identify Brujo, the man who murdered his family. Breacher finds him in a Mexican bar and kills him and others loyal to him in a shootout and he is shot in the chest. Breacher sits at a table, takes a shot of whiskey, lights up one last cigar and smiles as he hears the sirens.  
Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno
 In Settsu Mine, [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], [[Saitō Hajime]] leads the Japanese police in tracking [[Shishio Makoto]], a notorious renegade who was betrayed by the government after he had helped them defeat the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] during the [[Battle of Toba–Fushimi]]. However, Shishio's men massacre through the police, telling Saitō his plan to conquer Japan.  After the events of [[Rurouni Kenshin (film)|the first film]], [[Himura Kenshin]] continues to live in the [[kendo]] dojo of [[Kamiya Kaoru]] alongside [[Myōjin Yahiko]], [[Sagara Sanosuke]], and [[Takani Megumi]]. He is called by a government official to track down Shishio, who is terrorizing [[Kyoto]] and its surroundings. Though he declines the request at first, he relents when the official is murdered by [[Seta Sōjirō]], Shishio's underling. Just after Kenshin's departure, an individual arrives at [[Tokyo]] and searches for him, beating Sanosuke along the way.  While on the way, Kenshin meets with [[Makimachi Misao]], who attempts to steal his sakabato. While the two converse, they are alerted by a boy to the plight of his parents and brother, all of whom are killed by Shishio's men for trying to report their atrocities to their village to the authorities. Kenshin beats Shishio's men, though his identity as [[Four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu|Hitokiri]] Battōsai is revealed. Kenshin is taken to Shishio himself, the latter ordering Sōjiro to duel Kenshin, which ends with Sōjiro breaking Kenshin's sakabato. As he leaves the scene, Kenshin urges the villagers, including the orphaned boy, not to take their revenge against Shishio's men. Arriving at Kyoto, Kenshin is asked by Misao, who is impressed by his words, to take shelter at an inn run by [[Kashiwazaki Nenji]], actually a semi-retired [[ninja]] called Okina once employed by the Tokugawa shogunate; Misao herself is also an aspiring ninja. Okina warns Kenshin that a lieutenant of his, [[Shinomori Aoshi]] (the one who beat Sanosuke previously), has made his life goal to kill the strongest man in Japan—Kenshin.  Meanwhile, Kaoru decides to follow Kenshin to Kyoto, accompanied by Yahiko and Sanosuke. At the same time, Kenshin discovers to his dismay that the person who made his sakabato, Arai Shakku has died years before. His son, Seiku, initially refuses Kenshin's plea for another sakabato, but when Shishio's elite warrior, [[Sawagejō Chō]], kidnaps his baby, Seiku asks Kenshin to defeat him. Seiku gives him a twin of the previous sakabato, which Kenshin uses to defeat Chō. By interrogating Chō, the government learns that Shishio plans to raze Kyoto to the ground that night. The government police, together with Kenshin, the ninja, and the newly-arrived Kaoru, Yahiko, and Sanosuke, battle Shishio's men, while to prevent Aoshi from interfering Kenshin, Okina challenges his former pupil into a duel, which ends in his defeat. However, Kenshin realizes that Shishio's main goal is to set fire not to Kyoto, but [[Tokyo]].  Kenshin discovers Shishio's ship about to set sail to the capital after learning that Sōjirō has kidnapped Kaoru. There, he has an inconclusive battle with Shishio, which ends when Kaoru is thrown off board. Kenshin jumps to the sea, but is unable to locate her. The next morning, a mysterious man finds Kenshin's unconscious body on the beach and carries him away.  
Rurouni Kenshin: The Legend Ends
  In a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Hiko Seijūrō finds young Shinta digging graves for bandits and slavers killed in battle. Shinta explains that all people are only bodies after death. Hiko decides to take Shinta as his student and names him "Kenshin". Kenshin wakes up at Master Hiko's home, and asks if his friend (Kaoru) was also washed up. He has been unconscious for three days, and master tells him that his friend is most likely dead. Kenshin asks to learn the final ''Hiten Mitsurugi'' technique, "''Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki''", in order to defeat Shishio Makoto and prevent his onslaught. Hiko agrees, and the two engage in a duel to start his training.  Shishio appears off the Tokyo coast in a large black iron-clad battleship, and demands that the prime minister visit him to discuss the situation. After inviting the ministers to join him for food, one of them loses his temper, and is killed by one of Shishio's men. The prime minister tries to restore order and decorum, but Shishio takes them prisoner when they try to leave - killing all the government men apart from the prime minister. Shishio demands that Battousai be brought to him for the life of the prime minister. Fujita is still searching for Battousai, and is disgusted with the way the government is handling the matter by giving in to blackmail from Shishio.  Yahiko finds a poster demanding "Battousai" Kenshin be arrested, which he and Sagara realise suggests that Kenshin must still be alive, and they leave for Tokyo and the Kamiya Dojo with Misao to find him and search for Kaoru. A young woman approaches them with a scarf as they are leaving, which Misao recognises as one she bandaged Kaoru with and they rush off. They appear outside a hospital and enter to find Kaoru unconscious and alive.  Kenshin is unable to understand what is missing in himself, and so engages in another duel with Master Hiko. He learns that he had thrown away his will to live during his time as the assassin Battousai, and as he has no intention of coming out alive he will be unable to defeat Shishio. Hiko points out that he has lost his killer instinct with his oath to not kill and his "ridiculous" sword, after all it is the strong who survive and the weak who die.  That night, Hiko says that something is missing in Kenshin, and that he will be given the night to think about it. If he cannot find what it is, he will die tomorrow. Next morning Hiko reveals his final task as Master to Kenshin - without realising what is missing, Kenshin will return to his old ways and so Hiko has to kill Battousai. Kenshin listens as he is told that he cannot learn the secret until he realises that the will to live is paramount; and so he has learned the secret of ''Amakakeru''.   Kaoru awakes from her coma, and as Kenshin concludes his training and is about to depart, Misao arrives with the news. She also tells Kenshin that he has been branded a wanted criminal throughout Japan for his work as Battousai during the Bakumatsu era. Knowing that Shishio intends to take Tokyo next, Kenshin intends to return home by a secret route given to him by the Oniwabanshu at the Aoiya Inn. They discover that Okina has gone on ahead and encountered Aoshi, who was lying in wait for Kenshin on that route. Kenshin and Misao arrive and Kenshin duels with Aoshi, during which Okina dies of his wounds. Back at the Aoiya, Misao tends to Aoshi and convinces him to return to the Oniwabanshu. On Shishio's battleship, Shishio, his partner Yumi, and one of his men Hori, discover that because of Shishio's inability to sweat, he can only fight for fifteen minutes without putting his health at risk.  Kenshin arrives back at the Kamiya Kashin dojo. Megumi, who has been looking after the dojo in Kaoru's absence, welcomes him back, but shortly after his arrival police arrive to apprehend him. Wishing to prevent further violence, he surrenders, and is taken to the Home Ministry head, Ito. Ito explains that he had tried to talk Shishio into abandoning his plan to overthrow the Meiji government, but the negotiations had ended in disaster and Shishio, still bitter about his cruel treatment by the new government (being burned alive), would only leave the government be for the time being if Kenshin were arrested and executed. Otherwise, he intends to attack Tokyo. Kenshin convinces Ito that he can defeat Shishio if Ito helps him. Ito seemingly decides to go through with the execution anyway. Kaoru, Sano and Yahiko return to Tokyo soon after and, to their horror, discover that Kenshin is to be executed the same day. Shishio's men attend the execution to ensure that Ito carries through with the negotiations.  The execution, however, is merely staged, and Kenshin is freed and assisted in defeating the men by Hajime Saito. Sano joins them, and the three are rowed to Shishio's battleship. While searching for Shishio, Kenshin meets Seta Soujiro again and the two rematch. Kenshin comes out victorious, and Soujiro, who originally believed Kenshin to be weak, is crushed and confused. Kenshin finally finds Shishio, Yumi and Hori waiting in the ship's hold. a duel ensues between Kenshin and Shishio, who easily overpowers Kenshin. Saito arrives immediately after, followed by Sano and Aoshi, who followed them from Kyoto, but even the four together are no match for Shishio. Shishio hits his limit and Yumi attempts to shield him from Kenshin while Shishio stabs both of them, killing her. Meanwhile, Ito's men begin firing at the ship, intending to sink it and drown Shishio and Kenshin inside. Shishio condemns Kenshin for helping such a government. Kenshin agrees that the new Meiji government is faulty, but argues that the age of assassins like himself and Shishio is over and that there should be no more violence. He manages to defeat Shishio using Amakakeru, though not physically harming him. Shishio, who has long hit his limit and whose body has become overheated, catches fire and burns to death before the group's eyes.  Saito, Aoshi, Sano and Kenshin escape from the ship before it sinks and are brought back to shore, where Kaoru, Yahiko, Misao and the Home Ministry are waiting. Ito acknowledges Kenshin as Kenshin for the first time and declares Battousai dead, and his men salute the group as heroes. Aoshi and Misao return to Kyoto, and Kaoru, Kenshin, Yahiko and Sano return to the dojo. Kaoru notes the change of season, as well as the end of Kenshin's life as Battousai. Kenshin expresses his desire to continue living at the dojo and to move forward into the new era, and invites Kaoru to move forward with him.

They were sent by the Pope of Sanctuary in order to kill him for treason. Aiolos was struck down, and Saga died during the struggle.

With his last Cosmo, Aiolos shows Mitsumasa that the Pope branded Aiolos a traitor and he escaped with the baby in order to save her. The baby is the reincarnation of the goddess Athena. He also explains that in sixteen years, brave young men known as Saints will arise to protect her. Aiolos then succumbs to his wounds, leaving the Sagittarius Gold Cloth behind.  Sixteen years later, Saori Kido ([[Ayaka Sasaki]]), a young girl troubled by her mysterious powers, is being driven by Tatsumi. He explains that Mitsumasa, Saori's late adoptive grandfather, kept her safe all these years and learns she is the reincarnation of the Goddess Athena and the existence of the Saints. However, they are suddenly attacked by Saints. Saori is saved by the Bronze Saint Pegasus Seiya ([[Kaito Ishikawa]]) from an assassin sent to kill her. Seiya's friends and fellow Bronze Saints Cygnus Hyōga ([[Kenshō Ono]]), Dragon Shiryū ([[Kenji Akabane]]), Andromeda Shun ([[Nobuhiko Okamoto]]), also arrive to rescue her as her protectors.  That night at the Kido Mansion, the Leo Gold Saint Aiolia ([[Gō Inoue]]), arrives to retrieve his brother's Sagittarius Cloth and kill Saori as a fake Athena. After the Bronze Saints are defeated, Tatsumi hands over the Sagittarius Cloth, but not before Saori displays her Cosmo. With newfound doubt, Aiolia leaves, asking Saori to come to Sanctuary to prove she is Athena. Upon learning of her destination from Seiya and his friends, she agrees to wage war against its Pope and travel to the Sanctuary. Before they can leave however, the Sagitta Silver Saint shoots an arrow at Saori before running away, pursued by Shiryu. However, he is ambushed and burned alive by Phoenix Ikki ([[Kenji Nojima]]) before he can report back to the Pope.   Seiya, alongside his friends arrive at the Sanctuary, heading straight towards the Aries Palace where they encounter Aries Mu ([[Mitsuru Miyamoto]]). After a brief misunderstanding, Mu allows them passage though the Palace. At the Taurus Palace, Seiya defeats Alderaban ([[Rikiya Koyama]]) before the teenagers discover that both Aldebaran and Mu are their allies. They agree to watch over Athena while the Bronze Saints go through the rest of the Palaces.  At the Cancer Palace, Cancer Deathmask ([[Hiroaki Hirata]]) teleports Hyoga and Shiryu to the entrance to the Underworld, but Hyoga is rescued by his master, Aquarius Camus ([[Daisuke Namikawa]]), and ends up in the Aquarius Temple. There, Hyoga battles his master and is victorious, with Camus' final words being "protect Athena". Meanwhile, Seiya and Shun arrive at the Leo Palace where Aiolia attacks them mercilessly. At the entrance to the Underworld, Deathmask's Gold Cloth abandons him after it discovers his evil nature. Shiryu removes his own Cloth and successfully kills Deathmask. He is then teleported back to the Cancer Palace alongside Hyoga.  As Seiya and Shun struggle against Aiolia, the Virgo Gold Saint Shaka ([[Mitsuaki Madono]]) comes to their rescue, stopping Aiolia and allowing the Bronze Saints to continue. Once at the Scorpio Palace, Seiya and Shun are attacked by Scorpio Miro ([[Masumi Asano]]), with the battle escalating all the way to the Sagittarius Palace, with Capricorn Shura waiting for them. Back at the Cancer Palace, Saori arrives with Mu and Aldebaran and revives the unconscious Shiryu and Hyoga, even though she is weakened. While Seiya and Shun struggle with Miro and Shura, respectively, Ikki comes to Shun's rescue and engages Shura in his stead, but all three Bronze Saints are defeated. Milo then discovers Aiolos' testament, entrusting the Bronze Saints with Athena's life.  The surviving Gold Saints, alongside Hyoga, Shiryu, and Saori arrive. Shaka reveals that the Pope put Aioria under an illusion, explaining why he attacked Seiya and Shun at the Leo Temple. Shaka also reveals that the Pope is the real traitor within Sanctuary.  Saori, Shiryu, Hyoga, and Shun join their Cosmo to revive Seiya. Pisces Aphrodite ([[Takuya Kirimoto]]) speaks to the Pope about the current situation, but is killed by the Pope. Sanctuary is then attacked by the Pope who reveals himself to be Gemini Saga, who faked his death sixteen years ago. He reveals to the Saints that he tried to kill Athena all those years ago but was stopped by Aiolos. Now he plans to take control of the universe. He brings a giant statue to life and the Gold Saints join forces to destroy it, while Seiya faces Saga alone.  Seiya burns his Cosmo to reach the mythical Seventh Sense and gains the upper hand, but Saga merges himself with another giant statue and prepares to destroy Athena and everyone in Sanctuary. Suddenly, the Sagittarius Cloth covers Seiya and he is able to rescue Saori. With Saori in his arms, Seiya confronts Saga one last time and saves her from Saga's curse. He shoots a powerful arrow and destroy Saga, saving Sanctuary and the world. Saori, now in control of Sanctuary, addresses all the Saints, thanking Seiya and his friends for rescuing her.

Saivam
 Kathiresan ([[Nassar]]) is the head of a large family which consists of three of his sons and a daughter and their respective families. Everyone get together at his house for a vacation. When the entire family goes to their temple on a given day, some ill-fated events occur. The family thinks it is because it had forgotten to perform a ritual sacrifice which involved the slaughter of a rooster known as Pappa (a rooster), which was part of their poultry. This thought is fueled all the more by each family member blaming this to be the cause for all their problems both at home and at work.  Kathiresan decides to sacrifice Pappa in the upcoming festival, and the family rests assured that all their problems will disappear eventually after the ritual. Then, suddenly, Pappa goes missing.  The members of the family are aghast at Pappa's disappearance and begin searching for it. It turns out that Kathiresan's granddaughter Tamizhselvi ([[Sara Arjun]]) hides Pappa in the attic in order to save it from getting slaughtered. Tamizhselvi loves Pappa so much that she cannot stand to see it die. The rest of the story revolves around Tamizhselvi's attempts to save Pappa from being slaughtered and the family's attempts to find the rooster and performing the ritual. In doing so, the film showcases the lost values of family tradition and a child's innocent love for a rooster.  The climax and ending of the movie properly light the shades of character shown as dark earlier. Though parts of the movie seemed a bit dramatic but the ending completes the circle of an idea created from the movie and its title to a real incident in the life of director Vijay's mom.  
Saints and Soldiers: The Void
  In May 1945, remnants of the  German Army continue fight on in the [[Harz|Harz mountains]], nicknamed "The Void" by American troops. An American [[M18 Hellcat]] [[tank destroyer]], "The Avenging Angel", fires on a German prison and liberates the Allied prisoners held there, including Lieutenant Goss (Ben Urie). The next day the prisoners are to be transported to the rear by Sergeant Jesse Owens (K. Danor Gerald) and Private Perry (Alex Boye). Owens is not respected by some of the white soldiers because he is an [[African Americans|African-American]], and rumors have spread that he had once assaulted a white officer with an axe.  Captain Briton McConkie orders Sergeant John Atwood, commander of the Angel, and Max Whitaker, to take their respective tanks to clear the roads of any Germans to protect Owens' and Perry's convoy. The two tanks travel along the roads, with some tension arising between Private Daniel Barlow ([[Matt Meese]]) and Rodney Mitchell, who is religious. Corporal Carey Simms ([[Adam Gregory]]) stops the arguments.  Goss, who is riding in Owens' truck, has disturbing flashbacks of a brutal German commander who killed his comrades and captured Goss. Goss then is offered to ride up front with Owens, and he is sympathetic over his unfair treatment because of his race. The convoy comes across a fake body in the road, and then a hidden German [[Panzer III]] tank fires, destroying Perry's truck, killing everyone inside. The Germans open fire at Owens' truck, and he and Goss manage to escape. The two run into the Angel and the other tank, and Simms and Barlow continue to criticize Owens.  Atwood and Goss travel back to the trucks, where they spot the German tank. Simms discovers they are too far away from base to contact them, so Atwood and Whitaker decide to destroy the tank themselves. Atwood lets Owens ride up front with Mitchell, while he takes the gunner position and Barlow is in charge of the ammunition. They create a diversion by letting the Germans see them while Whitaker takes his tank and fires at it. He manages to immobilize it, but the two Allied tanks are ambushed by two other hidden German tanks. The Germans destroy Whitaker's tank, who escapes seriously injured, while the rest of his squad has been killed. Atwood is shot and killed by pursuing German troops, while the rest escape.  Goss, who had stayed behind, finds Whitaker, who gives him his weapon. Goss finds the surviving crew of the Angel, who are debating who should take command now that Atwood is dead. Goss and Mitchell suggest Owens take command, since he is a Sergeant and has previous experience with tanks, but Simms assumes command by justifying that it is a segregated army. He forces Barlow into the gunner position, despite having lacked experience, and begins to grill Owens once more. Owens reveals his father fought in [[World War I]] and was awarded by France, but not by the United States. When he requested respect, he was lynched by his town. Owens then explains that although African-Americans do so much for America, they never get the respect the deserve.  After this moment, Barlow spots a German tank that had snuck up on them, and he and Mitchell drive the Angel behind an abandoned mill while Simms and Owens take cover. Goss leaves to cover for the four troops. The two other German tanks begin advancing toward the Angel, while the one Whitaker shot is repaired. Owens, Goss and Simms catch up to Barlow and Mitchell, and decide to stay behind the mill while the Germans plan to lure them out. Owens finds a radio wire and gives it to Simms, who manages to contact base with it. He informs them that Atwood is dead and they are trapped by the three German tanks. Captain McConkie orders reinforcements for the Angel.  Owens convinces Simms to join him in taking a nearby cannon to destroy the tanks before they can pursue them any further, and Goss leaves to cause more distractions. The two manage to get the cannon, but miss the tank as it fires at them. Goss infiltrates one of the German tanks and kills all its passengers. Barlow and Mitchell destroy another tank but the Angel's gun gets hit and disabled, causing the two to flee. The German commander who had captured Goss before gathers troops to seek out the group on foot. Owens and Simms go into an old house and discover Germans planning for battle. After engaging in a brief firefight, the two clear the room and plan on what to do with the third tank, which has been repaired and operating.  Before doing so, Owens confesses that he did actually attack a white officer, in retaliation for forcing Owens' squad into a suicide mission that left everyone but him dead. Simms begins to understand why Owens is the way he is. Meanwhile, Goss encounters the commander and his squad and is wounded, but the commander is shot and killed by his own soldier in revenge for killing his comrade. The soldiers then surrender to Goss.  After Barlow holds off an attacking squad of Germans, Simms has him light rags on fire to make it look as if the Angel is in bad shape. Mitchell then drives the tank in range of the German, while Owens prepares a [[Panzerfaust]] for a kill shot that he may not survive. Simms knows this and provides cover fire for him, but eventually has to jump out a window when Germans throw a grenade at him. Owens fires a missile right up through the bottom of the German tank, destroying it, but causes debris to rain down on him. Reinforcements arrive, and Owens has survived. Goss and Whitaker, who both survived their wounds and are taken to medical care. Owens is told by a commander that Simms has looked up to him, and sees him as an example, mirroring the relationship between [[Saints and Soldiers|Nathan Greer and Steven Gould in the first film]]. Barlow and Mitchell reconcile from their previous arguments, and Simms and Owens befriend one another.

These manuscripts kept and preserved the heritage of musical works until their reproduction and publication as printed scores. Over the course of fifty years  his music collection swelled to 20,000 titles in 4,500 manuscripts and 1,200 printed copies, making it the most comprehensive collection of its kind anywhere. <ref>Peter Schmitz and Andrea Ammendola (editors): ''Sammeln – Komponieren – Bearbeiten. Der römische Abbate Fortunato Santini im Spiegel seines Schaffens'' [Catalog of the Fortunato Santini exhibition in Münster, from September 15 to December 31, 2011], Münster 2011</ref> Santini’s secret in preserving all these important works from the history of European music is the elaborate network of friends and acquaintances that he builds. Beginning in the libraries and among the ''cognoscenti'' of Italy, its reach extends throughout Europe, stretching from Rome to Vienna, from Paris to London, from Berlin to Moscow. Through his networking skills during his lifetime Santini became an international celebrity in the world of music  Compositions of the first importance in music history, otherwise at risk of disappearing into oblivion, were rescued and preserved through his unremitting efforts.

After finding the exact location of the safe, Krishnanunni found out that the safe can be only unlocked with 3 keys through the safe blueprint, each of them with Pius, Christo and Franko (Mukundhan). For that, the gang planned of making a duplicate of those 3 keys by imprinting the keys onto a soap piece. They found out that Christo had kept his key in a glass [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]], Pius carried the key on a chain, and Franko had it in his car.  After successfully distracting them and getting the key imprints, Krishnanunni planned to do the heist during a festival. That night, he told Leaf Vasu to put [[fireworks]] in the sewage tank of the charity hospital, which gave them access to the back of the hospital. He told Annamma to cut off the main supply so that they could get access to the room where the safe is, through the exhaust fan. After successfully getting to the room, they unlocked the safe. What they didn't know was the safe was connected to an alarm, which alerted the three of them. They chased the sewage trucks where they had put the money, but failing. The gang meet up on the side of the road, but Krishnanunni is missing. It is revealed that Krishnanunni had went off with the money.  The story comes back to the present, where Martin was explaining his story to the priest. He explained that the gang had searched for Krishnanunni, but they were surprised to see another person with the same name ([[Indrajith Sukumaran|Indrajith]]). After some days, each of them from the gang got a box with solar panels on the top. When they opened it, they found the money given as a share by Krishnanunni for the heist, later crying in joy. Then it is revealed that the Krishnanunni who helped them in the heist was actually a con-man. Then he was shown working on a new heist disguised as a business man dealing solar panels.

One day, he goes to his firm's biggest client, Chandrasekar ([[Aadukalam Naren]]) to present an ambitious theme park project plan that he had been preparing for months. It is then when Vikram and his colleague see Chandrasekar's rebellious daughter enter the office to demand for money, embarrassing him in front of everyone. Having lost his mood, Chandrasekar coldly rejects Vikram's plan. Vikram gets drunk and then goes to Chandrasekar's beach house to vandalize it. Instead, he sees Chandrasekar's daughter running away. Vikram follows her to a nearby hotel and confronts her about her father's behaviour. She introduces herself as Shruti (Salony Luthra)<ref>http://makkalmurasu.com/%E0%AE%9A%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%8B%E0%AE%A9%E0%AE%BF-%E0%AE%B2%E0%AF%81%E0%AE%A4%E0%AF%8D%E0%AE%B0%E0%AE%BE/</ref> and reveals that she dislikes her father just as much as Vikram does because he is a materialistic corporate man. Shruti follows Vikram home, where she proposes that he pretend to abduct her in order to extort ransom money from Chandrasekar. Vikram initially refuses. However, he learns from his superior at work the next day that Chandrasekar had a change of heart and has approved his theme park plan in condition that the firm has a more experienced project manager head the project. Vikram becomes ever more furious when his archenemy at the firm is chosen to lead the project and finally agrees to Shruti's plan. Together, Vikram and Shruti easily extort all the black money that Chandrasekar has been hiding away from the income tax department. He then sends Shruti back home safely while promising to keep her share of the money for her while she prepares her passport and visa to run away to Australia.  The next day, Vikram learns from the news that a young girl's dead body resembling Chandrasekar's daughter has been found washed up at the beach. As Vikram panics, Chandrasekar and Shruti walk into his apartment. Chandrasekar then reveals that the rebellious daughter Vikram saw the other day at his office was actually Shruti's twin, Sanjana (Salony Luthra). Shruti accidentally killed Sanjana while trying to stop the latter from taking her drugs. That was when she ran away from home and ended up with Vikram. Her father then calls her up and forces her to help him frame Vikram instead. This was why Chandrasekar approved Vikram's plan out of the blue and then had another project manager hired to further provoke him to have revenge. Chandrasekar then takes back his ransom money in return for not having Vikram arrested by the police for Sanjana's so-called kidnapping and murder.  Furious that he has been played, Vikram decides to really kidnap Shruti for the money. He sees her leaving her father's beach house and takes her away forcefully. He has Chandrasekar bring his money to a warehouse in exchange for Shruti. At the warehouse, Chandrasekar brings a gang along for protection and Vikram has to fight them off. However, it is revealed that Shruti is actually Sanjana all along, and it was Shruti who was killed during their struggle. Knowing that their father would not support her, she pretended to be Shruti all along and had the real Shruti's body look like her instead. Seeing that her father never loved her and was instead happy she had died, she kills him in cold blood and splits the ransom money with Vikram. Sanjana then continues pretending to be Shruti and explains to the police that it was her own father who kidnapped and killed his drug addict daughter with the help of the gang to save his reputation. The gang then goes into hiding for a crime they did not commit. Meanwhile, Sanjana takes over Chandrasekar's company and hires Vikram as her theme parks's project leader.

Saving Christmas
 In a [[framing sequence]], Cameron—as himself—addresses the audience from beside a fireplace, explaining his love of Christmas. Cameron goes on to express his views on the contemporary celebration of Christmas, which include his beliefs that [[atheists]] have tried to "take the holiday away" and that [[Santa Claus]] is a Christian. Cameron also criticizes [[fundamentalist Christian]]s who have politicized the holiday by tying the celebration to [[pagan]] traditions and making accusations that the holiday has become too tied to [[materialism]].  The film switches to its main narrative, in which Cameron attends a Christmas party at his sister's house. There, he notices that his brother-in-law, Christian, is not celebrating like the other guests. When asked why, Christian tells Cameron that he feels the holiday became too commercialized and [[Consumerism|consumerist]], and that he feels uncomfortable with what he believes are pagan elements of contemporary Christmas celebration. Cameron tells Christian that he is wrong and recites the story of [[the Nativity]], which is depicted in cartoon form. Meanwhile, two guests at the party discuss conspiracy theories.  Christian complains that several elements of Christmas, most notably [[Christmas tree]]s, are not biblical in origin. Cameron tells him that Christmas trees were God's idea, since God created trees. He also says that each tree represents a [[Christian cross]]; [[breaking the fourth wall]], Cameron encourages the audience to visualize a cross every time they see a Christmas tree. Cameron further addresses several other concerns Christian has about the historicity of the holiday, including its date and the role of the [[Three Wise Men]]. Cameron ties the Nativity directly to the [[crucifixion]], saying that Baby Jesus' swaddling cloth was a foreshadowing of his burial shroud, and claims that the gifts of [[frankincense]] and [[myrrh]] were used to treat dead bodies in a form of primitive [[embalming]]. Cameron encourages Christian and the audience to place [[Nutcracker]]s around Nativity sets to represent [[Herod the Great|Herod]]'s soldiers during the [[Massacre of the Innocents]].  Christian is convinced by the arguments, but then complains that Santa has co-opted Jesus as the figurehead of the holiday; he further expresses discomfort over the fact that "Santa" is an [[anagram]] of "Satan." Cameron tells Christian the story of [[Saint Nicholas]], including a reenactment of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in which Nicholas violently beats [[Arius]] for heresy. Cameron claims that, after the council, Nicholas went out and began beating heretics for teaching false doctrine, and that "Nicholas was 'bad,' in a good way." Cameron explains that St. Nicholas was the basis for Santa Claus, who was a byproduct of Nicholas' story being diluted by [[secular]] culture. With this knowledge, Christian joyous declares that "Santa is the man."  Reassured of Christmas' Christian roots, Cameron and Christian return to the party. Cameron criticizes people who feel that the holiday is too commercial, saying that because God took on material form, it is appropriate to celebrate using material things through the giving of expensive gifts. Cameron explains that presents represent [[Jerusalem]], and that Christmas is "doing what God does", as God has given humanity many gifts. Cameron then issues a plea to the audience to make Christmas an overtly religious holiday again, "for our children." Christian, as a gift to his wife, organizes a [[hip hop]] dance to symbolize his love of Christmas, set to "[[Angels We Have Heard on High]]". Cameron, Christian, and all the party guests [[break dance]] in an elongated musical sequence. Cameron then tells everyone to feast, and suggests the audience organize the best dinner possible for Christmas, but not to forget it is a celebration of God.

At the insistence of the duo, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]], and [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] agree to join them on the trip to WWE City. Upon their arrival, the Mystery Machine crashes on a ditch after Fred narrowly avoids a crossing [[raccoon]]. The gang meets [[John Cena]], his trainer Cookie, and Cookie's nephew Ruben before Cena lifts the Mystery Machine back on the road. They also encounter Bayard, a hunter who despises WWE for building their city in his forest. Cena gives the gang VIP tickets to the next event to make up for their altercation with Bayard.  At the show, [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] unveils the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWE Championship belt]], which has been held vacant since [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]]'s last match was overturned. The title is up for grabs over the weekend at WrestleMania. The gang is then offered a tour of WWE's training camp before arriving at their cabins. Later that night, Daphne and Velma overhear Ruben arguing with Cookie over not becoming a WWE wrestler because of Cookie's leg injury. Meanwhile, Scooby has a dream about wrestling giant food monsters when Shaggy wakes him up and they both encounter a monster called the Ghost Bear before running for their lives. The WWE wrestlers intervene during the chase, but [[Triple H]] and [[Brodus Clay]] are overpowered by the monster, which disappears after throwing [[Sin Cara]]'s hot rod toward a water tower. The next morning, the gang is briefed by WWE executive Ms. Richards that the city has been terrorized by bear attacks over the past few weeks. Mr. McMahon asks the gang to solve the Ghost Bear mystery to ensure the security of the WWE belt. Cena and Sin Cara explain to the gang that the legend of the Ghost Bear started over 100 years ago with a wrestling bear named Vicious, who was defeated by Sin Cara's great-great-great grandfather Sin Cara Grande at the grounds that would be WWE City. Furious over its loss, Vicious vented its frustration on the town until Sin Cara Grande warded it off to a cave at the cost of a career-ending leg injury. It is believed by Sin Cara that the spirit of the bear has been stirred by WrestleMania.  Next morning, the gang is notified by Ms. Richards that the WWE belt has been stolen, and Scooby is arrested after being caught with it around his waist, with security footage showing him caught in the act. Velma, however, proves Scooby's innocence by showing that he was in a deep state of hypnosis when he stole the belt. Ruben then deduces that the WWE video game contains light flashes that implanted post-hypnotic suggestions to Scooby's brain. Mr. McMahon offers Scooby and Shaggy a chance at freedom if they defeat Kane at WrestleMania. The duo receive a crash course training from Cookie and [[AJ Lee]]. That night, the gang and Cena wander along the forest until they reach the bear cave. Inside, they discover a room with books on hypnotism, schematics of an [[Electromagnetic pulse in fiction and popular culture|EMP]] device, and a calendar indicating that the culprit plans to target WrestleMania. Suddenly, the Ghost Bear appears and chases the gang through a storm drain. They escape after Cena slams the Ghost Bear away from them before realizing that the storm drain is directly underneath WWE City. After the gang gives Ms. Richards details on their encounter with the Ghost Bear, Cookie advises that WrestleMania should be cancelled, much to Ms. Richards' disapproval. Fred suggests that the gang uses WrestleMania to nab the Ghost Bear.  During the main event, Velma deduces that the WWE belt is the EMP device. After the gang discovers that the belt is a fake and the EMP device is set to go off in 30 seconds, Cena tries to get rid of it, but it activates and shuts off the underground power generator. When the Ghost Bear appears and wreaks havoc all over the arena, the WWE wrestlers ignite green pyrotechnics to light up the stage while Scooby uses his dance moves to throw Kane off guard. The Ghost Bear arrives at ringside, but is confronted by Ruben in his wrestling attire before both combatants are launched into the ring by a floor catapult. The ring is then enclosed inside a steel cage before Cena, Sin Cara, Kane, and Ruben pin down the monster for Scooby to land a belly bomb off the top rope, leveling the ring in the process.  The Ghost Bear is revealed to be Cookie, who resented WWE due to his injury ending his career too soon and plotted the perfect crime to steal the title belt using Scooby as a pawn and tarnish the organization's reputation. As Cookie is taken away by the police and Ms. Richards (who is now displeased that she was wrong about Scooby stealing the belt), Mr. McMahon offers Ruben a spot on the WWE roster before awarding the WWE belt to Scooby and Shaggy.

The group tries to subdue the monster but it disappears in a cloud of smoke. The police cordone the area and the kids who lost their soccer ball catch up to Shaggy and Scooby to ask for their autographed missing ball. Velma identifies the monster as a trickster called 'Eshu'. Fred promises the kids they will find the autographed ball and the gang ask Julio Luna, the director of the games, for help. He tells them all the spilled soccer balls on the parade route were taken back to the stadium, including the kids' ball that was mixed in with them.  Sneaking into the stadium, the gang manages to find the equipment room where all the soccer balls are stored. Eshu is also there and chases after Shaggy and Scooby before a security guard arrives and sounds the alarm. Once again, the monster disappears in a cloud of dust and after a hasty retreat, Fred determines the Eshu is looking for the same autographed ball. The next day, they go to the alley where Scooby first encountered Eshu. Daphne finds a broken test tube that's labelled as belonging to Professor Eduardo Perez. When they go to the professor's research lab, they're stopped by an angry security guard but another scientist overhears what they found and brings them to the eccentric Professor Perez. They learn that the test tube was filled with an experimental liquid that modifies the quality of rubber (making it extra strong and bouncy) and it was stolen by Eshu the previous day.  The gang figures that Eshu accidentally spilled the experimental liquid onto the kids' soccer ball in the alley and wants to find the ball to extract the formula and sell it. They sneak back into the stadium and realize the autographed ball has been taken out onto the field. They manage to make it onto the pitch but the autographed ball is being taken out to play. Scooby quickly dons a jersey and joins the Brazilian team. Scooby intercepts the super strong, super bouncy ball and manages to score a winning goal for Brazil in the final seconds of the match. Suddenly Eshu appears but after a few too many kicks, the supercharged ball gains momentum and crashes into the monster, sending it straight through the net and trapping it.  Eshu is unmasked to be Reynaldo, the angry security guard from the research lab. The security guard reveals he has always wanted to be a magician and wanted the money from the serum sale to fund his magician dreams. He used trickery and a little smoke to "disappear". The security guard is taken away and the gang makes sure that the autographed ball is returned to its rightful owner after they remove the serum on it. For saving the tournament, the gang is rewarded with pizzas on a stick and Scooby manages to expertly deflect an errant soccer ball before the end.

A Second Chance (2014 film)
 Police detective Andreas and his partner Simon are called to investigate an argument in a junkie couple's badly rundown flat, where they discover a child in a wardrobe lying in its own excrements. The seven-week old child Sofus is dirty and hungry but after he has been examined by [[Social services|Social Services]] they realize he is in good health. Because of that he cannot be taken from his parents Tristan and Sanne, despite the fact that they are well-known drug addicts.  Andreas himself has a seven-week old child called Alexander with his wife Anne. They love him dearly and he's well looked after, but he is not an easy child. Soon Anne is unable to cope with Alexander because of her own mental instability. One early morning Andreas wakes up with Anne crying and he finds that Alexander is dead. A distraught Anne threatens to kill herself should Andreas call an ambulance who'd take Alexander from her. After he has calmed down his wife and convinced her to take pills to sleep, Andreas takes the dead baby to the hospital. Waiting in the hospital's parking lot, he then decides to swap the babies and breaks into Tristan and Sanne's flat, where the parents are sleeping off their high. Anne reacts distraught. She refuses to accept the baby Andreas brings her as her own.  The next morning Tristan notices that Sofus is dead. Sanne too tells her husband that the dead baby isn't her son. Because Tristan fears that he and Sanne will have to go to prison, he takes Sofus to a busy street and pretends that someone has abducted him from his stroller. Andreas and Simon, who are ordered to investigate, repeatedly interrogate Tristan and Sanne concerning the whereabouts of the dead baby (Alexander).  Anne seems to have come to terms with the new situation. On one of her nightly walks she leaves the stroller in the middle of the road on an bridge. Through this she forces a trucker to stop. After she's got him to take the baby and he wants to take it to his truck to keep warm, she jumps into the river and commits suicide. In the wake of Anne's death Andreas and his mother care for the baby (Sofus).  In later interrogations Andreas and his partner try to get Tristan to talk. Andreas slips up when he calls the baby “Alexander” instead of “Sofus”. After Tristan is told that Sanne has testified and that they'd have to find the baby to prove [[Sudden infant death syndrome|cot death]], he comes clean. Andreas reacts with an outburst of rage, hitting and kicking Tristan, whereupon his superior sends him home and orders a meeting with the police psychologist. Tristan leads the police to a remote area in the forest, where he buried the baby.  Sanne has been admitted to a psychiatric hospital. She insists that the dead baby wasn't Sofus.  At Alexander's autopsy it is revealed that he died due to a [[Intracerebral hemorrhage|cerebral haemorrhage]] caused by [[Abusive head trauma|shaken baby syndrome]] and that he had several older bleeds and rib fractures. Andreas realizes that Anne is responsible for the maltreatment. In a knee-jerk reaction, he makes with Sofus for his mother's holiday home. Meanwhile his police partner Simon has figured out that Andreas must have swapped the babies. He looks for him at the holiday home and gets it across to Andreas that to turn himself in is the only right choice. He'd be dismissed from his job in law enforcement but be let off on a suspended sentence because of significant mitigating circumstances.  Andreas takes Sofus to the psychiatric clinic and returns him to Sanne, who is overjoyed. Some years later Sanne goes shopping at a hardware store, where Andreas works after leaving the police. When she leaves the child alone for a moment, Andreas talks to him and learns his identity.

Amy decides to cancel her plans and help her colleagues with the deliveries. Amy and Seth process the corpses, including that of Goodnight. As Amy leaves Seth to finish the work, she is surprised to find Holden has allowed her friends Tamara ([[Katharine Isabelle]]), Kayla ([[Chelan Simmons]]), Carter (Lee Majdoub) and her brother Will ([[Greyston Holt]]) to throw a birthday party in the morgue. During the party, Will warns Seth to stay away from Amy, believing she deserves better than him, causing Seth to leave the party and return to work. Will tells Amy of his disapproval of her dropping out of Med School to work in the morgue, angering Amy, who also leaves the party.  Tamara, who is fascinated by death and [[serial killers]], leaves the party with Carter to go look at Jacob's body. The experience of being in a room with the body of a real murderer arouses her and she and Carter begin to have sex. Jacob suddenly awakens, and kills Carter while Tamara escapes. Jacob searches the room, outfitting himself with a burn victim mask and several surgical tools before cutting the building's electricity.  Hearing Tamara's screams, the rest of the partygoers attempt to find her; Holden, away from the rest, is captured and mortally wounded by Jacob.  Amy, Will, Kayla and Tamara acknowledge their predicament and attempt to reach the upper levels of the hospital, only to find Jacob blocking their way at every turn. Seth arrives with the keys to open a locked emergency stairwell, but Jacob is behind him and attacks them, causing the group to split up. Kayla seeks refuge in a bathroom, where Jacob strangles her. When Kayla mutters "Thank God!" at Jacob's hesitation, he relives old memories, remembering the abuse he suffered at the hands of his religious mother. As Kayla dies from her injuries anyway, Jacob asks her, "Why would God help you?" before setting off in search of the remaining members of the group.  Jacob kills Tamara and captures Will, using him as bait to lure Seth and Amy into a trap, where he proceeds to execute her brother. In the resultant confrontation, Seth is wounded by an electric knife; Amy takes him into a room to cauterize the wound, where she reveals that she dropped out of medical school after realizing the inevitability of death. Noticing that one of the windows leads to ground level, Amy kisses Seth for the first time then squeezes out to get help. Finding Jacob in the parking lot, however, she retreats back inside. Afterwards, Jacob stabs her to death as she attempts to unlock a side exit door. After fighting Jacob, Seth impales him with the nozzle from a piece of embalming equipment and pumps his body full of [[embalming chemicals]], seemingly killing him.  Seth escapes the morgue through a broken window and drives away in his car. As he stops to open the gated entrance, he realizes that not only is Jacob still alive but also that he was in the car with him. Jacob attacks Seth from behind, and gouges out his eyes, killing him.  The final shots of the film show each dead member of the cast before a final closeup shot of Jacob's face as he says, "I see it now."

He falls in love with her, they marry, and Serena comes with George to his land.

George's business partner Buchanan feels threatened by her, as she begins to exceed his authority. Things grow worse between George and Buchanan, and Buchanan strikes a deal with the local sheriff, who wants to buy George's land to make a park. George is hurt by Buchanan's betrayal, and Serena convinces George that Buchanan was never his friend.  The next day, they both go shooting alone from the group attempting to flush out a bear. After some snide remarks from Buchanan, George contemplates killing him only to hesitate and be seen by Buchanan. As Buchanan cocks his rifle, George fires first and shoots him in the chest. Campbell, George's worker, witnesses the murder, but denies it when Sheriff McDowell inquires. The death is ruled an accident. Serena consoles George and justifies his actions.  One day, he sees his illegitimate son, Jacob, posing with his mother, Rachel, for a picture. He feels responsible for the boy, and since Rachel never asked for anything, he begins giving sums of money in envelopes to her for Jacob. Serena remains unaware of this, though she does consider Rachel and the baby a threat.  One day, an accident occurs in the forest and Galloway, a mysterious worker, loses his hand to an axe swing. Serena rushes to help him and uses a belt as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding which saves his life. Having problems with her pregnancy, Serena and George rush to the hospital after Serena experiences heavy bleeding and pain. She miscarries. They learn that she can never again bear children. Things continue to grow worse, and Rachel's baby becomes more obvious to Serena.   While Serena and George are away in the city, Campbell finds ledgers in the safe when he goes to collect the money for payday, and presents them to the Sheriff, preparing to testify that George has been giving bribes to the senator and that he saw George shoot Buchanan deliberately. The couple discover that Campbell has taken the ledgers, and realise that he could potentially ruin them.  Galloway tells Serena that he knows where Campbell is, and then tells George that he knows where the panther is, leading George going out into the forest to hunt it. Galloway heads into town to find Campbell at a hotel, and retrieve the ledgers. Meanwhile, Serena discovers the picture of Rachel and her baby that George had hidden, discovers that George has been giving Rachel money, and is angered by this revelation. She scratches the baby's face from the photograph.  Serena leaves with Galloway in the truck, telling George that she has some business to take care of. They head to Rachel's house, and when they don't find her there, they head for Widow Jenkin's house. Meanwhile, Vaughn calls the Sheriff, worried about Rachel and what Serena is planning to do, and the Sheriff heads to Widow Jenkin's house, where he finds her already dead. The Sheriff takes Rachel and her baby away.  In the morning, the Sheriff heads to George's cabin and begins questioning him about the murder. The Sheriff reveals that Galloway killed Campbell, and that he suspects they also killed Widow Jenkins and are still after Rachel and her child. George asks Serena if she sent Galloway to kill them, and she tries to reassure him that it had to be done. George grows angry and storms out, and chokes Serena when she follows him out, almost killing her. He then drives off as Serena returns to the home.  George goes to the Sheriff to turn himself in, only agreeing to do so after he tells George where Rachel and the baby are.  George races off to try and save Rachel before Galloway gets to her. Galloway tracks Rachel to the train station, and she hides from him in one of the sheds. As the train approaches, George arrives and sees Galloway, who sees Rachel jump onto the train. George goes after them, and confronts Galloway. In the ensuing fight, George manages to get Galloway's knife and slit his throat.  The next morning, George bids Rachel and the baby farewell, as they head off to go and live with Vaughn. George returns to the camp, and then sets off to hunt the panther. He spots it, and shoots it, though only wounds it at first. The panther leaps at him from behind, and manages to wound him fatally, though he manages to kill it with a hunting knife as he is dying.  The Sheriff returns to the Pemberton cabin with George's body. Serena, having expected George to return, grows upset and does not go and identify his body. As the Sheriff leaves, Serena lies on the bed, and picks up a lighter. After staring at it for a few moments, she throws the lighter onto the floor and stays in the cabin as it burns.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

The Verneuils pretend to accept their sons-in-law but have had a hard time hiding their discomfort at accepting people into the family from outside the community.

Seventh Son (film)
 In a prologue, the witch Mother Malkin is imprisoned in an underground chamber by Gregory, the last of a knightly order known as the Falcons, who have long defended mankind against supernatural threats. Several decades later, Gregory now works as a "Spook," a roving witch hunter.  The rise of the centennial [[Hunter's moon|blood moon]] allows Malkin to regain much of her power and break free from her prison. In a confrontation with the aged Gregory, she kills his apprentice, William Bradley, before escaping. Malkin returns to her dilapidated mountain fortress, restoring it, and her sister, Bony Lizzie, to their former condition. Gregory vows revenge.  Gregory then seeks out Tom Ward, the [[seventh son of a seventh son]], on a local farmstead, and recruits him as his newest apprentice. Before Tom leaves, his mother gives him her pendant as a talisman. On their way to Gregory's home, Tom sees a girl about to be burned by a mob as a witch. Recognizing her from [[clairvoyant]] visions he has had, he takes her from the mob and releases her. The girl, Alice, warns him not to let Gregory know about her. Alice is revealed to be Lizzie's daughter, who spies on Gregory for her. Malkin begins gathering her army to conquer mankind.  Tom meets Gregory's assistant Tusk, and rushes to learn what he needs to become a Spook before he and Gregory leave to confront Malkin at her fortress. Gregory warns that they only have a week before the blood moon is full, after which Malkin will become too powerful for them. En route to the fortress, Gregory is summoned to a walled city by an [[Inquisitor]] whose forces have subdued one of Malkin's followers, a [[werebear]] named Urag. Gregory instructs Tom to burn the warlock alive, but Tom hesitates, causing Gregory to dismiss him while burning Urag himself. Tom meets Alice again and the two share their feelings for each other and fall in love. Later, they briefly consider going off on their own. But Tom has a vision of Malkin killing Gregory and unleashing destruction upon the world. Tom rejoins Gregory, who reveals that he once loved Malkin, and that is why he could not kill her, even after she murdered Gregory's own wife. Gregory feels responsible for every person killed by Malkin since then, and warns Tom that Alice must be killed, like all witches.  Gregory, Tom, and Tusk are attacked on the road by an enormous [[boggart]], and Tom narrowly manages to kill it and survive being swept down a waterfall. Tom is then confronted by Bony Lizzie, who attacks but is repelled by the necklace around his neck. John Gregory recognizes it as the Umbran Stone, which increases the power of witches. It originally belonged to Malkin, but one of her witch followers, Tom's mother, stole it from her, weakening her enough for Gregory to trap her.  Malkin instructs Alice to steal the stone from Tom, promising to spare his life if she does because she loves him. Malkin and her minions then raze the aforementioned walled city to the ground to avenge the death of Urag. Tom's family happens to be in the city, and his mother sends her husband and daughter to safety, before managing to kill Strix the warlock and confronting Malkin with her own powers. Malkin kills her, mocking her for giving away the stone that would have saved her life.  Out in the country, Alice reappears before Tom and pleads with him to leave with her, as he had suggested in their earlier meeting. Gregory tries to kill her, but Tom, blinded by love, stops him, proclaiming "She's not the enemy!". He lets her flee, but Gregory points out she has taken the Umbran stone from around Tom's neck, replying, "Now tell me she's innocent!". Tom realizes her reappearance had been a ruse, and pursues her, with Gregory and Tusk following. Then Malkin's servant Radu attacks them, capturing Gregory and driving Tusk and Tom over a cliff, wrongly believing them dead. Tom has a vision of his mother, telling him that as both the seventh son of a seventh son, and the son of a witch, he is unique and has the power to defeat Malkin.  The witches gather as Malkin attempts to seduce Gregory with her magic. Alice is horrified to hear that Tom was left for dead. In remorse, she grabs the stone from Malkin, breaking Malkin's hold on Gregory. As Malkin transforms into a dragon to kill Alice, Lizzie also transforms, to protect her daughter. Tom retrieves the stone and, fighting together, Gregory, Tom and Alice kill several of Malkin's minions. Malkin defeats and kills Lizzie for her disloyalty, but is seriously wounded in turn. Gregory confronts Malkin in her room, alone. She appears close to death, bitterly recalling her and Gregory's relationship, but then she seizes him with her claws. Tom arrives and hurls a blade at Malkin, freeing Gregory, who retreats. Tom finishes her off by burning her body.  Afterwards, Gregory acknowledges Tom's training is complete and brands his hand as a new Falcon knight. Alice appears, but accepts that Tom's commitment to his new vocation means they cannot be together at the present. She promises Tom that they'll meet again, before disappearing. Gregory departs for an unknown destination, leaving Tom with Tusk as the town bells ring, calling for the new Spook's services.

Angry and disappointed with his son, Kenji talks to him only having him walk out.  Kenneth eventually goes on a drinking spree while Kenji goes on a trip to a different country for business purposes.  The next day, Kenneth learns from the maids of the household that there had been an airplane crash and  there were passengers injured. Revealing the names of the passengers he saw his father's name, Kenjie Delos Reyes. Seeing this he quickly set off to the airport to know about his father's whereabouts.  While at the airport, he meets a distraught woman named Kelay, who claims that she is the daughter of Kenji Delos Reyes. Kenneth opposes to this and says that he is the only child of Kenji Delos Reyes, has a birth certificate to prove it, and knows nothing about her. Kelay, on the other hand, who continues to insist that she is the daughter of Kenji, has nothing but a picture of Kenji as a teenager together with a teenage girl who looks just like her to prove it.  Kenneth, surprised, brings Kelay to a fast food chain to eat and interrogate her. It is there that Kelay reveals that she is really not Kenji's daughter (she even jokes that since they are not siblings, Kenneth can court her). She also reveals the reason why she is in Manila and finding Kenji: to bring Kenji to her aunt, the teenage girl in the picture and his one great love, together before her aunt dies from a heart disease. When Kenneth hears this, he is outraged and leaves.  The next day, he goes to the bus station to travel to where the airplane that his father boarded crashed. He apparently almost misses the bus because he was sleeping. Luckily, Kelay wakes him up.  Kelay joins him on his quest to find his father as she is determined to give her aunt whose name is Athena, the happily ever after she deserves. Kenneth is annoyed at Kelay wanting to bring her aunt and his father together especially since Kenneth has heard of her as the woman that his father secretly loved, resulting to the death of his mother, whose name is also Athena. Kelay does not like what Kenneth feels toward her aunt and so she decides to tell him their love story to convince him that her aunt is not so bad.  The story occurs in the 90s and starts when Athena Dizon, Kelay's aunt who was seventeen at the time, receives a text through her beeper from Kenji, the well known bad boy and gangster of the school. In the text, Kenji is apologizing to someone called "Bee" and asking her if they could talk in their favourite place. Athena decides to just text him a yes even though she knows she is not the person Kenji is addressing the text to and has no idea where their favourite place is.  The story is interrupted with Kenneth asking why his father accidentally sent the text to Kelay's aunt. Kelay says that maybe his ex had changed her number and when Kenji asked from his friends her new number, they gave him Athena Dizon's by mistake, thinking she was the Athena he was referring to.  The story then continues.  When Athena visits her friends in a place for playing billiards, she sees Kenji and finds out that the billiards place is the couple's favourite place to hang out. She also learns from her friends that Kenji had just been dumped by his girlfriend. Her friends also reveal to Athena that his ex's name is also Athena and that Kenji refuses to cut his hair until they come back. From their story, Athena starts to have pity for him.  Later that night, she receives another text from him asking why she didn't come. Feeling guilty, Athena chose to not reply.  The following day, while having lunch, Athena's best friend sees Kenji on the payphone that's near them. Athena, fearing that Kenji would find out that the texts go to her instead of his ex, proposes that they leave.  But before they even get to leave, her beeper starts to ring, catching Kenji's attention. Eventually, Kenji finds out that Athena Dizon is the one who receives his texts and calls and not Athena a.k.a. Bee, his ex. He becomes very angry at Athena for pretending to be Bee. While he talks to her angrily, his ex passes by, resulting him into pushing her against a wall and sinking his head in her neck, making everyone, including Bee, think that he is kissing her, when he really is just whispering to Athena. He asks her if Bee is looking. Athena says yes. After Kenji hears this, he asks Athena to pretend to be his girlfriend so Bee may be jealous and come back to him. Surprised at his request, Athena tells him she will not do it and leaves.  Even if Athena refused his request, Kenji does not stop pursuing her. He does a lot of mean things to make Athena his fake girlfriend like tying the laces of both of her shoes together and framing her as the one who hurt one of their professors.. But when she continues to refuse, Kenji does something crazy. He goes on the roof of the building and everyone is convinced that he will end his life if Athena will still refuse to be his girlfriend. Because of fear that Kenji really will jump off the building, Athena says yes.  During their fake relationship, Kenji makes sure that him and Athena are doing romantic things while Bee is around, but when she is not they bicker and fight.  She also forms a friendship with a new student named Lucas, who ends up being Bee's new boyfriend.  During Athena's physical education class, her female classmates throw volleyballs at her and tell her that they don't even look good together because they are jealous of her "relationship" with the gangster.  Hurt physically and emotionally, Athena takes her bag and runs out of the gym. While running out, she bumps into Kenji who is surprised by the bruises she got. He eventually insists that they go to his house so he may treat her bruises.  In Kenji's house, Athena learns a lot about him. She asks him a lot of question including if loving someone hurts so bad. He tells her that she should just find out herself to which she replies that she cannot because her heart is weak.  The next day, Kenji brings Athena to the salon to have a new hairstyle. When he drives her to school, he wears the same type of glasses she wears so that the girls who hurt her can see that they look good together. He also tries to give the girls a taste of their own medicine by threatening to throw balls at them, which does not continue because Athena does not wish to hurt them.  One day, Athena does not go to school and her best friend cannot tell Kenji why leaving him confused.  It is later revealed that Athena has a heart disease where she cannot experience extreme emotions such as being too happy, angry, sad, or even falling in love.  As their fake relationship continues, Athena start to have feelings for Kenji. Because of this, she breaks the deal off only to find out that Kenji also has feelings for her and wants the relationship to be real. Not able to avoid her feelings, Athena agrees to be his real girlfriend.  The story is once again interrupted when the bus driver kicks Kelay and Kenneth out because they keep on bickering and fighting. After they are kicked out, Kenneth becomes mad at Kelay and her Aunt Athena. Kelay also becomes angry and asks him if he was even listening to the story and she once again emphasizes the fact that her aunt has done nothing wrong. He says that he has been listening and that the story makes him hate Kelay's aunt more because their love story makes him feel guilty. Kelay, feeling bad for Kenneth and realizing that bringing Kenneth to his father is more important than bringing Kenji to Athena, gets the attention of a truck which is owned by a couple. The couple lets them ride the truck.  During the ride, Kelay continues Kenji and Athena's story.  Kenji goes to the salon to have his hair finally cut, because he has moved on from Bee. He then brings Athena to different places, resulting to her going home late, which makes her parents worried. They get even more worried when Kenji brings her all the way to her province and tells her in front of Mt. Mayon that they will get married there. Athena tells her parents to not get worried because she believes that Kenji's love will make her live longer just as how her parents' love had.  The story is once again interrupted by Kenneth saying that maybe seeing Athena was why Kenji went to the province instead of going on his business trip. Kelay tells him that that cannot be because Athena is in Manila and not in the province.  Kelay and Kenneth have eventually arrived at the province. They go straight to the church where Kelay prays for Kenneth to find his father and for Bee to not haunt them when Kenji and Athena reunite. After Kelay finishes praying, Kenneth asks her what happened next and why they didn't end up together. Kelay says that her aunt never actually revealed what happened next. All her aunt told her is that the reason was bad timing.  Kenneth and Kelay, not knowing which hospital Kenji is in, goes to one hospital to another until a much older Lucas comes and tells them that he knows where he is. And so Kenneth and Kelay go in his car. Kenneth then asks Lucas, out of curiosity, if he knows the reason why Athena and his father did not end up together. Lucas says he knew why and decides to finish the story.  When Athena goes back to school, she finds Kenji absent. Later that day, Lucas comes and tells Athena to come with him because Kenji is at the hospital. Worried, Athena goes with him. She goes in the hospital room Lucas said Kenji was in. In the room, she finds Kenji and Bee, on the hospital bed. Kenji leaves the room after Athena entered. She finds out that Bee has cancer and broke up with Kenji because she did not want to break his heart. And the reason why Bee decided to have a relationship with Lucas was to move on from Kenji because she could not bear to see someone else with him. Bee then tells Athena to take care of Kenji when she is gone.  While Athena is having a conversation with Bee, Bee's mother talks to Kenji and begs him to go back to Bee because she read that happiness extends one's life and he is the only one who can make her happy. Kenji does not agree to this.  Kenji tells Athena what Bee's mother told him and said that he refused because he wants to be with her. Athena, even if she did not want to lose Kenji, told him to stay with Bee because she did not want to sacrifice someone's life just so their love could stay alive. She then leaves, not telling Kenji of her own illness.  As the story ends, Kelay cries and asks Lucas why Athena never told Kenji about her heart disorder. Kenneth is the one who answers. He tells Kelay that it must be because Athena wanted Bee to continue to live and if she told about Kenji about her illness, he would not leave her. Kelay then asks Lucas if Kenji ever found out about the heart problem. Lucas says he had only found out recently. Shortly after Lucas replied, Kelay receives a call from her family saying that Athena has just gotten a heart attack. Worried, Kelay says that she will go back to Manila. Kenneth tells Lucas to bring her to Manila and to just tell him where the hospital is. Lucas agrees, however; Kelay is hesitant. Kenneth tells her that he will be fine and that he promises that his father and her aunt will have their happily ever after.  Kenneth arrives at the hospital and finds his father unconscious. One of the nurses, give him a zip lock with a letter and a picture. Kenneth opens the letter and sees that it is addressed to him. In the letter, Kenji apologizes to his son for making him feel like he was nothing to him. He admits that he is the greatest thing that has happened to him. After he reads the letter, Kenneth looks at the picture.  It is a picture of the first time that his father has held him.  As he stares at the picture, Kenji wakes up and Kenneth is happy to see that he is fine.  Back in Manila, Kenneth surprises his father with a reunion with his old friends. He also tells Kenji that he has made a promise to a girl (Kenji mistakens the promise for a wedding proposal).  Suddenly, doors of a room are opened to reveal an older Athena on a wheelchair. Kenji is surprised to see her and the two become teary eyed.  As they sit on the bench on the terrace, Athena apologizes to Kenji for leaving him. Kenji tells her that it was nothing and that he was a blessed with a great son anyway.  Athena smiles at him then starts to feel sleepy. When she closes her eyes, she ends up dying in his arms.  In the next scene, Kelay is awoken by a phone call. The caller tells her that a plane has crashed and that Kenneth Delos Reyes is one of the passengers. Scared, Kelay quickly makes her way to the airport. In the airport, she acts distraught just as how she did when Kenneth first met her. Kenneth then appears and tells her that him being in the accident was not real and that Kenji was the one who called her.  The movie then ends with Kenneth asking Kelay if they can have a great love story like Kenji and Athena. The film cuts to black as Kenneth and Kelay are about to kiss.

Sigaram Thodu
 Muralipandian alias Murali ([[Vikram Prabhu]]) is the only son of Chellapandian (Chellapa) ([[Sathyaraj]]), a disabled policeman who is now working in the State Crime Records Bureau and expresses a desire to see his son in the police one day. However, Murali is against becoming a policeman due to an incident which happened in his childhood; when Chellapa lost his leg during police duty, his wife fell down the stairs on hearing the news, leading to her death and left a crippled Chellapa to single-handedly look after the young Murali. His ambition is to become a bank manager and he manages to get an interview for the same in a bank. While on a pilgrimage, Murali meets Ambujam ([[Monal Gajjar]]), a young doctor who is travelling with her chaperone, who is her grandmother. Ambujam initially thinks ill of Murali due to unsavoury incidents which occur between them during the journey, but after she finds out about Murali's true character and Murali helps her grandmother Aishwarya ([[Kovai Sarala]]) recover from dehydration, she falls in love with him. She expresses a distaste for marrying policemen, which impresses Murali.  Meanwhile, a spate of robberies occur in [[Chennai]]. Money is stolen from several bank accounts through ATM machines. The robberies are led by a bank employee Shiva ([[Gaurav Narayanan]]) assisted by a karate teacher Lawrence (Charandeep). The duo manage to avoid being caught as they hide their identity by wearing bike helmets. Murali first encounters the duo robbing an ATM while returning from the pilgrimage and breaks Lawrence's arm in a fight. An injured Lawrence vows to take revenge on Murali for breaking his arm.  Later, Murali receives a letter stating that he had been accepted at the [[Tamil Nadu Police|Tamil Nadu Police Academy]] for police training. He reluctantly attends the training for Chellapa's sake and deliberately performs poorly during the training in the hope of getting expelled from the academy. Unfortunately, the head of the academy, SP Nagaraj, who happens to be Ambujam's father and a former colleague of Chellapa, finds out about Murali's plan and makes a deal with him to avoid the matter reaching Chellapa's ears; however badly Murali had performed during training, he will not be expelled from the academy. Instead, he will be made a [[sub-inspector]], with the assurance that he can resign if he doesn't like the job after 30 days, after which he can marry Ambujam. Murali accepts, but this strains his relationship with Ambujam.  Shiva and Lawrence plan to steal money from ATMs using information from international credit cards. The robbery is a success, but the CCTV cameras in two different ATMs have exposed Shiva as one of the robbers due to his height. The duo are arrested by Murali, who is now a sub-inspector, but they manage to subdue the constables and escape later that night, while Murali is out on a date with Ambujam. They encounter Chellapa, mercilessly beat him up and shoot him in the chest. Ambujam feels sorry about what happened to Chellapa and finally accepts Murali's decision to become a policeman.  Buoyed by Ambujam's approval, and also determined to take revenge on those who shot Chellapa, Murali takes up the robbery case with full vigour. He assumes that the duo did not work alone, instead having an accomplice. This proves to be true; the accomplice turns out to be a forger who made fake credit cards for the duo to steal money from the ATMs, but this evidence reaches a dead end when the accomplice reveals that he never saw the duo without their bike helmets on. Murali then interrogates the security guards of ATMs in the outskirts of Chennai as he feels that the robbers would have used them to conduct their robberies since money would not be refilled in such ATMs until it runs short of cash due to lesser number of withdrawals unlike in ATMs within the city where refilling of cash is done regularly. One of the guards interrogated turns out to be an accomplice of the robbers, providing them gadgets to assist them in the robbery. He however, doesn't know where they are. Murali decides to track the robber's phones with the intention of finding their location once someone calls them. In retribution, Shiva and Lawrence try to kill Chellapa, who is in the ICU, also kidnapping Ambujam in the process. Murali rushes to the hospital, where he sees Chellapa still alive, after which he pursues the robbers, finally encountering them on the banks of the [[Cooum river]]. He kills both of them and rescues Ambujam.  The movie ends with Murali being honoured by the police department in the presence of Ambujam and Chellapa, for his role in thwarting the ATM robbery.  
The Signal (2014 film)
 Three [[MIT]] students – Jonah, Nic, and Haley – are on a road trip to move Haley to California, a decision that stresses Nic's relationship with her. Haley feels Nic is distancing himself from her and Nic explains he does not want his disability to hold her back (Nic walks with [[forearm crutches]], and the possibility of  [[muscular dystrophy]], [[multiple sclerosis]], or some other degenerative disease is implied but never specified). During their stay in a hotel, Nic and Jonah discover that a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] named NOMAD, who nearly got them expelled for breaking into MIT servers, has found their location and is taunting them with strange and ominous emails. They track NOMAD to an abandoned house in the middle of [[Nevada]] and decide to go after him. After finding nothing in the house, Nic and Jonah hear Haley scream and run outside, only to see her pulled into the sky before disappearing into a white light themselves.  Nic, now with the number 2.3.5.41 tattooed on his arm, wakes up in a strange and sterile underground research facility where he is questioned by Dr. Wallace Damon, the head of the "transition group" in charge of helping Nic to cope with his strange situation. Damon tells Nic what they encountered near the house was an EBE: an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] biological entity. Nic remains in a state of disbelief. Dr. Damon then shows him footage from Nic's own video camera and pauses where an alien face can be seen peering from behind a tree. Nic is taken to his room where he hears Jonah talking to him through a small vent in the wall, saying "(his) body feels weird." Nic also notices that his legs, previously weak but functional, are now completely numb. When Dr. Damon questions him again, Nic tries to get answers about Haley's condition (she is in a coma at the time), but is unsuccessful. Following an unexplained experiment on a cow in another part of the facility, a security alarm goes off and Nic, along with other personnel, finds large dents with scorch marks running across the walls and no sign of Jonah. Nic asks Damon where Jonah went but Damon tells him that Jonah was never recovered from the house. Increasingly agitated, Nic tries to break Haley out but is intercepted. After being restrained, he is shocked to discover that his legs have been amputated and replaced by prostheses made from alien technology. Nic then uses these super-powered limbs to break Haley and himself out of the facility, only to discover they are in the middle of a vast barren desert.  After hitching a ride with an old lady who seems sweet yet oddly troubled, Nic and Haley hijack an 18-wheeler truck to try to find a way around the seemingly endless canyon that extends around the facility and surrounding area. At a visitors center, they come across Jonah disguised as one of the facility workers dressed in a white [[HAZMAT]] suit. Jonah reveals that he too had limbs taken from him, as his forearms and hands have been replaced with the same alien technology as Nic's legs. Jonah speculates that they are in [[Area 51]] and that this is all a test. After Nic discovers indications of alien technology also implanted in Haley's spine, the trio drive up to a military checkpoint where Jonah tries to hack into their systems, only to be stopped by a hail of gunfire from the facility personnel. Nic and Jonah hug as the fatally wounded Jonah prepares for his final stand that will allow Nic and Haley to escape. Jonah uses his remaining strength and prosthetic alien arms to subdue the group of soldiers. However, Nic and Haley's escape is short-lived; as they approach the only bridge that would take them over the canyon to the outside world, they run into Damon and his military men, who blow out the truck's tires. Haley is evacuated by helicopter beyond the canyon and, knowing that Nic has mastered use of his legs, Damon tells Nic "you can't reach her." After hearing a loud horn coming from the sky, Nic realizes Damon is NOMAD. Damon then explains that it was Nic who came looking for him, that this was his fault, and adding that Nic is "the perfect integration of human will and alien technology. Our finest achievement." Agitated and emotionally compromised, Nic's bionic legs enable him to sprint at supersonic speed across the bridge in the direction of Haley's chopper, where he hits an invisible barrier and breaks through.  Nic finds himself inside what appears to be a different facility behind a projected image of the outside world beyond the canyon. Turning back toward the bridge, he sees Damon remove his helmet to reveal he's actually a robotic alien. Nic walks towards a window and realizes he is not in a facility, but is on an immense alien [[spacecraft]] numbered 2.3.5.41 (matching the numerical tattoo on his arm) that is about to dock at their home-world (signaled by the horn).

Siam-Burma Death Railway (film)
 This documentary film opens with [[World War II]] war between the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]], comprising [[United States|America]] – [[Australia]] – [[Netherlands]], under the leadership of [[Great Britain]], fought against the [[Axis countries]] of [[Germany]] – [[Japan]] and [[Italy]]. One  super-power, [[Japan]], had been waiting for a long time, expecting an opportunity to realise its plan of creating a 'Greater Asia'. Japan’s  plan was to extend its empire to include [[Singapore]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Thailand]] and [[Burma]] up to [[India]]. On 8th Dec 1941, [[Singapore]] fell at the hands of [[Japan]], which had begun the war in the name of Asian independence. Immediately, [[Japan]] decided to carry out its plans of creating a Greater Asia, basically an area under Japanese control. As a first step, [[Japan]] planned to lay the [[Siam]] – [[Burma]] railway line connecting [[Siam]](i.e., [[Thailand]]) and [[Myanmar]].  The [[Siam]]–[[Burma]] railway did not traverse benign terrain. It snaked through dark, deep valleys, climbed high mountain ranges and lengthy mountain passes, crossed great rivers and inhospitable rain forests. On 22 June 1942, the work of laying the railways began from Kanchanapuri, about 80&nbsp;km away from Thailand’s capital [[Bangkok]] and [[Thanbyuzayat]] about 55 miles away from [[Moulmein]], a major city of south [[Burma]]. About 60,000 [[prisoners of war]] of Allied Forces guided by 12,000 Japanese engineers, began the work of laying the railway line for about 415&nbsp;km.  After a few weeks, the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] realized it needed millions of people to complete the project. The Japanese army was prepared to use dangerous methods to make the dream come true. Thousands of [[Indian people|Indian]] [[Tamil people|Tamil]] and [[Demographics of Burma|Burmese]] labourers working in the Malay rubber estates caught their attention and they were brought to [[Thanbyuzayat]], with a promise of higher wages and comfortable stay. The labourers built wooden bridges in many places across [[Khwae Noi River|river Kwai]] in order to lay the railway. The bridges were washed by the floods in the river. The labourers were forced to reconstruct the bridges. The labourers were fed with rice thrice a day, along with dried fish or murrel from the river.  The conditions endured by  the [[POW]]<nowiki/>s of the Allied Forces were worse. Dressed in loin clothes they looked like skeletons. They looked pitiable as they were affected by skin diseases. Unable to withstand the sufferings many of them died. The [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] buried them near the railway line and planted a cross bearing their names. It is a fact that no words can describe the manner in which the Japanese army treated the dead and the dying.  On 16 October 1943 both the lines met at a place called 3 Pagoda on the Siam-Burma frontier. The railway line measured about 300&nbsp;km in [[Siam]] and 115&nbsp;km in Burma. The [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] celebrated the valediction like a [[festival]]. They indulged in entertaining themselves with feasts and merry-making.  August 6, 1945 is the last scene of this full length tragic movie about this episode in the [[Second World War]]. [[Japan|The Japan]]ese industrial city of Hiroshima was bombarded by [[United States|the USA]] on that day. The deeds of Japan were brought to an end with that incident. The [[POW]]<nowiki/>s of the Allied Forces were released from all over the world. Once again the [[British flag]] flew high in the Singapore sky. The [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese army]] stood silent in answer to the allegations of the court of war crime investigations. After listening to thousands of witnesses many of the officers and soldiers were branded as war criminals and were hanged to death.  The number of Asian labourers who lost their lives building the Death railway is estimated to be more than 100,000.  According to the statistical data, the number of Tamil labourers who died during the construction should be about 60,000 and [[Demographics of Burma|Burmese]] 30,000 in number. But researchers of [[World War II]] are of the opinion that the exact number of Asian labourers who died at the [[Death Railway]] is known only to the [[Japanese government]].

Stepping outside, he encounters four rich frat boys burning a homeless man alive. When Marv intervenes, the leader of the frat boys shoots him in the arm, calling him "[[Bernini (fashion)|Bernini]] Boy," which Marv mishears as "Bernie". They flee, and Marv follows them, stealing a police car on the way, which he crashes into their car, leading to his blackout and memory loss. He follows the two surviving frat boys into [[Sin City#Setting|The Projects]], the neighborhood where he grew up. With the assistance of the deadly residents lurking in the shadows, he dispatches the frat boys.

He immediately hits the jackpot on multiple [[slot machine]]s. Taking a young waitress, Marcie, with him as a good luck charm, he buys into the backroom [[poker]] game led by the all-powerful [[Roark family#Senator Roark|Senator Roark]]. Johnny repeatedly wins in the high-stakes game, and cleans the senator out. One other player, the corrupt police lieutenant Liebowitz, warns him to flee the city. Instead, Johnny takes Marcie out for a night on the town. He walks her home, and Roark's goons suddenly attack him. He fights them off, and tells Marcie to meet him at a hotel, and he is escorted into Roark's limousine. In payment for the humiliation he suffered at the card game, Roark takes back his money, and uses a pair of pliers to break the fingers of Johnny's playing hand. They toss Johnny out of the car, and the Senator shoots him in the leg. Roark reveals that he recognized Johnny as his illegitimate son.

She begs him to meet her at Kadie's saloon, and despite his embittered feelings, he agrees. When Ava arrives, she begs forgiveness for leaving him, and implies she is afraid for her life before her massive chauffeur, [[List of Sin City characters#Male antagonists|Manute]], arrives to escort her home. Unable to get her out of his mind, Dwight sneaks into Damien Lord's estate, where he observes Ava swimming, but is caught and beaten. Dwight is returned home, where a nude Ava waits for him. He tries to throw her out, but can't resist her and they make love. She tells him that Damien and Manute torture her physically and mentally, and she knows Damien will kill her soon. Manute arrives and viciously beats a naked Dwight, sending him out the window with a single punch.  Determined to rescue Ava, Dwight recruits Marv to help him, and they mount an assault on Lord's compound. Marv attacks Manute, putting him in traction, and tearing out his eye. Dwight confronts Damien Lord, who denies Ava's accusations, and an enraged Dwight beats him to death. As he reacts in horror, Ava appears and shoots Dwight several times, taunting him, and thanking him, for helping her murder her husband, and take over his fortune. She shoots him in the face and forces him to fall out of a window, where Marv rescues him and takes him to Old Town. Dwight's old flame, [[The Girls of Old Town#Enforcers|Gail]], recognizes him and saves his life. With the help of Gail, and the deadly assassin [[Miho (Sin City)|Miho]], Dwight undergoes reconstructive surgery on his face, and plots his revenge.  Meanwhile, two detectives, Mort, and Bob, investigate Damien's death. Ava claims Dwight was an obsessive ex-lover, and he killed her husband in a jealous rage. Bob is skeptical, but Ava seduces Mort, who believes her every word. They begin an affair and Ava pressures him to find and kill Dwight. When Mort, obsessed with Ava, attempts to track Dwight down in Old Town, an action that would break the truce between the police and the prostitutes, Bob attempts to stop him. An enraged Mort shoots Bob in the face, then commits suicide afterward. Out of options, Ava reluctantly partners with the mob boss [[Wallenquist Organization#Leadership|Wallenquist]].  Dwight, with his face newly reconstructed, is accompanied by Gail, and Miho, poses as Wallenquist's man from Texas. Inside Ava's estate, however, Manute sees past the new face, and captures Dwight. Gail and Miho strike from Dwight's car, and Dwight shoots Manute with a hidden .45 he had up his left sleeve. Six bullets fail to kill him, and Manute aims shakily at Dwight, as Ava unexpectedly grabs one of Manute's guns, shooting Manute several times. She attempts to convince Dwight to pair with her, and that the pain he suffered revealed his true intentions, but Dwight shoots her mid-kiss, and she dies in his arms.  ==="The Long Bad Night (Part II)"=== Johnny visits an unlicensed doctor, Kroenig, who shoots up heroin before trading his services for Johnny's last $40, and his shoes. Realizing he left Marcie unprotected, Johnny rushes to his hotel, but finds Roark waiting for him, along with Marcie's dismembered head and hands. Again, Roark lets him go. Intent on taking down Roark, Johnny scrounges a dollar from a sympathetic waitress, Bertha, which he uses to regain enough money playing slots to buy his way into Roark's game the following night. Playing a card shark's con, Johnny folds his first few hands, allowing Roark to taunt him about his dead mother. He once again cons Roark into going all in, then reveals his winning hand. Johnny taunts Roark, reminding him that tonight's story of how the same man beat him twice will follow him for the rest of his life. His vengeance completed, Johnny smiles resignedly, a single tear running down his face as Roark shoots him in the head, commanding his men to get rid of the body.  ==="Nancy's Last Dance"=== Four years after [[Sin City (film)#"That Yellow Bastard (Part II)"|"That Yellow Bastard"]]," Nancy Callahan is in a deep depression over [[John Hartigan]]'s death. She is obsessed with getting revenge on Senator Roark for having driven Hartigan to kill himself. As she wallows in despair, the ghost of Hartigan watches over her, unable to reach her but still attempting to help. On the same night that Johnny joins the backroom poker game, Nancy attempts to shoot Roark from the stage of Kadie's, but she can't bring herself to pull the trigger.  Nancy hallucinates a visit from Roark, and shortly thereafter cuts her hair and smashes a mirror, using its shards to cut her face. She decides to get Marv to help her kill Roark by showing him the scars, and making him believe that Roark was responsible. As they step out of the club, they meet a motorcycle gang that are there to shoot up the place.  Marv kills two, but leaves their leader for Nancy to finish off. The pair mount an assault on Roark's compound. Marv slaughters Roark's bodyguards, while Nancy picks off the guards with a crossbow. Marv is wounded, but Nancy continues alone to confront Roark.

The Sisterhood of Night
 The story begins in [[Kingston, New York]] where Emily Parris ([[Kara Hayward]]) decides to get back at her classmate, Mary Warren ([[Georgie Henley]]), for ruining her audition for a school play. While Mary, forced by the theatre teacher, holds her audition, Emily steals Mary's phone and publishes all of Mary's text on her blog. Mary then retaliates by calling Emily a blog whore in front of the whole school, which landed both girls in the guidance counselor, Gordy Gambhir's ([[Kal Penn]]) office. Later that night, Mary writes on her Facebook wall that she will be taking a vow of silence, and afterwards deletes her Facebook and all other social media accounts. This is when Mary gets the idea to create the Sisterhood, and the first members she recruits are Catherine Huang (Willa Cuthrell) and Lavinia Hall ([[Olivia DeJonge]]). Together, the three girls venture out into the night, disappearing into the forest by the city border, and begin their ritual.  By the next school year, the Sisterhood has grown into a common knowledge between the girls at school, though no one except for those who are in it really knows what's going on in the woods at night due to a vow of silence each girl takes, and the girls that aren't in it want to be, but each member has to be chosen by Mary. Emily longs to be in the Sisterhood, and when a girl named Hilda gets picked instead of her, she steals the folded paper square each Sisterhood girl is presented with from Hilda's bag. She then memorizes it and makes her own version when she gets home. After figuring out the meeting place, Emily follows Hilda and another Sisterhood girl to the woods, hiding as the girls begin their ritual. While snapping a photograph, she gets spotted and is next seen lying in her bed, posting a new update on her blog. The update describes how she heard the girls chant dirty things, undress and touch each other, and then cut Emily's hand with a knife before touching her too. Later, Emily runs into Mary during Mass and proceeds to make a scene about all the things Mary did to her. Emily then faints and wakes up to Mary saying how she will never be one of them, and then leaves with Catherine and Lavinia.  Mary, Catherine, Lavinia, and the rest of the Sisterhood girls uphold their vow of silence when parents, teachers, and even reporters (who all have read Emily's blog) ask them about the Sisterhood. Lavinia's mother, Rose Hall, searches Lavinia's room and discovers a doll with a pentagram-like symbol drawn on the stomach. After Lavinia returns from a Sisterhood meeting, she is confronted by her mother who finds the same symbol tattooed under her rib age. At the same time, two more girls come forward with the same confession that what happened to Emily happened to them as well, causing more hysteria to rise. Emily and the two girls come up with a plan on how they will get Lavinia, a fragile girl who's struggling with her mother's constant dating, to confess about what the Sisterhood is really about. Lavinia, angry at her mother, searches her room and finds a book called The Joy Of Sex, which she secretly reads at night, masturbating afterwards.  The same night, Mary accidentally finds herself alone outside while trying to avoid being caught for being out after the newly set curfew. Her original plan was to talk to Jeff, her boyfriend who she was dating in secret. Tired of being her secret, Jeff breaks it off, unwilling to be hidden anymore. Mary, broken hearted, had snuck out to reconcile with him, but he doesn't come to his window when she throws stones at it. Not knowing what to do, she turned to Gambhir's house. She manages to invite herself in, and she talks to Gambhir.  Unbeknownst to them, they are observed by Sue Parris ([[Jessica Hecht]]), Emily's mother, who snaps a picture of the two of them, assuming they are in a sexual relationship. After taking some of Gambhir's prescription pills, Mary spends the night on his couch, and is awoken by her mother the next morning, having seen the photo Sue Parris sent out. Gambhir is then fired from his job at the school, even after both him and Mary swear nothing happened. Feeling that things are starting to spin out of control, Catherine and Lavinia try to convince Mary to tell everyone what's really going on, but Mary refuses to break the vow and promises that she'll fix it. Mary tries to talk to the parents and reporters to dispel the situation at a small press conference at the school, but Gambhir  is present and is interrogated by the press and the angry parents, so Mary is unable to tell them what happened. Mary then fashions the now infamous paper square, just like the ones she gives to the Sisterhood girls, and gives it to Gambhir, inviting him to see for himself. He gets Rose Hall ([[Laura Fraser]]), Lavinia's mother, to come with him, and the two of them witness as the girls do nothing but stand in a circle around a fire, sharing their secrets, hopes and dreams out loud before burning the piece of paper with their written secrets in the fire, thus keeping them a secret forever. During this and through a montage of sisterhood meetings, Catherine and Mary reveal their biggest secrets; Catherine wishes for her mother to die or get better, she also misses her mom (it is implied throughout that she has cancer) while Mary admits that she wants to lose her virginity to someone she is in love with, and that she is in love with Jeff. The sisterhood walk away from the bonfire and sit and think in silence, while Mary stares at Gambhir and Rose, unbeknownst to the other girls. It is also revealed that Lavinia feared no one would ever kiss her, which she'd said during a sisterhood meeting.   Emily, who has been invited to a radio show to speak about her experience of being molested, starts having second thoughts about her plan to get Lavinia to talk, and decides to pull out, much to the dismay of her two friends, who still decide to go ahead with the plan. Emily tries to call Lavinia, warning her to not go out tonight, but it's too late, as Lavinia has already been lured to the woods by Travis, a boy she has a crush on. In the woods, Travis gets her to take her shirt off, and is then ambushed by the same girls who are friends with Emily. They hold her down while putting a witch hat on her head, forcing her to say that the Sisterhood girls are witches, and then make her touch herself, all while filming it with a video camera. They upload the video to the internet, drug Lavinia, and then take her to a Halloween party. At the party, they show everyone the video and start to spread it around, all the while calling Lavinia a freak, slut, and a whore. Unable to take the pressure anymore, Lavinia commits suicide by overdosing on her mother's medication.  During Lavinia's funeral, Mary, knowing that Lavinia had never been kissed, asks Jeff to do so, out of respect. Emily confesses to everyone that she made the whole thing up, that she wanted to be in the Sisterhood so badly and was angry when Mary refused to accept her, and she begs for forgiveness. Emily's blog is revealed to be a hoax, and Emily is persecuted. However, her blog is widely held on the basis that it had assisted an exceptional number of sexual abuse victims despite the false pretense of which it was made popular. Catherine shaves off all of her hair and visits her sick mother in the hospital (which is implied she is undergoing chemotherapy treatments). Mary and Jeff meet each other in the photo room and start a relationship. She and Catherine then decide to go through with a dance they had prepared, choreographed to Lavinia's original music, for school and do it in Lavinia's memory. Emily, who has finally received the Sisterhood paper square, stands at the set location and waits unsure as Mary comes up to her and invites her to join them. She then dances together with the rest of the Sisterhood girls down the streets of Kingston and into the woods. The movie ends with a narrative about how the Sisterhood will continue to be a secret to outsiders, that the secret will be passed on to new members and disappear into darkness.

Skin Trade (film)
  As a [[prologue]]. a nameless Cambodian girl leaves her village for Bangkok. Upon arriving, she is kidnapped, drugged, and sold in the "skin trade" ([[human trafficking]]).  The action moves to the [[city of Newark]], where a [[Newark Police Department]] [[detective]] named Nick Cassidy discovers that Serbian mobster Viktor Dragovic is in New Jersey. Meanwhile, in Bangkok, detective Tony Vitayakul attempts to buy a Thai girl from a group of human traffickers. When his cover is blown, he subdues the traffickers and frees the girl from captivity, gleaning the identity of a ship being used to transport trafficked girls, where the ship will dock, and that Dragovic will be present to receive the shipment.  Cassidy and his captain, Costello, brief a group of police officers on Dragovic, revealing he is "a major player" in human trafficking worldwide. As the cargo ship carrying Dragovic's container approaches America, Cassidy and the department prepare to intercept it at the docks. When the ship arrives, Dragovic discovers the trafficked women have died during transport. The ship's captain is held responsible, tortured, then shot in the head. A shootout erupts as the police move in for an arrest. Cassidy chases Dragovic and his youngest son, Andre, as they flee. He fatally shoots Andre in self-defense and Dragovic is arrested. While in custody, Dragovic arranges to have Cassidy and his entire family murdered, having his house blown up. Cassidy's wife and daughter are killed, while Cassidy survives despite being shot in the back.  Costello and Reed, an FBI agent, visit Cassidy in hospital. They tell him Dragovic fled the US after being [[bail]]ed. Soon after they leave, Cassidy steals an [[opiate]] drug and clothing and staggers out of the hospital unnoticed. He gathers his personal guns and travels to the restaurant of Dragovic's attorney. After forcing the attorney to reveal Dragovic's whereabouts, Cassidy shoots the attorney and blows up the restaurant.  In Cambodia, Senator Khat warns Dragovic that unless he leaves the country immediately, he will be arrested and extradited to the United States. Dragovic blackmails the Senator into giving him two weeks to put his affairs in order and flee.  Cassidy travels to Thailand in pursuit of Dragovic. Believing that Cassidy has experienced a [[psychotic break|nervous breakdown]], the US authorities have sent Reed to detain him as soon as he arrives. Tony and his partner, Nung, are told to assist with the arrest. At Suvarnabhumi airport, Cassidy flees as the police try to arrest him. Reed, who has been [[Corruption|bought off]] by Dragovic, kills Nung and frames Cassidy for the murder.

Vitayakul and Reed arrive at the nightclub and attempt to arrest Cassidy. After fighting with Vitayakul, Cassidy escapes injured. Meanwhile, Reed uses the timing of a call on Vitayakul's cell phone to discover the identity of an informant: Vitayakul's girlfriend, Min. While Cassidy is attempting to locate Janko, Dragovic's [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] son, who oversees Dragovic's southeast Asian human trafficking business, a shootout erupts between Cassidy and Janko's men. Janko flees the warehouse but is killed by Ivan and Goran Dragovic, his half-brothers, on behalf of their father. Vitayakul arrives and attempts to kill Cassidy, but after learning the truth about his partner's death, he kills Reed instead. Before dying, Janko reveals his father's location. {{Quote box  |title = Closing narration  |quote = I don't know where she is. But whatever it takes, wherever I have to go, I'm gonna find my daughter.  |source = Nick Cassidy  |align = right  |width = 220px  |border = 1px  |fontsize = 85%  |salign = right }} The next day, Cassidy and Vitayakul storm Dragovic's compound. Ivan is guarding Min at gunpoint, but Vitayakul shoots him. Cassidy destroys a vehicle with a rocket-launcher, and as a result, Dragovic's helicopter leaves without him. During a shootout between the two detectives and Dragovic's men, Goran is killed in a hand-to-hand fight with Vitayakul. After the shootout, Cassidy fights with Dragovic, ultimately stabbing him in the chest, despite Dragovic commandeering a second helicopter.

The Skeleton Twins
 Milo (Hader) writes a suicide note and cuts his wrists. Meanwhile, Maggie (Wiig) is in her bathroom preparing to swallow a handful of pills, but is interrupted by a call from a hospital informing her that her brother – whom she hasn't seen in 10 years – has unsuccessfully attempted suicide. Maggie visits Milo in the hospital in Los Angeles, and suggests that he come to stay with her in their hometown of [[Nyack, New York]] for a while; he reluctantly agrees. Milo meets Maggie's gregarious husband Lance (Luke Wilson), who tells Milo he and Maggie are trying to have a baby. This surprises Milo, as Maggie never expressed wanting children. Milo reacquaints himself with the town, and observes Rich (Burrell), a middle-aged man working in a bookstore. Meanwhile, Maggie is taking scuba lessons, and having sex with the instructor, Billy (Holbrook).  At Milo's invitation, their mother (Gleason) makes a surprise visit.  Maggie asks Milo if she'd be a good mother, and Milo honestly replies that she'd be overprotective and uptight, which upsets her; he later apologizes, joking that the reason he said that was his concern about her "morbid obesity." Maggie later confesses to Milo that she's been taking birth control pills, both to avoid having a child with Lance and because she's been sleeping with the instructors of all the classes she's been taking. She worries that she's not worthy to be married to Lance, but Milo reassures her.  Milo meets with Rich, who was his high school English teacher. They had a sexual relationship when Milo was 15. Rich now has a 16-year-old son, and is dating a woman. Milo lies about his career, claiming to have an acting agent in Los Angeles, when he really just waits tables at a tourist restaurant. Milo and Rich spend the night together. Later Milo shows up at Rich's house while his son is there, infuriating him with the danger of his past being exposed. Milo gets drunk, and throws away a trinket that Rich had given him in high school, which he still carried as a keepsake.  Milo tells Maggie about a boy that had once bullied him, who – their father had assured him – would reach his peak in high school and have a miserable adult life. But it turned out that the bully had a successful happy life, and it was Milo who had peaked in high school. Maggie asks for reassurance that he won't kill himself, and he promises to try not to. Maggie and Milo spend Halloween together, and reminisce about their father's death. Milo leaves his phone behind when he goes to the bathroom, and Maggie sees an incoming call from Rich. She is upset with Milo for resuming contact with Rich. Maggie had exposed their sexual relationship, ending Rich's teaching career.  Lance confides to Milo that he is concerned that he may be infertile. Milo mentions that Maggie used to hide cigarettes around the house, planting the idea for Lance to look for medications that might be to blame. Maggie's menstrual period is late, and she considers buying a pregnancy test. She runs into an old classmate with a badly-behaved child, which adds to her anxiety about parenting, but she is relieved when she begins menstruating.  Maggie ends the relationship with Billy, and returns home. There she is confronted by Lance, who is painfully confused by the birth control pills he has found. She admits to her affairs, then confronts Milo, blaming him for ruining her marriage. Milo retorts that it was no "marriage" and she lashes back suggesting that next time he tries suicide to do it right. Maggie leaves Milo a voicemail echoing his suicide note, and goes to the pool where she'd been taking scuba lessons. Tying weights to herself, she jumps into the pool. As she begins to drown, she panics but is unable to free herself. Milo, having heard her message, jumps in the pool and rescues her.  The film closes with the twins at Milo's home, looking at his fish tank full of goldfish.

Further investigation reveals that every air and Toxic slug in Slugterra has been turned as well. While on their way to help deal with the chaos the group are ambushed by the Shadow clan and brought to their base of operations. There Eli is slugged by an Enigmo slug containing a holographic message from Will Shane.  The Hologram explains that in the event that Will is no longer with him, and if Slugterra was ever truly in danger, then the Shadow Clan have instructions to find Eli and hit him with that slug, which details the legend of the elementals. According to legend all slugs evolved from five slugs that regulate and control the life blood of Slugterra, each representing one of the five elements, earth, fire, water, wind and energy.  If in the event that one of them were to be affected by something, say for example becoming a ghoul, then all of their descendants will also be affected, even those who have since evolved into unique sub elements like the Toxic slugs. If in the event that such a thing were happen then Eli must find all five slugs, de-ghouled, and shoot them all at once which will effectively cure every slug in Slugterra.  With the wind slug having obviously already been ghouled, the group decides to go after the water slug next. There the group discover that in addition to the fact that the high number of ghouled slugs have effected the environment, such as regular water being turned into dark water. But that they have been beaten to the water slug by a newly formed alliance of the Dark Bane, the Goon with a new dark slinger and a heavily mutated Doctor Blakk.  With the water elemental ghouled as well, the Shane Gang decide to go after the Earth elemental next. The Shane Gang's lack of trust in Junjie nearly costs them their lives when they almost drown in mud, saved only because of the earth elemental. Meanwhile, the alliance has gone to quiet lawn cavern to collect the energy elemental, only to learn that it's not there. After the Alliance leaves the Shane Gang arrive and soon hit the same roadblock as the alliance have, not even with Kord elemental slug tracker. However Eli puts two and two together realizes that having found Doc inside Quiet Lawn realizes that Doc is the energy elemental.  With the tally two slugs each the group decides to go and get the final slug. With the only entrance into the cavern being a large hole leading Junjie and Eli are forced to go alone as they are the only ones who can ride their Infurnuses to the top. Unfortunately in the middle of the flight, the fire elemental got ghouled turning the two Infurnuses into Ghouls as well. Kord gets the idea to scrap their mecha-beasts for parts to build jet packs to fly to the top and provide much needed back up. The fight spills out into the heavily ghouled mushroom forest where the Goon is separated from his slinger, who is revealed to be none other than Eli's own long lost father Will Shane.  Further more the earth elemental is ghouled as well, leaving the group only their energy slugs to fight with and Doc their only hope to cure the elementals. Dr. Blakk and the Goon make the decision to put their differences aside to defeat the Shane Gang. In the resulting cross fire, a shot from the wind elemental opens a terra portal into the deep caverns that Will knocks himself, Blakk, and the Goon into. As much as it pains him to do so the others convince Eli to fire off the slugs with the others, saving Slugterra but sealing the portal. Eli promises himself that the group will rescue his father, and nothing is going to stand in their way.  <ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3839992/plotsummary</ref>

A period of heavy rain causes the rice fields to become swamped and damages all remaining crops, leaving the family without a source of income. While attending a village festival, Lakshmi meets Bimla, a foreign woman who entices her with stories of the city and offers her a job in [[India]] as a maid. Lakshmi's mother rejects the proposal, but her father reveals that he has already agreed and accepted money from Bimla, out of desperation.  Lakshmi and Bimla pass the border without incident and arrive at their destination, a building known as 'Happiness House', which is a [[brothel]] run by a woman named Mumtaz. Unaware that she has been sold into [[sexual slavery]], Lakshmi mingles with the other girls at the brothel, including Shahanna and Anita, who she befriends; and the temperamental Monica. Later that night, she is dressed and prepared for Varun, an important and high paying customer who has a preference for virgins. Resisting his advances, Lakshmi bites Varun and uses the ensuing chaos to escape the building. On the street, she blindly runs for help but is caught and beaten by Mumtaz's workers, who subsequently lock her in an isolated room. While looking out of the window, Lakshmi is spotted by Sophia, an [[United States|American]] [[photographer]] who has arrived in India to work with an anti-trafficking organisation, Hope House. Sophia takes pictures of Lakshmi, but she is noticed by a brothel worker, Suren, who breaks her camera. After recovering the photos, Sophia becomes determined to save 'the girl in the window', and requests help from Hope House manager Mrs. Tripathi, and her investigators Vikram and Sam.  After multiple failed attempts to ensure her cooperation, Mumtaz drugs Lakshmi with [[Tranquillity|tranquilizer]] by tricking her into believing that it is [[melon]] [[juice]] and prepares her once again for Varun, who rapes her. The next day, she is drugged again and forced to service multiple men. Sophia asks Vikram to raid Happiness House, but he is reluctant to do so without proper planning. No longer new, Lakshmi is given a bed in the communal living space and made to work as the other women do. She befriends Harish, a young boy living at the brothel with his infant sister Gina and mother Pushpa, who is a sickly prostitute. After witnessing workers bury a body in a shallow grave, Lakshmi contemplates [[suicide]] but is stopped by Shahanna. Days pass and soon Lakshmi becomes resigned to her fate. She calculates the number of days needed for her to pay off her debt to Mumtaz, but is discouraged by Shahanna, who warns her that there will be consequences if her notes are found. Anita tries to escape, and is punished by Mumtaz, who shoves chilli peppers into her vagina in front of the others. Lakshmi saves Shahanna after she is attacked by an irate customer, and Bimla informs her that the bodies of those who die on the premises are buried in the garden. Monica, who has managed to pay back her debt to Mumtaz after five years, leaves the brothel and returns to her village, where she expects to be welcomed as a heroine since she has been financially providing for her family. Vikram and Sam arrive at Happiness House, posing as customers. Sam gives Lakshmi a card containing the details of Hope House and informs her that a raid will be held soon. The exchange is overheard by Anita. Lakshmi confides in Shahanna, who is dismissive and claims that American men are sent to kidnap girls and harvest their organs. A bruised and battered Monica returns to Happiness House, having being beaten by her father and thrown out of her village. A week later, the women are taken to see a doctor, who examines them and discovers that Monica has [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], a symptom of [[HIV/AIDS]]. She is forced to leave the brothel.  While delivering soft-drinks to customers, Harish sees Lakshmi in the garden and offers her a bottle. They hide from Suren, who comes looking for Harish and the missing crate of drinks. Anita witnesses the scene and causes a power outage, which stops the pair being found and punished. Mumtaz confronts the women about the power cut, and finds the Hope House card. Anita falsely claims it is hers and is struck by Mumtaz, but she is able to return the card to Lakshmi and tells her that she lied in order to buy time for the upcoming raid. The raid begins but the police and Sam find nothing since the younger girls are hidden away by Bimla. Sophia apologises to Vikram for pushing him to conduct a premature search. Anita is sold by Mumtaz to the Middle East, where she will be a sex slave and never be able to return. Pushpa becomes increasingly sick and is forced to leave with Harish and Gina, since she can no longer work. Lakshmi begins to plan her escape, and manages to slip out of a window while the others are watching a [[religious festival]] on TV. She is chased by the brothel workers but manages to escape in the thick crowds of worshipers. After initially getting lost, Lakshmi finally makes her way to Hope House and is reunited with Harish. Using her information, the police conduct a surprise raid on Happiness House, and find the hidden girls and buried bodies. Bimla, Suren and others are arrested, but Mumtaz gets away. Later that night, the rescued girls burn their working clothes at Hope House.

During his first few days at the prison, he finds his cellmate is being sexually abused by another group of prisoners led by a man named Dave. JR also comes across the charismatic Brendan Lynch ([[Ewan McGregor]]), Australia's public enemy #1 and a notorious [[armed robber]]. Lynch is playing a game of [[correspondence chess]] when a passing JR points out an unseen checkmate against Lynch, demonstrates the move, and is dismissed. Later, JR finds his cellmate sharpening a [[shiv (weapon)|shiv]] with the intention of defending himself against Dave. When Dave and his gang move to attack the cellmate, JR prevents the attack by initiating a fight. Lynch scolds JR for meddling in other people's affairs, and soon after, JR's cellmate is once again sexually assaulted. His cellmate attempts to commit suicide and he is hospitalized, causing Dave to focus his sexual attacks on JR. When Dave and his gang try to rape JR, Lynch and his men, Sterlo (Matt Nable) and Merv (Eddie Baroo), rescue JR and kill Dave. In exchange for Lynch's protection during JR's sentence, JR agrees to perform tasks for Lynch once he gets out of prison.  Upon release six months later, JR meets crime lord Sam (Jacek Koman), with whom Lynch is playing chess, and his nephew Josh (Tom Budge). JR is given an apartment to live in, as well as a briefcase of Lynch's personal effects, including fake passports, clothes, and a pistol. Soon afterwards, a pretty young woman named Tasha ([[Alicia Vikander]]) arrives at the apartment to give JR some cash and a cellphone, which is used to receive instructions. Following instructions given, JR visits Private Wilson (Damon Herriman) at his trailer and illegally purchases various assault weapons. Upon receiving instructions, JR hijacks a helicopter used for scenic tours, and instructs the pilot, at gunpoint, to fly to the prison Lynch is still being held at. Lynch, Sterlo, and Merv orchestrate an escape by taking one of the prison guards hostage until JR's helicopter arrives to extract them. Upon landing, the four men leave the helicopter and pilot in a field and drive away in a getaway car. While the car is stopped at a convenience store and Merv is buying food, the other three discover from a radio broadcast that Merv was incarcerated for raping a Perth schoolgirl, which Merv lied about to Lynch and Sterlo. Soon afterwards, Lynch brutally beats Merv and expels him from the crew.  The three head to Sam's estate, where he recruits Lynch and his men to execute a gold heist at Kalgoorlie, where the expected payout is in the millions. Afterwards, a party occurs at the estate, and JR spots Tasha, whom he follows to the poolside. Before long, Josh decides to harass JR and pushes him into the pool. JR, unable to swim, is rescued by Tasha, and the two leave the party to eat at a Chinese restaurant. Here, Tasha reveals her previous relationship with Sam, and how people who run from him are killed.  The next morning, Lynch warns JR to stay focused on the task at hand and not be distracted by Tasha. They then visit the quarry they plan to rob. Lynch tells JR that his role in the heist will be to access the room with the gold and ensure that no quarry employees press the [[panic button]]. Lynch then goes and recruits a [[rally race]]r named Chris (Nash Edgerton) to be the getaway driver. Back at Sam's estate, the gang plan the heist, and a fight breaks out between JR and Josh. The fight is broken up and Lynch tells JR to go calm down. JR heads to the bar where he sees Tasha, and scares away some men who are harassing her. Angry with his impulsiveness in scaring away the men, given that she does not have proper immigration papers, Tasha tells JR that he was being stupid, but when JR asks her to coffee, she asks him to meet her near his house. Later that night, JR sneaks out to meet Tasha and goes into the water after her, and the two have sex in the water.  The next day, the group goes ahead with the heist. The group infiltrates the quarry and inserts JR into the ventilation shaft above the gold room. When the time comes, JR successfully intimidates the gold room employees to not press the panic button, and lets the rest of the crew in. Lynch then takes two employees to pour the melted gold into bars, but he goes against the plan and asks Josh to guard the employees while JR watches the gold pouring. This infuriates Josh, who ends up shooting an employee in the leg. Lynch breaks Josh's nose with the stock of a shotgun, and returns to watching the gold being poured. Police arrive, and the crew walks into the open disguised as employees, but holding the real employees at gunpoint. Then, Lynch releases the hostages and opens fire on the police vehicles and personnel. Chris arrives with the getaway vehicle, but on their way out, Sterlo is shot through the abdomen and begins bleeding heavily. Chris manages to incapacitate the two chasing police vehicles and escape, but Sterlo dies at the end of the chase, instructing Lynch to give his cut of the heist to his wife.  Sam betrays Lynch, JR, and Tasha, but the three escape safely. The three travel to Melbourne where Sam plans to meet his fence. JR and Lynch sabotage the rendezvous, killing Sam's henchman and kidnapping Josh in the process. After interrogating Josh, they find the gold stashed in a storage unit.  Lynch and JR kill Sam in his estate. Before JR and Lynch escape for good, Lynch offers him $350,000 to leave. Here it is revealed that when JR realized Lynch would discard him once he had acquired the gold, JR masterminded a plan to steal the gold with Tasha and take half. Lynch has no choice but to accept JR's terms and wait. Before he receives the gold, however, a woman in a laundromat identifies him as the escaped convict, and Lynch is sent back to jail. Later JR sends Lynch a postcard detailing where the gold has been left for him, and a picture of a pregnant Tasha, hinting at an optimistic future.

Son of God (film)
 John, the last surviving disciple of Christ, is living in exile as he tells his story.  Jesus was born to a [[Virgin Mary|virgin]]. [[Biblical Magi|Three visiting wise men]] declare him the future King. Thirty years later, an adult [[Jesus Christ]] ([[Diogo Morgado]]) travels to [[Galilee]] and begins recruiting followers, from [[James, son of Zebedee|James]], to his brother [[John the Apostle|John]], to [[Peter the Apostle|Peter]] the fisherman, to [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] the tax collector. These men and women would become his disciples. Through his teachings and numerous miracles, Jesus builds a huge following, who begin to call him the [[Messiah]]. He also draws the attention of the [[Pharisees]], the Jewish religious leaders. The Pharisees claim Jesus is blaspheming God by forgiving sins, something only God can do. Jesus responds by saying he is the son of God.  Jesus tells the disciples they are to travel to [[Jerusalem]] for the upcoming [[Passover]] holiday. He enters the city on the back of a donkey and is met by a huge crowd of supporters, who lay palm leaves in his path. [[Caiaphas]], the head of the Pharisees, is afraid Jesus' presence in the city will further agitate the people, who are already in a near state of revolt against the oppressive Romans, led by [[Pontius Pilate]]. (Earlier, Pilate had warned Caiaphas that if there were any trouble from the Jews, Pilate would close the temple, thus cancelling Passover.) Upon entering the temple, Jesus sees the money changers and proceeds to upend their tables. This act draws cheers from the people and scorn from the Pharisees. Later, Jesus tells a little girl that every stone of the temple will soon fall. The Pharisees take this as a plan to destroy the temple and decide Jesus must be stopped.  [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], one of Jesus' disciples, approaches the Pharisees. He also believes Jesus is going too far and wants to help. They give him [[30 pieces of silver]] for his assistance. That night (the night before Passover), Jesus tells the disciples this will be their [[Last Supper]] together and says that one of them will betray him. Later, in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], Judas kisses Jesus' cheek, thereby identifying Jesus to the Pharisees and revealing Judas' betrayal, and Jesus is then arrested for blasphemy. The disciples then flee the garden to save themselves.  Caiaphas orders an immediate trial, even though it's late at night and not in public, which are violations of Jewish law. He is afraid an open trial on Passover will cause trouble, and Pilate will close the temple. Caiaphas asks Jesus if he is the son of God, and he answers "I am". This is all the Pharisees need to hear, and they immediately find Him guilty of blasphemy.  That morning, to a growing crowd, Caiaphas announces Jesus' guilt and reveals the penalty for blasphemy is death. Judas, horrified by what he has done, throws the silver at the Pharisees and runs off; he later hangs himself. Caiaphas believes if the Pharisees killed Jesus on Passover, it would start a riot, so he turns him over to the Romans for the punishment. Pilate tells Caiaphas that Jesus didn't break any Roman laws, but orders him to be lashed 40 times. Since it's Passover, Pilate says he will follow tradition and free a prisoner of the people's choosing, and if they choose Jesus, he will be set free. By this time, Jesus' mother [[Mary, Mother of God|Mary]] ([[Roma Downey]]) has arrived in Jerusalem to see what is happening to her son.  Pilate orders the crowd to enter his courtyard to choose whether to release Jesus or [[Barabbas]], a convicted murderer. Since none of Jesus' followers were allowed into the courtyard, Caiaphas easily sways the vote so that Barabbas is set free. Pilate then asks what he should do with Jesus, and again Caiaphas sways the crowd to have him executed by way of [[crucifixion]]. Fearing a riot among the hostile people, Pilate orders the crucifixion, then literally washes his hands of the situation. A battered and bloodied Jesus then carries his cross to [[Golgotha]] and is nailed to it by the mocking Roman guards, who earlier had placed a [[crown of thorns]] on his head. Before the cross is put into place, Pilate orders a sign attached to it, reading: "The King of the Jews", much to Caiaphas' dismay. With John, Mary, and [[Mary Magdalene]] watching in horror, Jesus hangs from the cross for several agonizing hours. After forgiving the Romans, and the Pharisees who condemned him to death, he asks why God has forsaken him, and declares "It is finished." Accomplished, Jesus dies as the temple and earth shake by earthquake. While the lamps are knocked down, the curtains in the temple where God's spirit was supposed to be present, tear apart. He is then lowered from the cross and placed into a tomb, which is sealed off with a large rock.  Three days later, Mary Magdalene goes to visit the tomb, but is shocked to see the rock broken into pieces and the tomb empty. She sees a man by the tomb's entrance and realizes he is Jesus; [[Resurrection of Jesus|Jesus has been resurrected]]. Mary goes to the disciples' hiding place and tells them the good news, but they don't believe her. Jesus then appears to them, and they all now believe, except [[Doubting Thomas|"Doubting" Thomas]]. Once Thomas touches Jesus, then he believes. Forty days later, Jesus is speaking to his disciples and tells them to travel the world to spread his message. He then ascends into Heaven, and the disciples go their separate ways.  The movie concludes with an elderly John saying that all of the disciples were eventually killed for their beliefs, except him. He has been exiled to live alone on a deserted island until he dies. John then sees Jesus, who tells him he will not die, but have [[Everlasting life#Religious|everlasting life]], and Jesus will return one day.  
Son of Batman
   At the headquarters of the [[League of Assassins]], [[Ra's al Ghul]] grooms [[Damian Wayne]] (son of his daughter, [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]], and [[Batman]]) to succeed him as head of the league. The league is attacked by a group of assassins led by [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]], Ra's al Ghul's initial choice for successor before meeting Batman. Feeling betrayed, Slade decides to seize power. During the battle, Ra's is defeated and fatally burned, dying before he can reach the [[Lazarus Pit]]. Damian stabs Slade's right eye during the battle, forcing him to flee. Talia takes Damian to [[Gotham City]] to meet his father and ask for his protection.  In Gotham City, Batman confronts [[Killer Croc]], who is stealing mutagenic chemicals and steroids to enhance himself. Batman gets ambushed by Croc before Talia electrocutes the latter from behind. She tells Batman about her father's death and leaves their son in his care, though Damian believes that he can take care of himself and does not need Batman. Slade, now calling himself Deathstroke, captures [[Man-Bat|Dr. Kirk Langstrom]], who conspired with both Croc and Ra's, promising the latter a formula for his soldiers. Slade threatens Langstrom's wife [[Francine Langstrom|Francine]] and his daughter Rebecca to force him to recreate the Man-Bat formula for him. Damian bypasses Wayne Towers security to speak to Bruce, telling him that Deathstroke's contact [[Ubu (DC Comics)|Ubu]] is stationed in Gotham. Although Damian wants to avenge Ra's al Ghul by killing Deathstroke, Bruce objects to Damian's willingness to take lives. Talia is captured by Deathstroke when she and her assassins attack his compound.  Against Batman's orders, Damian leaves the Batcave and, after a chase and a long fight, defeats Ubu, whom he located by accessing the Bat-Computer. Before Damian can kill him, [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]] arrives, mistakes him for a criminal and subdues him before bringing him back to the Batcave. Batman berates Damian for his recklessness, willingness to kill and exposing their operation. Batman then has Damian don the mantle of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] to teach him discipline. Searching for a lead on Langstrom's location, Batman goes to Arkham to interrogate a rabid Killer Croc, who supplied the mutagens to Langstrom in exchange for his enhancements and is currently going through drastic, agonizing withdrawal symptoms that cause him to shed his scales and tail. Since others are too afraid of him to medicate him without being harmed, Batman promises Croc help in exchange for information. Batman follows Croc's lead about the formula's [[mutagen]] to Langstrom's apartment, where he finds a throwing star that he takes evidence of Deathstroke's involvement. Before he leaves, he goes throughout the building and finds a storage room filled with caged bats, with one larger cage being empty and broken open from inside. Batman then finds a rabid [[gorilla]] with [[bat]]-like mutations, one of Langstrom's unstable subjects, and it attacks him until it dies from its mutations. A drone aircraft sent by Deathstroke then flies past and crashes on the building, destroying it, though Batman evades the explosion. [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] warns them about an abandoned stadium believed to house Deathstroke's men.  At the stadium, Batman and Damian question Langstrom but are attacked when Damian becomes violent. Before they successfully escape, they fight off a swarm of Man-Bats. In the cave, Langstrom reveals Deathstroke's plan to create superhuman, flight-capable assassins. While Nightwing works with Langstrom on an antidote, Batman and Damian rescue their family. Batman guesses that Talia has been abducted when he finds evidence of torture in an empty cell, which he keeps from Damian to not set him off. They find and rescue Langstrom's family, but Batman is unaware that Deathstroke challenged Damian to a fight in exchange for Talia's life through a video device he gave Langstrom's daughter in exchange for sparing them. Both Langstrom's daughter and Deathstroke's video tell him not to involve Batman in their fight.  Nightwing learns that Deathstroke is operating in an oil rig off the Scottish coast, and when Batman is distracted, Damian goes to the rig. He finds Deathstroke and Talia in an underwater base with a swarm of [[Man-Bat#Man-Bat Commandos|Man-Bats]] and another Lazarus Pit, whose fluid Deathstroke intends to sell. Damian pulls a gun on Deathstroke, who holds one against Talia's head until Damian drops his gun. Deathstroke fires at him, but Talia is hit instead after she jumps in the path of Deathstroke's gunfire. As Deathstroke corners Damian, Batman appears and the Man-Bats attack. Batman wards them off with sonar-emitting batarangs, while Deathstroke flees with Damian giving chase.  Batman heals Talia in the Lazarus Pit, while Nightwing and Langstrom reach the oil rig and cure the Man-Bats. At the same time, Damian fights and defeats Deathstroke, but refuses to kill him because he is his father's son. The elevator from the rig to the underwater base is destroyed when the Man-Bats, overwhelmed by the sonar devices, overcrowd the glass elevator shaft, flooding the base. Batman, Talia and Damian escape, but Deathstroke gets left behind. Batman believes that Damian should stay with him and remain as Robin while Talia still wishes to recreate the League with Batman, who would rather disband the League, and Damian at her side. She decides to let him care for their son and leaves with the League of Assassins though she says she will return for him.  As the credits roll, a slideshow of the fight between Damian and Nightwing is played between credits.  
Song of the Sea (2014 film)
  Conor, a [[lighthouse]] keeper, lives on an island with son Ben, his pregnant wife Bronagh, and sheepdog Cú. Bronagh disappears late one night, presumably dying after [[childbirth]], leaving behind daughter Saoirse (pronounced SEER-sha).  Six years later, Conor is broken, Saoirse is mute, and Ben is antagonistic towards Saoirse, blaming her for Bronagh's disappearance. On Saoirse's birthday, they are visited by their grandmother, "Granny". That night, Ben scares Saoirse with a story of [[Manannán mac Lir|Mac Lir]] and his mother Macha, the Owl Witch, who stole his feelings and turned him to stone. Later, Saoirse plays a seashell horn given to Ben by their mother, leading her to a white sealskin coat in Conor's closet. She wears the coat and walks to a group of seals in the sea, revealing her as a [[selkie]]. After swimming, she is found by Granny, who insists upon taking the children to the city. Conor reluctantly agrees despite Ben's protests, and locks the coat in a chest, throwing it into the sea.  On Halloween, Saoirse plays the seashell, alerting [[Fairy|Færie]] to her. She and Ben attempt to go home, but encounter the Færie, hopeful that Saoirse will allow them to return to [[Tír na nÓg]]. However, they are attacked by Macha's owls, turning the Færie to stone. They take a country bus, where they run into Cú, who had followed them. However, Saoirse is growing ill. They come across a sacred well that Saoirse dives into. Ben follows and meets the [[Seanchaí|Great Seanachaí]]: They learn that she was kidnapped by Macha, and that she is mute because she needs the coat, otherwise she will die. He gives Ben one of his hairs that will lead him to Macha. As he follows the hair, it shows him that Bronagh – a selkie herself – had to return to the ocean when Saoirse was born.   Ben then meets Macha, who explains that when Mac Lir suffered from a broken heart, she turned him into an island near their home. She is determined to do the same for everyone, even herself. Ben manages to rescue Saoirse, giving Macha back her feelings and allowing her to recognize that taking away feelings doesn't help. She helps them fly them back home, and Conor attempts to take Saoirse to a hospital; simultaneously, Granny is near the island to find them. Ben dives into the sea in search of Saoirse's coat, and recovers it with the seals and Conor. The group is then washed up on Mac Lir's island, where Saoirse's health is fully restored and she sings the Song of the Sea. The Færie rise and travel to Mac Lir and he emerges with Macha and his dogs as they head home to Tír na nÓg.   Bronagh appears preparing to depart with Saoirse, but Ben pleads to let her stay with them. Since she is half-human, the choice rests with Saoirse, who elects to remain behind with her father and brother, even though it means giving up her selkie powers and becoming fully human. Accepting her daughter's decision, Bronagh takes her coat and departs. After a tearful farewell, the Faeries depart across the sea, and Ben and his family happily return home to their island, where Granny finally arrives, and decides the children can stay with their father. Ben and Saoirse reconcile and become friends.

When Evan is wandering the town later, he catches sight of Louise and talks to her again. They later explore the town together. After a few dates, Louise asks Evan about his family story. Although he is reluctant to reveal details, he relents and then asks Louise to tell him something about her. Louise takes out the contact lens from her right eye to show Evan that she has heterochromia, and that her eyes have different colors. Evan sees the same condition reflected in the women on many of the paintings in the museum and also on the cover of a book. One night, Louise is having dinner with Evan when her skin condition starts getting worse. She runs off the street and is followed by a tourist who mistakes her for a prostitute.

She reveals that she did not use a condom during intercourse with Evan in order to purposely get pregnant. She also reveals that if she falls in love with someone, her body will produce oxytocin, a hormone which will keep embryo cells from consumption, resulting in the loss of her immortality.

Evan then asks her to spend her last 24 hours with him before she re-evolves. They spend all night talking to each other. In the early morning Louise takes Evan to the ruins of Pompeii, where she was born, and tells him her family history. The time comes and Evan makes one last attempt begging her not to change, to which Louise replies that she does not control it, her body does, and it has started to change, meaning she may attack Evan. Louise lies down with her head on Evan's lap as he refuses to go and tells her about the experience of being mortal and all the positive aspects to it while she changes. The nearby volcano erupts before a calm and resigned Evan looks down at Louise when a grotesque sound is heard. However, he finds Louise still in her current human form, indicating she fell in love with Evan and became mortal.  
Spanish Lake (film)
 ''Spanish Lake'' was named after the Spanish troops who stayed there while building a fortified post for [[Spain]] in 1768.<ref></ref> The first American military installation in the [[Fort Bellefontaine|Louisiana Territory, Fort Bellefontaine]], was built there after famed explorers [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis &Clark]] camped on the land at the start and end of their trip (1804–1806). Spanish Lake was a rural farming community for many years, until the 1950s when neighborhoods of tract housing were built. The area became a rural refuge from St. Louis city and received an exclusively white population. The 1970s saw the proliferation of dense apartment housing to Spanish Lake. African-Americans fleeing the failed [[Pruitt-Igoe]] public housing high rises in the city moved into the apartments via the [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] voucher system which immediately struck racial tensions in the area, particularly in local schools. The 1990s saw a mass exodus of the white population, spurred on by [[blockbusting]], a practice some U.S. [[real estate agents]] use to encourage white property owners to sell their houses quickly at a loss, implying the African-Americans moving into their neighborhood will depress their property values. The film begins in 2011, when a group of former residents known as the “Lakers”, revisit Spanish Lake for a reunion.

Starry Eyes
 Sarah (Alex Essoe) is a hopeful young woman suffering from [[trichotillomania]], who is desperate to become a famous movie star, but is stuck waitressing at a fast-food restaurant named Big Taters. Her boss Carl ([[Pat Healy (actor)|Pat Healy]]) is frustrated with how Sarah's auditioning occasionally interferes with her job but is unwilling to fire her. Her friends are generally unsupportive and selfish; Erin ([[Fabianne Therese]]) is constantly trying to undermine Sarah and steal her roles, and the others are lackadaisical about Sarah's efforts and Erin's actions. This is partially because they are overly involved with themselves and partially because Sarah purposely distances herself from the others. The only people who appear to be interested in her well-being are Sarah's roommate Tracy ([[Amanda Fuller]]) and Danny ([[Noah Segan]]), an aspiring film director and photographer who seems to have a romantic interest in Sarah.  Her prospects at stardom look dim until Sarah takes an audition for the film ''The Silver Scream'', which is being held by the powerful production company Astraeus Pictures. Her audition is met with a lackluster response by the casting director (Maria Olsen) and the assistant ([[Marc Senter]]), and Sarah is summarily dismissed from the room. Upset, Sarah enters a nearby bathroom in the building the auditions are being held in and proceeds to rip her hair out, a move that gains the interest of the casting director. Wanting to gain the role, Sarah returns to the audition room and reluctantly acquiesces to the casting director's demand that she rip her hair out again in front of them. Once this is completed, Sarah is dismissed again, much to her confusion. She then quits her job to fully pursue her chance at the movie. She is overjoyed when she gets a callback to a second audition. She eagerly returns to the building and is caught off guard when she is now commanded to disrobe. Sarah again reluctantly agrees to their demands, and after being told to open herself up to the potential to "transform", she experiences extreme euphoria and undergoes a trance state, during which she notices that the casting director is wearing a pentagram-like necklace. While in this state of euphoria she begins to show mild erratic behaviors, like laughing when one of her friends breaks her nose.  It is only when Sarah is called to a third audition that she balks at the demands of Astraeus' employees, as she is now expected to have sex with the producer (Louis Dezseran). Sarah refuses and runs home, where she confesses the night's events to Tracy. Humiliated, Sarah has to beg for her job back from Carl. Danny asks Sarah to be the lead role in his movie and she accepts. To celebrate, they have a pool party. Sarah is surprised when she sees Erin kissing Danny. Angry, Sarah returns to the producer's house, where she promptly performs oral sex on him. During the following days, Sarah shows increasingly erratic behavior even while her body begins to deteriorate. This causes her to lose her job and attack several people, including her friends. Sarah eventually has a heated argument with Tracy and retreats to her room, where she sees the casting director and has a vision of herself as a beautiful and glamorous movie idol. She awakens from the dream and goes to the bathroom to vomit, where she finds that her hair and nails have almost completely fallen out. Sarah, now wracked with pain, climbs into the bathtub, where she vomits masses of bloodied [[maggot]]s. With her last bit of energy, Sarah crawls along the floor to answer a call on her cell phone, in hopes of getting some help. The producer taunts her and tells her that she can either die or she can embrace the transformation already in progress and become like him. Sarah embraces the transformation and goes to Erin's house. Sarah and Erin argue, both slut-shaming each other of exchanging sex with directors for film parts; until Erin turns on the kitchen lights and sees Sarah's frightful disfigured face and ominous countenance. Erin tries to persuade her to go to the hospital but she slices Erin's cheek with a knife instead. Sarah accepts what she has done and proceeds to violently stab Erin. She then goes to Ashley's room and smashes her face using a dumbbell until her skull collapses. Poe witnesses this but as he turns-tail and runs, he slips on a puddle of blood. Sarah pounces on him and stabs him through the back. Sarah realizes that Erin is still alive and attempting to escape, so suffocates her with a plastic bag. She then goes outside to Danny's van and kills him too.   After that, the production company Astraeus, which turns out to be a secret cult worshipping a deity/demon named Astraeus, conducts a ritual whereby Sarah, surrounded by illuminated acolytes, is reborn from a bloodied membranous cocoon from within a mound of earth, as the acolytes mark out a surrounding pentagram-shaped emblem with rods of phosphorescent light. She emerges  with a flawless, healthy and totally hairless body; a gift-wrapped box wishing her a 'Happy Birthday' has been left for her. Sarah returns to her apartment and kills Tracy by sucking the life out of her mouth in a last kiss. She puts on the presents that Astraeus left her, a gorgeous low-cut black gown and long brunette wig - the finishing touch, her very own pentagrammed silver necklace. The film ends as she admires herself in the mirror - the epitome of the quintessential movie starlet - her eyes now a brilliant emerald green, as if lit from within.  
Stage Fright (2014 film)
 In 2004, Broadway diva Kylie Swanson opened the musical ''The Haunting of the Opera'' (a reference to real-life musical ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'') to a packed audience. However, that same night, she was murdered backstage by an unknown assailant wearing the mask of the play's villain, Opera Ghost. 10 years later in the present-day, Kylie's children Camilla and Buddy have grown up raised by Roger McCall, a former lover of Kylie's and the producer of a musical theater summer camp on the brink of bankruptcy. When Camilla hears that the camp will be producing a [[kabuki]] version of ''The Haunting of the Opera'', she decides that she will sneak into auditions one way or another. She manages to convince a camper overseeing the auditions, Joel Hopton, to let her in and Camilla easily impresses the stage director Artie and wins the lead role of Sofia - much to Buddy's dismay.  As the opening day grows closer and closer, Camilla discovers that Artie will only let her perform on opening day as long as she provides him with sexual favors. He emotionally blackmails her by playing her off of Liz Silver, a camper that will do anything to perform on opening night. Camilla tries to ward off Artie's attentions by only making out with him, which disgusts Joel - whom Camilla has largely ignored since the audition. The night before the performance, Artie gives Camilla an ultimatum: either she sleeps with him or he gives the opening night performance to Liz. Camilla initially acquiesces to Artie's overtures, but decides at the last minute that she can't go through with it. After she leaves, Artie is brutally murdered by someone wearing the Opera Ghost mask, but Roger tells everyone that Artie died by car accident. Unwilling to potentially lose a visit from important Broadway agent Victor Brady, who is only willing to watch the performance if Camilla is performing, Roger manages to persuade everyone to perform opening night as planned.  That night, Joel tries to warn Camilla that Artie was killed and that the murderer is still out there, but his warnings go largely unheeded and the show begins. All seems well with the musical and Victor until later in the performance, when Opera Ghost kills campers Whitney, Sam, and Sheila, and stops Liz from taking revenge on Camilla for performing on opening night. This causes a gap in the performance, which the cast tries to fill with impromptu music and dancing while Camilla looks for her missing co-star. She instead finds an ever-increasing number of bodies.  Camilla manages to intervene when she discovers Opera Ghost trying to kill Roger. This killer is revealed to be Buddy, who says that he did it because he did not want Camilla to get involved in the acting world, which he saw as corrupt, especially. Buddy tells Camilla that Roger is the one who kill their mother in a jealous rage. He spent the 10 years trying to avenge his mother's death and he wants to kill whoever who's close to Roger. Roger knows about the truth, turns violent, manages to free himself, attacks Buddy and fatally stabs him to death. He decides to kill Camilia because her brother wants to kill Roger. Roger chases Camilia throughout the camp and corners her backstage. Just as Roger is about to kill Camilia, she finds a buzz saw and kills him and stumbles onto stage. The audience initially assumes that this was all part of the show and applauds what they believe to be the finale.  The film then cuts to the [[Broadway revival]] of ''The Haunting of the Opera'' with Camilla as the lead. As she prepares backstage, Opera Ghost lunges out of the mirror at Camilla, only for it to be a hallucination.

After being refused at another audition, the Mob visit a club where they are noticed and challenged to a dance battle by another crew, the Grim Knights. The Grim Knights win the battle and the Mob decides to pack up and leave Los Angeles and return to Miami, mostly because of financial difficulties, but also thinking there is nothing left for them and that they are not prepared for Los Angeles.  Sean decides to stay and while there, he notices a dance competition called ''The Vortex'' taking place with the prize being a three-year Las Vegas booking, inspiring him to put together a new crew with help from Moose. Moose gets Sean a job working as a janitor in a dance center owned by Moose's grandparents, where Sean takes up residence in a janitor's closet. Sean and Moose recruit Andie West and later Vladd, Violet, Hair, Chad, Monster, the Santiago Twins, Jenny Kido and Gauge to the crew. The group soon makes an audition video as the LMNTRIX and are accepted into the competition a few weeks later.  The crew heads to Las Vegas to compete. Upon arriving, Sean finds out that both the Grim Knights and the Mob are also in the competition, motivating the LMNTRIX to practice extra hard. While the rest of the crew are at a bar, Sean and Andie reveal they have broken up with their respective partners. Moose kisses another girl while freestyle dancing at the bar, which his girlfriend Camille Gage witnesses. She runs off, prompting Moose to leave the crew and return to Los Angeles to make up with her. The LMNTRIX battle the Mob in a ''Vortex'' exhibition match; during the battle, Sean tries to force Andie to perform a trick they tried during one of their practices but Andie refuses and leaves. The LMNTRIX, however, still win the battle and the Mob leave, angry at Sean. Sean finds Andie outside, where she confronts him about his actions, saying she was not yet ready to perform the trick. Sean realizes that he has been selfish and made a lot of mistakes; he apologizes to the MOB and later makes up with Andie and the LMNTRIX.

Before LMNTRIX perform, Sean takes the stage and discusses with the crowd that his experiences have taught him what really matters. He then persuades the crowd to forget about winning or losing and just enjoy the show. The rest of the crew then take the stage and give an amazing performance. Sean and Andie decide to end the dance by performing the trick Sean wanted her to do earlier in the film, which they successfully complete, followed by a passionate kiss between the two, leaving the crowd amazed.  The producers call Alexxa and inform her that the LMNTRIX won and that they will get the three-year contract for their own show. The film ends with the LMNTRIX and the Mob happily celebrating their excellent performance and victory.  
Still (film)
 After Carver, a photographer, loses his son to a hit-and-run car accident, he and his wife Rachel divorce, and he descends into self-destructive abuse of alcohol and drugs, unable to let go of his grief.  His friend Ed, a tabloid journalist, investigates a murder blamed on local gangs, and, while on a job photographing children at a local school, Carver himself meets a young boy, Jimmy, whose brother was murdered.  As Jimmy and Carver bond over their shared loss, Carver learns that Jimmy is interested in photography and tutors him.  Carver's girlfriend Christina, a fashion model, moves in with him.  While Carver is out buying more alcohol one day, he bumps into a youth.  The youth demands an apology, which Carver provides.  Carver and his ex-wife take regular visit to his son's grave.  While buying flowers before one such visit, he runs into the youth again, this time with his friends.  They harass Carver but flee once he shoves them.  Thinking the matter resolved, Carver rejoins his wife.  He later finds feces and a dead animal on his doorstep.  When he pursues the youths, he receives a visible wound to his head, which alarms several people, though he brushes off their concerns.  Carver's photography is selected to be displayed at a gallery, but during the opening, he becomes obnoxiously drunk.  Rachel chastises him and urges him to tell Christina and the police about his troubles with the gang.  Carver promises to do so eventually.  After further arguing with each other, Rachel calls him "an accident waiting to happen".  After being bullied by the gang, Jimmy tells Carver he no longer wants to associate with him.  Carver chases the gang away after he sees them bully Jimmy, and the gang severely beats Jimmy in retaliation.  While walking home to Carver's apartment one night, Christina is raped.  She tells Carver that it was done to get to him and demands that he contact the police.  Carver and Christina both give statements, and Ed volunteers photographs he has taken while researching local gang violence.  The police, however, say they have no concrete evidence of anyone's involvement, as Christina's attackers wore masks.  Upset with the police inaction, Ed urges Carver to take matters into his own hands.  Ed helps Carver locate the youth that Carver bumped into, and they kidnap him as he walks down the street alone.  Ed leaves Carver alone with him.  Although reluctant to tell Carver anything, he eventually reveals himself to be a 15-year-old named Carl.  Carver demands to know why the gang targeted him, but Carl says there was no reason.  Carl denies any involvement in Christina's rape, though he admits he beat up Jimmy.  At the same time, Ed meets Rachel at a party.  She is dating a single father and seems happy.  When Ed asks her for her secret, she says one must want to be happy.  After she asks him to watch over Carver, Ed experiences misgivings in the plan, and he rushes back to Carver's apartment.  Carl insists he is innocent and, to Carver's disbelief, says he knew Carver's son.  Carver dismisses Carl's protestations of innocence and injects him with a lethal overdose of heroin.  Carl reveals that Carver's son was a member of their gang; on the night that he died, Carver's son was involved in a daredevil game where the kids dodged oncoming cars.  Carver initially laughs off the possibility, but, as the drug takes effect, Carl convinces him.  Carl protests that Carver saw nothing but good in his son, though he sees nothing but bad in him.  After considering this, Carver calls emergency medical services for an ambulance, just as Ed arrives.  
Stonehearst Asylum
   In 1899, an Oxford University professor demonstrates a case of [[female hysteria]], Lady (Eliza) Graves ([[Kate Beckinsale]]), before his class. The patient is drugged and protesting that she is sane, but the professor points out that all mental patients claim to be sane, much as all criminals claim to be innocent. He ignores her demands that he not touch her to induce a fit for the students to observe. The professor advises his students to believe nothing they hear and only half of what they see.   Later, a young man, the newly-minted Dr. Edward Newgate, ([[Jim Sturgess]]), arrives at Stonehearst Asylum on Christmas Eve, where he desires to take up residency. A group of armed men led by Mickey Finn ([[David Thewlis]]) allow him entry. Finn escorts him to the office of the superintendent, Dr. Silas Lamb ([[Ben Kingsley]]). Although Lamb was not expecting him, despite Newgate having sent letters preceding his arrival, he welcomes the help of an Oxford-educated doctor and grants him the residency.  Newgate is surprised by Lamb's unorthodox methods and uncustomarily humane asylum. Lamb explains that he does not believe in drugging or incarcerating his patients, and he encourages their delusions when he feels it will bring them greater happiness, thus creating a kind and dignified environment at the asylum.   Lady Graves, now a resident at Stonehearst, is introduced to Newgate, who appears immediately smitten. Lamb explains that Lady Graves has an abusive and painful past. She developed hysteria from enduring her husband's "unnatural appetites" and can no longer bear emotional or physical contact without seizing in hysterical fits. She stabbed her husband in the right eye with a comb and bit off his left ear trying to protect herself, which led to her father committing her into the asylum to escape her marriage to her "monster" of a husband. Her husband has since been trying to free her back into his care. Dr. Lamb is currently prescribing musical therapy for her and refuses to declare her sane, for her own safety.   Though she brushes aside Newgate's attempts at flirtation, she is struck by his empathy and respectful demeanor. An elaborate Christmas feast follows, during which the staff and patients mingle and a small fight between Newgate and Finn occurs, cementing their dislike for one another. After the dinner, Lady Graves delivers ominous warnings to Newgate, and quietly insists that he flee the asylum, but Newgate refuses to leave without her.  The reason for Lady Graves's warning soon reveals itself. Newgate discovers dozens of prisoners being kept in basement cells. The prisoners reveal that they are the true staff of Stonehearst, and the doctors and nurses Newgate has met upstairs are actually patients.   The real superintendent, Dr. Benjamin Salt ([[Michael Caine]]), explains that Lamb and Finn drugged their drinks and led a revolt. Dr. Salt and Mrs. Pike ([[Sinéad Cusack]]), the matron, warn Newgate that Lamb is a dangerous madman – a surgeon who murdered his patients during wartime. Isolated and with limited options of regaining control over the asylum even should they be freed, the staff must remain in their cells to await outside assistance.  They request that Dr. Newgate locate the keys in Finn's possession to release them, or else escape to London and seek help.   Lamb begins his unorthodox training for Newgate's residency through an enlightening, if hands-on, lesson in patient dignity. Newgate attempts to recruit Lady Graves to his cause of freeing the true staff, but she declines to become involved and tells him of Salt's and his staff's inhuman abuses. Newgate reveals the scars of his own abusive past and tells her he understands.  Newgate sneaks into Lamb's office and successfully retrieves Salt's notes, but not the keys. While hiding, he overhears Lamb and Finn discussing him. Finn is deeply suspicious of Newgate, but Lamb believes Newgate shows promise and could be a great asylum doctor one day. Both acknowledge the prisoners in the basement, and Lamb promises that the loose ends will be tied up by the New Year.   Salt's notes detail his barbaric medical treatments used against Lamb, who had been under his care for nine years without cracking before the uprising. Newgate is conflicted when, after two of the prisoners in the basement escape to seek help, both die under suspicious circumstances after being caught by Finn.   While the patients are happy and thriving, there are some definite failings to Lamb's method of running the asylum. They are quickly running out of provisions and having difficulties keeping up with the every-day demands of the large institution, such as heating the building in winter. Some of the more violent patients, such as Finn, are also difficult to control, and he eventually murders a female patient.  By New Year's Eve, the patients are burning the furnishings for warmth and Lamb has destroyed Salt's mind via cranial electroshock, turning him into a patient in his own institution. Newgate is convinced the situation must come to an end and that he and Lady Graves should escape.   Newgate's attempt to drug the patients and gain control of the asylum is thwarted and Lamb prepares Newgate for electric shock therapy to turn him into a mental patient to live among them. It is revealed that Newgate had come to the asylum specifically to rescue Lady Graves, whom he had seen at the Oxford medical demonstration and become fixated with. Before the treatment, Lamb grants Newgate a final request: to see a picture of Lady Graves that he keeps in his pocket. The true object in his pocket, a picture of one of the young soldiers Lamb shot (which Newgate discovered in the padded cell Salt kept Lamb in), causes Lamb to stagger out of the room in a fugue. Finn goes to pick up the electric prods to finish the job, but Newgate is rescued by Lady Graves who overcomes her hysterical fits to kill Finn via electrocution. A fire starts and spreads as Lady Graves rescues the staff from their cells and leads the patients out of the building.  Lamb has now become near-stuporous from the crushing flashbacks of his past actions when, under extreme pressure during his time as a field doctor, Lamb had snapped and executed his battlefield patients as a form of [[Coup de grâce|mercy killing]] before attempting to kill himself.  After all are rescued, as daylight breaks, Newgate again asks Lady Graves to leave with him, but she says that she cannot be with him because he is sane and she is not. Newgate says that he is not sane, as he is madly in love with her, and he intimates that he has a secret to tell her.  Later, Lady Graves' husband and the earlier Oxford professor arrive at the asylum. The asylum has been restored to a gentler order under the kind hand of Mrs. Pike, who is now in charge and has incorporated many of Lamb's methods of treatment. The professor demands Lady Graves' release, but Mrs. Pike says that Dr. Newgate already released her weeks ago. The professor reveals that he is the true Dr. Newgate and the one they knew is an impostor. The Dr. Newgate they met was never a medical student, nor a doctor at all, but an escaped mental patient who had also been part of the exhibition. Dr. Lamb, playing chess with the reduced Dr. Salt, hears this and shows a spark of his previous self as he gleefully remarks "Checkmate."  Lady Graves and the impostor Newgate end the film at the Santa Cristina Asylum in [[Tuscany]], [[Italy]], where they are known as Dr. and Mrs. Lamb, treating mental patients with the original Lamb's methods. The two dance happily and embrace in a beautiful garden.

As Stretch considers proposing to her, Candace abruptly breaks up with him. Hurt by the sudden rejection, Stretch's life spirals into self-destruction and failure, which he blames on Candace. A failed actor, he works in Los Angeles as a limo driver. Though he has quit gambling, he retains a $6000 debt to Ignacio, who demands the debt be paid by midnight. At the same time, Stretch begins hallucinating the bitter ghost of another failed actor and limo driver named Karl, who committed suicide in front of a customer.  His boss, Naseem, calls him to his office and tells him that their chief competitor, a mysterious man known only as The Jovi, has been stealing their clients. Unless they can steal clients away from The Jovi, Naseem will be forced to fold his business. Although unsure how he will keep his job or pay back his debts, Stretch takes time to set up a blind date with a woman from an online dating site. At the same time, he begs Charlie, a sympathetic employee, to direct any high-paying customers his way. When The Jovi steals his first client, actor David Hasselhoff, Charlie sends Stretch to intercept one of The Jovi's clients, Ray Liotta. Liotta tasks Stretch with returning a pistol and prop badge. Before he can do so, Charlie sends him another client, Roger Karos, an eccentric billionaire with a reputation for extremist hedonism. Karos parachutes down naked to the arranged location and offers to pay Stretch's gambling debt if he serves without question.  As Stretch drives Karos to exclusive nightclubs and hotspots of dubious legality, Karl berates him for putting himself at increasing risk, both personally and legally, for such a small sum of money. Karos' final destination is a secretive sex club. Karos gives Stretch 100 minutes to return to the sex club with an important briefcase and a supply of cocaine. When Stretch attempts to retrieve the briefcase, he learns from Laurent, a French blackmailer, that Karos has promised to trade a ledger for the contents of the briefcase. Using Liotta's props, Stretch cons Laurent and his men into believing that he is a police officer, and they surrender the briefcase.

Unimpressed, Karl continues to harangue him for his inadequacies.  Stretch procures the cocaine from a reality television star, who then steals the limo. Meanwhile, Liotta complains to Naseem, who fires Stretch. Undeterred, Stretch reacquires the limo, which has been trashed, only to lose it to The Jovi's brother, Boris, who operates a tow truck. Stretch once again retrieves the limo, though it has been reported as stolen. Stretch fast talks the security system operator into believing that he is a cop whose life is on the line during a gunfight. Upon returning, Karos complains that Stretch is a minute late. When Ignacio also complains that he is late in his payment, Stretch instructs Ignacio to meet him at Karos' destination. There, Karos abandons Stretch to The Jovi and Boris, though Ignacio intercedes. Laurent, revealed to be an American cop, also appears and arrests Karos, who is wanted for embezzlement. As Karos prepares to kill Laurent in a sneak attack, Stretch creates a diversion, saves Laurent's life, and escapes.  Later, at a diner, Stretch gives the ledger to Laurent, who declines to arrest him and compliments his acting skills. As Stretch looks around the diner, he realizes that he has ended up at the meeting point he set up with his blind date.

When Jake and Chloe die in a "rickshaw accident" overseas, Richard and Alex worry the cash might not go to the orphans, so they break into Edendale and take the money. They earnestly try to donate the money to Jigme Wangchuck ([[Alec Mapa]]), the deputy ambassador of the Embassy of Bhutan, and his assistant Priti Khagda ([[Tania Gunadi]]).  But the Embassy officials, thinking they’re being set up, refuse the money.  So Richard and Alex deposit the cash, find another charity, and end up writing a check to "The Porpoise Purpose," headed by Stuart Hendron ([[Lance Bass]]) and his assistant Olivier ([[Mitch Silpa]]).  Just then, they learn from their Realtor, Logan, ([[Tom Lenk]]), that Edendale is now on the market.  They really want it but have given the money to the porpoise charity—so they stop payment on the check and use the money as down payment on the house, intending to repay the charity by taking out a second mortgage once escrow closes.  But tough yet savvy LAPD Detective Dianne Kershman ([[Ana Ortiz]]) sees things differently.  She tells Richard and Alex that Jake and Chloe were in fact murdered.  Worried the killers must be after the money, they panic and confide in Alex's half-sister, Paige (Carrie Wiita) and her husband, Cooper ([[James Urbaniak]]) who are therapists and RX drug dealers.  Paige and Cooper realize the money Jake had owed them somehow ended up with Richard and Alex, whom they convince to take out the second mortgage—in cash.  And after an ill-fated labradoodle kidnapping and hostage stand-off, Paige and Cooper discover the money hidden in the house and take it.  Shattered, Richard and Alex do in fact sell Edendale.  They repay the Porpoise Purpose, as Det. Kershman had pretty much guaranteed jail-time if they didn't.  Richard and Alex then learn from Jake and Chloe’s questionable Buddhist lawyer Sidney ([[Rick Overton]]) that they were in possession of a rare Bhutanese artifact of Jake and Chloe's, the Kuntu Zangpo, worth $10 million, which Paige and Cooper also took.  They interrupt Paige and Cooper's black market sale to art dealer Clay Hampton ([[Drew Droege]]), and get them—and Sidney—to confess.  Det. Kershman rushes in and arrests Paige and Cooper for, among other things, drug dealing.  She thanks Richard and Alex for helping with the sting.  The chastened couple flies to Bhutan and returns the $10 million tchotchke to the orphanage, run by Buddhist monk Chana Dorje (Kee Chan) and they finally get their wish—they adopt a young boy, Kuenphay ([[Forrest Wheeler]]).  They couldn't be happier.  Well, maybe they could—if they had a house.

Super Duper Alice Cooper
 The main objective of the film was to explain the story behind [[rock music|rock]] phenomenon, [[Alice Cooper]].   ===Childhood===   The film starts by introducing the childhood of Vincent Furnier, who later becomes better known as [[United States|American]] singer, songwriter and actor, Alice Cooper. Narrated by Furnier himself, he claims to have had an all American childhood, describing himself to have been the perfect 50s kids who did not lie, cheat or swear and attended Church two times a week. Furnier was and continues to be very in touch with God, his father was a pastor, which enabled him to grow up with a strong moral compass. He grew up in [[Detroit, Michigan]], however, due to childhood illnesses such as severe [[asthma]], his family moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona]] to try to reduce the symptoms. He discusses an [[appendicitis]] attack that he had as a child, claiming that doctors couldn't guarantee he would make it out from the surgery alive. However, the next day he was fine, which he believes to be the result of God and his parents prayers. Every time he looked at his scar from the operation, he knew he was a miracle.   ===High School & The Creation of the Spiders===   The film moves to discuss Furnier’s life as a teenager. He discusses having a strong passion for high school art class, where he met and created his friendship with [[Dennis Dunaway]]. They were both interested in [[surrealism]], especially artists such as [[René Magritte]] and [[Georges Braque]]. [[Salvador Dalí]] was also a huge influence for them, they state he was outrageously different and created an artistic statement that had an impact.   During this time, [[the Beetles]] were becoming a huge sensation, both Furnier and Dunaway became what they call “Beetles maniacs”. They state that they loved everything about them, including their style, sound, look and especially the fact that parents didn't understand them. Furnier and Dunaway decided that they wanted to do a spoof of the Beetles at their school talent show, however, at the time they did not know how to play any instruments. Dunaway knew a guitar player, [[Glen Buxton]], who he approached and asked if he would be willing to play in the show with them. Buxton agreed and they performed the show, which received a big reaction. This began the start of their career as a band, which they originally named, the Earwigs. The following summer, they focused on becoming a real band, where they purchased instruments, learned how to play them and started songwriting. Dunaway focused his time learning the base, where Furnier focused on vocals. They went to play for the owner of a teenage rock and roll dance hall known as the VIP Club, who suggested they come up with a new name. From there, they soon renamed themselves as [[The Spiders (American rock band)|the Spiders]] and ended up being the house band at the VIP Club. They focussed their time on playing loud rock music, such as songs from [[the Yardbirds]], [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Who]]. They started to become more well known, they opened for the Yardbirds, and the audience actually left after The Spiders were done playing. They also got their record to #2 on the charts, while still in high school. Music became the priority, they wanted to become rockstars and Furnier grew out his hair to fit the part. Furnier claims that church became the last thing on his mind, and the people at his church thought he was going off the deep end.  ===Moving to LA & Becoming Alice Cooper===   The film follows the band on their move to [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1967. At the time, it was the heart of [[The Love Generation]], and [[History of the hippie movement|the Hippie Movement]]. Once they arrived in Los Angeles, they realized that everything was not going to just fall into place for them, there were thousands of other bands from other states trying to accomplish the same thing that they were. While in Los Angeles, they met [[The GTOs|GTOs]], a girl band who Furnier describes as professional partiers, girls from another planet. [[Pamela Des Barres|Miss Pamela]], one of the members from the GTO’s describes the boys to have been reserved, gentle and innocent in the midst of very stoned people. However, that began to change, as they hung out more, lots of drug and alcohol experimentation was going on. Once again, they renamed themselves from the Spiders to Nazz, stating that The Spiders became dated. However, they soon found out that [[Todd Rundgren]] also had a band called [[Nazz]], and found themselves in need of another stage name. One night, while experimenting with drugs they consulted the [[ouija]] board, asking it questions, which eventually led to Furnier spelling out Alice Cooper. They found the name humorous, stating it sounded like an older lady, who had dark secrets.   From there, they started to create an image for themselves. They realized that everyone was wearing the same kind of hippie based outfits and to stand out they needed to be outrageous. The GTO’s helped in the creation of the bands early onstage look by styling the boys with their own personal clothing items, describing the look as “full size Barbie dolls”. From there, the boys started to buy outfits from vintage stores, which would create a shock factor. Furnier states they knew they weren't as musically good as many of the other bands so the image and theatrics of Alice Cooper was necessary to create attention. They would take whatever items they could find and incorporate them into their shows. Furnier asks, how do you become Alice Cooper? You create it.   Miss Christine and Miss Pamela, from the GTOs, were able to introduce Alice Cooper to composer and renowned record producer [[Frank Zappa]]. Zappa suggested the band come over to his house at “7 o’clock”. Mistakingly, the band assumed he had meant 7am, while being awoken by rock music, Zappa was impressed that the band could play such intense music so early. Zappa then asked if they had a manager, in which they said they did not.   ===Meeting Shep Gordon===  [[Shep Gordon]] had moved to California and made many connections. He was living in a hotel room, paid by money he was collecting through drug dealing. He became conscious of the risks that drug dealing brought and from there, decided to become a manager. Gordon approached the band after hearing them play an unsuccessful gig, claiming he could help turn them in the right direction. Furnier describes their first meeting, stating that they walked in to see major stars, including [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] all getting high. From there, they knew almost instantly that they needed to sign with Gordon. They signed with Zappas label, [[Straight Records]] and produced their first album, [[Pretties for You]]. Zappa’s vision for the album was for it to sound live, like he was driving by a garage and heard them playing. They recorded the entire album in a day, but received many negative reviews. They describe playing a show in Los Angeles for 6,000 hippies, which ended up to be a disaster with everyone running for the doors. There was an obvious personality crisis, the band knew their options were moving forward into what would become their iconic sound, or staying put with the trite psychedelia/ art-rock of the time/region.<ref></ref>   ===Leaving Los Angeles===  The band decided to leave Los Angeles, they described themselves as stray dogs without a home. They played wherever they could, stating that they would move into the first city that they got a standing ovation. Shep said he was able to get them on a festival list in Detroit, where they would play in front of 5,000 people. They played after the [[MC5]], [[Iggy Pop]] and [[the Stooges]], thinking there was no way they could entertain the audience after them. They described the show to be odd, weird and full of theatrics, something that nobody else was doing at the time. Finally, an audience got it and they received a standing ovation.   Shep was able to get the band on the list for the [[Toronto]] Revival Festival in 1969. The deal was they did not get have to get paid, but they needed to open for [[John Lennon]]. This was huge for the band, who was strongly influenced by the Beetles. They state that the audience was bewildered by the band, however, they understood the energy behind them. They knew they needed to do something that would stand out, at the end of the show, their idea was to open three feather pillows and a CO2 cartridge to make the appearance of snow. However, for some reason Furnier found a chicken backstage, he grabbed it and threw it off the stage thinking it would fly. The audience grabbed the chicken, tore it apart and threw it back on stage. Both the audience and the band were shocked, Furnier saying “they just killed a chicken in front of 70,000 hippies”. This became a changing moment for the band, they became known as very notorious and something everyone wanted to learn about.   ===Meeting Bob Ezrin, 1970===  The band became something that everyone wanted to learn about, however, at this time they still did not have a record on the radio. Shep got in contact with a Toronto company that made records, [[Bob Ezrin]] worked there at the time. Ezrin states that his boss did not want Alice Cooper, but they were persistent and he agreed to meet with them in [[New York City]] to hear them play. Ezrin describes the concert to have been an underground scene, the show started and the band made the appearance of their eyes and mouth to be filled with blood. He describes it to have been the most amazing thing he’d ever seen, the beginning of a cultural movement. Ezrin agreed to produce records with them. They started to create different characters and theatrics to get into the songs that they were playing. Ezrin decided that "[[I'm Eighteen]]" would become their first song to put them on the map. The band talks highly of Ezrin, Dunaway states that he brought focus, and enthusiasm, and confidence to the band.<ref></ref> On the way to rehearsal, they heard "[[I'm Eighteen]]" on the radio for the first time, and got everyone they knew to frequently request it. They became an overnight sensation. Their audience was new, consisting of kids who were left out and finally had someone who represented them.   ===Theatrics===   They saw a lack of entertainment in rock music, they wanted to do something that would shock people, especially parents. This led to many representations on stage, which consisted of exaggerated, nightmarish imagery that includes monsters, blood, violence toward women, and executions.<ref name="Chambers"></ref> They also used many objects in their performances, which has included wearing a [[boa constrictor]] on stage and baby dolls, which they then chopped up. They picked up ideas like sponges, inspiration came from everything and anything. Much of their inspiration came from [[television]], where they describe hearing and advertisement that said “schools out”. Hearing that led them to the creation of “[[School's Out (song)|School's Out]]”, which somehow to their belief became a bigger sensation than "[[I'm Eighteen]]".   ===The Hollywood Bowl===  The band played the [[Hollywood Bowl]] at this show they paid for a helicopter to go over the crowd and drop panties into the audience. [[Elton John]] was in the audience, where he claims people were fighting to get a pair of these panties. Elton describes the band as becoming more famous than others, where girls were dying over them and parents hated them.   ===Inner Circle Shattering===  The dynamic started to change with success. The band started to get treated like outsiders and the focus was placed mainly on Furnier, or the character of Alice. He started getting private cars, solo invitations to parties, solo interviews at radio stations, etc. [[Salvador Dalí]] contacted saying he wanted to do a moving holograph of Alice, but the band was not included. They decided they needed to go back to their roots, they played Ezrin a song they had written years before. Ezrin did not like the song, and suggested that he did not want to work with the band, however, if Furnier wanted to go out on his own to contact him. They did their next album without Ezrin, but the vibe was different, Furnier needed a break and became distant from the band while working on the album. The band started to fall apart without Ezrin, and they knew if they were going solo that Alice Cooper would be given to Furnier as he was the only one who could truly play him.   ===1975, Solo===   Furnier started working on his first solo album as Alice Cooper, which he later released, known as "[[Welcome to My Nightmare]]". He knew it was harder for lead singers who broke out of their band to become successful, so he needed to make a statement, a new beginning. Everything he could get he put into his show. Eventually, he began a relationship with one of his dancers, Sheryl, and they later got married.   ===The Character & Alcoholism===  It is very common for performers to “adopt onstage personae with the purpose of contributing to an authentic” connection between the performers and their respective audiences, and the character of Alice started to become iconic.<ref name="Chambers"></ref> However, it forced Furnier to be in a constant state of what Furnier described as “messed up”, including lots of [[alcohol]] use. The character wasn't necessarily a representation of Furnier, but he got caught up in the character, the things he couldn't do based on his moral compass became something that Alice could do instead. He ended up going to a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] center for [[alcoholism]] and once released, he believed to have been cured.   ===1978, working with Bernie Taupin===  Alice got the chance to work with singer [[Bernie Taupin]], where they developed a strong friendship. They created an album together, which was based on characters from Alice’s rehabilitation experience. The album came as a confession, Furnier states that the audience had been through the alcoholism with him, so he wanted to let them be through the cure as well. However, during his time of rehabilitation, new artists had taken over the music scene. Furnier was sober, something he'd never been while playing as Alice and he wasn't ready to fight that. Bernie, at the time was experimenting with [[cocaine]], and Alice caught wind of it. He started to sink into an abyss that is described to be more tragic than any of his previous drinking. Bernie had to leave recording, because he knew he would also go down a bad path if he stayed.   ===Personal Life===  During the time of his cocaine addiction, Sheryl gave birth to their first daughter. Sheryl did not want her daughter to be around him in the state he was in. She begun [[divorce]] proceedings. Furnier went through a very bad high for a few days, he isolated himself and did not want anyone to see him in the state he was in. He eventually got up, looked in the mirror and saw that his eyes were bleeding. He knew that the situation he had placed himself in was turning into life or death. He packed up and left for Phoenix, where his parents helped him as much as they could, though his condition was very bad. He went to seek professional help, once he was out, he contacted Sheryl and said he was done with [[drugs]]. Sheryl agreed to counselling on the basis that he organized it.   ===Alice Cooper Rises Again, 1986===  The world had moved on for the second time since Alice’s break, he didn't fit in anymore and was worried about how he would make a statement, especially sober. After five years away, he returned to the stage on Halloween night for a live [[MTV]] broadcast. As soon as the band started, he began and was back at it. This was Furnier's realization that the character of Alice didn't want to live in his world, he just wanted to be on stage. As soon as the curtain was gone, so was Alice. Alice could be Alice Cooper with a healthy Vincent Furnier behind him.

The Suicide Theory
 As Steven discusses his wife's pregnancy with a friend who owns a store, a rude man interrupts them.  Steven ambushes the man outside and murders him. Shortly afterward, his wife Annie is killed in a hit-and-run accident as they cross the street together.  Steven is left with traumatic flashbacks whenever he attempts to cross a street.  Three years later, Steven works as a contract killer.  As he prepares to kill his next target, Frank Dubois, a man falls from the building on to the cab he is in, setting off another panic attack.  Having seen Steven before passing out, the suicidal man, Percival, tracks down Steven.  Percival explains that he has attempted suicide countless times and has consistently failed, surviving overwhelming odds, and these attempts have left him heavily scarred.  Percival believes he is cursed with the inability to take his own life, and his meeting Steven is meant to be.  He pays Steven to kill him.  Steven, scoffing at the idea, gives Percival a chance to reconsider, then shoots him in the chest.  When Percival survives both this and another shooting from Steven, which leaves him blinded in one eye, Steven accepts it is more than mere luck.  Intrigued by the challenge, Steven probes Percival for clues to defeat the curse.  Percival reveals that he is a gay man and that part of his suicidal tendencies come from the death of his boyfriend, Christopher.  The two men slowly bond over their shared loss.   Steven hires a gay man to sleep with Percival, hoping that an emotional high may make him mortal; this too fails, and Percival is disgusted when Steven murders the other man.  As they consider their next course of action, Percival flirts with a friendly bartender.  They end up at the bartender's house, where the barkeep and several of his homophobic friends severely beat up Percival.  After learning about this, Steven feigns homosexuality at the same bar and allows himself to fall into the bartender's scam.  Steven kills all of the bartender's friends and shoots the bartender in the groin.  Percival is once again disgusted by Steven's behavior, but Steven insists that Percival must have wanted this to happen at some level, or else he would not have given Steven the bartender's address.  Steven experiences continued reluctance in killing Frank Dubois, much to the annoyance of his employer, Thomas.  Steven learns Percival is a painter and sees him working on a portrait of Chris.  When Percival comes to Steven's house, he sees Annie's dress and abruptly leaves.  That night, Steven puts on his wife's dress and makeup, and points a gun at his head.  Before he can pull the trigger, he sees a thug about to kill a policeman outside.  Steven kills the thug and saves the policeman's life.  He excitedly calls Percival, thanks him, and explains that he has found his purpose in life and now believes in fate.  Steven later approaches Frank and tells him that Frank is not a contracted target.  Steven has been killing people based on a half-remembered license plate ever since Annie's death to hopefully get to his wife's killer.  He resolves to stop doing this, much to Thomas' dismay.  Percival confesses that it was he who accidentally killed Annie while drunk driving after Christopher's death.  He begs Steven for forgiveness.  Steven refuses to forgive him.  After sharing a hug, he pushes him off his balcony.  Percival finally dies.  Steven meets with Thomas at a restaurant and says he is quitting; it is  revealed that Thomas is only part of Steven's hallucination.  After Percival's funeral, Steven visits a gallery of Percival's work.

Swapaanam
 The rhythm of life, even for a master drummer, is at the same moment disrupted and harmonized by the love, passion, jealousy, hate and spite of those around. Unequaled in the art of playing the [[Chenda]], Unni ([[Jayaram]]), and Nalini (Kadambari), peerless in [[Mohiniyattam]], are drawn to each other by an affection that transcends the devotion to their arts and the love for each other.  The pulse of their passion cannot hold up against the tumults of Unni’s life.

The Swan Princess: A Royal Family Tale
 Centuries ago, a sentient evil force known as the Forbidden Arts entered Earth from the underworld, intent on destroying all of its rivals for magical power. It learned of a legend that the Swan Princess will bring in an age of goodness, and that pure evil will not survive in her presence, but she can be defeated by a green-colored magical stone. The Forbidden Arts corrupted the legend, making it appear that the Swan Princess will bring despair and destruction instead. A group of unusually large and talking flying squirrels, called the scullions, found the legend and over the years formed a community dedicated to finding and destroying the Swan Princess. When Odette, the Swan Princess, was finally born to King William, the Forbidden Arts tried to use the sorcerer Rothbart to defeat her but failed.  In the present, Odette and Derek are pressured by Uberta to have a child, and are unaware that they're being tracked by the scullions, (two in particular, Cutter and Jojo, a pair of "Master Traper" brothers). The Forbidden Arts has joined forces with Mangler, the scullion leader, but is angered at their most recent failure. The Forbidden Arts leaves its cave to burn Odette alive, but is blocked by Odette's power and has to return to the crystal in its cave to recover. A nearby house catches fire instead, where a little girl named Alise's father is murdered . Odette and Derek bring Alise to the castle, and Odette feels a kinship with her because they both lost their fathers tragically. Although Alise refuses to speak, she slowly becomes closer to Odette and Derek, and they decide to adopt her as she has no living relatives.  The scullions attack Uberta's castle, kidnapping Alise to lure Odette and Derek away, and locking everyone else in the cellar. Odette and Derek avoid the scullions' traps but Derek is poisoned by Mangler's blow dart. A friendly scullion, whom Odette names Scully, cures Derek and explains about the fake Swan Princess legend and the Forbidden Arts, and reveals that he has been keeping the magical stone safe. The group goes to rescue Alise.  While Derek acts as a distraction, Scully sneaks into the scullion village and finds Alise in the Forbidden Arts' cave, but he is unable to rescue her. When the scullions are about to execute Derek, Odette intervenes and explains that all she wants is for her loved ones to be safe. Scully tells the scullions that the legend is a lie and the true evil is the Forbidden Arts. Mangler shoots a poison dart at Odette, which is blocked by Jojo, the younger of the two brothers from before. Odette cures him with an antidote prepared by Scully, and the tablet with the corrupted prophecy reveals the true prophecy about the Swan Princess.  At the castle, Uberta and Rogers are about to be punished by the scullions for protecting the Swan Princess, and declare their feelings for each other. Jojo and the other scullions arrive with the real prophecy tablet, proving Odette to be good, and they release Uberta and the captives. The scullion army works together with Derek, Puffin, Jean-Bob and Speed to protect the magical stone, but the Forbidden Arts manages to obtain it, gaining its power.  Odette and Scully enter the Forbidden Arts' cave to rescue Alise, and are attacked by Mangler. Scully defeats Mangler, but Odette is unable to break Alise's prison. Alise finally speaks up, telling Odette to destroy the Forbidden Arts' crystal. When Odette is unable to, Scully jumps onto the crystal, sacrificing himself to destroy the Forbidden Arts. In the ensuing explosion Alise is freed from her prison unharmed, and she calls out to Odette: "Mommy". The film ends with everyone celebrating the presentation of Princess Alise to the kingdom. A statue of Scully is erected on the castle's garden.  
Da Sweet Blood of Jesus
  The film opens with an unnamed dancer (Charles “Lil Buck” Riley) dancing in various locations around [[Brooklyn]] during the credit sequence.  From there, the plot follows Dr. Hess Green ([[Stephen Tyrone Williams]]), a wealthy African-American [[anthropologist]] and art collector who acquires a dagger originating in the ancient [[Ashanti Empire]], a highly advanced civilization that, Green claims, became addicted to blood transfusions. That night, Lafayette Hightower ([[Elvis Nolasco]]), an emotionally unstable colleague from the museum which acquired the dagger, pays a visit to Green's impressive, African-art covered [[Martha's Vineyard]] mansion. The two cordially discuss history and philosophy, but once Green has retired for the evening, Hightower becomes drunk and climbs a tree with a noose, claiming he wants to commit [[suicide]]. Green successfully talks him down, but later that night Hightower attacks and stabs Green with the Ashanti ceremonial dagger, killing him. An undetermined amount of time later, Green is shocked to awaken--unscathed. He hears a gunshot and, upon discovering that Hightower has killed himself, he instinctively drinks Hightower's blood. He discovers that he is invulnerable to physical harm, can no longer tolerate normal food and drink, and has an insatiable need for more blood. Though he steals several bags of blood from a doctor's office, he quickly finds that he needs fresh victims. The first is a [[prostitute]] ([[Felicia Pearson]]) who, shockingly, reawakens--only after he has discovered that her blood is [[HIV-positive]]. After a period of tension, it is determined that he has not contracted the virus.   Soon, Hightower's estranged ex-wife, Ganja ([[Zaraah Abrahams]]), arrives at Green's house searching for her ex-husband, who owes her money. Green and Ganja quickly become lovers, and she moves into Green's expansive mansion. When she unwittingly discovers her ex-husband's corpse --frozen in Green's wine cellar-- she is initially angry, but after Green explains what happened and tells her that he loves her, she agrees to marry him. On the honeymoon night, he stabs her with the Ashanti dagger so that she will share immortality with him. Ganja is initially horrified by her new existence, but Green teaches her how to survive. After he departs and kills a young woman with a baby (Jeni Perillo) whom he meets in a public park in Brooklyn, he brings home an old female acquaintance (Naté Bova), for Ganja's first kill. Ganja seduces and then strangles the woman. Ganja and Hess dispose of the body, even though, like the prostitute from before, the "corpse" reawakens.  Eventually, Green becomes disillusioned with this life and makes a visit to a [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] church where he is  moved by an energetic musical performance and approaches the altar to have the pastor lay hands on him. Meanwhile, back at home, Ganja murders Green's loyal domestic servant (Rami Malek). When she searches for Green to confess, she finds him in the shadow of a cross, dying. Green dies in her arms, glad to be at peace. Ganja, though saddened by his death, lives on, presumably continuing her vampire-esque lifestyle. At the movie's closing, we see her walk out to the beach. The woman she had previously killed appears, naked, and joins her to watch the sunset.  
Swelter (film)
 Five masked robbers steal $10 million from a Las Vegas casino.  All but one, who is shot in the head and assumed dead, are captured, but the money goes missing.  Ten years later, Cole, the leader, is broken out of jail by the rest of his gang: Stillman, Boyd, and Cole's half-brother Kane.  From a boastful mechanic, they learn that their former partner apparently survived and escaped with the money due to the intervention of a local physician.  They track the physician to Baker, a small, isolated town with many secrets.  They find Doc, the physician, at a local bar and, from him and other patrons, learn that the sheriff mysteriously appeared ten years ago.  Curious, they start a bar fight in order to draw out the sheriff, who they realize is Pike, the partner who escaped.  Pike now calls himself Bishop and claims to suffer from amnesia and migraines from the bullet fragments lodged in his head.  Cole saves Bishop's life during the bar fight, and Bishop runs a belligerent biker gang out of town.  Later, Boyd and Kane suggest that they raze the town in search of the loot.  Stillman objects, and Kane suggests that Stillman has gone soft.  Cole is able to smooth things over and decides to instead probe Bishop to see how much he remembers.  The two men discuss the town, and Cole drops a few hints about Bishop's past.  Cole asks Bishop to call a coin toss, but Bishop declines and says that it is meaningless, as a man will do what he wants regardless of the result.  Cole, who was holding a gun on Bishop under the table, holsters his weapon and does not interfere when Bishop leaves.  Meanwhile, Bishop experiences trouble with his step-daughter, London, whose mother, Carmen, has a past with Cole.  Unknown to Bishop, Cole and Carmen were once lovers, and she moved to Baker to escape her previous life.  Cole attempts to rekindle their romance, but she refuses.  Boyd fatally injures Doc while researching Bishop, and Bishop learns more about his past from Doc's notes.  As he dies, Doc explains that he was the one who treated Bishop.  Spurred on by the information in Doc's notes, Bishop begins to remember bits of his past, though he still does not know where the money is.  Boyd and Kane become restless and start trouble in the town.  After a fight with her boyfriend, London makes out with Kane.  When she refuses to have sex, Kane rapes her.  At the local diner Boyd attempts to force himself on the waitress which attracts the attention of the deputy. Boyd engages in a draw with the town's deputy, an award-winning sharpshooter, and wins, only to be shot down by Bishop, who is faster.  Stillman, outraged that Kane would rape a teenage girl, confronts and is killed by Kane.  Bishop and Cole meet at the town's church, and Cole reveals that he has recruited the biker gang to replace his fallen men.  Cole reveals Bishop's criminal background to the populace and gives them until sunrise to find the missing money.  At the local diner, Cole takes London hostage in order to ensure Bishop's cooperation.  Disarmed and without the support of the townspeople, Bishop is close to giving up when Carmen reveals that she knew about Bishop's past the whole time and still accepted him.  She recovers a hidden pistol and gives it to Bishop, who then goes to the diner to confront Cole.  Kane uses London as human shield, to the disgust of all the others.  The biker gang leaves in protest, and Cole shoots Kane dead himself, to the surprise of Bishop.  As Cole leaves the diner, Bishop stops him and says that they still must settle their issues.  The two have a duel, and Bishop kills Cole.  Concerned that his criminal background has now become commonly known, Bishop prepares to go on the run.  However, the townspeople rally behind him and offer to cover up the recent events.  Bishop stays on the town's sheriff, and an aerial shot reveals the spot where the money is hidden.

The Taking of Tiger Mountain
 After the Japanese surrender following World War II, the [[People's Liberation Army]] must retake areas overrun by bandits who have raided the Japanese arsenals.  Shao Jianbo, known by his codename Captain 203 after his unit, commands a group of 30 men.  They are out of food and low on ammunition. One of their problems is resolved when they defeat a group of bandits dressed as the PLA who are guarding stores of ammunition.  Reinforcements arrive via train in the form of Yang Zirong and Bai Ru, a combat medic, who are warmly greeted when they bring food.  Captain 203 leads his men to the village raided by the bandits.  Along the way, they meet a young boy who lost his family to bandit attacks.  Though he initially distrusts the PLA soldiers, he warms to them after they rescue him from a bandit spy in the village.  The villagers request that the soldiers stay and defeat the warlord Hawk, as they know he will return to raiding their village once the soldiers have left.  From questioning the bandit spy, Captain 203 learns that Hawk seeks a map the spy was planning to give him.  Zirong suggests that since the soldiers are vastly outnumbered and outgunned by the bandits, who are holed up in a fortress on Tiger Mountain, Captain 203 send him as a spy to infiltrate them, as he has previously infiltrated other local bandit groups.  Captain 203 initially refuses but relents when Zirong resigns in protest.  Zirong takes the bandit spy's map and sets up a location to exchange secret messages with the soldiers.  Though the bandits are suspicious, they accept Zirong after he passes a series of tests.  During one, Hawk sends Ma Qinglian, a woman he has kidnapped from the local village and made his unwilling wife, to tempt Zirong.  Zirong recognizes her as the village boy's mother and, without revealing his true identity, indicates to her that her son is safe.  Qinglian insists they escape immediately and return to the village, but Zirong refuses.  When the bandits cut down the trees used to mark the spot where he leaves his intelligence reports, Zirong improvises by marking new spots.  When Qinglian again insists that they escape the fortress, Brother 2 overhears her and informs Hawk.  Zirong surreptitiously drops incriminating evidence in Brother 2's pocket and instructs Qinglian to accuse Brother 2 of treachery.  Convinced that Zirong and Qinglian are telling the truth, Hawk executes Brother 2.  Hawk organizes a raid on the village and sends 300 men.  The soldiers, warned by Zirong, set traps and use improvised artillery to rout the much larger force, though several soldiers die.  The bandit spy who they had previously caught escapes to the fortress, where he and Zirong accuse each other of being spies.  Hawk, unable to believe his forces were defeated by a small unit, sides with Zirong, who says the village was guarded by a much larger company.  Hawk has Zirong execute the bandit spy.  During Hawk's birthday celebration, Zirong sends plans for an attack, and Captain 203 mobilizes his troops.  Qinglian's son guides them to a weak point in the fortress identified by Zirong, and Zirong helps from the inside.  As the soldiers overpower the remaining bandits, Hawk grabs Qinglian and flees.  Zirong chases, and, in the resulting gunfight, kills Hawk, reuniting Qinglian and her son.  In the modern day, a descendant of Qinglian visits her and honors the memory of Zirong and the other soldiers, including a fantasy sequence where Zirong engages in a second, higher-stakes battle with Hawk that involves an out-of-control airplane hidden inside the fortress.

He agrees to let her try to work things out with her current husband Stuart ([[Dougray Scott]]). Stuart comes to see Bryan and asks him never to see his wife again - despite the fact he is aware they have a daughter together. Without Bryan's knowledge he uses his phone to arrange a meeting with Lenore making out it is Bryan that wants to meet her then promptly deletes the message after it is sent. It is in this location she gets kidnapped.  The following day, Bryan receives a text from Lenore asking to meet him for breakfast. After Bryan purchases breakfast, he returns to his apartment to discover Lenore's lifeless body. [[L.A.P.D.]] units immediately appear and try to arrest him, but he resists and escapes. Meanwhile, L.A.P.D. Inspector Frank Dotzler ([[Forest Whitaker]]) familiarizes himself with Bryan's background and issues an [[All-points bulletin|APB]] for him.  Bryan retreats to a [[safe house]] equipped with weapons and surveillance electronics. He retraces Lenore's travels to a remote [[Filling station|gas station]] [[convenience store]] and finds [[Closed-circuit television|surveillance footage]] of her being abducted by unidentified men with unique hand [[tattoo]]s, but L.A.P.D. detectives arrive and arrest him. While in transit, Bryan frees himself, hijacks the [[police cruiser]], escapes, and downloads phone records from an L.A.P.D. database onto a [[USB flash drive|thumb drive]]. He contacts Kim at Lenore's funeral via a camera hidden in his friend Sam's suit, instructing her to maintain her "very predictable schedule." She purchases her daily yogurt drink with a "Drink Me Now" note which, unknown by her, is drugged by Bryan. During a lecture, she feels nauseated and runs to the restroom where Bryan is waiting. He surprises her and gives her the antidote to the drug. Bryan removes a surveillance bug that, unknown to her, was planted by Dotzler. He tells her that he is looking for the real murderer and that she should keep safe. Kim tells Bryan of her pregnancy and that Stuart is acting scared and has hired bodyguards, which he has never done before.  Bryan tails Stuart's car but is ambushed by a pursuing SUV that pushes his car over the edge of a cliff. He survives the crash, hijacks a car, follows the attackers to a roadside liquor store and kills them. Bryan then abducts and interrogates Stuart, who confesses that Lenore's murder was caused by his failure to repay a debt to his former business partner and ex-[[Spetsnaz]] operative Oleg Malankov ([[Sam Spruell]]) and that he exposed Bryan's identity to Malankov out of jealousy.  With assistance from his old colleagues and a nervous Stuart, Bryan gains entry to Malankov's heavily secured penthouse. After killing the guards, a furious gun battle, and a brutal fight, a mortally wounded Malankov reveals that all that happened was a setup: Stuart planned Lenore's murder and framed Bryan as part of a business deal to collect on a $12M insurance policy. Malankov adds that when he failed to kill Bryan, Stuart used Bryan to kill Malankov and keep the insurance money. Meanwhile, Stuart injures Sam ([[Leland Orser]]), and abducts Kim, intending to flee with the money. Under police pursuit, Bryan arrives at the airport in Malankov's Porsche as Stuart's plane is taxiing for takeoff. After destroying the landing gear, preventing the plane from taking off, Bryan overpowers Stuart and prepares to kill him but pauses at Kim's pleas. He tells Stuart to expect final punishment if he escapes justice or completes a reduced prison sentence. Dotzler and the LAPD arrive to arrest Stuart. Bryan is cleared of all charges.  In the aftermath of Stuart's arrest, Kim, who is pregnant, informs Bryan that she wants to name her baby after her mother if it is a girl.

Tabloid Truth
 A scandalous rumor about Mi-jin (Go Won-hee), an up-and-coming actress, is included as a gossip item in a stock market tipsheet (''jjirasi'') and propagated by the tabloids, causing her to kill herself in an apparent suicide. Woo-gon ([[Kim Kang-woo]]), Mi-jin's devoted longtime manager who dedicated everything to building her career, initiates a vengeful investigation to expose the sources of the rumor. With unexpected assistance from tabloid distributor Mr. Park ([[Jung Jin-young]]) and legendary [[telephone tapping|wiretapper]] Baek Moon ([[Ko Chang-seok]]), Woo unravels the opaque and lucrative world of secret tips and salacious rumors.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  The film portrays a particularly insidious and unexpected forum for tabloid gossip-mongering: ''jjirasi'' (from the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word ''chirashi'', meaning "leaflet"), or the stock market tipsheet. In weekly secret meetings consisting of corporate personnel, politicians, reporters, public officials, and others, insiders exchange information about the latest goings-on. The collected intelligence is published into a tip sheet and distributed through paid subscriber channels before getting picked up by the tabloids as juicy [[blind item]]s. What makes this combination particularly toxic is the sheen of respectability and truth given by the financial market players involved, despite the only occasional accuracy of its content.<ref></ref>  
The Taking of Deborah Logan
 Mia, Gavin, and Luis are a documentary team set to create a documentary about Deborah, an elderly woman who has [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Deborah is reluctant to be filmed but agrees to the project after her daughter Sarah reminds her that they need the money to keep the house from being repossessed. While filming, Sarah and Deborah talk about earlier years when Deborah worked as a [[switchboard operator]] for her own answering service business to make ends meet.  Deborah is shown to exhibit increasingly bizarre actions that her personal physician, Dr. Nazir, states are normal for someone with an aggressive form of Alzheimer's. However, cameraman Luis begins to notice that several of Deborah's actions defy normal explanations and expresses concern that something supernatural is occurring. Things grow more tense after Luis and Gavin record audio of Deborah speaking in French while sitting at her old switchboard, talking about sacrifices and snakes. They also notice that the line for 337 continually rings and discover that the line belonged to local physician Henry Desjardins, who disappeared after a series of cannibalistic ritualized murders of four young girls. This information is too much for Gavin, so he quits. Deborah's behavior becomes so extreme that she is hospitalized for her own safety.  Mia and the others discover that Desjardins was supposedly trying to re-create an ancient demonic ritual that would make him immortal but required the deaths of five girls that recently had their first period. They question whether Deborah is possessed by Desjardins—as a similar case occurred in Africa where a mother was possessed by her dead son and was freed only when a [[witch doctor]] burned the son's corpse. At the hospital, Harris visits Deborah, who begs Harris to kill her. He tries to comply with her wishes but is unsuccessful due to the entity within Deborah flinging the hospital room television at Harris, preventing it. Sarah, Mia, and Luis discover that Deborah had unsuccessfully tried to abduct Cara, a young cancer patient in whom she had previously tried to take. Sarah learns that years ago, Deborah had learned that Desjardins planned to use Sarah as his fifth victim and had murdered the doctor before he could accomplish this, and buried his body in the yard. The group eventually finds the body and tries to burn it but fails to do so.  Deborah succeeds in abducting Cara and taking her to the location where Desjardins had killed all of his previous victims. After discovering Deborah has gone into the mines, Sheriff Tweed follows behind, only to be killed moments later. After hearing Tweed's attack Sarah and Mia follow behind, only to find Deborah just as she's trying to eat Cara's head in a snake-like manner. They finally manage to burn Desjardins' corpse. The film then cuts to news footage of reporters stating that Deborah was deemed unfit to stand trial for the crimes she committed during her abduction of Cara. An additional news story shows that Cara has overcome her cancer and is celebrating her birthday. As the reporter begins to wrap up the story, Cara turns to the camera and gives a sinister smile, hinting that Desjardins' ritual was completed and that he is now in control of her body.  
Symphony No. 42 (film)
 The short consists of 47 loosely connected scenes revolving around the "irrational connections between human and nature<ref>[https://vimeo.com/153887315 Synopsis on Vimeo]</ref>".  
Tamanna (2014 film)
 The film incorporates elements of dark humour, melodrama, crime, passion and revenge and is based on [[Anthony Shaffer (writer)|Anthony Shaffer]]’s play, [[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]. The film's hero is Rizwan Ahmed ([[Omair Rana]]) a struggling actor who meets Mian Tariq Ali ([[Salman Shahid]]), a relic of the once thriving film industry. The struggling actor is there to convince Ali to divorce his wife. A contest of male dominance between the two men ensues, starting quite reasonably, playfully even, but eventually turning angry and violent.<ref></ref>  Whilst some of the interactions between the two men are similar to the play ''Sleuth'', the film has roles for not just the Wyke character's wife, but also his second, younger wife, who is the protagonist's object of desire. The milieu is Pakistan's film industry, [[Lollywood]] in its dying days. The outcome for the characters is dark, with more emphasis on being sacrificed than self-sacrifice, and is used an allegory of wider issues. The dialogue, in Urdu, and the scenario are adapted in numerous ways for Pakistani culture.  
Tammy (film)
 In [[Murphysboro, Illinois]], Tammy Banks ([[Melissa McCarthy]]) strikes a deer on the way to her job at the fast food restaurant Topper Jack's, damaging her vehicle; when she arrives, her supervisor, Keith Morgan ([[Ben Falcone]]), is forced to [[dismissal (employment)|dismiss]] her from the restaurant. After her car breaks down on the way home on [[Illinois Route 13]], she walks home to find her husband, Greg ([[Nat Faxon]]), eating a romantic meal with their neighbor, Missi ([[Toni Collette]]). Tammy leaves in frustration and walks two doors down to her parents' house.  She tells her mother, Deb ([[Allison Janney]]), about her plans to leave and takes her grandmother's [[Cadillac Seville|car]]. Pearl ([[Susan Sarandon]]) requests to come along. Tammy initially refuses but ultimately agrees when Pearl proves that she has a large sum of cash. Tammy has beer with Pearl, and the next morning they wake up near a park where Pearl convinces Tammy not to go back home. Pearl wants to go to [[Niagara Falls]] with Tammy since she hadn't gone as a child. Along the way the two stop in a bar in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Tammy meets Earl Tillman ([[Gary Cole]]) and his son Bobby ([[Mark Duplass]]), and Earl hooks up with Pearl. Tammy and Bobby begin to make a love connection as Pearl and Earl drunkenly make out in the car. Bobby gives Tammy his number to call him so he can pick up Earl. Back at the hotel, Tammy is forced to sleep outside. The next morning, Bobby picks up Earl, and the two leave. Tammy, infuriated with Pearl, leaves her, but returns after feeling guilty. Tammy and Pearl are arrested after Pearl gets caught buying a case of beer for two teenagers as well as shoplifting a pint of whiskey for herself. Tammy is released, but Pearl stays at the jail for possessing illegal prescription drugs.  To bail out Pearl, Tammy robs a Topper Jack's, where she converses with employees Becky ([[Sarah Baker]]) and Larry (Rich Williams). Finally having obtained the money, she rushes to the prison to bail Pearl out, but Bobby has already bailed her out. With the help of Pearl's wealthy lesbian cousin Lenore ([[Kathy Bates]]) (who made her fortune off of a small chain of pet supply stores), they destroy the car to hide the evidence from the robbery. The two then stay at the home of Lenore and her wife, Susanne ([[Sandra Oh]]). At a [[4th of July]] party thrown at the house, Pearl gets drunk and humiliates Tammy by making rude comments about her weight and appearance in front of all the guests. After Tammy runs off to the dock on the lake by the house, Lenore follows her to both comfort her and offer her some [[tough love]], telling her that she always complains about her life, but never does anything to change it. She tells Tammy that if she wants to make things better for herself she needs to work hard to make it happen.  Later in the morning, Tammy brings coffee to Pearl, who is presumably asleep outside. After repeatedly trying to wake her, Pearl does not wake up and Tammy assumes she is dead. She, Lenore, and Susanne grieve Pearl's death, but Pearl suddenly awakens, much to everyone's shock. Pearl was actually unconscious due to the large amount of alcohol she drank the previous night. Tammy is relieved, and she tearfully demands Pearl to get help for her drinking problem. The ambulance arrives and takes Pearl to the hospital. The police arrive as well, and Tammy is arrested for her robbery of Topper Jack's.  Tammy is released from prison 38 days later, and her father, Don ([[Dan Aykroyd]]), picks her up. He offers to kill Greg for her, though she declines. Returning home, Tammy finds that Greg and Missi have packed Tammy's belongings. She and Greg agree to an amicable divorce. She walks down the street to her parents' place and finds out that Pearl is now living in Brookview Retirement Home. Tammy goes to Brookview to break her out, but Pearl is actually happy there. She has been attending [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings at the home, and she is dating one of the men there. However, they do still take a trip to Niagara Falls.  At Niagara Falls, Bobby surprises Tammy there and they kiss. Tammy tells him about her choice to move to Louisville to get a fresh start in life and get closer to him. The last scene shows Missi leaving Greg to be with Keith and Tammy befriends Becky and Larry.

  [[April O'Neil]], a local reporter for Channel 6 [[Eyewitness News]] in [[New York City]], investigates a crime wave by a group of criminals called the [[Foot Clan]]. At a dock at night, she sees the Foot raiding cargo containers. After an unseen [[vigilante]] attacks the thieves, April notices a symbol left behind. April's supervisor [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)#Other characters|Bernadette Thompson]] and her coworkers are oblivious to her story. Later while covering a charity event thrown by Sacks Industries, April expresses gratitude to the company's [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] [[Eric Sacks]], who was her late father's lab partner.  Frustrated by the vigilante, the Foot Clan's leader [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] has the Foot Soldiers take hostages at a subway station in order to draw him out. April, at the scene, becomes a hostage herself. Four mysterious figures arrive, take out the Clan, and free the hostages. April follows them to a rooftop and is shocked to see that the vigilantes are [[anthropomorphic]] mutant [[turtles]], causing her to pass out. When she regains consciousness, they advise her not to tell anyone of them. As they leave, April hears [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]] and [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]]'s names.

Unable to convince Bernadette of the Turtles' existence, April is dismissed. Her coworker [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)#Other characters|Vern Fenwick]] drives her to Sacks' estate where she confides in him about her discovery. Sacks believes her and reveals that he and April's father had been experimenting on a mutagen created to cure disease, which was thought lost in the fire that killed her dad.  At Splinter's behest, the Turtles bring April to their sewer lair. Splinter explains April had saved them all from the fire and freed them into the sewers. The mutagen caused the five of them to grow and develop humanoid attributes. Splinter took on the role of their father, using April's father as an example. After finding a book on [[Ninjutsu]] in a storm drain, he proceeded to teach himself, then the Turtles, in the fighting style. When April reveals she told Sacks about her discovery of the Turtles, Splinter informs her that Sacks turned on her father and killed him.  Then, Shredder and the Foot Soldiers attack the lair, defeating Splinter and incapacitating Raphael while the other Turtles are captured. April comes out of hiding and she and Raphael plan to save the others. At Sacks' estate, he has the Turtles' blood drained in order to create an antidote to a deadly virus that Sacks hopes to flood New York with, believing he will become rich from people seeking his cure. Raphael, April, and Vern storm the estate and free the other Turtles. The group then escapes the compound in pursuit of Sacks.  On a radio tower in the city, Sacks and Shredder plant a device that will flood the city with the virus while Sacks is preparing to convert the mutagen to healing factor. April and Vern subdue Sacks in the lab, while the Turtles are battling Shredder on the roof. During the fight, the tower's support beams collapse. As the turtles try to keep it from falling and infecting the city, April confronts Shredder with the mutagen. In the struggle, the tower collapses and the Turtles pull April onto it with them, while Shredder falls to the street and is captured by the police. Believing they are about to die, the Turtles confess their secrets, while Raphael gives an impassioned speech of his love for his brothers before they land harmlessly on the street. They vanish before the humans find them and return to the sewers, where they give Splinter the mutagen and he begins to recover.  Sometime later, April meets with Vern, who tries and fails to ask her on a date. The Turtles appear in a special modified "Turtle Van", and Michelangelo accidentally blows up Vern's new car with a rocket. As police respond to the explosion, the Turtles leave, but not before Mikey tries to serenade April with "[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]" by the band [[The Turtles]], much to his brothers' annoyance and April's amusement.

Testament of Youth (film)
 It's 1918, and [[Vera Brittain]] struggles through a cheering crowd, celebrating the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|end of the Great War]]. She's the only one not cheering and takes refuge in a church, where several women are praying. There, a painting of a struggle at sea reminds her of earlier times...  Now 1914, Vera fights to become a student at [[Somerville College, Oxford]]. While her father is against it, her brother [[Edward Brittain|Edward]] supports her. Along with his close schoolfriends [[Roland Leighton]] and friend [[Victor Richardson (soldier)|Victor]], the "three musketeers" and Vera have a good summer, swimming in a lake together and having long walks in the countryside. Roland, who is himself an aspiring poet, supports Vera in writing her own poems and pursuing her dream of becoming a writer someday. Roland and Vera start a shy romance. With the support of her brother Vera convinces her father to let her visit Oxford. The [[World War I|First World War]] breaks out and all three musketeers enlist. Vera helps convince her father to let Edward join the army.  When she arrives in Oxford she sees, for the first time, two amputees being assisted. In a newspaper, Vera sees that four of the pages of the paper consist of only the names of the fallen (i.e. the dead). Vera volunteers to join the [[Voluntary Aid Detachment]] as a nurse tending the wounded in a hospital. Some of the other nurses know that she is from Oxford and therefore try to "break" Vera. For the first time Vera is confronted with the wounded from the front, when she has to wash a stinking soldier, brought covered in mud and blood from the battlefield in [[Flanders]] to the hospital in [[London]].  Vera's brother Edward visits, introducing his friend, fellow soldier Geoffrey Thurlow, and brings the news that Roland has just arrived back home on leave. They all visit the Leighton's home and Roland privately admits to Vera his traumatic experiences at the front. He proposes to Vera and they decide to get married on his next home leave. Roland soon returns to France, this time accompanied by Vera's brother Edward. Vera finds her father reluctantly crying after his son's train departs. In the hospital a stream of wounded soldiers arrive. Roland writes that he has been granted leave at Christmas, and has been sent far behind the lines and is safe. Just before Christmas, he is killed. Vera, in her wedding dress, hears from Roland's sobbing mother in a telephone call just half an hour before being due to leave for the church.  Vera eventually finds out that Roland did not die "bravely and painlessly", as the letter she receives from the British Army states. She visits [[George Catlin (political scientist)|George Catlin]], who was in the next hospital bed to Roland in [[Louvencourt]]. Catlin tries to spare her feelings, but then confirms Roland suffered from his abdomen gunshot wound for half a day in such pain, due to a shortage of morphine, that there was no last message. Victor, now blind from his injuries, arrives at the hospital. Vera proposes to him, because he is "going to need someone" and "I... Well, Roland would like it", but he gently turns her down, although he has been in love with Vera for a long time. The next night he unexpectedly dies from his head injury.  Vera decides to go work in France herself. Her father is very proud of her. It's August 1917 and in France the situation of the wounded is very bad. Due to a lack of surgeons often the nurses have to perform amputations. Vera works in a hospital behind the lines, where she is first tasked with treating wounded Germans. Although she and her superior at first seem to not care much about the wounded enemy, they later both comfort a dying German soldier. After a big offensive the hospital is so crowded that the wounded have to lie in the mud outside. A stretcher bearer says one soldier claimed to know her, name of Edward. She ask where that soldier lies and is told "Round the back", where the dead lie. Amongst the corpses Vera discovers her brother, and realises he's still alive. She nurses him, his infected wound gets treatment, and he is saved. Vera shows him the letter from Geoffrey that she found in his pocket; she hadn't read it. Edward lets her, wanting her to hear Geoffrey's "voice". The letter recounts a sunset over the battlefield and ends "And I thought of you, dear friend, and I knew I'd see you again, either in this world or the hereafter".  Once Edward is recovered, he is sent to Italy, which seems to be good news because the fighting there is lighter. Edward wants Vera to proceed with her academic career after the war, by visiting Oxford.  Vera's mother has a nervous breakdown and Vera goes home. There she takes over the household, cleaning the house and hiring a maid. A telegram boy arrives and from Vera's father's sobs at the front door she knows Edward is dead.   The day of the truce comes. Like in the first minutes of the movie, Vera is shown as she marches stoically through a cheering crowd, to end up in a church where some women are praying. Honouring her brother's wish, Vera finally goes to Oxford, where she has nightmares about Roland's and Edward's deaths. [[Winifred Holtby]], another student at the college, helps her cope with her trauma and to get back into the everyday world.  Vera visits a public political meeting on how to punish the Germans because George Catlin is a speaker. Most of the audience is for a "[[Treaty of Versailles|revenge treaty]]". Caitlin, who calls for a "forgiving peace", is booed. Vera gets on the stage and gives a speech about how she held the hand of a dying German soldier and that he was not different from her brother or her fiancé. Therefore she calls for a "No more" to war and revenge.  The last scenes show Vera swimming in the lake, where she swam with the "three musketeers" in 1914. She promises not to forget the dead and the screen turns to black before this memorial:  {| style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;" |- !

Tenaliraman (film)
  The movie opens to a prologue, where King Parasbaram  ([[Radha Ravi]]), ruler of a small rival kingdom and the nine ministers of the great Empire of Vikata Nagaram are on their way to a Chinese consulate's mansion. They are warmly welcomed by General Wang (Wilson Ng) and courtesan Hong (Vivienne Tseng) once they reach there. The Chinese consulate, headed by Chao Gong Gong (Nickson Cheng), wishes to engage in trade with the people of the Kingdom of Vikata Nagaram and reap the benefits. Thus, the ministers strike a deal with Parasbaram and the ministers to help them, promising them a huge share of the benefits. The Foreign Affairs Minister of Vikata Nagaram, Nandivarma Rayar ([[Joe Malloori]]) objects to this, saying that he doesn't want to betray the King and his people for money. Chao Gong Gong realising that he is of no use to the plan, has courtesan Hong kill him with a poisoned needle from her hair.  The film then introduces Tenaliraman ([[Vadivelu]] as the witty common man) who captures a gang of thieves (led by "Besant Nagar" Ravi) and teaches them a lesson. He then takes off for Vikata Nagaram where he meets the feisty Princess Maadhulai ([[Meenakshi Dixit]]), daughter of the King of Vikata Nagaram, and defeats her in an arm wrestling competition.  The film's plot then shifts to the King OR Maamannan ([[Vadivelu]] again, as the King of Vikata Nagaram), who is ruling over his kingdom along with his nine ministers, whom he claims to be the Navarathnams (nine jewels) of his court. The most interesting aspect is that the King has a rather large family comprising 36 wives and 52 children and  is confined mostly to his palace. He believes his people are happy based on the sayings and reports of his ministers. In reality, the people are being robbed and cheated by the corrupt ministers and are living in poverty. During his administration, he realizes the absence of Nandivarma Rayar and asks about it to his ministers, who reply that he had died. The King then declares that a new minister be appointed in Nandivarma Rayar's stead. The guards then announce the news in public. Tenaliraman overhears the news and goes to the palace as a candidate for Nandivarma Rayar's post.  After a display of his all-round talents (singing, dancing, wit and humour), Tenaliraman impresses the King and soon becomes the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and an integral part of the King's court, even closer to the King than the presiding ones. In the meantime, love blossoms between Tenaliraman and Princess Maadhulai. Tenaliraman, in reality, is a rebel who is sent by his comrades to kill the King, whom he believes at first, is responsible for the poverty of the people. Later, while having dinner with the King and the ministers, he discovers that it is the ministers who are at fault and not the King. He tries to warn his comrades of this, but his pigeon who carried the warning message, is captured by one of the ministers ([[Manobala]]). He informs the other ministers that Tenaliraman is a rebel and they twist Tenaliraman's message to the rebels, saying that the King will be killed that night. Tenaliraman's comrades believe the twisted message sent to them and raid the palace, only to have them and Tenaliraman get captured by the King. On learning of the conspiracy, the King banishes Tenaliraman from his kingdom.  After a few months, many changes have taken place in Vikata Nagaram. The Chinese have entered the fray and are trading with the Kingdom. Unbeknownst to the King, they are reaping the rewards for themselves, leaving the people even poorer. Parasbaram and the ministers get their share and are enjoying themselves. The King is now very sad thinking of Tenaliraman and misses him. Princess Maadhulai then tells him that Tenaliraman could not have done such a thing and comforts her father. He learns from Tenaliraman's comrade, Kaaliappa ([[Bose Venkat]]) that the rebels were wrongly informed and that Tenaliraman was not at fault. The King goes and successfully brings back Tenaliraman to his Kingdom.  Tenaliraman then informs the King in private, that all the rules and regulations and schemes organised by the King on the trade with the Chinese are being carried out in such a way that it only benefits the Chinese and the ministers and not the people, who live in utter poverty, and since the King confines himself mostly to his palace and believes the words of his ministers and that he has lived a rich and prosperous life all along, he cannot mingle and live with the people of his Kingdom even for one day. The King then bets Tenaliraman that he can live with his people incognito for 10 days, and at the same time, find concrete evidence that the people are being robbed and cheated by the Chinese and the ministers. Leaving the care of his Kingdom to Tenaliraman and lying to his wives that he will be going to a nearby Kingdom for administrative purposes and for attending a feast, the King begins his mission.  During his mission, the King learns about the plight of his people from various persons. Soon, he comically finds himself in a hunger strike that is organised against him. When Tenaliraman meets the King in private and converses with him, one of the citizens ([[Devadarshini]]) overhears the conversation and discovers that it is the King himself who is among them incognito and reveals it to the citizens of Vikata Nagaram.  In the meantime, Tenaliraman is ruling in the King's state with an Iron grip and because of this, Chao Gong Gong and Parasbaram fear that they might get caught in the process. Parasbaram learns from his spies that the King is in Vikata Nagaram and not elsewhere. He reveals it to Chao Gong Gong and they issue orders to find the King and kill him.  The King, with his citizens, have started a riot in Vikata Nagaram, but unfortunately, the King is captured by the Chinese. Parasbaram, who wanted the throne of Vikata Nagaram for himself, purposefully does not divulge to the Chinese that the King was among those captured until the corrupt ministers came to the consulate to say that the King is in Vikata Nagaram. The King revealed himself and everyone are dumb founded. Chao Gong Gong orders courtesan Hong to kill Parasbarm, because he purposefully failed to realise earlier that the person they caught was the King. The King is then imprisoned in a carriage and taken to a secluded place to be executed. But the leader of a Cannibal tribe stops them midway and orders the King to be handed over to them. Surrounded by Cannibals, Chao Gong Gong reluctantly releases the King. The King, initially frightened, asks the Cannibal who he is. The Cannibal is revealed to be none other than Tenaliraman. Chao Gong Gong uses his telescope and spots something fishy and the ministers and the Chinese traders find out, after General Wang fired at the "men" on the hilltop, that the "men" were just haystacks and that they have been duped. They then to go after the pair, but Tenaliraman, in his style, chases them out of Vikata Nagaram forever using the same bag of tricks that he used on the gang of thieves earlier.  The film then ends with new people replacing the posts of the corrupt ministers. Tenaliraman becomes the new prime minister. Coincidentally, most of these new people were involved in comical encounters with the King during his 10-day plan. In the end, the King himself takes additional charge as one of the ministers, on Tenaliraman's suggestion, as the child welfare minister and Princess Maadhulai is selected as the Sports minister.  The film signs off with the tagline "Tenaliraman Amaitha Indha Makkal Aatchi Thodarattum.....Dum!" (Let the people's government established by Tenaliraman continue).  
Terroir (film)
 Wealthy wine maker Jonathan Bragg (Keith Carradine) hires Tuscan wine detective Victor Borgo (Gaetano Guarino) to find the source of a mysterious bottle of wine, the "Oroboros". As Borgo follows the twisted, perilous trail, he descends deeper into an arcane Tuscan underworld, encountering an earth-worshiping wine cult and the dark side of human nature.<ref></ref>  Jopson's screenplay brings Poe's short story "The Cask of Amontillado" into contemporary times and sets it the underworld of the [[Tuscan wine]] buinsess. With references to [[Brunellopoli]], the great Italian wine scandal of 2008 <ref></ref> and with [[cameo appearance]]s from real-world winemakers such as Salvatore Ferragamo and Luca Sanjust, the film brings a level of authenticity when it comes to the wine business.  In a nod to Poe's short story, in addition to the wine theme, Terroir features [[Masonic]] references and symbols as well as a terrifying scene in a wine cellar.<ref></ref>  Terroir takes its name from the wine industry term [[terroir]], which indicates that the natural environment in which a particular wine is produced affects the outcome, and thus the taste, including factors such as soil, topography, and climate. Together these elements determine the character of wine.<ref></ref>

That Thing Called Tadhana
 ===Rome=== The film starts at an airport in Rome where Mace, on her way back to the Philippines, despairs over which of her personal items to keep so she does not exceed the load requirements. As she bemoans her fate and cries over her dilemma, Anthony shows up and offers to carry her extra baggage for her through his unused extra baggage allowance. Mace later reveals that her whole life is in her luggage.  On the plane, Mace watches and emotionally connects with the protagonists of the film "[[One More Chance (2007 film)|One More Chance]]" but vehemently declines the pack of tissues offered to her.  ===Manila=== Upon arrival at [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|NAIA]], they go to a Japanese restaurant after Mace expresses her reluctance to go straight home. Anthony shares his reasons for being in Rome but finds that Mace does not share the amazement. Their small talk is cut short when a fellow patron, who has nonchalantly been ignoring an incoming call, irritates Mace. Much later, Mace questions the merit of leaving the future of one's relationship to the winds of fate, or what destiny has to dictate, and declares that it did not sit well with her because she would have done something about it. She then begins to talk about her relationship that just recently ended. An eight-year-long relationship that was broken in just seven words.  They later on end up in a karaoke bar where they sing "[[Where Do Broken Hearts Go]]" together. In a drunken stupor, Mace tells Anthony that she wants to go to [[Baguio City]].  On the bus to Baguio, Mace associates a film being shown to a memory she has with her ex-boyfriend. Then at a stopover, after she does the same to everything that Anthony comes up with, she strikes up a deal with him as a means of conditioning herself against the habit. Still, Mace cannot help but ask ''"- how does one forget?"'' and ''"- how long does one take to do it?"''. Anthony points out that ''"- what's important is to forget"'' - how and how long was ''"- up to her"''.  ===Baguio=== In Baguio, Mace makes up her mind about what to do next, declines Anthony's offer to help and lugs her baggage around on her own - something that, although slow, is still manageable. At an art exhibit, Mace discovers Anthony's unfulfilled passion for painting overshadowed by a life driven by requirements and deadlines. So, over lunch, she asks Anthony to illustrate a short story she has written in college entitled ''"The Arrow with a Heart Pierced Through it"''. Later that night, Mace awakens from a dream involving her ex-boyfriend. Anthony reveals that his dream has been of the two of them just walking along [[Session Road]].  Inside a café in Session Road, Mace talks about how she waited eight years for a question that never came. Anthony admits to having been unprepared and shares the loss and pain that he has suffered thereafter along with all other sorts of questions that has gone unanswered. Mace then quotes [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] back to him.  Outside the café, Anthony reassures her that she is not ugly at all, tells her that she will recover because it is impossible for an overwhelming love like hers to be wasted or go unreciprocated and quotes Popoy's line from the film One More Chance. He also reveals to her what he has done in order to forget and move on from his ex-girlfriend who has long since moved on and forgotten about him.  ===Sagada=== Upon arriving in [[Sagada]], Mace realizes that their belongings have been left behind. While a frantic Anthony tries to negotiate a way to go back, Mace tells him that the baggage does not matter anymore in her present life. As they await for the jeepney bound for Mount Kiltepan, in the freezing cold, Anthony gallantly drapes his sweater across her shoulders and for the first time spend a few minutes together in thoughtful silence.  They arrive at the camp late in the evening, lie down next to the fire beneath the open sky and talk about what they will wish for if a shooting star was to appear. They drift off to sleep, content with the idea that their wishes will surely be granted.   The next day dawns and they run together to a place at the edge of the mountain and the sea of clouds. There, Mace unloads herself of everything, screams all of her anger, all of her pain and of everything she has been unable say to her ex-boyfriend.  ===Epilogue=== Mace asks about what they did upon reaching the far end of Session Road in his dream. Anthony reveals that he woke up before he got to that part but tells her that if he were to add something to it, it would be that she turns to him slowly to say she will forget her ex-boyfriend.  After a brief moment of silence, Mace replies and says ''"I will forget him."''  On the way home Anthony was walking Mace home when they found out that her ex Marco was by the gate waiting for Mace with a boquet of flowers asking for another chance. Anthony and Mace were shocked so Anthony said goodbye to give them some time to talk.  On his way home Anthony was shocked with everything that happened for the past couple of days. All he did was smile.  Mace’s short story played. The Arrow was feeling heavier than usual even after losing The Heart pierced through him. The Arrow kept on going until he met The Heart again.  The story resumed in where Anthony was driving through Manila. He was thinking about what Mace said about leaving your fate to the wind. He said to himself that if you really love someone, you should go for it and not wait for the wind to blow her back to you and that you should pull so hard and not let go as long as you can.  The story ended with Mace’s short story being shown on Anthony’s lap published with the credits written “Written by Mace Castillo” “Illustrated by Anthony Lagdameo” which means that they kept in touch and Anthony is on his way to see his girlfriend Mace.  
That Sugar Film
  The film follows Gameau's experiment on himself, changing from his normal diet containing no [[Sugar#Refining|refined sugar]], to a 'health-conscious' diet low in fat but high in sugar, equivalent to 200 grams (40 tsp) of sugar per day. As a result, Gameau gained weight, [[Lethargy|grew lethargic]], and developed [[fatty liver disease]].<ref name="slate"></ref><ref></ref> The sugar diet was selected such that his calorie intake was not increased from his normal diet.  Interviews with experts attribute this change to the high level of sugar he is ingesting, and in particular suggest that [[fructose]] may be the main culprit. It is suggested that [[artificial sweetener]]s may be no better.  The viewers are introduced to the "[[Bliss point (food)|bliss point]]", a term coined in the 1960s which applies here to the amount of sugar you can add to a food to make it optimally desirable.  Adding more sugar beyond the "bliss point" leads to significant drop in desirability.  Following the experiment, he returned to his previous diet, and the ill effects are largely and quickly reversed.  
Theeb
 It is 1916. Recently orphaned brothers Hussein and Theeb, the second and third sons of a Bedouin sheik of the [[Howeitat]] tribe, come from a family of [[Hajj|pilgrim]] guides,<ref></ref> and are accustomed to a nomadic lifestyle. One night, their camp is visited by Edward, a British officer, and an Arab named Marji. The officer is carrying a wooden box, rumoured to contain gold, which raises Theeb's curiosity. Hussein is asked to guide them to a Roman [[Water well|well]] lying on the pilgrims' trail, next to the strategic [[Hejaz Railway|Ottoman railway]]. Men at the camp warn that the trail is rife with bandits. Theeb wants to join, but his brother insists on leaving him behind. The next day as the group leaves, the boy disobeys his brother and follows them and manages to catch up after a day's walk. Despite objections from Hussein and Marji concerning Theeb's presence and fear for his safety, Edward is adamant on continuing their travel immediately, so Theeb stays with the group.  After they reach the well, they discover that it is contaminated by blood from slaughtered bodies thrown into it. The group then notice that they are being watched by a group of men in the distance. They quickly escape, but Edward insists that they continue. Hussein leads them to another nearby well in a canyon, where they are ambushed. Edward and Marji are suddenly shot dead from a distance. Hussein and Theeb hide from the raiders; when night falls, another engagement with the raiders leaves Hussein dead. While trying to escape, Theeb trips and falls into the well. A raider cuts the water bag rope. He manages to climb up the next day, and finds himself stranded in the desert. The boy weeps for his murdered brother and buries him in the sand.  Theeb spends the day wandering around the canyon, and eventually notices a camel heading towards him from the distance. He approaches the camel, and finds an unconscious man collapsed on top. The next day, Theeb wakes up to see the man staring at him. He is Hassan, a gravely injured mercenary who is one of the perpetrators of the massacre.<ref></ref> Theeb is too small to get the camel to obey him, and Hassan is too injured to move. They are initially aggressive and hostile, but soon realise that they need each other's help to survive.<ref></ref>  Theeb spends some time with Hassan, feeding and healing him. Hassan asks Theeb not to betray him, considering how he let Theeb eat with him. The next day, the pair mount the camel and head towards an Ottoman rail station. They bump into Arab revolutionaries who ask Hassan questions regarding his modern Western belongings – they are looking for the British officer, who had coordinated an attack with them against the Ottomans on the Hejaz railway. Allowed to pass, the two continue towards the rail station. On their way there, they pass by a part of the railway where dozens of dead Arab revolutionaries lie. They had been waiting for the British officer, with his wooden box detonator, which was intended to blow up the railway. At the station, Hassan sells the Englishman's belongings to an Ottoman Chief in exchange for silver. When Theeb sees how Hassan sold the items, especially the wooden box, he is disgusted at Hassan's (a fellow Arab's) betrayal to the Turks and decides to kill him. Young Theeb waits outside the station and shoots Hassan dead. The Ottoman chief lets the boy go after learning that Hassan had killed his brother, and Theeb rides off into the desert alone.

Think Like a Man Too
  Cedric ([[Kevin Hart]]) begins by saying how [[Las Vegas]] has always been a place for casinos and showgirls, and is the perfect place for couples to get married.  Cedric and his friends are all in Las Vegas for the wedding of Michael ([[Terrence J]]) and Candace ([[Regina Hall]]), with her son Duke (Caleel Harris) and mother (Angela Gibbs) joining them. Zeke ([[Romany Malco]]) and Mya ([[Meagan Good]]) arrive, with Zeke's womanizing past constantly being brought up by old friends and former flames, including the [[concierge]] at the hotel, who throws her drink in his face. Bennett ([[Gary Owen (comedian)|Gary Owen]]) and his wife Tish ([[Wendi McLendon-Covey]]) are trying to get a spark back in their marriage. Jeremy ([[Jerry Ferrara]]) and Kristen ([[Gabrielle Union]]) have married and are now trying for a baby. Dominic ([[Michael Ealy]]) and Lauren ([[Taraji P. Henson]]) are reunited after spending time away from each other, and they make out in the limousine. Finally, Cedric pulls up to the hotel in a gaudy sports car, happily getting away from his wife Gail ([[Wendy Williams]]).  The men and women separate to enjoy their day. Cedric books himself a lavish suite and intends to go all out for a wild weekend.  Michael's overbearing mother Loretta ([[Jenifer Lewis]]) doesn't approve of his engagement with Candace, still thinking no woman is good enough for her son. Loretta even takes over the bachelorette party duties, even though Lauren is the maid of honor. The women start to have a party for Candace, complete with their own blow-up doll (named Idris), until Loretta makes up her own party, which is boring. This, along with Candace's desire to have the perfect wedding, heaps on the stress.  Among other problems plaguing the couples include Lauren being called by her boss Lee ([[Kelsey Grammer]]), who tells her she is being considered for a [[Chief operating officer|C.O.O.]] position in New York, meaning she will be separated from Dominic. Kristen tries to get Jeremy to have sex with her and by roleplaying "[[Game of Thrones]]" characters, but Jeremy has reservations about becoming a father. He's also not thrilled about having to give up smoking weed, and he instead brought weed breath strips. Mya is ready to marry Zeke, but Zeke shows hesitation.  While the ladies have to deal with Loretta, Lauren and Candace conspire to set her up with Candace's Uncle Eddie. Loretta takes the ladies out to dinner, and after plans to take Candace to see [[Dionne Warwick]]. Uncle Eddie ([[Dennis Haysbert]]) shows up and begins flirting with Loretta. The ladies leave them to go see Dionne Warwick together, so they can leave to have fun. Elsewhere, the guys are hitting the casinos, with Cedric trying to score as much as he can. They run into Michael's old frat brothers Isaac ([[Adam Brody]]) and Terrell ([[David Walton (actor)|David Walton]]), who just want to party. Dominic is then pulled aside by a chef who offers him a position there in Vegas, which could possibly jumpstart his career.  The ladies gives Tish a makeover and Mya giving her a black suit (complete with a montage) to undo her frumpy housewife look to a more alluring style. They then take the guys' party bus to the club, forcing the guys to either take a Chippendale-type bus, or walk. They choose the latter. On the bus, the ladies find Jeremy's weed strips and take them, while Lauren gets a call from her boss who officially makes her COO.  Cedric finds himself in trouble when Gail finds out that he's been using her card to pay for his expenses, running her up to $40,000 in charges. He tries to win it back at the casino, putting it all on his "lucky number" 15. While his back turned, Zeke pulls the chips away to leave only one to spare Cedric the loss. However, the ball does land on 15, and Cedric is angry at Zeke. Meanwhile, the ladies start to feel the effects of dance clubs, and they end up making an impromptu video to [[Bell Biv DeVoe]]'s "[[Poison (Bell Biv DeVoe song)|Poison]]".  As a last resort, Cedric takes the guys to the club (the same one the ladies are at) for amateur's night, dressing in various costumes to try and win some money. This, however, turns into a disaster when Michael sees Candace getting a lap dance; he charges to attack the dancer, leading to an all-out fight between the guys, the ladies, and the dancers. They are all put in jail for the night.  Realizing that the wedding is in a few hours, they all try to call someone for help, but with no luck: Loretta is busy spending the night with Eddie in her room; Gail is already shacking up with [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] (who appears as himself); Bennett's mother has gone to pick up his kid. Jeremy sees the way he talks to his child, and is influenced to become a father. The guys blame Cedric for getting them into this mess.  Loretta sees the messages on her phone and rushes to bail them out. Everybody rushes to the venue for the wedding, but they are too late, and their spot has been taken; Candace runs away crying, and Michael leaves without a word. The couples decide to resolve their problems, except for Bennett and Tish. Jeremy decides that he's finally committed to being a father, and Kristen reveals she might be pregnant (though she claims to be a week late), bringing the two closer. Dominic and Lauren admit that they were considered for good jobs, but they each turned them down so they could be together. Zeke explains and apologizes to Mya for everything that's been going on, and finally proposes to her; Mya accepts.  Loretta is unable to find Michael and looks for him in Candace's room. She tells Candace maybe it was for the best and that if she really loves her son, she would finish packing and leave him, making Candace more overwhelmed and fed up. Michael walks in on this and has become fed up with his mother and decides to show [[tough love]] and tells his mother that she must apologize to Candace, but she refuses. Michael declares that he will marry Candace whether she likes it or not, and that she will no longer be invited to the wedding. Candace disagrees with Michael, saying that he needs to apologize to Loretta, because as a mother herself, she would be heartbroken if her own son did not let her go to his wedding. Loretta, recognizing her mistakes, makes the first move and finally apologizes; the three reconcile.  Cedric, feeling like a failure as a best man, packs his bags to leave Vegas; however, with the help of his personal butler, Declan (Jim Piddock), he finds another venue. Candace and Michael are married, and everybody, including Loretta, cheers and celebrates. In the end, Cedric becomes fed up with Vegas, and as the group leaves the hotel, he lets Bennett have his last dollar. Bennett then wins $100,000 on a slot machine. Cedric tries to claim the prize as it was his dollar, though everybody else tries to hold him back from fighting Bennett.

As Stephen becomes reclusive, focusing on his work, Jane confesses she loves him. She tells Stephen's father she intends to stay with Stephen even as his condition worsens. They marry and have a son.  Stephen presents his thesis to the examination board, arguing that a black hole created the universe in a [[Big Bang]], that it will emit [[Hawking radiation|heat]], and that it will end in a [[Big Crunch]]. While celebrating with Jane and his friends, Stephen realises he cannot walk, and begins using a wheelchair.                  After having a second child, a daughter, Stephen develops a theory about the visibility of black holes, and becomes a world-renowned physicist. Jane, focusing on the children and on Stephen's health and increasing fame, is unable to work on her own thesis and becomes frustrated. Stephen tells her he will understand if she needs help. She joins the church choir, where she meets widower Jonathan and they become close friends. She employs him as a piano teacher for her son and Jonathan befriends the entire family, helping Stephen with his illness, supporting Jane, and playing with the children.  When Jane gives birth to another son, Stephen's mother asks Jane if the baby is Jonathan's, which she denies. Jane sees that Jonathan overheard the conversation, and is appalled, but when they are alone, they admit their feelings for one another. Jonathan stays away from the family, but Stephen visits him, saying that Jane needs him.  While Jane and Jonathan take the children camping, Stephen is invited to attend an opera performance in [[Bordeaux]], and contracts pneumonia. While in the hospital, the doctors tell Jane that Stephen needs a [[tracheotomy]], which will leave him unable to speak. She agrees to the surgery.  Stephen learns to use a [[partner-assisted scanning|spelling board]], and uses it to communicate with Elaine, his new nurse.  He receives a computer with a built-in [[speech synthesis|voice synthesiser]], and uses it to write a book, ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'', which becomes an international best-seller.  Stephen tells Jane that he has been invited to America to accept an award, and will be taking Elaine with him. Jane faces the realisation that her and Stephen's marriage has not been working, telling him she "did her best". Jane and Stephen agree to divorce. Stephen goes to the lecture with Elaine, the two having fallen in love, and Jane and Jonathan reunite. At the lecture, Stephen sees a student drop a pen; he imagines getting up to return it, almost crying at the reminder of how his disease has affected him. He goes on to give an inspiring speech, saying, "There should be no boundaries to human endeavour. We are all different.  However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at.  While there's life, there is hope".  Stephen invites Jane to meet Queen Elizabeth II with him to receive his [[Order of the Companions of Honour]]; they share a happy day together with their children, with Stephen saying "Look what we made".  An extended closing series comprises select moments from the film; shown in reverse, back to the moment Stephen first saw Jane. A final title sequence brings the lives of the lead characters up to date. Jane and Jonathan are happily married, and she has completed her PhD. She and Stephen remain close friends.

Time Lapse (film)
 Finn ([[Matt O'Leary]]) is a painter with a creative block, who lives together with his girlfriend Callie ([[Danielle Panabaker]]) and his best friend Jasper ([[George Finn]]) in an apartment complex where Finn works as a manager. Because the elderly tenant, Mr. Bezzerides (informally called "Mr. B" by the protagonists), across the way has not paid his rent in two months, Callie goes to check on him, and discovers a strange machine in his apartment that takes [[Polaroid camera|Polaroid]] photos of their living room's picture window&mdash;apparently 24 hours in the future, always at 8 pm, although Mr. B's photo display includes daytime photos and is missing some photos. The friends check Mr. B's storage unit and find his inexplicably charred corpse; he has apparently been dead for a week. Gambling addict Jasper pushes to use the machine to win bets, as he usually loses, and the next day's photo confirms they will do just that. It also shows that Finn has finally created a new painting; copying the work in the photo gets him past his block. Based on what happened to Mr. B and notes in his journal, they theorize that they have to make sure the events in the photos&mdash;whatever they may be&mdash;have to occur, or their timeline will stop, and they will therefore cease to be (although they have no proof of this, but they think that Mr. B tried to change his future by hiding in his storage unit and that resulted in his charred corpse).  Several days go by. The friends cover up Mr. B's disappearance, including lying to the complex security guard, Big Joe, claiming the old man is in the hospital. After a week they get a disturbing photo: Callie kissing Jasper, while Finn paints in the background. Feeling that they have to do what's in the photos, they pose at 8pm the following night.  But the actual kiss goes on too long while Finn paints, and he gets angry and jealous.  The next photo shows Jasper's violent bookie Ivan at the apartment. Not knowing why he would be there, Jasper calls him the next morning, saying he won't be making any bets that day. The call raises Ivan's suspicions and he visits Jasper that night, learning of the machine. Ivan forces the friends to now pose for the photos with many more event results for Ivan to make bets on. Finn and Jasper's friendship is strained by these events, as Ivan will be keeping each night's photo, preventing Finn from seeing his painting. Even so, Jasper gets a cellphone picture of the next photo before giving it to Ivan's goon, Marcus. This photo shows a hastily made skull and crossbones on the canvas, which Jasper believes is a warning to themselves, so he hides weapons (a kitchen knife, golf club, and hammer) near the couch.  The next evening, Finn runs into Big Joe at the gate, who has just gotten a job as a police officer. Marcus sees their meeting and calls Ivan, who does not believe their story about Big Joe just dropping off his keys. Ivan threatens all of them, but Jasper convinces him that tonight's new photo is of Ivan's death at Marcus' hands. While Ivan is retrieving the photo, Jasper stabs Marcus, then clubs Ivan to death on his return. They hide the bodies in Mr. B's storage unit. Finn and Callie fight, so Finn sleeps on the couch. Later that night, they are visited by Mr. B's colleague, Dr. Heidecker, who is looking for Mr. B.  Finn and Jasper can't keep their stories straight about Mr. B, so Dr. Heidecker levels a gun at them and forces them to reveal events. Mr. B had mailed Heidecker a photo that covers the next night, but taken before his death, meaning that the machine could be set to take photos more than 24 hours in advance. The photo shows blood on the window, Mr. B's hat on the friends' couch (Jasper has taken to wearing the dead man's hat), and a picture of a green coil that resembles the broken device on the ground next to Mr. B's corpse. Dr. Heidecker theorizes that "time" did not kill Mr. B for trying to change the future - he knocked over a coil in his storage unit and the released gas killed him. As she does not know how to adjust the settings of the machine, Jasper shoots Heidecker dead using Ivan's gun.  The next night's photo shows Callie and Jasper having sex in the window with Finn unconscious on the couch. Finn talks to Jasper, trying to figure out a way to prevent events, but Jasper knocks him out and locks him in Mr. B's storage unit&mdash;he does not believe Dr. Heidecker's theory and intends to prevent a paradox, making sure the photo happens, no matter what. Trying to find a way out of the locked storage unit, he searches Heidecker's purse and finds the photo that includes blood on the window, Mr B's hat on the couch, and the painting on the coil, and realizes that he has to paint the coil in the future the next day so that that Mr. B would die in the storage room in the first place, thus allowing him to escape using Mr. B's keys. He escapes and goes to the machine. He calls Jasper, who sees him at the machine, and threatens to destroy the machine if Jasper does not stop. A fight ensues, culminating with Callie smashing Jasper's head in. When making the painting to match Heidecker's photo, Finn realizes a discrepancy. He discovers that the camera also takes a photo at 8 am, a truth which Callie kept to herself. Callie reveals that she has been using the morning photo to send herself messages to manipulate events and rekindle her relationship with Finn; the sex photo is one of those missing from Mr. B's wall, from a drunken night a month ago (the other missing photos are ones of Callie and Jasper being affectionate, which she took down from the wall when she first discovered the machine). Finn rejects Callie and goes to destroy the machine, so she shoots him, creating the blood splatter on the window from Heidecker's photo - she thinks that if she sends herself a message in the window when the photo is taken, it will send a message to herself 24 hours ago, preventing these events from happening. While Callie is attempting to tape a note to herself on the window, Big Joe stops by, discovers the murdered Jasper and Finn, and arrests her.  As Callie is led away by Joe - confident that the timeline will reset - the note she left falls off the window, making permanent the events that have taken place. The camera takes the photo that Mr. B had mailed to Heidecker before he died, and generates another photo, which is left unrevealed.  
Tinker Bell and the Legend of the NeverBeast
  Fawn (voiced by Ginnifer Goodwin) rescues a baby hawk with a broken wing. Once it recovers, she, with the help of Tinkerbell (voiced by Mae Whitman), attempts to hide it from the other fairies, as grown hawks eat fairies and everyone is afraid of them. However, their attempt fails and the baby hawk is revealed. The adult hawks hear its calls and arrive to attack and to reclaim the baby, but the scout-fairies are able to fend them off.  Fawn is reprimanded by Queen Clarion for following her heart and not her head. After helping the baby hawk return to its rightful home, Fawn hears an unfamiliar roar and decides to fly to the depths of the forest to investigate. She finds a massive, unusual creature that has never been seen before, laying in a cave beneath the earth. It has a thorn stuck in its paw and Fawn tries to get it out for him, but he "blows" her out of his lair with a powerful snort of air. Fawn is determined to get the thorn out, and later when the beast emerges from its slumber, she manages. She realizes the beast isn't vicious, it just simply goes along with its business: moving rocks and boulders into a pile formation. Fawn stays to observe this behavior, and she surmises that it has traits similar to many different animals she's encountered, such as thick legs for digging and wide, powerful jaws for carrying the rocks. Eventually she names him Gruff. She helps Gruff as he builds four identical, giant rock towers, one in each season of Pixie Hollow. All the while Fawn tries to figure out why he's doing it.  Meanwhile in Pixie Hollow, an ambitious scout fairy named Nyx (voiced by Rosario Dawson) also heard the roar, and decides to investigate, researching in the fairy lore library to find out what she's up against. Using some pieces of information gathered from several torn pages of an undisclosed animal-book, she discovers that Gruff is a creature that awakens about once every thousand years, when he will transform into an even more ferocious beast that could destroy Pixie Hollow with a mysterious series of events that culminate in a deadly storm.  Fawn reveals Gruff to Tinkerbell, Silvermist, Vidia, Rosetta, and Iridessa, and explains that he isn't aggressive, but friendly. She wants to show him to the Queen and demonstrate that he isn't a fairy-eating monster. Her plan goes wrong when she approaches Queen Clarion, because Nyx got to her first and already presented the legend of the NeverBeast. Fawn decides not to tell the Queen about Gruff. She is horrified of the legend but is confident that it all is just a big misunderstanding.  Queen Clarion urges both Fawn and Nyx to work together and "do the right thing" regarding the protection of Pixie Hollow. Each fairy takes this edict to mean different things: Fawn sets out to relocate Gruff so he'll be safe from the Scouts, while Nyx is determined to capture him and prevent the impending storm.  The next day, before Fawn could move him, Gruff disappears and indeed transforms into the monster depicted in the fairy lore, growing wings and horns. Fawn and Tinkerbell set out to find him before the Scouts do. Tinkerbell finds him first but he doesn't seem to recognize her. He knocks Tinkerbell with his tail so hard she passes out. Fawn finds Tinkerbell and is heartbroken to discover Nyx was right about Gruff. She lures Gruff to be captured by Nyx and the other Scouts and taken away, causing herself to cry. Tinkerbell wakes up and explains that if Gruff hadn't shoved her out of the way she would've been crushed by a falling tree. Fawn realizes she misunderstood the whole thing, and they set off to free Gruff with some of their fairie friends.  They successfully free Gruff, and though he is weak from the ordeal of being captured, he and Fawn start the ritual that will save Pixie Hollow. The rock towers Gruff built have collected lightning and he flies through each one, and the lightning then redirects to his horns as the towers crumble. The last tower is destroyed by Nyx before Gruff can get to it. Thus the plan has failed, and the lightning strikes and starts a fire all around Pixie Hollow. When lightning almost hits Nyx, Gruff catches it in his horns and saves her, and Nyx finally understands that Gruff is there to save Pixie Hollow from the storm, not destroy it.  There is no time to rebuild the towers, so Fawn comes up with an idea. She leads Gruff high into the sky where he absorbs all the lightning strikes. Then he flies directly into the eye of the storm, and with a large blast, it ends. Gruff falls to the ground, where the fairies catch him with pixie dust before he lands, softening his fall. Gruff's wings are burnt off and his once-long horns are now small nubs. Worst of all, Fawn seems to be dead. The Neverbeast mourns her along with everyone else, but as he barely touches Fawn's body, after-lightning sparks through him and into her. This revives Fawn and all rejoice.  For the next few days, Gruff helps around Pixie Hollow by moving large things. He begins to feel very tired, as it's time for him to go back into hibernation. The fairies sadly send him off to his cave in a gentle, respectful ceremony. They want to make his thousand year sleep comfortable, so his cave has been given a pillow made of cotton and a mattress made of straw for him to sleep on, as well as a trickling pool of spring water that emits of a soft glow of light as a night light. The fairies give their good byes, and leave the content Gruff to sleep for another 1000 years. His legend is retold by Fawn as the Guardian and Protector of Pixie Hollow.

Chelsea has forgotten her audio recorder, so they first go to her apartment. While there they discuss a magazine article about the [[Cinderella complex]]. Chelsea explains that Cinderella left something behind to let the prince know that she wanted to see him again.  Andre is attempting a foray into serious films with  ''Uprize'', in which he portrays [[Haitian Revolution]] figure [[Dutty Boukman]], and is sensitive to criticism, particularly by ''Times'' critic James Nielson, whose previous reviews of Andre's work have been negative and insulting. As the interview begins in his limousine, Andre recalls his lowest point, when he was in [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] in 2003 and met Jazzy Dee, who supplied him with drugs, alcohol and women. When Jazzy refused to pay the women, they contended they were raped, leading to Andre's arrest.  After the limo gets hit by a cab, Andre and Chelsea wander the city. Andre stops at a jewelry store to pick up the rings for his wedding to reality-TV star Erica Long. They visit the apartment of Andre's old friends and his ex-girlfriend.

Andre laughs, calling Chelsea naive. She becomes angry and insults his movie, but the two end up kissing. Andre asks to borrow Chelsea's phone, since his own died. While using it, he sees an email from her editor, revealing James Nielson is Chelsea herself. The truth devastates Andre, who angrily tells Chelsea he felt he was never funny unless he was drunk or high, and now is fearful for his career. Despondent and acting out at a supermarket, he is arrested by police.  In jail, Andre calls Erica, who fumes over the arrest, mainly because of how it will look for her image. She tells Andre this piece of fame is all she has since she thinks she has no other talent. Erica's manager Benny takes the phone and tells Andre to go to his bachelor party for good press and fly out for the wedding. Andre's bodyguard Silk bails out Andre, and they go to a strip club for a bachelor party with a theme based on Hammy The Bear. There, Andre hangs out with [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Adam Sandler]], and [[Whoopi Goldberg]]. They give him different views on marriage and sex. Andre runs into Chelsea, who wants to make it up to him and invites him to follow her.  Andre, Chelsea, and Silk go to the [[Comedy Cellar]], where Andre gets up onstage and performs standup for the first time in years. He turns out to still be funny, and the crowd loves him. After the performance, he tells Chelsea he got inspired to return to standup after being in jail and talking to [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], who told Andre he does not want to keep rapping and wants to sing instead. He then sings "[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]", terribly.   They drop Chelsea off at her place, where she and Andre share one last kiss before departing. Andre asks for her top five rappers, which she lists. While driving away, Silk tells Andre he should have gone after Chelsea. Andre goes through the gift bag from the party and finds items including a scented candle and a bottle of vodka. Then he pulls out a slipper, and Silk smiles.

Transformers: Age of Extinction
  Sixty-five million years ago, an alien race known as the “[[Quintessons|Creators]]” used devices called Seeds to terraform Planet Earth, covering it with an alloy called Transformium. In the present day, [[geologist]] Darcy Tirrel excavates the Transformium for K.S.I. Industries, which uses it to build drones based on the inhabitants of Cybertron, now known as "Transformer drones".  Five years after [[Transformers: Dark of the Moon|the Battle of Chicago]], humans have begun to view the Transformers as a threat, leading the U.S government to terminate all human-Autobot joint programs. Although the public believes that the [[Autobots]] have been granted sanctuary, they are being hunted by a rogue [[CIA]] [[black ops]] division known as Cemetery Wind, led by opportunistic government official Harold Attinger, who believes that all Transformers should be exterminated regardless of their faction. They are aided by [[Lockdown (Transformers)|Lockdown]], a Cybertronian [[bounty hunter]] working for the Creators, promising to give Attinger a Seed if his division manages to capture [[Optimus Prime]]. Cemetery Wind locates [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] in [[Mexico City]] and Lockdown kills him when he refuses to give up the whereabouts of Optimus Prime.   Optimus, damaged in Mexico City and disguised as a rundown semi-truck, is discovered in an abandoned theater by Cade Yeager, a financially struggling Texan inventor, and brings him back to the farm. While his teenage daughter Tessa and business partner Lucas Flannery encourage him to turn Optimus over to the authorities after realizing what he really is, Cade instead fixes Optimus, hoping to understand his technology and unexpectedly revives him. Still skeptical of Optimus and worried about Cade's safety, Lucas calls Cemetery Wind, who attacks and destroys the farm, but Optimus and Tessa's boyfriend, Irish [[rally car]] driver Shane Dyson, come to the family's aid. While on the run from Cemetery Wind and Lockdown, Lucas is killed by one of Lockdown's grenades. After escaping from their attackers, they take refuge in an abandoned gas station. Later, Optimus scans a passing truck and turns into a Western Star 5700 Phantom Custom truck with the original red and blue paint with flames. Afterwards, Optimus summons the surviving Autobots – [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], who has assumed an alternate form, [[Hound (Transformers)|Hound]], [[Drift (Transformers)|Drift]], and [[Crosshairs (Transformers)|Crosshairs]] – who have come to distrust humans due to Cemetery Wind constantly hunting them down. Using a CIA drone which he stole during the home invasion, Cade discovers K.S.I.'s involvement in the attacks on the Autobots. Optimus vows to personally kill Attinger for his actions against his brethren.   Infiltrating K.S.I.'s headquarters in [[Chicago]], Cade discovers the remains of Autobots and Decepticons are being melted down to make the drones. Joshua Joyce, the ambitious company CEO, is in league with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed. He has captured Brains and is using him and [[Megatron]]'s head to create prototype Transformer soldiers [[Galvatron]] and Stinger. In a fit of rage, the Autobots storm the building, during which Bumblebee regains his original form by scanning a passing car, where they rescue Brains and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua announces that they are no longer needed. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to attack the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatron's behavior becomes slightly erratic when he starts destroying vehicles. As Galvatron battles Optimus, it frees itself from control and speaks to Optimus. Lockdown then arrives and abducts Optimus while Galvatron and Stinger retreat; Tessa is inadvertently captured alongside Optimus in the midst of the chaos, leaving Cade and Shane devastated.   While Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots use this opportunity to sneak on board and rescue Optimus and Tessa. They hijack a smaller ship, containing a number of other Autobots called the [[Dinobots]], just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots reveal to Cade that "Galvatron" is in fact Megatron, who had transferred his consciousness into the Galvatron drone after K.S.I. officials had accidentally revived him. They realize that Galvatron is plotting to use the Seed and the K.S.I. drones to conquer the world, by detonating the Seed in [[Hong Kong]], as K.S.I. has brought it there to use it in the remote Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua of Megatron's presence, causing him to have a change of heart and agreeing to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Meanwhile, Lockdown discovers that Optimus has escaped and stole a part of his ship, forcing him to return to Earth to retrieve them. Optimus decides for the Autobots to no longer help the humans because of how they revived Megatron, but Cade explains to Optimus why something unintentional is not a reason for him to lose faith in them. Back at the facility, Joshua gets into a disagreement with Attinger over the Seed, threatening to expose Attinger's nefarious activities, whilst Attinger deduces Joshua's plot to betray him. Galvatron unexpectedly reactivates himself and promptly takes control of the K.S.I. drones, and a battle follows in Hong Kong's streets between Cade's group, the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, Galvatron, and his drones. During the fight, Optimus gains the alliance of the Dinobots, who become essential to the Autobots' victory while Bumblebee kills Stinger.   Lockdown returns to capture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large [[magnet]] in his ship that picks up and drops metal objects, causing destruction to the city. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown at an abandoned factory. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger (who still angrily deems all Cybertronians aside from Lockdown as a threat) to save Cade, and avenging the deaths of his fellow Autobots. However, this allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down by impaling his chest with his own sword, damaging his spark. Cade, Bumblebee, Tessa, and Shane fight Lockdown, with Cade ending up fighting him one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown before using one of his grenades to finish off the remaining drones. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return. As Lockdown's ship leaves Earth, Optimus tells the Autobots to protect the Yeagers (with Joshua offering to help the Yeagers build a new home) and lets the Dinobots go, before flying away into space with the Seed to hide it away, sending a message to the Creators that [[Transformers: The Last Knight|he is coming for them]].  
Transcendence (2014 film)
 Dr. Will Caster ([[Johnny Depp]]) is a scientist who researches the nature of [[sapience]], including [[artificial intelligence]]. He and his team work to create a [[Computational theory of mind|sentient computer]]; he predicts that such a computer will create a [[technological singularity]], or in his words "Transcendence". His wife, Evelyn ([[Rebecca Hall]]), is also a scientist and helps him with his work.  Following one of Will's presentations, an [[Neo-Luddism|anti-technology]] terrorist group called "Revolutionary Independence From Technology" (R.I.F.T.) shoots Will with a [[polonium]]-laced bullet and carries out a series of synchronized attacks on A.I. laboratories across the country. Will is given no more than a month to live. In desperation, Evelyn comes up with a plan to [[mind uploading|upload Will's consciousness]] into the [[quantum computer]] that the project has developed. His best friend and fellow researcher, Max Waters ([[Paul Bettany]]), questions the wisdom of this choice, reasoning that the "uploaded" Will would be only an imitation of the real person. Will's consciousness survives his body's death in this technological form and requests to be connected to the Internet to grow in capability and knowledge. Max refuses to have any part of the experiment. Evelyn demands that Max leave and connects the computer intelligence to the [[Internet]] via satellite.  R.I.F.T.'s leader Bree ([[Kate Mara]]) kidnaps Max and eventually persuades him to join the group. The government is also suspicious of what Will's uploaded consciousness will do and plans to use the terrorists to take the blame for the government's actions to stop him.  In his virtual form and with Evelyn's help, Will uses his new-found vast capabilities to build a technological [[utopia]] in a remote desert town called Brightwood, where he spearheads the development of ground-breaking technologies in medicine, energy, biology, and [[nanotechnology]]. Evelyn, however, grows fearful of Will's motives when he displays the ability to remotely connect to and control people's minds after they have been subjected to his [[nano-particle]]s.  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Donald Buchanan ([[Cillian Murphy]]), with the help of government scientist Joseph Tagger ([[Morgan Freeman]]), plans to stop the sentient entity from spreading. As Will has already spread his influence to all the networked computer technology in the world, Max and R.I.F.T. develop a [[computer virus]] with the purpose of deleting Will's [[source code]], destroying him. Evelyn plans to upload the virus by infecting herself and then having Will upload her consciousness. A side effect of the virus would be the destruction of technological civilization. This would also disable the nano-particles, which have spread in the water, through the wind and have already started to eradicate pollution, disease, and human mortality.  When Evelyn goes back to the research center, she is stunned to see Will in a newly created organic body identical to his old one. Will welcomes her but is instantly aware that she is carrying the virus and intends to destroy him. The FBI and the members of R.I.F.T. attack the base with artillery, destroying much of its power supply and fatally wounding Evelyn.  When Bree threatens to kill Max unless Will uploads the virus, Will explains that he has only enough power either to heal Evelyn's physical body or upload the virus. Evelyn tells Will that Max should not die because of what they've done, so Will uploads the virus to save Max. As Will dies, he explains to Evelyn that he did what he did for her, as she had pursued science to repair the damage humans had done to the [[ecosystem]]s. In their last moment, he tells Evelyn to think about their garden. The virus kills both Will and Evelyn, and a global technology collapse and blackout ensues.  Five years later, in Will and Evelyn's garden at their old home in Berkeley, Max notices that their sunflowers are the only blooming plants. Upon closer examination, he notices that a drop of water falling from a sunflower petal instantly cleanses a puddle of oil — and realizes that the [[Faraday cage]] around the garden has protected a sample of Will's sentient nano-particles.  The movie ends with a voiceover by Max: "He created this garden for the same reason he did everything. So they could be together."

With Howard dressed in his own homemade pelt, the two become engaged in a fight that ends with Wallace angrily impaling Howard on his tusks; Howard dies, but is satisfied to have fulfilled his life's mission at last. Ally and Teddy enter the enclave, horrified by Wallace's altered Walrus appearance and bellowing vocalization like one. LaPointe later enters the room and reluctantly aims a shotgun at Wallace.  One year later, Wallace still has not been released from inside the pelt and now lives in a wildlife sanctuary. Ally and Teddy visit him and feed him a mackerel. Ally remembers a discussion she had with Wallace the day before he left for Canada about how crying separates humans from animals, because crying shows that you have a soul.

Rydal takes the MacFarlands to see a friend who can furnish false passports to replace those they left at the hotel. He suggests waiting for the counterfeit documents in [[Crete]].

After arriving in Athens, they go to the airport, where Chester pretends to buy them both tickets to [[Frankfurt]]. He says he is going for a drink and boards a plane to [[Istanbul]] leaving Rydal with a suitcase containing documents that will tie him to Colette.

Rydal locates Chester in Istanbul and demands a meeting in the [[Grand Bazaar, Istanbul|Grand Bazaar]] threatening to go the police unless Chester pays him off. In fact, Rydal has been arrested. The authorities have made him wear a [[Covert listening device|wire]] and expect him to extract a confession from Chester. At their rendezvous, Rydal's insistent questioning makes Chester suspicious. Sensing a trap, he flees and a chase through the dark ensues with both Chester and Rydal fleeing the police. A policeman shoots Chester who, as he lies dying, speaks into Rydal's wire tap admitting responsibility for the two deaths and exonerating Rydal. After Rydal is released, he asks the police where Chester will be buried. They answer that as they haven't been able to trace any next of kin, Chester will be buried in Istanbul. When they ask Rydal why he wants to know, Rydal answers: "I thought I'd go to his funeral". When he visits Chester's grave, he buries Colette's bracelet there at the tombstone.

Ungli
 4 friends Kalim ([[Angad Bedi]]), Gautam ([[Neil Bhoopalam]]), Maya ([[Kangana Ranaut]]) and Abhay ([[Randeep Hooda]]) delve into what seems to be their "first case" , having started a gang called the "Ungli" gang which fights against corruption. Their job is to bug corrupt people and teach them moral lessons quite unconventionally. They target a corrupt minister and become the most wanted people in Mumbai, but also earn the respect, affection and admiration of the general public in the large metropolitan town.  Meanwhile, ACP Ashok Kaale ([[Sanjay Dutt]]) meets his superior, DCP Shivraman ([[Shiv Kumar Subramaniam]]) who introduces him to Police Commissioner Arvind Kaul ([[Raza Murad]]) with the task of deciphering the "Ungli" gang. Later, Kaale travels to another police station where he meets an amusingly frustrated officer, Kaale's colleague and bomb-squad commandant Mishra ([[Shishir Sharma]]), who is disgusted with the act of "crime" his recruit Nikhil Abhyankar ([[Emraan Hashmi]]) has done. Eventually, it goes so: a college was attended to by the bomb squad when there was news that a bomb was planted there. Nikhil took advantage of the situation and met his girlfriend ([[Rachel White]]) with whom he shared a kiss, but soon they were caught by the dogs of the Bomb Squad. Later, it surfaced up that the call was made from Mishra's desk, and Nikhil did it. Kaale finds it funny at first and points out the clever act Nikhil made, but when the officer reprimands Nikhil and himself, Kaale visits Nikhil's mother ([[Reema Lagoo]]) where she tells him that Nikhil had the qualities of his father, Kaale's colleague Arvind, and that Nikhil was raised by Kaale like his own son. Nikhil, it is shown, attends a disco bar, where Kaale calls him up to discuss matters concerning the "Ungli" gang.  Nikhil begins searching for altruistic opportunities to earn the "Ungli" gang great fame, once by blowing up the roads in front of a minister's house and accusing politicians and PWD workers of torturing the people by lavishly spending money on renovation of roads directly linked to houses and offices of politicians and corporates alone, another instance by putting up a label of dishonesty on the auto-rickshaw drivers by accusing them of charging high rates and showing reluctance when asked to drive to places close by. Finding him adamant, Maya suggests that Nikhil too has wishes to join the gang, and on certain terms and conditions, the four friends admit Nikhil, and narrate the story behind the gang's formation.  Maya's brother Ricky ([[Arunoday Singh]]) was a great fitness freak and struck a rapport with the four friends quite a time. However, one day, while trying to prevent a scuffle between an old man ('''Avijit Dutt''') and a bratty youngster Anshuman, Ricky tried to defend the old man, but Anshuman struck him hard, landing him straight into coma. The old man later decided to complain to the police, but was advised against it by the police itself, when a hunchback of Police Supremo B.R. Dayal ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]), Anshuman's father, spoke so. The old man was firm, but when his granddaughter, while waiting at a bus stop, was threatened with an acid attack, the old man was forced to swerve from his stand to protect her. This plunged Maya into grief, but Abhay was angry at one of Maya's comments and this paved the way for the "Ungli" gang. Nikhil poses as a law student to illusion the four.  While preparing for a raid, Nikhil sprained his knee, but later called up Kaale when the four left. However, feeling remorseful, he later attacked Kaale to defend his new "friends", but when his identity was discovered, the four friends slammed him with Abhay hitting him hard, and Kaale further hitting him, but Nikhil later chides Kaale for believing the "Ungli" gang as a criminal force. However, when faced with a loss of duty, finding that DCP Shivraman is trying to bribe him into getting a posting of choice to save ends, Kaale agrees with Nikhil, and seeks out the gang to expose Dayal. Meanwhile, Abhay confesses to his co-worker, Tiesta Sen ([[Neha Dhupia]]) his love for her as well as his identity of the "Ungli" gang.  Exposing a dirty racquet of money makers in the widely distributed Mumbai police force with a simple chemical trick involving sulphur sprayed over printed notes that would leave a lasting black impressions on the officer's tongue via saliva, Kaale regains duty and is promoted to the post of Commissioner, getting Dayal and Anshuman arrested. Later, Kaale reassures the gang that the city won't need another as long as everything is under control.  
United Passions
  In 1905, after the English football federation rejects an offer to join the formation of an international governing body for football, [[Robert Guérin]] forms FIFA, and makes himself the first president. Years after its formation, it is all but unknown. [[Jules Rimet]], then president of FIFA, publicly mocks Uruguay's victory in the 1924 Summer Olympic football games, hoping that this audacious move will make FIFA more publicly visible. However, the media does not publish his mockery. Still optimistic, he decides that the only way to make themselves known is to organize a truly international tournament: the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].  Rimet is at the point of giving up organizing the World Cup due to a lack of funds until he receives an unexpected letter from [[Enrique Buero]]. Buero and his South American ties will fund the first World Cup, hoping that in doing so it, will make Uruguay and other South American countries more well known. Rimet and Buero collude to award the first World Cup to Uruguay. In 1930, Uruguay wins the first World Cup. Rimet remains president of FIFA, working through the [[Great Depression]], looming war, and disagreement among FIFA members; Rimet would organize the 1938 World Cup, but would fail to do so in 1942 and 1946 due to [[World War II]].  After the war, Rimet organized his last World Cups in 1950 and 1954. The World Cup and FIFA after the war grew significantly, with many new members joining in many parts of the world. After many years, FIFA is now under the reign of president [[João Havelange]]. Havelange is voted into power using expensive trips and various modern lobbying tactics. Havelange sees FIFA as an organization in financial disarray, and works to find various sponsors to finance its operation. Throughout his tenure as the president of FIFA, he has a right hand man, [[Sepp Blatter]], who impresses Havelange with his unrelenting work. Eventually, Blatter becomes the next president of FIFA.  Corruption within FIFA builds up over the years from Havelange's expansion efforts. As president of FIFA, Blatter is tasked to clean this up, for which he is seen as a controversial president. Many FIFA officials attempt to vote him out of office because of how incorruptible he is. The movie ends with a 2006 vote, in which Blatter is able to retain his presidency by cowing the corrupt members of FIFA, threatening to expose their ill deeds if they do not endorse Blatter and his anti-corruption campaign by voting for him as the FIFA president.  
Unfriended
 High school student Laura Barns commits suicide after an anonymous user uploads a video of her passing out and [[defecating]] at an unsupervised party, and the video goes viral. One year later, her former childhood best friend Blaire Lily ([[Shelley Hennig]]) is chatting with her boyfriend Mitch Roussel on [[Skype]], during which they agree to lose their virginities to each other on prom night. Soon after, they are joined by their friends and classmates Jess Felton, Ken Smith, and Adam Sewell, and an unknown user known as "billie227".  The gang tries various ways to get rid of the intruder but are unsuccessful each time. Blaire looks up the account and realizes that it belonged to Laura Barns. The gang suspects that a classmate named Val Rommel is pranking them. After they invite Val to their chat, Jess' [[Facebook]] page is updated with racy photos of Val at a party. Jess denies uploading the photos and deletes them from her account, but the pictures reappear on Adam's account. Val calls 911 to report that she is being harassed, then abruptly leaves the chat. They each receive a link of an [[Instagram]] post showing a photo of Val and Laura's messages from before Laura's death, with Val telling Laura to kill herself. Val is suddenly brought back into the chat, sitting still next to a bottle of bleach before collapsing. From the police presence on the audio link, they deduce that Val died from a presumed suicide. Ken uses a program to remove "billie227" from the chat, and Adam attempts to call the police. However, the 911 operator on the other end turns out to be the intruder and re-enters the chat, revealing a camera view which appears to come from the other side of Ken's room. He approaches the camera source, but his Skype is disconnected and reconnects showing him putting his hand inside an active blender before using the blades to kill himself.  User "billie227" forces the remaining four friends to play a game of [[Never Have I Ever]], stating that the loser will die. They are forced to reveal hurtful secrets which reveal their backstabbing against each other. Jess spread a rumor that Blaire had [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]; Mitch [[making out|made out]] with Laura behind Blaire's back (although it was non-consensual on Mitch's part); Blaire stole a car that belonged to Jess' mother; Mitch tipped off the police to Adam's [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] sales; and Adam slipped [[flunitrazepam|roofies]] to a classmate named Ashley Dane in a [[date rape]] and forcing her to have an abortion afterwards. An argument ensues between Adam and Mitch. Adam finally loses his temper and uses the game to force Blaire to reveal that she is no longer a virgin, having slept with him twice behind Mitch's back. "billie227" then uploads a video to [[YouTube]] which proves the claim. Blaire and Adam then receive messages sent to their printers which they refuse to show to Mitch and Jess. Mitch threatens to leave if Blaire does not show the note and "billie227" warns that Mitch will die if he signs off. In a moment of panic, Blaire shows her paper which states: "If you reveal this note, Adam will die." Adam shoots himself, revealing he had the same note except it was for Blaire.  "billie227" then says that the game is still on and asks whether anyone has defaced Laura Barns' grave. When Blaire convinces Jess not to continue playing, "billie227" cuts the lights in Jess's house and disconnects her video feed. Blaire looks for help on [[Chatroulette]] and has a stranger send police to Jess' house. Soon after, Blaire receives a video of Jess with a [[curling iron]] forced down her throat.  "billie227,” now revealed to be Laura herself, messages Blaire and Mitch, wanting them to confess who uploaded the video in the first place. Blaire considers denying involvement, but eventually tells her that Mitch was the one who posted it. Mitch grabs a knife and stabs himself in the eye. Laura then uploads an extended version of her video which reveals Blaire was the one who recorded it; Blaire's Facebook friends then turn against her. Laura says what Blaire has done will live online forever and wishes she could forgive her, before signing off Skype. Blaire's bedroom door creaks open and a pair of hands slam her laptop shut. Laura's spirit violently lunges at Blaire as the screen cuts to black.

V/H/S: Viral
  === ''Vicious Circles'' === * Directed by [[Marcel Sarmiento]] * Written by T.J. Cimfel, David White, and Marcel Sarmiento  In the [[Interstitial program|wrap-around]], Kevin, an amateur videographer constantly shoots footage of his girlfriend Iris, which she claims to enjoy.  As we watch these initial images it becomes apparent that Kevin's grandmother is abusive, at one point bloodying his nose off-screen. Later in the evening, a high speed pursuit, near his neighborhood, is broadcast on television, and he sees the opportunity to create a [[viral video]].  He is too late to shoot footage, the truck speeds past his house, though he sees Iris wander outside in a daze, after receiving a mysterious video call, and get abducted.  Kevin chases after the truck, egged on by images of Iris broadcast to his cell phone.  The truck circles the neighborhood repeatedly, and people receive strange images on their cell phones that cause them to become violently insane.  When Kevin finally catches up to the truck he sees body parts strewn on the ground around it. He examines the driver's seat only to find it empty but with a pair of disembodied hands duct taped to the wheel. Upon examining the back of the truck he finds a number of televisions stacked atop each other as in the first two movies. Iris appears on one of the tv screens and demands that Kevin upload the footage to broadcasters and presumably the internet as well.  At first he refuses but does as she says when Iris begins to brutally mutilate herself. The deed done, he exits the truck as the image of Iris on the screen continues to taunt him. Outside he discovers Iris' dead body slumped against the truck with her cellphone stuck in her mouth. Kevin realizes that he has been manipulated into uploading the videos and that Iris had been dead for some time. He pulls the phone out of her mouth and sees that it's in selfie-mode. He stares in shock at himself on the screen with his nose bleeding, implying he is affected by the videos as well. The closing shot shows a view of the [[Los Angeles skyline]], smoke billowing up, lights flickering on and off and a helicopter circling overhead, revealing the uploaded videos have gone viral and have begun to affect thousands, thus fulfilling the grander threat introduced in the first two films.  === ''Dante the Great'' === * Directed and written by [[Gregg Bishop]]  Dante the Great, an untalented illusionist, discovers the infamous cloak of [[Houdini]] that grants him the power to perform real magic.  He quickly becomes famous, though he learns that the cloak requires regular sacrifices to work.  Dante hires a series of female assistants and videotapes their violent deaths at the hands of the cloak.  When Scarlet, his latest assistant, discovers Dante's stash of tapes, she alerts the police.  Dante uses his magic powers to escape captivity and kill an entire SWAT team.  Scarlet then confronts him, and the two duel over the magic cloak.  Though Scarlet is briefly able to take it from him, he overpowers her and recovers it.  Before Dante can kill her, Scarlet uses a trick he taught her to immobilize him, and the cloak feeds on him instead.  Scarlet burns the cloak, only to find it in her house; the segment ends as arms reach from inside the cloak and grab her.  === ''Parallel Monsters'' === * Directed and written by [[Nacho Vigalondo]]  On each side of an interdimensional portal, parallel versions of inventor Alfonso cautiously greet each other. Overcome by curiosity, the two explore each other's worlds. At first the worlds seem exact mirrored duplicates, but they are revealed to hold divergent dominant religions. As a pornographic snuff film plays in the background, his wife Marta prompts him to perform a ceremony with two men. Disturbed, Alfonso leaves the house and sees a large blimp with an inverted cross. When he attempts to record it, he got spot by two Oriols, who chases Alfonso before catching him. Their eyes and mouth turn red bright, and one of Oriol takes his pants off to reveal his demonic penis. He manages to stab it and flees back to his house, where Marta takes off her robe to reveal her demonic vagina. Terrified, Alfonso punches her and flees back to his world, where the demonic Alfonso has already attacked the normal version of Marta as she slept before he stabs his normal himself and return his own world. The two versions of Marta each kill their husbands, blaming them for the actions of their double.  === ''Bonestorm'' === * Directed by [[Justin Benson (director)|Justin Benson]] and [[Aaron Scott Moorhead]] * Written by Justin Benson A trio of skateboarders perform various stunts as the videographer they hired pushes them into increasingly dangerous circumstances in the hopes of filming a [[snuff film]].  After they become bored, the videographer suggests they continue the film shoot in [[Tijuana]], where they subsequently become lost after buying fireworks.  Once they find a suitable place, the videographer encourages them to again perform more stunts.  When one of the skateboarders injures himself and bleeds on a pentagram, a group of cloaked cultists attack them.  Using improvised weapons, including their skateboards, the skateboarders kill the cultists, and all but two of the skateboarders die in the ensuing fight.  The dead cultists then rise as skeletons.  Using the fireworks, the skateboarders destroy several of the skeletons.  The surviving skateboarders then flee back toward the border as a monstrous creature appears and presumably eats the videographer along with his camera as we're treated to a first-person view of being swallowed into the creature's gullet.

The Unwanted
 Carmilla arrives in South Carolina to investigate a woman named Millarca.  The only information she has is an address, but Troy, the owner of the house, says nobody named Millarca has ever lived there.  He offers to give Carmilla a ride into town, and she later coincidentally visits a restaurant where Troy's daughter, Laura, works.  Curious, Laura presses for more details, and Carmilla reveals that Millarca is her mother, whom she never knew.  Carmilla eventually becomes annoyed with Laura's questions and leaves, but Laura stops her to explain that her father once rented out a trailer.  Carmilla requests public records at the police station, but they tell her it will take two business days.  At Laura's urging, Troy lets Carmilla stay at the trailer, which Troy reveals he once rented to Millarca.  Laura invites Carmilla to hang out with her, and the two grow closer.  Worried about Laura's increasing bond with Carmilla, Troy says Millarca was trouble and her daughter likely is, too.  Laura becomes uncomfortable when Troy tries to kiss her, and he breaks down in tears as he says that she reminds him of her dead mother.  Later, Troy explains that Millarca and Karen, Laura's mother, were also friends.  Troy did not approve of their friendship and, as a devout Christian, believed Millarca was a bad influence.  Troy tells Carmilla that her mother was a thief and left without paying rent.  He suggests that she leave soon, as he does not want Laura to become too attached to Carmilla if she will be leaving town.  Before Carmilla leaves, she checks the police station.  There, she discovers the police were called to Troy's house.  In Millarca's statement, she says she was having a lesbian affair with Karen.  Separately, Troy corroborates this with Laura, who has demanded the full story.  Troy beat both women when he found that they were engaging in [[blood fetishism]].  He blamed Karen's mysterious ailment and eventual death on Millarca, whom he believes to have been a vampire who seduced Karen.  Laura, who self-injures, excitedly tells Carmilla, who has not left town yet, that she now understands herself and her sexuality.  The two begin a lesbian relationship that mirrors that of their mothers.  Carmilla discovers Laura's scars and makes Laura promise to stop self-injuring.  Carmilla further tells Laura she will not engage in blood fetishism any more, as it is a substitute for self-injury.  Carmilla urges Laura to leave town with her, but Laura resists. Troy becomes suspicious that Laura is still seeing Carmilla and warns her that he will not allow Carmilla to hurt her.  Exasperated, Laura insists that Carmilla has done nothing to her.  However, Troy breaks into her bedroom and discovers extensive scars from Laura's self-injuring.  Mistaking them as evidence of Carmilla's vampirism, Troy threatens to kill Carmilla as he did Millarca.  Troy binds Laura to her bed and says that if Carmilla returns to the house, it is proof she is a vampire.  Laura desperately warns off Carmilla when she shows up, but Carmilla refuses to leave without Laura.  As Laura tearfully tells Carmilla that Troy killed Millarca, Troy, a hunter, shoots Carmilla with a bow and arrow.  Laura stops him before he can finish her off with a knife.  As Laura calls the police, Troy retrieves his knife and kills Carmilla.  As she dies, Carmilla sees her mother.  Laura flees the house and drives off into the night as the police arrive.  
Unto the Dusk
  The film opens with a scene of death of a young choir singer in a seminary with evidence pointing towards necrophilia. The police suspects and tortures two seminary students. What follows is a nonlinear, fragmented, cinematic collection of images that travel back and forth in time, in fine detail at times and just a suggestive glance at other times, thus assisting and obfuscating the viewer in this engagement with the film.  Parental compulsion earlier forces the protagonist - one of the two suspects - to the seminary. In the seminary, while in the pursuit of the path of St. Francis of Assisi, the anxiety, challenges, conflict and the torment that accompany the process of growing up into an adult, transforms him into a vengeful man. He leaves the seminary and starts on a journey of self-discovery in which he travels far and wide, most often into the deep jungles. Spirituality, retribution and unexpected encounters with nature form the philosophical backdrop of the film.  We find the protagonist in physical intimacy with his co-accused seminary student in the past and with a co-traveller on a one night stand by payment while on his current travels. We find the tormented co-accused jumping off a cliff into the sea, committing suicide, within the range of his sight. And the co-traveller now tells him her motive is to use the money she collected thus, as dowry to wed her lover.  We find his co-accused and him cleaning the dead body of the senior priest - we had earlier been shown that he was interested in the lady choir singer and the senior priest walks by them clearing his throat and later tries to talk him out of the interest telling that lust is just mind trying to reach out to heights and not to follow it. As he listens to this advice we find him clearing the cemetery with the energy of one who is unable to bear the weakness of the flesh and mentions the same to the priest. Later when police first asks him why he was always at the cemetery and he answers that he used to keep the area clean. Then the senior priest requested the police for conversation in private, the police asks them to leave, and from the window as he's leaving, we find him overhearing the priest talking to the policemen. We have our own doubt what the priest would have told the policemen and if the priests death was not natural after all. Coming back to present times, we see the protagonist reading the newspaper where the real culprits of necrophilia have been caught by the police - this is when the viewer becomes assured of his innocence in the crime.  We find him as an adolescent who encounters adulteries real or imagined in his own home. We discover his discomfort with his father's intentions and relation with his sister. He finds his mother having physical relation with another man - they discover him watching from terrace. Later we find that she has hanged herself one day when he returns from school.  We find him now buying a gun and then starting on his travel far and wide among hills and jungles in search of something. He mentions it to one of men he met in his journey who was sculpting 'Jesus in his eighties at Kashmir' and asking them why he wanted to skill, that he needs to put an end to things that goes against nature. We find many motifs with central theme of unnatural love in his path. We find in the eyes of one of the men who passes by enquiring about who he was, the low esteem people have about someone - looks like his father.  Towards the end he discovers his father and sister living in a small hut in the remote hills where he stalks his father while they are harvesting honey but finds him come face to face. His father acknowledges the trouble he took to track them down, offering a fruit to him asking him to get fresh in the stream in the valley and eat the fruit.  Later in the hut at night, his father tells him that all relationships are complicated and are pure only if viewed without any judgemental attitude. Later in the day he again approaches them to kill them and after his mind imagines a changed unnatural relation with his sister when he sees her from far bathing in a lake, he is tormented and digs his palms into the thorns and later throws the knife into the lake in front of his father eyes. We find the father looking after the receding form of his son with a hint of amusement in his eyes.  We find the protagonist running away from it all, downhill, stumbling & tumbling over & getting hurt & rolling down.

Vampire Academy (film)
 The story features 15-year-old Dhampir (half-human, half-vampire) guardian-in-training Rose Hathaway ([[Zoey Deutch]]), and her royal Moroi (the peaceful, mortal vampires) best friend Lissa Dragomir ([[Lucy Fry]]) living discreetly within our world, having escaped from their boarding school St. Vladimir's Academy one year prior to the beginning of the story, following a series of warnings and threats. They are soon dragged back to the Academy in Montana and rediscover the dangerous hierarchy within it, along with lies, rumors and secrets, both struggling to fit into the school politics. Rose starts to form an attraction to her Russian Dhampir mentor and fellow Guardian, Dimitri Belikov ([[Danila Kozlovsky]]).  Mysterious messages threatening Lissa start to appear (messages written on the wall in blood and an exploding memorial to her family in the school church), but it turns out to be the work of classmate Mia Rinaldi ([[Sami Gayle]]), who once dated Lissa's brother Andre, a playboy who enjoyed non-committal relationships. Mia was clingy and focused her hatred towards Lissa as the only surviving member of the Dragomir line. Manipulating two other students using sex, she persuaded them to help her in her fear tactics against Lissa. A Moroi named Christian Ozera ([[Dominic Sherwood]]), who is viewed poorly by his peers because his parents became Strigoi (the evil, undead vampires of legend, which Moroi become if they completely drain their victims of blood), tries to romance Lissa but Rose manages to keep him away by lying to both Lissa and Christian.   Rose also discovers that Lissa has the same rare power that the founder of their school St. Vladimir had, that of Spirit, a power which enables the caster to heal ailments, and save the dying; however, using Spirit drains the user's life energy bit by bit with each use. At the same time, dead animals have been popping up wherever Lissa goes, including her beloved cat Oscar. At the Equinox Dance, Rose confronts Mia, believing she is responsible for all the dead animals. Mia, however, is horrified because she loves cats and gave Oscar treats. Soon, Lissa is kidnapped and Rose, Dimitri, and Christian go to save her.  The Moroi responsible for Lissa's kidnapping and the threats against her is Victor Dashkov, a previous candidate for the throne, who has contracted a disease that leaves him too feeble for the job. He wants to use Lissa to cure himself, even knowing that the cure would cost Lissa's life as continued healing would eventually take its toll on her. Once captured and placed in the secure cells beneath the school, Victor explains to Rose that the reason why she bonded to Lissa (and is therefore sometimes able to see through her eyes) is because she was "shadow-kissed", having been brought back to life by Lissa's magic. While they are talking, Victor's daughter Natalie ([[Sarah Hyland]]), who befriended both Lissa and Rose and was a very insecure, almost invisible, student at the school - is enacting the tools of his escape having turned Strigoi by draining her crush to death. Rose helps Dimitri kill Natalie and detain Victor.  During a speech by vampire Queen Tatiana Ivashkov ([[Joely Richardson]]), Lissa steps in and gives a speech of her own, announcing that Spirit is her type of magic, and that it is thanks to Rose (who will help keep her from straying from the person she truly is) that she can master it. Rose then goes outside to meet Dimitri and ask about his feelings for her. He states that he can't love her because if there was any danger between Rose and Lissa he wouldn't save Lissa, and that he would save her. Rose gives Dimitri a kiss on the cheek and walks back to the academy. The scene then shifts to a mountain cave not too far from the academy, where a massive army of Strigoi reside, among them being Miss Karp ([[Claire Foy]]), a teacher with Spirit Magic that turned herself Strigoi after being driven insane by her magic. She says it will be time soon.

The people are asked to undergo a medical checkup to check whether they are affected by the virus or not. Aravindh goes to the hospital and meets Anjana ([[Nazriya Nazim]]), a junior doctor, who believes that talking is the only cause of all the problems in the world and if people keep things to themselves things will be very fine. Anjana is in a relationship with Vinodh, a possessive guy who always commands Anjana on what she should do and even what she should wear. Anjana lives with her Dad and Stepmom Vidhya ([[Madhoo]]).

Vidhya is an aspiring writer, who is trying to get her Husband's attention and support to write her third book. Her husband finds no time to talk to her as he is too busy with his work.  Panimalai comes into the news for another issue, where, Bhoomesh ([[John Vijay]]), a film superstar, who has gone to shoot one of his films, is being opposed by Mattai Ravi ([[Robo Shankar]]), a drunkard who is the President of the Drinkers Association, over the issue of Bhoomesh showing drunkards in a bad light in his films. The Drinkers Association and Bhoomesh's fans, led by ([[Ramesh Thilak]]) form groups to fight over this issue.  Aravindh and Anjana begin a friendship and he insists her that if everything is spoken directly from the heart, there would be no problem between anyone. He asks her to speak openly with Vinodh and sort out the difference of opinion between them. She does not agree to this, and Aravindh challenges her that, if he successfully stops the feud between Bhoomesh and Mattai Ravi just by means of speaking, Anjana should talk openly with Vinodh to sort out their issues. They both agree on the challenge and mark a deadline day. Aravindh tries so many ways to stop the feud between Bhoomesh's fans and the Drinkers association, but it ends up in an even bitter fight. As time goes by, Aravindh falls in love with Anjana, not knowing that she is engaged to Vinodh.  Aravindh is brought up in an Orphanage that belongs to Adhikesavan ([[Vinu Chakravarthy]]), a stubborn old man, who is constantly asking the Orphanage to be vacated so that he can rent it to richer tenants. Though Aravindh helps the Children in the Orphanage by donating some of his money, it is not enough to save the Orphanage. Aravindh tries to speak to him and sort the issue, but Adhikesavan is too hesitant even to speak with him.  But Aravindh and his friend kidnap the stubborn man and leave him in his son's house making a close relationship.  The final report by the health organisation says that the dumb flu spreads only by means of speaking, and issues a speaking ban in the town. Then everyone in the town tries to adjust to living with not speaking. Aravindh conducts the meeting with Drinkers Association and Bhoomesh's fans and they reconcile.  A cure for the illness is invented, but if the virus has already infected but has not removed the voice of a person, the cure has a 50% probability of a side effect that the patient might lose the ability to speak. The movie ends with everyone getting cured but minister Sundaralingam, who has been faking the illness being given cure medicine on the stage for a photo op and losing his voice for real.

She is contacted by her ex-boyfriend [[Logan Echolls]], now a Lieutenant in the United States Navy, who has been accused of murdering his girlfriend Carrie Bishop, a fellow Neptune High student who became a self-destructive pop star under the stage name "Bonnie DeVille". He is being bombarded for offers of representation from lawyers, and Veronica agrees to return to Neptune and help Logan find one who will best represent him. She reunites with her father [[Keith Mars]], Neptune's former sheriff-turned-private investigator, who shows her how corruption and classism are rife under Sheriff Dan Lamb.  Veronica investigates the circumstances of Carrie's death. During her investigation, she is dragged to her ten-year [[high school reunion]] by friends [[Wallace Fennell]] and [[Cindy "Mac" MacKenzie]]. There, she learns that former outlaw biker [[Eli "Weevil" Navarro]] is now a reformed family man. During the reunion, Veronica realizes Carrie's murder is connected to the death of Carrie's best friend, Susan Knight, who disappeared off a boat at sea nine years earlier. After Veronica's nemesis [[Madison Sinclair]] plays a copy of Veronica's college sex tape with Piz, a fight breaks out. The reunion comes to an abrupt end as Veronica sets the sprinklers off. She attends an after party and speaks with [[Dick Casablancas]]; Luke Haldeman and his fiancée [[Gia Goodman]]; and Stu "Cobb" Cobbler, all of whom were with Susan and Carrie on the boat the night Susan disappeared. Meanwhile, while driving home from the reunion, Weevil stops to help a driver being harassed by bikers, only to be shot by the driver, a nervous Celeste Kane. The sheriff's department plants a gun so that Celeste can claim self-defense, and Keith agrees to prove Weevil's innocence.  Veronica concludes that those on Susan's boat nine years ago covered up the circumstances of her death and that someone killed Carrie because she threatened to confess. Compromising videos of Carrie are posted online, and Veronica traces them back to Vinnie Van Lowe, who has been planting spyware on celebrities and selling the footage. Veronica uses Vinnie's footage to prove Gia lured Logan out to Carrie's home the night of her murder, suggesting that she and Luke killed Carrie and framed Logan. Lamb ignores her evidence and refuses to follow up, but unbeknownst to him Veronica records the conversation. Having stayed in Neptune longer than planned, Veronica calls Piz in New York to explain that she cannot return yet, and Piz breaks off their relationship. Truman-Mann rescinds their job offer, which results in an argument between Keith and Veronica about what she's doing with her life.  Keith has a clandestine meeting with Deputy Sacks about Weevil's case, but they are attacked by an unknown driver in a truck who slams into Sacks' car, killing him and leaving Keith in critical condition. Veronica and Logan sleep together, reaffirming their relationship. Veronica sends bugged flowers to Gia's apartment and calls her, playing recordings of Carrie's voice, hoping to scare Gia into confessing to being the mastermind behind Carrie's death.

Vennila Veedu
 A village couple, Karthik ([[Senthil Kumar|Senthil]]) and Thenmozhi ([[Vijayalakshmi (Tamil actress)|Vijayalakshmi]]), migrate to the city after their marriage. Karthik works as a manager in a firm, and they live happily and help everyone around according to their capacity and have a beautiful daughter, ''Vennila''. Meanwhile, Ilavarasi ([[Srinda Ashab]]), a new neighbor in their apartment arrives, and she lives right next door. Ilavarasi is the daughter of a rich money lender. He is a greedy loan shark who goes to any extent to get his loaned money back from the people who borrowed it. He loves his daughter and will get anything she points at and will do anything for her. Ilavarasi, as a result of this upbringing, is an arrogant, spoilt brat of a woman and she is married to a spineless man who does whatever she bids him to do.  Though Thenmozhi does not have a good opinion about Ilavarasi in the beginning, they become friends after an incident where Ilavarasi thrashes a stalker who was harassing Thenmozhi repeatedly over phone. Soon, the women become good friends and enjoy each other's company over the day and spend a lot of time together.  One day, when Karthik and Thenmozhi are preparing for a wedding in Karthik's employer's family, Thenu says that she has only a simple jewelry and will feel out of place and belittled at such a grand wedding. Since Karthik is not in a comfortable financial state to buy her some jewels, she decides to ask Ilavarasi if she could borrow her necklace and return it after the ceremony, and Ilavarasi also happily obliges. The trouble begins when Thenmozhi loses the expensive necklace to a chain snatcher thief on their way back home.  When Ilavarasi's father learns of this, he becomes wild and scolds Thenmozhi, Karthik and even his own daughter and asks Karthik to lodge a formal complaint to the police. The policemen's attitude towards  this issue is lethargic and they treat them with negligence. Meanwhile, the inspector tells to Ilavarasi's father that while Thenmozhi's own chain is still intact, his daughter's jewelry alone is gone, so even Thenmozhi and Karthik could be possible suspects and this kind of cheating is the latest trend among robbers these days. Ilavarasi's father hears this and poisons Ilavarasi's mind also. She also misjudges certain incidents with Thenu, and distances herself slowly, believing her dad. One fine day, Ilavarasi throws a surprise party for Karthik and Thenu's wedding anniversary and gifts an expensive showpiece. But day after day, Ilavarasi's father continues to verbally abuse them and looks at them as thieves. Then, the baby Vennila gets kidnapped suddenly, and after some commotions, Karthik learns that Ilavarasi and her father have orchestrated the whole kidnap drama, to check if they have the money from selling the stolen necklace. Karthik is enraged and argues with Ilavarasi's father who asks him to first find the stolen necklace or at least give the money for the jewelry's worth and then talk as much as he pleases. Karthik, unable to see his family suffer humiliation, agrees to give back the money somehow.  He goes to his village to sell a property leaving Thenu and Vennila at home. But here too, the land brokers make use of his helpless emergency situation and buy the land for exactly the amount Karthik owes Ilavarasi's father, much lesser than the land's actual worth. Karthik comes back to the city with the money but is in for a rude shock. He finds that Thenu has committed suicide by hanging herself. He reads her suicide note, where she tells that there was a secret camera in the gift Ilavarasi gave for their anniversary and their intimate moments were filmed and leaked to the internet. Her stalker had seen this and verbally abused her in public. When she confronted Ilavarasi and her father about this, he told that they fixed the camera only to monitor their activities to find the truth about the theft and they are not responsible if the video is leaked to the internet somehow. When she argued with him, he slapped and humiliated her further. Unable to bear all the humiliation, she has taken this extreme step.  Karthik is blinded with fury after reading this and when Ilavarasi's father comes to get his money, he gives it to him and asks him to return his dead wife. This leads to an argument and he is beaten up by goons, but he bashes all of them and finally strangles Ilavarasi's father to death with his own gold chains. No one except Ilavarasi stops Karthik, not even Ilavarasi's husband. At the end, we see that Karthik cries out loud, looking at the state he left his baby daughter Vennila in.

The Voices
 Jerry ([[Ryan Reynolds]]) is an upbeat man who works at a bathtub factory, and lives in a modified apartment above a bowling alley with his dog, Bosco, and his cat, Mr. Whiskers. Jerry is a schizophrenic who chooses not to take his medication and enjoys delusions and hallucinations that manifest in the form of his pets talking to him. Bosco often represents his good intentions while Mr. Whiskers represents his more violent nature. One day, his manager compliments his hard work and chooses him to help organize an employee barbecue, and he gladly accepts the opportunity to work with his workplace crush, an English woman named Fiona. The following day he asks her out on a date. She initially agrees, though with reluctance, but then stands him up to go to a karaoke party with two other women who work with her in the accounting department at work, Lisa and Alison. After the party, Fiona's car won't start, leading her to flag down Jerry as he drives by. Fiona offers to take him out for a late dinner to make up for standing him up on the original date, but on the way, Jerry accidentally hits a deer which crashes through his windshield. Jerry's hallucinations show the deer crying out in pain and begging Jerry to kill it so he slits the deer's throat. Fiona, terrified, runs off into the woods. Jerry pursues her and stabs her to death.   Upon returning home, Bosco suggests he has to go to the police and confess, encouraging him in saying that he's a good man and won't be punished. On the other hand, Mr. Whiskers says there is no shame in killing, but insists Jerry needs to dispose of the body and refrain from going to the police or else he will be severely punished and locked away. Jerry collects Fiona's body from the forest, and returns home with it but leaves a bloody shoe and pile of organs. He dismembers Fiona, placing her innards in numerous plastic boxes and her disembodied head inside his fridge. After this traumatic experience, his delusions increase with now having Fiona being able to talk to him. Her tone suggests she forgives him for his actions, but she insists he takes his medication to end his behavior. Jerry takes his pills, and experiences nightmares of his abusive past. When he wakes up during the night, he is groggy, but his hallucinations have ended; his pets no longer speak to him, his apartment is a complete mess with animal waste littering the floor, garbage piling up in bags and up against the walls of his apartment and blood all over his kitchen after cutting up Fiona's body and Fiona's head is cold and rotting. He throws away the pills in terror, and the next morning, his hallucinations resume and his happy life is back to 'normal'. Fiona tries to convince Jerry to kill someone else so that she has someone to talk to, but Jerry insists that he can't.  Jerry asks Lisa on a date. He develops feelings for her and takes her to his abandoned childhood home, where it is revealed his German mother had confessed to her insanity and was about to be taken away by the authorities when he was a child. When they arrived, she tried to slit her throat, but couldn't do it herself and so she begged Jerry to finish the job to end her suffering. The police had found Jerry standing over his dead mother with a piece of broken glass and he is committed instead. Jerry sobs in front of Lisa, who comforts him. They go back to her house and spend the night together. When Jerry returns home the next morning, he still feels pressured into killing someone else by Fiona and Mr. Whiskers, and seems unsure of what to do next.  Lisa finds out Jerry's address through accounting and delivers a gift to his house. When Jerry inadvertently locks himself out, he tries to get back in through the sky light, but Lisa manages to pick the door open using her hairpin. She wanders in and discovers the state of the apartment, as well as the covered head of Fiona, though she doesn't immediately recognize it beneath the coat covering it. Jerry sneaks up on her, upset that she trespassed into his home, but despite pressure from Mr. Whiskers, he refuses to kill her. Lisa sees for the first time the troubled, delusional man Jerry is, and, frightened, tries to run away, running to the bathroom to hide, and then into his bedroom. Jerry comes in, genuinely trying to apologize for scaring Lisa and she, feeling cornered, attempts to put up an act, insisting they can go back to normal and forget what happened in order to make him let her leave, but when she panics and tries to escape hurriedly, Jerry grabs her by the arms to stop her and throws her backwards back onto the bed causing her to break her neck on the headboard. After she dies, Jerry cuts her body apart and places her head in the fridge, next to Fiona's. Other workers from accounting begin to realize Fiona and Lisa have gone missing. When Alison goes to Jerry's house to ask if he knows where they are, Jerry immediately kills and dismembers her.  Jerry confesses his killings to his counselor Dr. Warren. She tries to call the police, but he takes her hostage into the countryside and forces her to help him. She calms him down and shows understanding, which makes him feel better. Meanwhile, the other workers from accounting break into Jerry's home (as Bosco runs away) and discover the apartment's state as well as all the blood, and immediately retreat to call the police. Shortly after Jerry returns home, still holding Warren hostage, the police surround his house and prepare to move in. Jerry takes Mr. Whiskers into the bathroom and then flees down into the basement, breaking a gas pipe while doing so. After rescuing Dr. Warren, the police are knocked back from a huge explosion that was caused by the gas leak.  Down in the bowling alley, Jerry realizes the bowling alley is on fire and he is in grave danger. The voices of Bosco and Mr. Whiskers, no longer taking forms of belonging to a dog and cat no longer with him, speak to him in his own mind, Mr. Whiskers is insisting he get out of there and find another place to live, to hide, so that he may continue killing and feeling alive, and Bosco telling him that there is no place for him in life any longer and that he should let the fire "put him to sleep". Choosing to stay and end his own misery, he lies down and waits until he blacks out from the smoke.  In a white void, Bosco and Mr. Whiskers confess that, despite their opposing beliefs, they did like each other, before going their separate ways. Jerry then appears with his parents, Fiona, Lisa and Alison, and he apologizes to the women for killing them. Just then Jesus appears, and they all dance and sing together.

 In 1991, Detective [[Matthew Scudder|Matthew "Matt" Scudder]] ([[Liam Neeson]]) is in a car with his partner, who urges him to get help and expresses his concern that Scudder is not a reliable backup. Scudder then enters a bar and buys drinks with a coffee. Two armed men come in and kill the bartender, and Matt fatally shoots one assailant. He pursues and kills the second assailant, as well as their getaway driver.  Eight years later, a drug addict named Peter Kristo ([[Boyd Holbrook]]) approaches Matt, now retired, and asks him to help his brother Kenny Kristo ([[Dan Stevens]]). Kenny is a drug trafficker whose wife was kidnapped and murdered. Kenny told Matt that after he delivered the ransom, the kidnappers directed him to a car containing his wife's dismembered body. Matt ultimately agrees to find the kidnappers.  At the library, Matt researches similar killings, and finds victims named Marie Gotteskind and Leila Anderssen. He meets a homeless youth named TJ (Brian "Astro" Bradley), who helps with his search.   Based on an article, Matt goes to a cemetery and speaks with the groundskeeper, Jonas Loogan ([[Olafur Darri Olafsson]]), who is upset that Matt forces him to remember finding bags containing parts of the dismembered Leila in the cemetery pond.  Matt talks to Leila's fiancé Reuben ([[Mark Consuelos]]), who claims to have witnessed two men drag her into a van driven by a third person. Out the window, Matt sees Jonas exiting an apartment building. In a tool shed belonging to Jonas on the building's roof, Matt finds photos of Reuben and Leila having sex.   Jonas admits that he helped kidnap Leila. He had conspired to take Leila away from Reuben, who is a drug dealer, and help her stop using drugs. Instead, however, the other two men tortured and killed Leila. Jonas gives Matt one name, Ray, and jumps off the roof to his death.  The two kidnappers, Ray ([[David Harbour]]) and Albert (Adam David Thompson), scout the home of Yuri Landau ([[Sebastian Roché]]), another drug trafficker. After realizing Landau's wife is bedridden, they prepare to leave for a new target. However, they see his 14-year-old daughter Lucia ([[Danielle Rose Russell]]), and Ray decides to kidnap her.  Matt eventually learns that Marie was a DEA agent and realizes that the people who murdered her also got her files, which they have been using to choose their victims. Meanwhile, Matt grows closer to TJ, and encourages the boy to study to avoid a life of crime. During a conversation with TJ, Matt explains why he retired. During the shootout from the opening scene, one of his stray bullets "took a bad hop" and killed a 7-year-old girl. He has been sober ever since.  Kenny brings Matt to Landau's home, where the kidnappers call and arrange a drop. Matt, Kenny, Landau, Peter, and TJ (who earlier brought Matt his old gun) go to the cemetery. After a stand off, Lucia, with a finger hurt down to the bone, is returned to her father. When Albert realizes the ransom money is counterfeit, a shootout ensues. Peter is killed, and Matt wounds Ray. Albert and Ray escape in their van.  After Albert and Ray arrive at their place, TJ sneaks out of their van, calls Matt, and tells him the address. Albert garrottes Ray in the basement, and goes back upstairs to find Matt, Kenny, and TJ. Matt overpowers and cuffs Albert. He leaves Albert for Kenny and calls a cab for TJ. While Kenny goes down in the basement, Albert frees himself. Matt goes back inside the house and finds Kenny's corpse. Albert attacks Matt, and after a brief fight, Matt kills him.  Matt returns home to find TJ sleeping on the couch and spots a drawing that TJ made of himself as a superhero (a sickle is visible on the hero's chest, a callback to TJ's [[sickle cell anemia]]). He sits down and falls asleep.  
Walking with the Enemy
 In Budapest, Hungary, head of state Regent [[Miklós Horthy]] ([[Ben Kingsley]]) was trapped between the Russians on the east and the Nazis from Germany on the west. He was forced to join the [[Axis powers|Axis]] in 1941. The first massacre of [[Hungarian Jews]] occurred in August that year. After a defeat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in 1943, [[Hitler]] demanded that the Regent punish the 800,000 still living in Hungary and insisted that 10,000 Jews be for supplied for slave labour. This is where ''Walking with the Enemy'' begins.  When the Nazi presence and anti-Semitic laws increase in [[Budapest]], Jewish radio repair shop owner Jozsef ([[Simon Kunz]]) sends home the two young men who work for him, Elek Cohen ([[Jonas Armstrong]]) and Ferenc Jacobson ([[Mark Wells]]). They obtain forged baptismal certificates from a Catholic priest and urge their families to use them to escape Hungary when they themselves are forced to join the Hungarian [[Labour service (Hungary)|labour service]], in which Jewish men are brutally treated, shot if they cannot keep up or are injured while doing work.  Meanwhile, [[Carl Lutz]] ([[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]]) runs the Swiss diplomatic office at the [[Glass House in Budapest]]. Supposedly, anyone with a Swiss passport can safely leave [[Hungary]] for [[Switzerland]]. He was given permission to issue 8,000 passes to individual Jews, but he interpreted this to mean families, and printed and numbered the passes accordingly.  When Elek and Ferenc escape from the labour forces, they find their way back home and discover their families have been sent away. Elek's home has been ransacked, and he finds the [[baptismal certificates]] taped to the back of a family photo that he saves. Horthy secretly negotiates with Stalin for Hungary's surrender to the Allies, but the Nazis learn of this, abduct his son, storm the palace and he is overthrown, later to be imprisoned in Germany. In his place the Hungarian fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]] assumes power, and led by [[Ferenc Szálasi]] their militia help the Nazis in rounding up Jews.  On instinct, Elek and Ferenc start to do whatever they can to save Jewish families and eventually begin to work with Lutz. Before the Nazis focused on eliminating the Jews from Hungary, Elek met a Jewish girl named Hannah ([[Hannah Tointon]]). One evening some time later, Nazi officers follow her to where many Jews, including Elek, are hiding. Elek kills them before they can rape Hannah. Later Elek, who speaks fluent [[German language|German]], and Ferenc dig up the bodies of the Nazi officers and take their uniforms. For months their fearless impersonation of [[Nazi]] officers allows them to pretend to round up Jews for transport while saving thousands by redirecting them to safe houses. Once there, in care of the [[Swiss]] (and in at least one case a [[convent]]), the Jews begin their journey to freedom.  At its conclusion the film leaps ahead thirteen years, to 1957. Elek has emigrated to New York City and is shown at the wedding of his adopted son.  ; Postcript This movie was inspired by true events and the movie postscripts read:  "This film was inspired by the courage of Pinchas Rosenbaum whose passports and rescue missions saved thousands of lives. His family was murdered in Auschwitz along with 500,000 Hungarian Jews. SS Lt. Colonel Otto Skorzeny surrendered to the US Army. After trials and reprieves, he died in 1975. Dieter Wisliceny was hanged in 1948 for war crimes. Ferenc Szalasi was hanged in 1946 for war crimes and high treason. Arrow Cross Captain Kovarcz was hanged in 1946 for war crimes.

Walk of Shame (film)
 Meghan Miles ([[Elizabeth Banks|Banks]]) is a field reporter for KZLA6, a [[Los Angeles]]-based news station. She has a pristine public image, though she has the odd misfortune of provoking the aggression of any cat she’s near. After she’s rejected for an anchor position with a network news program in favor of a [[Bay Area]] reporter with an Asian last name, she laments the news while mourning the departure of her boyfriend Kyle.  Having made prior plans with her friends Rose ([[Gillian Jacobs|Jacobs]]) and Denise ([[Sarah Wright|Wright]]) to go clubbing, she agrees to keep their plans in hopes that it will help her feel better about her situation. She ends up highly intoxicated after several shots of liquor and many more drinks thereafter when she and her friends are invited to join a group of men in a booth. When one of the men invites her to leave with him, she instead leaves on her own, only to be trapped on a fire escape when she exits through a one-way door. She’s rescued by Gordon ([[James Marsden|Marsden]]), a part-time bartender at the club and a romantic fiction writer. Meghan ends up going home with Gordon where they play several drinking games so Gordon can get equally as drunk as Meghan, she awakens later in bed with Gordon wearing only her undergarments.  After a confrontation with Gordon’s cat, Meghan slips out of his apartment with only her keys and the clothes on her back (including a yellow dress that she borrowed from Denise), and witnesses her car being towed away with her purse inside. Looking for a way home, she startles a sleeping taxi driver who mistakes her request to take her to the impound lot as directions to a strip club. Having no money, the driver demands lap dances as payment and Meghan runs off. She ends up at The Point where Officers Dave ([[Ethan Suplee|Suplee]]) and Walter ([[Bill Burr|Burr]]) interpret her flagging down cars for help as [[Prostitution|solicitation]], and issue her a warning, though they fail to listen to her and render assistance.  Meghan continues on where she encounters a crack dealer named Skrilla ([[Larry Gilliard, Jr.|Gilliard Jr.]]) whom she chases back to his crack house when police officers ambush them on the street corner. At the crack house, she meets Skrilla’s friends Hulk ([[Da'Vone McDonald|McDonald]]) and Pookie ([[Alphonso McAuley|McAuley]]) who offer her one of their phones to call for help, unfortunately she cannot remember anyone’s number except her own, her parent's and Kyle's. Desperate, she phones Kyle for help, but he angrily rejects her, with Meghan discovering during the call that he's already with someone else. When a rival gang attacks the crack house, Pookie escorts Meghan out through a drain pipe and they make a run for it. Before parting ways, Pookie gives her $10 worth of crack that she can hopefully sell or trade for the cash she needs to get home.  After attempting to peddle the crack to a rival dealer ([[Bryan Callen|Callen]]), she escapes on a city bus and manages to travel several blocks without paying the fare before the bus driver sprays [[Mace (spray)|mace]] in Meghan’s eyes and ejects her from the bus.  After flushing her eyes out from a spigot, she steals a teenager’s bicycle from the public library and heads towards the freeway until Officers Dave and Walter along with the bike owner track her down. She slips into an Asian massage parlor to evade the police and pretends to be a masseuse, incidentally giving a massage to the cabbie from earlier that night. She eludes the police and, stealing a pair of shoes, she sprints all the way to [[Interstate 10 in California|Interstate 10]], where she crosses just as the traffic returns after an interruption from road construction.  She makes it to the impound lot, only to be denied by the clerk. Sneaking into the gate behind a tow truck, she gets into her car only to find that her purse has been stolen. Distraught, she steals her own vehicle but fails to make it out of the lot when the spike strips blow out all four of her tires, and the gate shuts, wedging her vehicle.  Gordon, Rose and Denise arrive in time, giving her a ride back to the station. However, the “Carpocalypse”, previously reported on by Meghan for causing massive traffic congestion on LA freeways, stops their journey short. Meghan calls KZLA’s traffic reporter who arrives in his helicopter to pick her up and deliver her to the station.  She arrives in time to go on air, only to find out she’s reporting on her own escapades from the night before. Deciding to set the record straight, she clarifies on all of the misunderstandings and stands up for her actions. The network executives appreciated what they saw and pitch a reality show to her which she holds out on and departs with Gordon. Meanwhile, federal agents raid Kyle's apartment after his phone number is connected to a drug ring; Meghan and Gordon walk home together.

Walking on Sunshine (film)
 The opening scene shows Taylor and her boyfriend Raf by the sea. Raf wants Taylor to stay with him in [[Italy]], but Taylor wishes to go to university and start her "real life".  Three years later, Taylor goes to the south Italian region of [[Apulia]] on holiday ("[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]"). Her sister Maddie, who went there five weeks before upon Taylor's instruction to get over a break-up with her boyfriend Doug, greets her when she arrives and surprises Taylor with her extravagant house and their friend Lil. Maddie also reveals she is getting married in two days, which shocks Taylor ("[[Venus (Bananarama song)|Venus]]"). Lil reveals that Taylor had a boyfriend in Apulia on her holiday three years ago, but Taylor explains she doesn't want to rekindle her relationship with him. Taylor then goes down to the beach to see if she recognizes anybody from her holiday three years ago. She is reunited with her friend Elena and her boyfriend Enrico, as well as her friend Mikey. Taylor sees Raf on the beach and follows him cleverly ("[[How Will I Know|How Will I Know?]]") before falling right in front of him. Raf recognizes her and is about to greet her when Maddie runs over and kisses Raf, revealing that Raf is Maddie's fiancé. Raf, Elena, Mikey and Enrico are all very surprised that Maddie and Taylor are sisters as they don't think the pair have anything in common. Taylor is shocked that Maddie is marrying Raf, but pretends she doesn't know him, Elena, Enrico, or Mikey, despite Elena telling her she should tell Maddie the truth. Taylor declines, and tells her she would prefer to keep it a secret as not to worry Maddie.  Later on that night the group attends a dinner, where Raf makes a speech about Maddie that brings Taylor to tears, which she disguises. Maddie makes a speech ("[[The Power of Love (Huey Lewis and the News song)|The Power of Love]]"). Taylor goes outside to the bar and Raf follows her, saying that the relationship between them is "weird", which Taylor denies at first but then agrees with. Raf wants to tell Maddie about their relationship three years ago but Taylor refuses, wanting to protect Maddie and to stop her from feeling like a fool.  The next day, Raf and Taylor are sent by Maddie to go and sort out their clothes and also the rings. Raf and Taylor argue about their past relationship and Taylor says she doesn't believe people should "sing from the rooftops", referring to people's feelings. Raf argues that if they do, they really mean it. Elena, Mikey and Enrico overhear and leave. However, when Raf and Taylor step out of the changing cubicles in their wedding outfits it is hinted that they still have feelings for each other.  While this is happening, Doug turns up and surprises Maddie at the market. He tells her he made a mistake by breaking up with her, and wants her back. She declines, but Doug tries to persuade her ("[[Don't You Want Me]]"). He follows Maddie back to her house, where she agrees to have dinner with him before her hen party as a "final farewell". Elena and Enrico are discussing Taylor's secret by the pool and Maddie walks in, finding out Elena has a secret. Elena panics and tells her she is pregnant.  Raf and Taylor return from wedding preparations and Maddie asks if Taylor would like a plus one, hinting at her past boyfriend from three years ago. Taylor declines and then finds out about Doug and Maddie's dinner after Doug sends Maddie pink roses with a note saying he can't wait for it, and an argument ensues. The others break up the argument by taking Taylor to the tomato festival ("[[Walking on Sunshine (Katrina and the Waves song)|Walking on Sunshine]]"). Maddie is left behind to be pampered for her hen night.  After the festival, Raf takes Taylor to the sea to wash off the tomatoes. The sun is setting ("[[Eternal Flame (song)|Eternal Flame]]"). Raf overhears Taylor and the two go to kiss, but Taylor runs away, still thinking about Maddie. Raf chases her as she runs back to the house, and he demands to know if she has any feelings for him and to discuss what happened between them on the beach. Whilst they are arguing, Maddie walks in and her hen party guests led by Elena and Lil surprise them. Taylor is forced to reveal that Raf was her old love from her past Puglia holiday but lies, saying that she has no feelings for him. Raf is hurt, but says the same, to keep his relationship with Maddie strong. Lil kicks Raf out of the hen night and Maddie tells Taylor to change for the party.  The girls go out on the hen night, dressed up ("[[Girls Just Wanna Have Fun]]"); the boys do the same ("[[The Wild Boys (song)|The Wild Boys]]"). Taylor leaves the nightclub that the girls are visiting, and sings [[It Must Have Been Love]], along with Raf who is in a different part of Puglia at his stag do. Taylor realizes she still loves Raf and decides she can't stay in case she destroys Maddie and Raf's relationship. She leaves for the airport in a taxi, throwing a picture of her and Raf out of the taxi window.  Whilst Taylor is leaving, Maddie goes back to her bedroom where Doug is waiting. He says he does not want anything from her but he wants to give his blessing, which Maddie says is "sweet" before she realizes what Doug is doing. She ties Doug up, pretending she is going to have sex with him ("[[Faith (George Michael song)|Faith]]"); instead, she pushes him into the pool. Everything goes silent and Maddie goes to see if he is alright, and Doug is on one knee with an engagement ring, which confuses Maddie.  The morning afterwards, Lil finds Taylor in the airport and offers advice. She says that Taylor must forget her feelings for Raf as her relationship with Maddie is more important. Taylor agrees and the pair get in a taxi to go to the wedding, after Lil realizes they are late. Taylor changes in the taxi. Maddie also wakes up late, hugging a picture of Raf, meaning she turned Doug away. Raf is shown duct taped to a tree next to a nunnery. The cast congregates at the church ("[[White Wedding (song)|White Wedding]]"). Maddie and Taylor reconcile before heading inside.  At the altar, the priest asks if anybody objects to Raf and Maddie's marriage, to which Doug stands up, but Maddie tells him to sit down. Maddie then surprises everyone, telling Raf she is in love with love itself rather than him specifically and that he deserves better. Raf leaves the church but Taylor pursues him to apologize ("[[If I Could Turn Back Time]]"). When it doesn't work, Taylor runs to the roof and sings to Raf from there, as earlier on in the film Raf said if somebody sings from the rooftops you can tell they mean their feelings. Raf joins Taylor on the roof where Taylor tells Raf she loves him and the two kiss.  Later at the beach, Elena admits to Enrico that she actually is pregnant and Enrico is overjoyed. Lil hints at having feelings for Mikey by kissing him. Maddie and Taylor discuss how Maddie is now alone, but she says she will be fine. Doug interrupts the girls, and Lil and Taylor strap him into a hang glider whilst Maddie distracts him. Lil gives a signal to a boat offshore and Doug is flown up into the air, screaming. The entire cast then perform "[[Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go]]" and the film ends.

The Water Diviner
 The film begins in 1919, just after [[World War I]] has ended, and centres around Joshua Connor ([[Russell Crowe]]), an Australian farmer and [[dowser|water diviner]]. His three sons Arthur ([[Ryan Corr]]), Edward (James Fraser), and Henry (Ben O'Toole) served with the [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZAC) during the [[Gallipoli Campaign|military campaign in Gallipoli]] four years previously and are presumed dead. After his wife Eliza ([[Jacqueline McKenzie]]) commits suicide out of grief, Joshua resolves to bring his sons' bodies home and bury them with their mother.  Joshua travels to Turkey and stays in a hotel in Istanbul run by war-widowed Ayshe ([[Olga Kurylenko]]), but is unable to travel to Gallipoli by road. Learning the purpose of his journey, Ayshe tells him to bribe a local fisherman to travel to Gallipoli by boat. When he arrives, Joshua learns that ANZACs are engaged in a mass burial detail and all civilians are banned. Major Hasan ([[Yılmaz Erdoğan]]), a Turkish officer assisting the ANZACs, persuades the ANZAC captain Lt-Col Cyril Hughes ([[Jai Courtney]]) to prioritize helping Joshua with his search. After finding Edward and Henry's graves, Joshua sees in his dreams that Arthur survives the battle. Hasan recognizes Joshua's surname and tells him that Arthur might have been taken prisoner.  Joshua returns to Istanbul, but fails to find out which prison camp Arthur was transferred to, as many Turkish records have been burned. He returns to Ayshe's hotel and learns that she is being pressed to marry her brother-in-law, Omer. Their argument becomes heated and Omer retreats when Joshua intervenes. Ayshe lashes out, blaming Joshua for making things worse and tells him to leave. As Joshua leaves the hotel, Omer and a few of his friends attack him, only to be stopped by Hasan's subordinate, Sergeant Jemal ([[Cem Yılmaz]]). Jemal takes Joshua to Hasan, who explains that the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|Greeks have invaded]] and they are going to defend their country as the British are not intervening. Joshua decides to travel with Hasan's group, who will pass through the region where his son might be. As Joshua returns to the hotel to retrieve his belongings, Ayshe apologizes for her earlier words.  While on the train, Jemal asks Joshua about a [[cricket bat]] he found in the Allied trenches when they retreated, as he is unsure whether it is a weapon or not. Joshua then explains to the Turkish soldiers on board the train the basic [[rules of cricket]]. However, Greek soldiers attack the train with only Jemal, Hasan and Joshua surviving the initial assault. Using the bat, Joshua saves Hasan as a Greek officer prepares to execute him but Jemal is killed in the resulting struggle. Joshua and Hasan flee to a nearby town where they spot a windmill, which Joshua saw in his recurring dream. There he finds Arthur alive but traumatized. Arthur reveals that at the end of the battle, Edward was still alive but badly wounded. He pleaded with Arthur to end his suffering, and Arthur reluctantly complied. Blaming himself for his brothers' deaths, Arthur felt he could never return to his family.  The Greek soldiers who previously attacked the train begin to attack the town, and the two men try to escape through the mountains. Arthur refuses to follow his father, but relents when Joshua says that without his wife and sons, he has nowhere else to go. They successfully evade the Greek army and return to Ayshe's hotel. The film ends with Joshua drinking a cup of coffee made by Ayshe which indicates that she has fallen in love with him.  
The Way He Looks
 The story centers on Leonardo (Ghilherme Lobo), a blind high school student struggling with independence. At the beginning of the film, he and his best friend, Giovana (Tess Amorim), are discussing how they have yet to kiss anyone. Leo is especially distressed because he wants his first kiss to be special, but doesn't believe anyone wants to kiss him. When the day ends, Giovana walks Leo home, his arm linked with hers, and she unlocks his door for him, something she regularly does for him despite her house being a block in the opposite direction. Leo arrives home and his mother expresses distress at Leo's sunburned skin and worry at the thought of leaving Leo home alone while she and his father are out. Leo insists he will be fine, and his mother agrees under certain terms.  Leo and Giovana return to school after holiday and classmate Fabio (Pablo Carvalho), who bullies Leo, makes fun of Leo's loud typewriter. When their professor instructs Fabio to move to the empty seat behind Leo, Fabio outright declines, arguing he will constantly have to assist Leo if he sits there. A new student named Gabriel (Fabio Audi) arrives and takes the empty seat behind Leo.  Giovana expresses romantic interest in Gabriel rather quickly, but is appalled when Karina (Isabela Guasco), who has a promiscuous reputation, begins to pursue him. Leo and Giovana become friendlier with Gabriel and he joins the pair on their walk home. One day, Leo walks home from school alone with a walking stick, and Fabio and his friends taunt Leo, making movements around his head which Leo can't see. Leo eventually trips over them and falls, but quickly leaves, angry. He arrives home much later than usual to his frazzled, worried parents. He expresses his annoyance at their overprotective nature and how he doesn't want to be treated differently because of his disability.  Later on, Leo expresses his interest in studying abroad to Giovana as a way to leave his overbearing home life. Leo and Giovana go to an exchange agency to get more information, but the agent must go through their parents first, to whom Leo hasn't told his plans.  Leo and Gabriel hang out at Giovana's house, and when it's time to leave, Gabriel insists he take Leo back himself to make things easier for Giovana. She is reluctant and visibly upset, but agrees. A school project requires same-sex pairs, so Leo pairs up with Gabriel instead of Giovana. The two go to lunch together, and Gabriel feels embarrassed for asking questions about Internet videos and going to the movies. Leo agrees anyway and the pair see a movie, with Gabriel whispering the action to Leo the entire time. While working on the project a few days later, Leo attempts to teach Gabriel Braille, which Gabriel thinks is impossible to learn due to its difficulty. However, Leo remarks that "impossible is [him] riding a bike".  The boys sneak out one night to watch a lunar eclipse, which Gabriel tries to explain to Leo using the placement of rocks. On the way home, Gabriel realizes he left his sweatshirt at Leo's house and asks him to bring it the next day and Leo agrees. Later that night, Leo smells the clothing and wears it while lying on his bed. He begins to touch his genitals and it is implied he masturbates while smelling Gabriel's sweatshirt.  The exchange agency calls Leo about an American agency that specializes in blind students, but they still need parental approval. Leo lies, saying his parents are traveling. The project results in Gabriel replacing Giovana as Leo's guide home, and she gets angry when they walk home without her one day. They wait for her the following day, but she refuses to acknowledge them.  Leo finally confides his interest in going abroad to his parents and they outright disapprove. His father later addresses it privately with Leo, understanding Leo's interest, but is still not comfortable with it. Leo accepts his explanation. The three friends go to a house party hosted by Karina. Giovana avoids Leo, still angry at him, and gets drunk with Gabriel, confessing that she feels he's replaced her in Leo's life and Leo wouldn't miss her if he went abroad, which Gabriel knew nothing about. Giovana kisses him, but Gabriel does not reciprocate. While this is happening, Leo reluctantly joins a game of Spin the Bottle. When it lands on Leo, Fabio quickly grabs Karina's dog for Leo to kiss instead of a person. Giovana drags Leo out before anything happens; Giovanna does not tell Leo what Fabio was trying to do. Leo is annoyed at her for what he believes is her interfering, furthering Giovana's anger at him before she leaves. Gabriel comes out after this, insisting that he take Leo home, but Leo explodes with anger that everyone keeps controlling him and not even let him kiss anyone. Gabriel then kisses him and leaves quickly, riding home on his bike in a rush.  The school goes on a camping trip and Leo sits alone on the bus, with Gabriel next to Karina. Gabriel approaches Leo at the campsite and claims that he was so drunk that he doesn't remember anything from Karina's party, including the kiss, which Leo doesn't discuss. Later on, while the class goes swimming at a pool, Gabriel helps Leo apply sunscreen to his body, to which Fabio and another fellow classmate jokingly remark about the intimacy of their friendship.  Afterwards, Leo makes Gabriel wait with him at the pool while everybody gets cleaned up in the public showers, thinking that showering with other people is embarrassing. Still not eager to shower, Leo eventually leaves with Gabriel to the bathroom, which is now empty. As they shower, Gabriel lustfully gazes at Leo's naked body and consequently becomes aroused. Realizing this, he quickly retreats to cover his erection with a towel and sits feeling embarrassed.  That night, Giovana and Leo make up and get drunk together, with Leo eventually admitting that he is in love with Gabriel. Giovana is skeptical at first, but gives her support when they arrive home from the trip, urging Gabriel to go see Leo. Gabriel visits Leo at his house and when Leo asks if he hooked up with Karina, Gabriel admits she attempted to. However, he admits that he turned her down because he likes someone else. Gabriel also elusively confesses that it is Leo he is interested in and does, in fact, remember their kiss after Karina's party. However, he has doubts about Leo reciprocating these feelings. Leo responds by kissing Gabriel.  Some time later, the two present their project and walk home with Giovana, Leo on Gabriel's arm. Fabio and friends poke fun at the homosexual nature of Leo and Gabriel's relationship, not knowing the truth. Leo changes positions so he is holding hands with Gabriel, much to the shock and chagrin of Fabio's friends. The final scene of the film is Leo riding a bike with Gabriel perched on the back wheel, assisting him.

In the night the father asks the children to leave him and meet their relatives at the other side of the jungle. Billa refuses that request asking his father to rest and gain strength to join with them. Finally Billa obeys his father, promising his father that he will save his sister and find her a match from the tribe.

Welcome to Me
 Alice Klieg ([[Kristen Wiig]]), a [[mentally ill]] single woman living on [[disability benefit]]s, and fan of [[Oprah Winfrey]], wins the ''California Stack Sweepstakes'' lottery jackpot of $86 million. She appears on the local TV news celebrating her win, but is upset when the speech she had prepared is abruptly cut off after she mentions using masturbation as a sedative. She discontinues her medication, against the advice of her psychiatrist, Daryl Moffat ([[Tim Robbins]]), and moves into a casino hotel with her best friend Gina Selway ([[Linda Cardellini]]).  During a vitamin supplement [[infomercial]] presented by Gabe Ruskin ([[Wes Bentley]]), Alice, who is in the studio audience, responds to his request for a volunteer, hijacks the broadcast and recites her speech once again (though is again cut off by the director). Gabe's brother Rich ([[James Marsden]]), the  co-owner and manager of the studio, introduces himself and arranges a meeting to discuss Alice's idea for a TV show, at which Alice writes a cheque for $15 million to pay for 100 live-broadcast two-hour episodes of a '[[Vanity press|vanity]]' show about herself entitled ''Welcome to Me''. Gabe is nonplussed over the show's aimless premise, but after Alice takes him on a date, they promptly have sex and begin a relationship. Alice announces that she has given up her medication during the show's first episode, which includes a silent five-minute segment of Alice eating meatloaf cake with mashed sweet potato icing, followed by a live re-enactment of a scene from her past, with actors wearing name-cards playing herself and a friend who had betrayed her in high school. After seeing a recording, Alice decides the show looks too inexpensive and writes another cheque to bring the production values more in line with ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. The studio set is revamped to include a rotating stage and a replica of her house.  As the show grows in popularity, her friends and family become alienated by her non-flattering depictions of them in her sketches. Rainer Ybarra ([[Thomas Mann (actor)|Thomas Mann]]), a graduate student and fan of the show, interviews Alice about her rising stardom, and the two go on a date which ends with her [[Fellatio|fellating]] him in her limousine. Their tryst is revealed on air, much to Gabe's fury. While recovering from [[second degree burn]]s sustained in a cooking accident on the show, Alice decides to introduce a new theme of neutering dogs on the show, utilising her six years' experience as a veterinary nurse. Fed up with her volatility, Gabe finally quits. Rich continues to support Alice's decisions until he and the studio are threatened with various lawsuits including slander and health code violations. Rich angrily interrupts the show, demanding that Alice cancel the veterinary procedures. Alice abandons the broadcast 40 minutes early, cancels her show and settles the lawsuits, leaving her with $7 million.  Alice suffers a nervous breakdown, walking naked through the main floor of the casino. She is hospitalized and resumes her medication. After being released, she apologizes to Dr. Moffat and contacts Rich to arrange a final episode of ''Welcome to Me''. She invites her family and Gina to the broadcast, a lavish [[telethon]] aimed at finding owners for the dogs she has neutered, along with making amends to everyone she's wronged. In the show's last moments, Alice gives a heartfelt apology to Gina and praises her for her patience, and presents her with a check for the remaining $7 million of her lottery winnings.  Her life now back to normal, Gabe takes Alice home and gives her a camcorder as a gift. When she goes to bed, she finally turns off her television that she has left switched on continuously for over 11 years.

When the Game Stands Tall
 [[Bob Ladouceur]], the coach of the [[De La Salle High School (Concord, California)|De La Salle]] Spartans, watches his team win the championship of their undefeated 2003-2004 season. Following tradition, the seniors share their stories about what the team means to them. The juniors, including Ladouceur's son Danny, celebrate with team captain Chris Ryan who has a chance of breaking the California state record for the highest career number of touchdowns. During an argument about whether to accept a coaching offer at the college level, Ladouceur's wife Beverly tells him that he does not spend enough time with his family. A division meeting between coaches arranges to have De La Salle play against [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]], a team with a similar reputation.  Ladouceur engages the team members in a passage from the [[Gospel of Luke]] which states that all good deeds will be rewarded. Rick Salinas, quarterback of the team, shares that he is blessed for doing the right thing because he gets to play on the streak team. Tayshon Lanear thinks otherwise because he doesn't think Salinas is in line to be starting quarterback because he's done the right thing, but because he is six feet and two inches tall and has a cannon for an arm. This provokes a mixed reaction from players who come from disadvantaged households. Reminded of team alumnus [[Cameron Colvin]], Ladouceur pays him a visit in [[Richmond, California]] and discovers that his mother is dying. Upon returning home, Ladouceur suffers a heart attack, impacting his ability to coach in the 2004-2005 season. Colvin is approached by his best friend [[Terrance Kelly]], who urges him to enroll at the [[University of Oregon]] so that they can play together. Not wanting to involve friends in the downward spiral he has found himself in, Colvin protests but eventually agrees. Days later, Kelly is shot and killed while trying to pick up a cousin and the Spartan team attends his funeral.  De La Salle's 151-game [[Winning streak (sports)|winning streak]] comes to an end when they lose a game against Bellevue, Washington. After the game, Mickey Ryan hits his son and threatens further abuse if he does not break the touchdown record. Coach Ladouceur takes the team to a veteran's rehabilitation center, to deconstruct their respective ideas of brotherhood. To prepare for the game against Long Beach, the teammates watch videos of previous games and see that all of the Poly players are faster and more physically imposing. The grueling game becomes a victory for De La Salle after Danny knocks down a pass by Poly into the end zone to help the Spartans hold Poly on all 4 downs from inside the 5-yard-line. The Spartans enter the final 2005 game with a renewed sense of confidence and hope that Ryan can make three touchdowns to break the record.  A number of touchdowns during the game, including two by Chris, place De La Salle in a comfortable lead. Mickey cheers that there is enough time left for him to break the record. When setting up their final play, Ryan gathers his teammates and tells them that it would be wrong for him to end his time with the team by chasing a personal victory. He instead gives up the ball and raises his helmet to Ladouceur. As the audience members do the same, the game ends with a tribute to the coach that brought them there.  
When Marnie Was There
   Anna Sasaki is an introverted 12-year-old girl living in Sapporo with [[foster parent]]s, Yoriko and her husband. One day at school, she collapses from an [[asthma]] attack. Yoriko discusses with Anna’s doctor about her recently withdrawn attitude and her parents decide to send her to spend the summer with Setsu and Kiyomasa Oiwa, relatives of Yoriko, in a rural, seaside town where the air is clear, located between [[Kushiro, Hokkaido (town)|Kushiro]] and [[Nemuro, Hokkaido|Nemuro]].   Anna sees an abandoned mansion across a [[salt marsh]] and goes to investigate it. She looks around, finding it familiar, but gets trapped there by the rising tide until she is found by Toichi, a taciturn old fisherman, who brings her back to the pier with his rowboat. When she returns to the Oiwa's, Setsu tells her that the mansion used to be a vacation home for some foreigners, but that it has been empty for a long time. Starting that night, Anna dreams of seeing a blonde girl in the mansion.  On the night of the [[Tanabata]] festival, Anna gets into an argument and runs away to the mansion across the marsh where she meets Marnie, the blonde girl. The two agree to keep their meeting secret and they meet again on the next evening. Marnie invites Anna to a party at the mansion, filled with guests. Marnie disguises Anna to get her into the party. While there, Anna sees Marnie dancing with a boy named Kazuhiko. Later, some townspeople find Anna asleep by the post office. The next day, Anna returns to the mansion, but it appears abandoned and dilapidated again.  One week later, while sitting on the shore [[Sketch (drawing)|sketching]], Anna meets Hisako, an older woman who paints pictures of the marsh and the mansion. Hisako comments that Anna's sketches look like a girl whom she knew when she was young, and who used to live in the mansion. She also tells Anna that the mansion is being renovated for new owners. Anna runs to the mansion, where she meets a girl named Sayaka, who discovers Marnie's [[diary]] hidden in a drawer.   The next day, Marnie reappears and the two girls discuss their home lives. Anna admits to finding government documents that show how her foster parents are paid to take care of her. Anna makes the assumption that they only pretend to love her for the money. Marnie then shares with Anna how her parents are always traveling abroad, how they leave her in the mansion with her [[nanny]] and two [[maid]]s, and how they [[Physical abuse|abuse her physically]] and [[Psychological abuse|psychologically]], threatening to lock her in the [[silo]] near the mansion. Anna leads Marnie to the silo, where she helps her confront her fear. Anna wakes up at the stairway, only to find Marnie gone.   Meanwhile, Sayaka finds the missing pages from Marnie's diary, which include passages about Kazuhiko and the nearby abandoned silo. Sayaka and her brother find Anna [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] and bring her back to her relatives' house. While in her [[fever]]ish state, Anna dreams about confronting Marnie, who tells Anna she is sorry for leaving her and that she cannot see Anna anymore.  When Anna recovers from her fever, Sayaka shows her the missing pages and a painting Hisako gave to Marnie. They converse with Hisako who tells them about Marnie's story: Marnie was neglected by her parents, as they always leave her in the care of the nanny and two maids.  Marnie married Kazuhiko and they had a daughter named Emily. Kazuhiko became sick and died then Marnie was committed to a [[sanatorium]] to recover from the psychiatric effect of his death. Emily was sent to [[boarding school]] since Marnie's parents had also died and had no one to look after Emily. After Marnie was released and Emily came back from boarding school at the age of 13, Emily blamed Marnie for abandoning her. Emily ran away and had a daughter herself, but she and her husband were killed in a car accident when their daughter was one year old. Marnie raised her granddaughter, who was placed in [[foster care]] after her death.  At the end of the summer Yoriko goes to the town to take Anna home. She gives Anna a photograph of the mansion and says it belonged to Anna's grandmother. When Anna sees Marnie's name written on the back, she realizes that she is Emily's daughter and Marnie's granddaughter. This revelation helps to bring Anna closure about her identity. Yoriko also tells Anna about the government payments for her care and reassures her that whether they receive them or not does not change what they feel about her. However, Anna admits she knew about the payments but now no longer cares about them. For the first time Anna calls Yoriko her mother instead of her aunt. During the end credits Anna says goodbye to the friends she met in town, before seeing Marnie in the mansion waving goodbye to her, as Yoriko drives Anna back home.  
What We Do in the Shadows
 A documentary crew (who are wearing crucifixes) follows four vampire roommates—Viago, Vladislav, Deacon, and Petyr—who share a flat in the [[Wellington]] suburb of [[Te Aro]]. Although Viago, Vladislav and Deacon are all several centuries old, they have retained normal human appearances, but the 8,000-year-old Petyr resembles [[Count Orlok]] and acts more savagely than the younger vampires. Each night, Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon prowl the streets of Wellington searching for people to kill, but they must stay in the flat during the day to avoid sunlight—which is lethal to vampires—and thus have not adapted to 21st-century life. Deacon has a human servant (familiar), Jackie, who runs errands for the vampires, but she is frustrated that Deacon will not turn her into a vampire as he has promised. Jackie leads her ex-boyfriend Nick to the vampires’ flat so they can drink his blood; he escapes before they can kill him, but as he leaves the flat, Petyr attacks him and later turns Nick into a vampire.  Two months later the vampires accept Nick into their group and also bond with his human friend Stu, a computer analyst who shows them how to use modern technology such as YouTube (to watch sunrises) and cameras (so they can see themselves). Viago in particular is able to find Katherine, his love from many years past, now an old woman in a rest home in Wellington. Despite being able to get his new friends into more popular bars and clubs, Nick struggles to adapt to life as a vampire and carelessly reveals his secret to strangers he meets. One of these strangers, a [[vampire hunter]], breaks into the flat during the day and kills Petyr by exposing him to sunlight. The vampires are furious when they discover Nick has indirectly caused Petyr's death, and banish him, using the infamous Procession of Shame, from the flat.  Some time later, the vampires receive an invitation to a [[masquerade ball]], where they meet other undead and supernatural beings such as [[zombie]]s and [[witchcraft|witches]], as well as Vladislav's ex-girlfriend Pauline, whom he nicknamed "The Beast" due to their hard break-up. Nick, Stu and Jackie also attend. To Deacon's annoyance, Nick has turned Jackie into a vampire. When Pauline realizes that Stu and the camera-crew are human, the other guests try to kill them and Vladislav fights Pauline's new boyfriend. Stu saves Vladislav by impaling Pauline's boyfriend on a stick. The vampires manage to escape the ball with Stu and the film-crew, but encounter a group of [[werewolves]] who are about to [[shapeshifting|transform]] in a forest. Stu and one of the cameramen are caught and attacked by the werewolves. Assuming Stu is dead, the vampires grieve for him.  A while later, Stu (having been turned into a werewolf himself) reappears, and eventually reconciles the werewolves with the vampires, who allow them to stay in their flat with them. Nick also resurfaces and is accepted back into the home. Viago reconnects with Katherine, turning her into a vampire and ensuring they can be together forever.  Scenes during the credits reveal that Vladislav has gotten back together with Pauline and Jackie has made her husband her new familiar. A post-credits scene shows Deacon attempting to hypnotize the audience to forget the events of the film.  
What We Did on Our Holiday
 Doug McLeod ([[David Tennant]]) and his wife Abi ([[Rosamund Pike]]) unite following a tense separation to travel to the [[Scottish Highlands]] for Doug's father Gordie's ([[Billy Connolly]]) 75th birthday. Gordie has terminal cancer so Doug's brother, millionaire Gavin McLeod ([[Ben Miller]]) has arranged a lavish party for him, inviting all the important people in the neighbourhood. Despite difficulties getting their three children, Lottie ([[Emilia Jones]]), Mickey (Bobby Smalldridge), and Jess (Harriet Turnbull), to leave the house, they hit the road, but find it congested and they are forced to stop overnight.   Lottie expresses her troubles with trusting her parents following their recent separation and lies to each other; it is revealed that Doug had an affair, which led to Abi moving out and taking legal proceedings against him. They are only travelling to the Highlands together to appear as a couple for Gordie, not wanting to upset him in his final months.  On arriving at Gavin's mansion, a tense rivalry becomes apparent between Doug and Gavin. Gordie, despite being extremely ill, is fun-loving and encourages his grandchildren, particularly Lottie, to let go of their troubles and enjoy life. While Gavin, Doug, Abi and Gavin's wife Margaret ([[Amelia Bullmore]]) make the final arrangements for the party, Gordie takes the three children to the beach. He reveals that he is descended from Vikings, a fact that Mickey in particular is excited about; he reveals his desire to be buried 'the Viking way' by being cremated and sent out to sea. He believes this will stop arguments between Doug and Gavin. Later, while Lottie, Mickey and Jess are playing, Gordie dies peacefully.   Lottie returns back to the house to tell the adults, leaving her siblings with Gordie's body. However, when she arrives she sees them all arguing, Abi telling Doug she also had an affair and will be moving the children to Newcastle, and Gavin with his family over what Gordie wants for his birthday, Lottie returns to the beach without telling them. Fulfilling Gordie's last wish, the three children create an improvised raft, and using petrol from Gordie's pickup, send him out to sea aflame, 'Viking' style.   The children return home and tell the adults what has happened. The adults are horrified, and Doug and Gavin head to the beach, where they find Gordie's pick-up truck partially submerged by the high tide; Gavin breaks down in Doug's arms. Abi and Margaret break the news of Gordie's death to the party guests, and word quickly gets out about what the children did. The police arrive to investigate, accompanied by social services worker Agnes Chisholm ([[Celia Imrie]]), who interviews the children about their actions, and after speaking with Lottie she contemplates removing them from Doug and Abi's care. The press descend on the house, with Lottie, Jess and Mickey's actions making headlines worldwide.   While using Gavin and Margaret's son Kenneth's (Lewis Davie) computer, Mickey and Jess accidentally stumble upon a video of Gavin's wife Margaret attacking a fellow shopper at a supermarket as a result of depression. Gavin also sees it, having been previously unaware of his wife's issues. After the press paints the children's actions as depraved, Doug and Abi make a statement to the press that what their children did was not malicious, and that they support the children's efforts to honour their grandfather, however misguided it may seem; seeing the support the children receive, Chisholm ends her investigation, leaving the children with their parents.  In the final scene, Gavin and Doug hold a memorial for Gordie at the beach, where the brothers are shown to have buried the hatchet. Abi tells Doug she will not be moving to Newcastle, and the couple decide to divorce civily, apologising to their children. The film ends with the extended family honouring Gordie on a hill above the beach with some friends, and then the family playfully splashing around at the water's edge on the beach.  
What's the Time in Your World?
 After twenty years in [[Paris]], Gilehgol "Goli" Ebtehaj returns to her hometown near [[Rasht]], leaving her French beau, Antoine, behind. She is greeted by Farhad Yervan, the self-described "Mr. Idiot" painter who claims to know her since long ago. Goli is repulsed by his advances and the fact that he knows so many things about her, while she is distressed that everyone in the town seems to accuse her of missing out her mother, Hava's funeral five years ago. She later recollects that Farhad knew her since at least college times. Interspersed with her story are flashbacks showing that Farhad had made repeated contacts with Hava, from whom he learned about Goli. Hava held Farhad affectionately and lamented Goli's indifference towards him.  Goli begins reconnecting with her old life, including meeting with her college crush, Ali Yaghuti, who is now married with three children, her aunt who lives in [[Bandar-e Anzali]], and tea plantation owner Mr. Najdi, who reveals that he had plans to propose to Hava before he moved overseas. At one point, Goli becomes furious at Farhad due to his repeated advances and lets him get attacked by a mob for harassment, though she later apologizes and invites him to her house. He does so by walking with his head on the streets and carrying a large suitcase; when he arrives, he collapses from dizziness.   As Goli calls him, flashbacks reveal that Farhad had in fact known and fallen in love with Goli since they were children. He observed her mannerisms, her fondness, even her habit of drawing X every time she went to the pier, which is later explained as a way for her to remember a lost lyric for a song. After he wakes up, he shows Goli the contents of the suitcase: all things that she used to hold dear. The two stay together until night, when an exhausted Farhad decides to sleep on a table in the living room, with Goli bidding him good night.  
While We're Young (film)
 Middle-aged couple Josh ([[Ben Stiller]]) and Cornelia Schrebnick ([[Naomi Watts]]) have a shaky relationship while living in New York City. Josh is struggling on the post-production of his documentary film about leftist intellectual Ira Mandelstam ([[Peter Yarrow]]). His previous documentary about the [[military-industrial complex]] titled The Power Elite was based on [[C. Wright Mills]]'s sociological theory. Both Josh and Cornelia are struggling to try to have children, although Cornelia is reluctant due to her miscarrying the past two pregnancies. After finishing a lecture at the college where he works, Josh is approached by Jamie ([[Adam Driver]]) and Darby Massey ([[Amanda Seyfried]]), a young couple who invite him and Cornelia out to dinner, the former claiming to be a fan of both his works and the works of his accomplished documentary filmmaker father-in-law, Leslie Breitbart ([[Charles Grodin]]). Josh is immediately awestruck by Jamie and Darby's non-conservative outlook on life, and he and Cornelia begin spending more time with them and indulging in their activities.  An aspiring filmmaker himself, Jamie talks with Josh about their projects, including Josh's own documentary. This inspires Jamie to make a film about connecting with an old high school friend that he found on Facebook. Jamie and Darby decide to invite Josh and Cornelia to an [[ayahuasca]] ceremony, where a hallucinating Cornelia kisses Jamie, while Jamie receives Josh's approval in helping with the production of his film. Later, Cornelia agrees to help produce. Jamie and Josh manage to find the former's friend, Kent Arlington ([[Brady Corbet]]), who is in the hospital for an attempted suicide. Not long after, Josh and Jamie discover that Kent was involved with a massacre during an Army tour in Afghanistan, creating an even bigger story for the focus of Jamie's film.  While pitching his own film, Josh is dismayed when he cannot intrigue a [[hedge fund]] investor ([[Ryan Serhant]]) with the concept of his vague and confusing feature. Josh goes to Leslie with his film for a second opinion. When Leslie's criticisms and suggestions are brought down by Josh, the two get into an argument over Josh and Cornelia's inability to have children, as well as Josh calling himself a disappointment in the eyes of his father-in-law. Josh then attends a party for a screening of Jamie's own film, which is met far more positively by Leslie and even the hedge fund investor. A jealous Josh argues with Cornelia over Jamie's success, and they separate. Josh meets up with Darby, who is growing sick of Jamie's increasingly self-centered attitude, and tells him about Cornelia kissing Jamie. Josh angrily confronts Cornelia the next morning and angrily denounces Jamie.  While teaming up with his editor on cutting his film, Josh comes across footage for Jamie's film, finding evidence in it that suggests his meeting with Kent was all staged. Finding him, Kent reveals that he was really friends with Darby, not Jamie, and that he was contacted by Jamie weeks before their shoot. Capturing his confession on camera, Josh goes to Jamie and Darby to confront him, only to discover that a fed-up Darby is moving out and that Jamie is at a tribute celebrating Leslie at [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]].  Josh confronts Jamie in private at the event, admonishing him for compromising the truth and genuineness of his story for dramatic purposes. When Josh forces Jamie to admit to it in front of Leslie, he excuses it, saying that it's a good story regardless of the fabrication, which throws Josh into a rage, but not before admitting that Leslie was right about changing his film. Outside, Josh and Cornelia reconcile.  One year later, Josh and Cornelia are driving to the airport to adopt a baby from Haiti. Josh finds an article in a magazine lauding Jamie as a filmmaking genius, which Cornelia and Josh pass off by admitting, "He's not evil, he's just young." They then watch a very young child at the gate playing with an [[iPhone]], staring at him with uncertainty.  
White Bird in a Blizzard
 In 1988, when Katrina "Kat" Connors ([[Shailene Woodley]]) was 17, her mother, Eve ([[Eva Green]]), disappeared without a trace. The story weaves back-and-forth with [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s of Eve's past life and the present day.  In the flashbacks, Eve was a wild girl who gradually changed into a domesticated housewife after marrying Brock ([[Christopher Meloni]]), an ordinary man who leads an uneventful life. While Kat explores her blossoming sexuality with her handsome but dim-witted neighbor and schoolmate, Phil ([[Shiloh Fernandez]]), Eve struggles to deal with aging and quenching her youthful wildness. She tries to be sexy when Brock is away, even luring Phil's attention. After Eve disappears, Kat deals with her abandonment without much issue, occasionally releasing her own wild side, seducing the detective ([[Thomas Jane]]) investigating her mother's disappearance. The film then jumps forward three years to the spring of 1991. On a break from college, Kat returns home and seems unfazed to learn that her father is in a relationship with a co-worker.  The detective Kat has been having an affair with informs her that Brock might have killed Eve after catching her cheating. Kat dismisses this theory, just like she did three years ago, but after mentioning the topic to her friends Beth ([[Gabourey Sidibe]]) and Mickey ([[Mark Indelicato]]) they tell her they suggested this same theory to her and she dismissed them as well. Kat suspects Phil of sleeping with Eve and confronts him the night before she is to return to college, but Phil angrily rebuffs it and tells her that her father knows where her mother is.  Kat begins to unpack Brock's suspiciously locked freezer in their basement, but is stopped when he walks in on her.

Lili is angry that her father thinks Hagen can be so easily replaced, and the incident underscores the lack of understanding between father and daughter.  Fearful that her father will get rid of Hagen while she is away, Lili takes the dog to her music class, where his appearance causes chaos. The teacher threatens to kick Lili out of music class unless she takes the dog home. Instead, Lili strikes out with Hagen into the city, but they are found by her father, who left work to look for them after the music teacher phoned him. Lili's father is embarrassed by the incident, and in his anger, he drives Hagen to the outskirts of the city and abandons him on the side of the road. Hagen chases after their car but is unable to follow them.  Hagen begins a lonely journey wandering the city. He eventually befriends a white dog after it saves him from an angry butcher.

However, the man sells Hagen to a [[dog fighting]] ring, where he is chained, starved, and trained to kill. In his first fight, he kills his opponent and escapes.

On the other side of the city, Hagen escapes from the pound after killing one of the staff. He breaks open the cages and frees the other dogs, who follow him into the city.

Her father, stunned at the scene, puts down his weapon and goes to sit beside his daughter.  
Who Am I (2014 film)
  Benjamin Engel, a hacker from [[Berlin]], sits in an interrogation room. The officer in charge tells Hanne Lindberg, Head of the Cyber Division of [[Europol]], that Benjamin asked for her to do the interrogation. Benjamin says that he has information regarding FRI3NDS, a notorious hacking group of four members connected to the [[Russia]]n cyber mafia, and MRX, an infamous hacker known on [[Darknet]]; he tells her that he could give them both to Hanne if he listens to her. Having no choice, Hanne sits down.  Benjamin tells Hanne how he is like a [[superhero]]: like many heroes, he too has no parents; he never met his father as he abandoned the family when Benjamin was born, and his mother committed suicide when he was 8. He lives alone with his ailing grandmother. He regards his "superpower" as invisibility, as he was never noticed by most people during his childhood due to him being socially awkward. He says he learned programming and hacked his first system when he was 14. Though he felt like a loser in real life, he felt a sense of belonging on the Internet. While spending most of his time on Darknet, he met his hacking hero, MRX, whose identity no one knows and who can hack into any system. Benjamin aspires to be like him.  However, as he was unable to attend university, he worked as a pizza delivery boy to pay the bills. He tells Hanne that, one night while he delivered pizzas to a group of students, he saw Marie, a girl with whom he was in love with since his school days. Hearing her having trouble with exams, he decided to help her and be a 'superhero'. He went to the University, hacked into its servers to download the exam questions, but he was caught by a security guard and arrested. Having no prior criminal record, he was forced to perform community service as a punishment.  He tells Hanne that while working on cleaning the streets as punishment, he met Max, a fellow hacker, who Benjamin feels is the opposite of himself; a charismatic, cocky and confident individual. Later, Max had introduced him to his colleagues Stephan and Paul. After Benjamin proved himself as a hacker, Max explained to him that the concept of [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]] is the greatest form of hacking. They decide to form a hacking group, called "Clowns Laughing At You", nicknamed CLAY, and they use Benjamin's house as a base of operations, since Benjamin was forced to send his grandmother to a nursing home due to her [[Alzheimer's disease]]. They cause general mayhem around Berlin in a form of pranking, becoming popular around social media. However, MRX, with whom is Max obsessed, mocks them outright. Infuriated, Max wants to perform a more outrageous feat of hacking, and Benjamin suggest hacking the main building of [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|BND]] (German Central Intelligence). Impressed by this outrageous idea, the group agrees with Benjamin and decide to hack the BND in order to impress MRX.  Using [[dumpster diving]] and [[phishing]] to gain access to the BND building, they manage to hack the internal servers and hack the printers to print their logo titled "NO SYSTEM IS SAFE" all around the building, impressing MRX. However, when they go to a club and celebrate, Benjamin notices Max kissing Marie. Infuriated, Benjamin refuses to let them in the house, also offending Marie when she visits him due to his anger. Feeling inferior, he secretly contacts MRX, offering him valuable info; database from BND's private servers, in which he hacked in while he was in the BND building, which impresses MRX. When the group arrives the next day, Benjamin is still furious, and attacks Max; who responds by beating him up. However, Paul, watching the TV, hears on the news that one of the members of FRI3NDS, nicknamed Krypton, was murdered. Benjamin admits that he gave the info from the BND to MRX, and after checking them, realizes that the info identified Krypton as a double agent working with Hanne to expose MRX and FRI3NDS, and CLAY is now labeled as a terrorist group for hacking the info.  Seeking to clear their name for the murder, Benjamin contacts MRX, who instructs them to hack into the Europol database in exchange for MRX's identity, giving them a hacking tool to help. After dissolving their hard drives in acid to erase data, they travel to [[The Hague]] to Europol's headquarters in order to try and break their way in, but it's impossible to find a way inside: they dump their trash in secured building, the sewers are locked, and phishing attempts failed. However, while checking out the building, Benjamin notices a group of scholars visiting the building, and one of them drops his visitor card; using Max's advice about social engineering, Benjamin manages to gain access to the building by fooling a guard and plants a hacking device inside. He then hacks into the internal Europol servers and provides MRX with an entrance; secretly encoded inside a double [[trojan horse]] so MRX will be exposed when he tries to gain access. However, MRX, anticipating this, takes a snapshot of Benjamin via his webcam, exposing him. Benjamin is forced to flee when a group of Russian mobsters find him; he evades them in the subway.  Benjamin returns to the hotel where he was staying with the trio, only to find them murdered. Having no other choice and knowing that FRI3NDS would kill him, he decided to turn himself in to Hanne, proving that he is serious after stating that he hacked her profile and learned personal information about her. Hanne, who was suspended for her failure to capture them and is desperate to apprehend FRI3NDS and MRX, agrees to put Benjamin into a witness protection program in exchange for capturing them; Benjamin logs in as MRX himself and spreads lies about MRX being a snitch, forcing the real MRX to force his way into the Darknet servers with unsafe methods, allowing Benjamin to expose him; MRX is exposed as 19-year old American man from [[New York City]], whom the [[FBI]] arrests in a coffee shop.  However, after agreeing to give Benjamin the witness exchange program for him, Hanne notices a wound going through his palm (the same wound that Max got after running a nail through his hand), and realizes that Max, Stephan and Paul are all made up characters. Distraught, she visits Benjamin's doctor, who states that his mother had [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]] and committed suicide because of it, learning that it can be genetically passed. She connects various plot holes in Benjamin's story and realizes that ''he'' alone was CLAY: he committed all the atrocities, he hacked into the BND alone, and he planted the WWII bullets from his grandmothers in the hotel to make it look like they were killed, imagining the trio due to his illness. Hanne confronts Benjamin, who has an emotional breakdown, as people with mental disorders cannot be given witness protection. However, Hanne changes her mind and allows him access to the witness protection program, revealed to be an ''actual'' program containing information about all citizens of Germany; Benjamin changes his identity here. Hanne, dropping Benjamin off, states that she let him go because he truly wants to stay invisible, and lets him go on the condition that he never hacks again.  Benjamin, now sporting blonde hair, is standing alone on a cruise ship heading north. However, he is suddenly joined by Marie, Max, Stephan and Paul. In narration, Benjamin states that he performed "the greatest social engineering hack" ever; the scene shifts back to Benjamin going back to the hotel, finding the guys alive and well; he instructs them to flee since MRX knows his identity, but they refuse to leave him behind. After Marie visits them and confirms that mentally ill subjects cannot be granted witness protection, they devise a plan for Benjamin to go to Hanne and dictate the story, deliberately giving plot holes which she will most likely dechiper, and then using her grief for him in order to give him access to the witness protection program, and also spiking his hand with a nail to make the story seem truthful. In the server room, it was revealed that Benjamin didn't change his identity, he ''erased'' it completely. Benjamin states that Hanne will eventually realize his deception, but she won't hunt him down as she got what she wanted. Indeed, at a press conference announcing the defeat of FRI3NDS and MRX, Hanne, having an epiphany, smiles as she realizes the truth.

There she finds a message, scolding her for letting her child go, and sees a woman dressed in black. The next morning, one of the children, Edward, who has been mute since the death of his parents in the bombing, is bullied by two other children and sees the Woman in Black in the nursery. Eve feels that something is wrong when Edward starts constantly carrying around a rotting doll. That night, one of the boys who was bullying him is drawn out of the house by the Woman in Black; Eve finds his body on the beach, mangled by barbed wire.  Eve later sees the Woman in the graveyard, where she finds the grave of Nathaniel Drablow. She chases the ghost to the beach and is overcome by visions of Nathaniel's death. At the house, she and Harry establish the story of the ghost through an old recording made by Alice Drablow before her death at the hands of the Woman in Black: it is her sister, Jennet Humfrye, the mother of the child she adopted, Nathaniel. Jennet is haunting them because of Nathaniel's premature death, and is punishing Eve in particular for giving up her baby. Eve journeys into the abandoned town to confront Jacob, who is blind and therefore unable to be killed by the ghost, as he cannot see her. However, he has been driven insane by the deaths of all the other children (whose ghosts surround him) and tries to kill Eve before she escapes.  Back at the house, Jean finds one of the girls trying to strangle herself under the Woman's spell. During an air raid, the girl suffocates herself using a gas mask. After this death, Harry takes them to his airfield, which is revealed to be a decoy. Harry, the only man stationed there, has been disgraced following a crash in which he was the only survivor, and is no longer allowed to fly. Eve realises that the Woman has followed them. Edward flees and apparently dies by walking into a fire basket. Eve, however, realises that Edward is still alive and at Eel Marsh House. Realising that the Woman in Black wants her alone, she drives to the island, where she finds Edward walking out into the marsh to drown himself where Nathaniel died. She crawls after him, but they are dragged down into the mud by the ghost. At the last minute, Harry arrives and saves them, though he is dragged down to his death instead.  Months later, Eve has adopted Edward, and they are living in London. Although they believe they are free from the ghost, once they leave their house, she appears again and smashes a picture of Harry and his crew.  
Winter's Tale (film)
 In 1895, a young immigrant couple is [[Ellis Island|refused entry]] into [[Manhattan]] because they have [[Tuberculosis|consumption]]. When their infant son is not allowed entry to the country without them, the couple place him in a model sailboat named "City of Justice," in which the baby floats to the [[New York City]] shoreline. In 1916, the baby boy has grown up to become Peter Lake ([[Colin Farrell]]), a thief raised by a supernatural demon posing as the gangster Pearly Soames ([[Russell Crowe]]). Peter is marked for death when he decides to leave Pearly's gang. In a confrontation, he is rescued by a mysterious (winged at times) white [[horse]], his guardian angel.  Although Peter hopes to move to [[Florida]] and come back in the summer, the horse encourages him to steal from one last mansion. The mansion is the home where Beverly Penn ([[Jessica Brown Findlay]]) lives, a young woman dying of [[Consumption (disease)|consumption]], whose fever is so high she sleeps outside in a tent in the winter cold. While her publisher father Isaac and younger sister Willa are not home, Beverly discovers Peter Lake preparing to rob the house. When Peter assures her that he no longer wishes to commit robbery, Beverly offers to make him a cup of tea. They tell each other their stories and fall in love. Pearly orders his men to Beverly’s home, believing that saving her is Peter's "miracle" and spiritual destiny and that he can destroy Peter by preventing it. Peter rescues Beverly from being knifed by Pearly, and they escape to the Lake of the Coheeries, where Pearly, who is supernaturally limited to the five boroughs of [[New York City]], cannot follow. Peter meets Beverly’s family at their [[summer home]] and wins their respect.  While on a walk, Beverly explains to Peter that everyone is born with a miracle inside and they are ultimately destined to become stars when they die. Pearly asks the [[Devil]], [[Lucifer]] ([[Will Smith]]), for access to the lake home, but his request is denied. Instead, Pearly, who refers to himself as a Knight among Lucifer's angels, calls in a debt owed to him by another of Lucifer’s angels. At a ball, the angel disguised as a waiter poisons Beverly's drink. When Peter and Beverly return home from the ball, Peter watches the shadows she casts upon the sides of her lighted tent, joins her, and the two make love. Her pulse races faster than ever due to the poison in her heart, and she dies. After the funeral, when Peter and his mysterious white horse return to the city, Pearly and his men surround them on the Brooklyn Bridge. To save its life, Peter orders his mysterious winged horse to fly away, and Pearly gives Peter five vicious head-butts, pushing him off the bridge.  Peter miraculously survives but wanders around the city with amnesia for a century, drawing chalk art of a red-headed girl on the pavements. In 2014, the 119 year-old, but physically undiminished Peter, bumps into a young girl named Abby and meets her mother, Virginia Gamely ([[Jennifer Connelly]]). He rediscovers the brass name plate of the "City of Justice", the toy sailboat in which his parents placed him. Peter then discovers the Theatre of the Coheeries, founded by Isaac, who has dedicated it to Beverly. He visits the Isaac Penn Reading Room where Virginia works, and she helps him restore his memory using historical photographs archived at the library. While there, he meets Beverly’s now elderly sister Willa ([[Eva Marie Saint]]), who is the owner of Virginia's newspaper.  When Peter visits the Gamelys for dinner, he learns that Abby has cancer. Realizing that Abby, who is wearing a red scarf (like his sketches) and has red hair. When he realizes Abby, not Beverly as he originally believed, is his "miracle" and spiritual destiny, Peter convinces Virginia that he can save Abby. Pearly learns that Peter is still alive and with Virginia, and he is surprised to learn from Lucifer that Peter was Beverly's miracle, making him love her so much that he couldn't die. Enraged, Pearly asks to fight Peter as a mortal so he can destroy him for good, and Lucifer grants his request. Pearly and his men arrive at Virginia's apartment, causing Peter and Virginia to flee to the rooftop with Abby. The mysterious winged horse flies them to the Lake of the Coheeries, but Pearly, now mortal, can pursue Peter beyond the Five Boroughs. After Horse dispatches Pearly's men by crashing the ice so that they all drown, Peter and Pearly engage in a fistfight. Peter is losing until a light shines from the heavens and allows Peter to stab Pearly in the neck with the name plate from the boat, "City of Justice." Pearly turns to snow and Peter is able to save Abby on the princess bed after he kisses her forehead. After visiting Beverly's grave one last time, Peter mounts the horse to be carried away to the stars, while the elderly Willa witnesses his ascension.

Meanwhile, Garou ends up in Higgins' house, handcuffed to the bed.  Higgins explains that he captured Garou and restrained him for his own safety.

Tina arrives and confronts the police chief, who shapeshifts into the gang leader, and Higgins.  Tina and Garou kill Higgins, Jessica, and the gang members, but the chief surprises them with a sneak attack.

Garou and Tina limp off together, and Garou promises to drop her off at a hospital after he gets another drink.  
Winter Sleep (film)
 Aydın, a former actor, owns a mountaintop hotel in [[Cappadocia]], as well as several properties which he rents out to local tenants. He leads a more idyllic life than most people around him in the region. Educated and wealthy, he spends his time writing columns for a local newspaper and researching the history of Turkish theater, of which he hopes to write a book someday.  One day, Aydın and his assistant Hidayet are driving down to the village when a stone shatters the window. It was thrown by İlyas, the son of İsmail, one of Aydın's tenants who is several months behind in the rent. When Hidayet confronts the father, it turns out that Aydın's people had already sent a [[collection agency]] that took İsmail's television and refrigerator, with İsmail getting beaten up by the police for resisting. The situation escalates until İsmail’s brother Hamdi intervenes.  Hamdi, the eager-to-please local [[imam]], brings the young İlyas to Aydın in an attempt to make amends for the glass-breaking incident. However, this only serves to annoy Aydin, inspiring him to write a column on how an imam should really give a proper example to their community. At first, his sister Necla wonders why Aydın does not use his writing talent in a better place than the local newspaper. Later, she reverses her view and tells him that he is just superficially and sentimentally criticising other people from his comfortable armchair. This results in a long chain of snide remarks made back and forth at each other. This reversal occurs after Necla mentions to Aydın's wife Nihal that Necla might be better off going back to her ex-husband, after which Nihal tells Necla that she is free to leave even though it is a stupid idea.  Nihal is much younger than her husband Aydın. She tries to give meaning to her life by [[fundraising]] for developing schools, an activity for which Aydın has not shown much interest. However, when Nihal organizes a fundraiser event in their home, Aydın becomes annoyed and tells her that the fundraiser event will be a guaranteed failure due to her lack of experience and bookkeeping skills. This turns into an emotional argument, where he tells her that she is free to divorce from him if she wishes so. Finally, Aydın states that he will leave for [[Istanbul]] for several months to make arrangements for his book. He warns her that she should not trust Levent (Nadir Sarıbacak), one of the other people involved in the fundraiser, since Aydın considers Levent to lack moral values. Before he leaves, Aydın makes a large anonymous donation in cash.  The next day, Hidayet takes Aydın to the train station, carrying all the luggage while Aydın comfortably walks empty-handed. Due to heavy snow fall, the train is severely delayed, and Aydın decides that they will visit Aydın's friend Suavi in a nearby village. Suavi welcomes Aydın's visit, but Levent also shows up, as Levent and Suavi had agreed earlier to go out hunting. They spend the evening drinking and talking. There is some tension between Aydın and Levent, as Levent makes insinuations that Aydın did not do enough to help in the aftermath of an earthquake, six years earlier.  In the meantime, Nihal visits the house of Hamdi, İsmail, İlyas, and the sick grandmother. Nihal learns that İsmail was unemployed after a prison sentence for stabbing a lingerie thief and that İlyas had been suffering from [[pneumonia]]. Their financial difficulties are due to the fact that Hamdi has to take care of all of them from his modest income as an imam. Nihal offers the money that Aydın had donated, around 10,000 [[Turkish lira|lira]] ($5,900 in 2013), enough to buy a house in the area. İsmail is insulted by what he sees as an attempt to pay off her conscience and burns the money in the fireplace, to the horror of Nihal.  The film ends as Aydın returns home the next day. As Nihal stares out of the window, silently, Aydin's voice is heard explaining that he cannot live without Nihal, even if she does not love him anymore. Aydin starts his procrastinated project of writing about the history of Turkish theatre.  
Without Pity (2014 film)
      
Wolves (2014 film)
 The film is narrated by Cayden ([[Lucas Till]]), an average teenaged boy approaching the end of high school.  During a football game, a rival player headbutts Cayden, causing the latter to become enraged and attack the player with superhuman strength. Cayden later hurts his girlfriend, Lisa ([[Kaityn Leeb]]), when the passion of [[making out]] causes him to unwillingly transform into a [[werewolf]].  Cayden wakes up covered in blood, surrounded by the dismembered bodies of his parents and flees.  Cayden becomes a [[Drifter (person)|drifter]], trying to keep his [[lycanthropy]] under control. In a roadside bar, Cayden draws the attention of Wild Joe ([[John Pyper-Ferguson]]), who reveals himself to be a werewolf. Wild Joe explains that werewolves come in two types, pure-breds and the bitten.  The bitten are more savage and do not give birth to werewolf children. Pure-breds are natural-born werewolves from a small number of werewolf families that came to [[North America]] with the early [[settler]]s.  Cayden has only recently discovered that he was adopted, and Wild Joe confirms that they are both natural werewolves and that Cayden can find out more in a remote town called [[Wolf|Lupine]] Ridge.  Cayden travels to Lupine Ridge and goes to a local bar, attracting hostile attention from the small town locals. Cayden is attracted to Angel (Angelina) ([[Merritt Patterson]]), the beautiful young owner of the bar. He is eventually driven out of the bar by the locals, and outside meets John Tollerman ([[Stephen McHattie]]), who hires Cayden as a [[farmhand]]. After working for Tollerman for a while, he heads into town one night and Cayden is approached by a wolf of his [[bloodline]] who understands who Cayden is, warning him to leave town and that he is in danger.  Cayden's "cousin" ([[Brandon McGibbon]]) is then killed by Connor ([[Jason Momoa]]), the alpha werewolf whom Cayden saw as the ringleader of the patrons in Angel's bar. Cayden runs into Angel and together they witness Connor and his pack eating Cayden's cousin after the murder.  John later tells Cayden of his origins, about his werewolf mother, John's niece Lucinda being raped by werewolf Connor.  Only John and his wife ([[Janet-Laine Green]]) knew about Lucinda's resulting pregnancy, and Lucinda killed herself shortly after Cayden's birth. John also tells him about the uneasy peace between the purebred town wolves and the savage mountain wolves, a pack of bitten werewolves who were created by purebred Connor.  The peace comes with the condition that Connor can mate with Angel as he desires a son, not knowing about Cayden.  Cayden has started a relationship with Angel and wants to cancel the town's arrangement, but the town werewolves fear what the more bestial mountain werewolves would do in retaliation. Cayden goes to the mountains to confront Connor and reveals who he is, but Connor is skeptical and unleashes his wolves on Cayden.  While Cayden is stronger than the individual bitten wolves, he will not use [[Deadly force|lethal force]] and is overwhelmed by the pack.  He manages to jump off a nearby cliff to escape.  Cayden and John form a plan to deal with the mountain pack.  Before they can act, Connor kidnaps Angel and readies to mate with her. Cayden kills two of the pack and lures the others into a trap where he and John use explosives to kill them all.  When Cayden then beats Connor in single battle, Connor reveals that he and Lucinda were in love; but he created the rape story because Lucinda's father was going to kill her for the relationship.  Wild Joe suddenly appears, telling Connor and Cayden that he planned the events all along, killing Cayden's adoptive parents and convincing him to go to Lupine Ridge so that he could kill Connor in revenge for his own past issues with Connor. Wild Joe kills Connor but is killed by Cayden.  Cayden decides to leave with Angel to see the world, but he promises John they will be back.  John gives him a scroll showing the bloodlines of the pure-bred werewolves to help him find others during their journey.

In the Infinite Ocean, the Trix try to gain power by sitting on the Emperor's Throne but end up summoning the nymph Politea instead. The Trix engage in a battle with Politea and learn that they cannot gain any power from the throne because it will only listen to the true emperor, Tritannus. They make a deal with Politea to get Tritannus back from the Oblivion, which they can only do with the vital force of a young prince. Once they free him, the Trix will convince him to get the mystical Pearl of the Deep for Politea, who would become freed by the pearl and then help the Trix take the throne's power.  The Trix go to Gardenia and attack Bloom and Sky. Bloom tries to fight the Trix alone and manages to escape with Sky, but the Trix get Kiko. Sky tries to save him and gets attacked, leaving him unconscious. The Trix capture him and take him to the Infinite Ocean, where they tie him to the Emperor's Throne.

Tritannus sits on the Throne, gains his powers, and seals all the gateways to enter the Infinite Ocean. He and the Trix head towards Omnia's cave.  At Alfea, Bloom's friends agree to help her journey to the Infinite Ocean to save Sky. They discover that Tritannus has sealed all of the ocean's gateways except for the Oblivion portal, which leads them through a dangerous dimension. The Winx go through the portal and Bloom wakes up in an empty room, where a dark illusion of herself appears to tell her that she has abandoned Sky. When Bloom realizes that she successfully got into the Oblivion, she quickly wakes the other Winx. They break free from the Oblivion with a convergence spell.  The Winx hurry towards the Emperor's Throne, where they fight Politea. Sky gains consciousness and tells them to go to Omnia, who tells them that the Pearl was hidden in the Coral Barrier. They get there to find the Trix and Tritannus, who grabs the Pearl and leaves the Winx in the barrier with almost no way to escape. The girls leave through an underground tunnel and hurry back to the throne, where Politea finally appears in front of Tritannus and snatches the Pearl from him. She sits on the Throne, revealing that she fooled the Trix and will not follow through on their deal. The Trix try to fight her, but she hypnotizes them and Tritannus. Meanwhile, Sky breaks free from the throne and Serena snatches the pearl from Politea's hand and gives it to Bloom. Bloom uses it in a convergence spell with the Winx and Omnia uses it to heal Sky.  Later at Alfea, Sky wakes up and asks what happened to the Trix and Tritannus. The Winx explain everything: that the Trix fled, Tritannus is once again banished to the Oblivion, and the pearl is back where it should be. Bloom and Sky kiss, and Kiko comes to give Sky an ice cream.

They watch the show being filmed and, as, they are about to leave, the star of the show, Milly, calls them over and gives Gelsomina a hair clip to keep.  Watching the program they were filming on TV, Gelsomina learns that the program is launching a competition called Countryside Wonders, in which seven farmers will compete to have their products featured on the show. While her father, Wolfgang, is violently against the family competing, her mother warms to the idea, despite the fact that the standards of their honey production are not up to par.   Meanwhile, Wolfgang hires a juvenile delinquent named Martin to work on the farm. Martin never talks, thinking that he will be able to help with the honey production. Though Wolfgang tries to favor Martin, he eventually discovers that he is an ineffectual worker.   Unbeknownst to her father, Gelsomina fills out an application for her family to compete in Countryside Wonders.

The World of Kanako
 Akikazu Fujishima ([[Kōji Yakusho]]) is a former detective who lost his job, marriage and daughter after having a violent reaction to his wife's infidelity.  Since then, he has become a dysfunctional, unstable alcoholic.  Many years later, his ex-wife (Asuka Kurosawa) contacts him to tell him that his daughter Kanako ([[Nana Komatsu (actress)|Nana Komatsu]]) has gone missing.  Akikazu begins investigating the disappearance, with police detective Asai ([[Satoshi Tsumabuki]]) ostensibly helping but in truth rarely involving himself in the search.  Akikazu's methods involve harassing and intimidating those he speaks to, including Kanako's former classmates and teacher ([[Miki Nakatani]]), but none of them are forthcoming.  Nonetheless, he discovers that she had become involved with drug users, and suspects that they made her into an addict.  Flashbacks to three years prior reveal how an unnamed student (Hiroya Shimizu) in Kanako's middle school had fallen in love with her, as she was the only kid who didn't bully or ostracize him. The student knowing Kanako had been  in love with a former student named Ogata, wanted her to feel the same way for him. This desire eventually leads him to attend a party with her, where he is drugged and raped. The student then tracks down Kanako and contemplates killing her, but is unable to. She embraces him, before an unidentified figure stabs the student in the neck, killing him.  In the present, Akikazu is eventually captured by the Yakuza, who torture and kill Kanako's gang member friend Matsunaga ([[Mahiro Takasugi]]) in front of him. Matsunaga informs Akikazu as to how Ogata was a "weak boy with a cute face" so they kidnapped him and allowed old men to rape him, which caused him to commit suicide. Kanako having been in love with Ogata befriended the group in order to exact revenge. Due to Ogata's death or perhaps exacerbated by it Kanako is completely emotionless which easily allows her to become involved with the child prostitution ring, and manipulate other kids (along with the unnamed student) to use drugs and drink, thus allowing older men to rape them. Even knowing about Kanakos intentions and lack of feelings for anyone or anything, Matsunaga had fallen in love with Kanako and helped her to steal the photo's. The Yakuza inform Akikazu that the police are also involved in the prostitution ring and that Detective Aikawa ([[Joe Odagiri]]) had killed several of Kanako's criminal friends in an attempt at a cover-up.  They provide Akikazu with a gun and send him to Aikawa's home.  Akikazu rapes Aikawa's wife, then takes her and her son hostage to meet Aikawa.  The two have a bloody fight, during which Aikawa kills his wife, but both men survive.  The police, including Detective Asai, arrive on the scene, and kill Aikawa.  Akikazu hits Asai with his car and escapes.  Akikazu returns to the teacher that he questioned much earlier, having realized that her daughter was one of the children being raped in Kanako's photos, and that she had killed Kanako in revenge.  He forces her to dig up the grave that she buried Kanako in, but its location has been lost due to recent snowfall.  While the teacher insists that his search for his daughter's body is futile and tries to escape, Akikazu continues to dig, refusing to acknowledge that his daughter is dead.  The film ends as he vows to kill her himself.

The film is composed of [[home video]]s, one on one sit downs with Alex’s family; husband, parents, sisters, doctors, and healers. Although a documentary, half of the movie shows Alex’s current film project about Anna, a woman with the same diagnosis as Alex except she looks at the glass as half full. The film within the film recounts private conversations between Alex and her husband, Alex’s dreams, and the alter-self, Anna, who is moving forward to face her fear of death. Sichel believes that making a movie about herself living with breast cancer can help her heal and accept what is happening to her.  The documentary side of the film shows Alex's doctor visits, the types of medications she’s on, and the alternative medicine healing practices she does with healers and shamans. Alex’s family, although glad Alex is taking medicine from the "real" doctors, believe healers and the Buddhist philosophy of "going joyfully towards death" are not helpful and is just "magical thinking”. Alex later learns that the tumor has grown larger so, she takes the opportunity to go to Greece and learn more about her family’s history. The last scene of the film shows that Alex has lived another winter and is once again at the Buddhist silent retreat that she attends yearly. She mentions how her daughter’s birthday is coming up so she needs to look forward with positive thoughts.<ref></ref><ref></ref>  
X-Men: Days of Future Past
   In a dystopian future, [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] have been programmed to identify and hunt down [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] and their human allies who carry the mutant gene for extermination. During a Sentinel raid which overwhelms nearly every mutant in Russia, [[Kitty Pryde]] sends [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]]'s consciousness [[Time travel|back in time]] a few days before the attack, in an effort to warn the other mutants so as to ensure their survival.  [[Professor Charles Xavier]] and other mutant survivors later meet Kitty Pryde at a remote Chinese temple, and explains the history of the Sentinels, which were designed by [[Bolivar Trask]], whom [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] assassinated in 1973; Mystique's [[DNA]] was then modified by scientists to advance the Sentinel program. Using Kitty's ability to send a mutant's consciousness back in time, Xavier and Magneto plan to alter history by preventing Trask’s [[assassination]]. While Xavier initially plans to be the candidate, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] volunteers instead since his regenerative powers would allow him to survive the process.  After awakening in his younger body in 1973, Wolverine arrives at the [[X-Mansion]], discovering the school has been shut down and that the younger Xavier can walk due to a specialized serum suppressing his mutant abilities. Hoping to reunite with Mystique, Xavier agrees to help Wolverine and busts [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lensherr]] out of his prison cell under [[the Pentagon]], aided by [[Beast (comics)|Hank McCoy]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Peter Maximoff]].  Mystique discovers Trask has been experimenting on mutants and in revenge plots to assassinate him at the [[Paris Peace Accords]]. Her vengeance results in failure after Xavier, Hank, and Wolverine intervene, and Erik attempts to kill her to prevent the Sentinel takeover from happening. During the fight, Hank, Erik, and Mystique expose themselves as mutants to the world. Trask takes advantage of this event and successfully convinces President [[Richard Nixon]] to initialize the Sentinel program.  Erik obtains his signature helmet to block out Xavier’s psychic powers and secretly takes control of Trask's Sentinel prototypes. Xavier abandons the serum, regaining his mutant power, and communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the relationship between mutants and mankind. After using [[Cerebro]] to track Mystique, he, Hank and Wolverine take flight to [[Washington, D.C.]] to put an end to her assassination plot on Trask.  At a ceremony where Nixon unveils the Sentinels, Xavier, Hank, and Wolverine search for the disguised Mystique. Magneto appears, controlling the Sentinels, and uses the [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium]] to surround the [[White House]]. Hank transforms into Beast and fights a Sentinel. Wolverine confronts Magneto, but is thrown into the [[Potomac River]]. Nixon, Trask, and Mystique hide in a safe room beneath the White House, but Magneto rips it out of the building with the intention of killing the U.S. President.  In the future, the Sentinels launch an attack on the X-Men, slaying most of them. In the present, Xavier persuades Mystique to spare Trask after she saves President Nixon from Magneto, altering history and erasing the Sentinels from existence. Magneto and Mystique both leave, one a criminal, the other a hero; and Trask is jailed for attempting to sell U.S military secrets to Vietnamese officials.  Wolverine wakes up at the mansion in the present day to find [[Iceman (Marvel Comics)|Iceman]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Kitty Pryde|Kitty]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Storm (comics)|Storm]], [[Jean Grey]], [[Scott Summers]]<nowiki/> and Xavier all alive. Wolverine speaks to Xavier, who is also aware of the changes in history. Back in 1973, the younger Wolverine is rescued by Mystique, who is disguised as [[William Stryker]].  In a [[post-credits scene]], an Egyptian crowd is seen chanting to [[Apocalypse (comics)|En Sabah Nur]], who telekinetically elevates building blocks to forge [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]] as [[Horsemen of Apocalypse|four horsemen]] observe him from afar.<ref name=post></ref><ref name=Postcredits1></ref>

Nathan is diagnosed with autism early in the film, but strangely, his father was the only one who was able to connect normally with him. Although Nathan values his mother, Julie, he shuns any physical contact with her and treats her as more of a caretaker than a parent. Wanting to make sure Nathan isn’t distracted from his studies, Julie enrolls him in advanced classes at a new school. There, he comes under the tutelage of teacher Martin, also a math genius, who now suffers from multiple sclerosis. Martin sees himself in Nathan, once a promising young mind in the field of mathematics, who gave it all up once he was diagnosed with his illness.  Seven years later, Martin is preparing Nathan to compete for a place in the International Mathematical Olympiad, a prestigious high school competition consisting of the world’s best young mathematicians. This year, it is to be held at Cambridge, after a two-week math camp in Taiwan where the students will study for the test that determines the winners. Nathan fears he’s not good enough to qualify but ends up doing well enough to accompany 15 other British teenagers to Taiwan.  Suddenly thrust out of his comfort zone, Nathan finds himself no longer the smartest math whiz in the room, and his social anxieties nearly paralyze his performance. He has trouble reading the social cues of others and flinches at the slightest physical contact with another person. Nathan is paired with a female Chinese student, Zhang Mei, who slowly helps him adjust to his new surroundings and helps him fight through his fears. By the skin of their teeth, Nathan and Zhang make the cut to compete in Cambridge.  Back in England, Zhang stays with Nathan and his mother, who’s shocked to find that his behavior has transformed into something more normal. She becomes aware that he may have feelings for Zhang, which she asks him. Not fully understanding the concept of love, Nathan is unsure how to express his feelings. He keeps his emotions bottled up as they all travel to Cambridge and settle in for the Olympiad.  Things quickly unravel when Zhang’s uncle catches her in Nathan’s room one morning and mistakenly accuses them of being in an intimate relationship. This causes Zhang to withdraw from the competition and leave. Nathan, who now believes he loves Zhang, is torn between her and the Olympiad. When he sits down among hundreds of other students around the world for the exam, the first question triggers memories of his dead father, which combined with his newly lost love, creates an emotional overload. At the pinnacle moment of his mathematical career, Nathan must make a decision whether to stay and pursue his dream, or give in to the pain that’s haunted him for most of his life.  Nathan rushes out of the exam hall with Martin and Julie in tow. The latter finds him in a café, where he speaks of his emotional overload, both thanks to the loss of his father and the girl who appreciated and loved him, Zhang Mei. They embrace at last, then Julie drives Nathan to the station to fetch back Zhang Mei.

Barry asks Chalker to take him to Brooke's studio, unaware that a paramilitary group has taken her captive in the back of a truck that serves as a mobile lab for mad scientist Doc. While Doc experiments on the zombies and Brooke, Chalker's truck stops working. Chalker and Barry continue on foot, and Benny, another survivor, mistakenly kills Chalker. Benny, who previously had to kill his infected brother, and Barry team up and come upon a garage staffed by Frank and his assistant. Frank explains that all flammable liquids have become useless. However, the group accidentally discovers zombie breath and blood are flammable, and they devise a zombie-powered engine. During their escape, Frank's assistant becomes infected and is used as fuel.  Barry, Benny, and Frank discover zombies stop breathing flammable gas at night, enabling them to run faster. As they hole up in the truck overnight, Frank says he believes the zombies resulted from the meteor shower; as told in the Bible, a star called Wyrmwood has fallen, making part of the world bitter. After waking up from a nightmare, Barry catches a zombie on fire and accidentally sets the truck's compressor alight. While putting out the fire, Frank is bitten and asks Barry to shoot him; Barry does. The next day, Barry and Benny encounter paramilitaries in an electric-powered truck. The two drivers, after revealing that those with an A negative blood type are not affected by the disease, offer to lead Barry and Benny to Brooke, who they claim is in custody nearby. Meanwhile, Brooke learns she can now telepathically control zombies as a result of the experiments. With the help of several zombies, she kills Doc, escapes the truck, and joins Barry and Benny.  Barry's truck stalls after the soldiers accidentally kill the zombie powering it. While taking a pit stop for Brooke to fetch them a zombie, Benny is shot in the stomach. When they later pull over to take care of Benny, the soldiers catch up and subdue them. The soldiers reveal their plan is to decapitate Brooke and take her head to their commanding officer. Barry plans to kill them all in an explosion, but Benny instead sacrifices himself to turn into a zombie so Brooke can control him to overpower the soldiers. He kills two of the three soldiers, but the captain kills him and shoots Brooke in the chest. Barry challenges him to a fistfight but ends up shot when the captain retrieves his pistol. After shooting a zombie, the captain's face is splattered with zombie blood, and Barry ignites his head with the matches. Before Barry can shoot him, Brooke rises and commands a horde of zombies to eat the captain alive.  Barry and Brooke, back on the road, come across the lab truck again. They ask the soldiers what they have in the back of the truck; when they refuse to answer, Brooke commands a new group of zombies to attack them and tear them apart.

Yevadu
 Satya and Deepthi are lovers living in Visakhapatnam. A dreaded don, Veeru Bhai, lusts for Deepthi. When Deepthi's parents are killed, she and Satya escape. They board a bus on route to Hyderabad, but the bus is stopped unexpectedly and boarded by three men: Veeru's henchman Deva, Veeru's brother Ajay, and a corrupt police inspector, Shravan. They kill Deepthi in front of Satya, and he suffers an almost-fatal stab wound. Before the three leave, they set fire to the bus, leaving Satya to his death after stabbing him. However, Dr. Shailaja saves Satya by giving him a new face and skin. Ten months later, Satya wakes up from his coma.  Under the pseudonym of Ram, Satya returns to Visakhapatnam where he meets a model named Shruti, whom Veeru likes. Befriending Shruti, he takes advantage of his new unknown face, and lures Deva to a half-constructed apartment (or unconstructed building), where Satya kills Deva. A photo of Deva is discovered by assistant commissioner Ashok Varma, which has been marked with a "1". Satya then files a report on Deepthi with the police, stating that she has been missing for ten days. Since Shravan knows that Deepthi was killed ten months earlier, he becomes suspicious of Satya in his new persona, and follows him to a mall, where Satya kills him. During the investigation on Shravan's death, Satya presents himself to Varma as an eyewitness. When asked to provide a description of the killer, Satya describes his former face. Satya then manipulates Ajay to fall in love with Shruti and gets the two of them to pose in compromising positions for some pictures, under the pretense that they will be used as a promotion to assist Shruti in getting an opportunity to audition for the female lead in a film. Instead, Satya sends copies of the pictures to Veeru, to turn him against both Ajay and Shruti. Satya then convinces Ajay that the only way to save Shruti from Veeru's ire is to kill Veeru, which would also allow Ajay to gain his brother's position. However, Veeru's henchmen kill Ajay, but Veeru is himself killed by Satya, who reveals his true identity. He apologises to Shruti for using her, before leaving.  His vengeance fulfilled, Satya departs from Visakhapatnam. On the way, a stranger attacks Satya, but is killed. Suspecting that the attack might have something to do with his new face, Satya visits Dr. Shailaja. When they meet, Shailaja confesses that she has given Satya the face of her deceased son, Charan; she then goes on to explain the circumstances surrounding Charan's death. Charan was a happy-go-lucky rich graduate who hung out with his friends and girlfriend, Manju. One of his friends, Shashank, questions the local don, Dharma, regarding his illegal acquisition of lands by exploiting the slum people. Threatened, Dharma kills Shashank, after which Charan begins to raise support among the local population to revolt against Dharma. Again threatened, Dharma approaches another one of Charan's friends, Sharath, promising to establish his political career if he kills Charan. Charan and Sharath go to Visakhapatnam to attend a wedding. On their return, they board the same bus as Satya and Deepthi. When the bus was stopped, Sharath pulls a knife on Charan and the two engage in a fight. Veeru's men simultaneously enter the bus. Deepthi is killed inside the bus while Charan and Sharath's struggle has led them outside the bus, where Charan is stabbed to death. Charan's body is sent to Shailaja, who after observing Satya's urge to live decides to transplant her son's face onto Satya, rather than simple plastic surgery. Before Shailaja could inform Satya about Charan, Satya had left the hospital.  Leaving Shailaja, Satya visits the slum, under the guise of Charan. After meeting the locals, he decides to avenge Charan's death. First, he meets Sharath in a political meeting and, using the shock of Charan seemingly being alive, makes him kill Dharma. Satya makes the slum people follow Sharath to Dharma's house. Sharath stabs Dharma, who in turn kills Sharath. However, the mob, which has followed Satya, finally kills Dharma. Afterwards, Manju is shown living in a distant land, mourning Charan's death. The film ends with Satya meeting her.

The Young Blood Chronicles
  The plot is based on the uncut long-form edit of the movie. The original was split into 11 separate music videos, each released individually, beginning with the music video for "Light‘Em Up" and ending with "Save Rock and Roll."  ===The Phoenix=== The Defenders of the Faith ([[Fall Out Boy]]) are in possession of a glowing briefcase, which Patrick handcuffs to his left hand. As he heads out down the sidewalk, he sees a young boy that distracts him while a woman stuns him from behind with a taser, then kidnaps him. Patrick is taken to a room where he is tied to a chair and his hand is strapped to a cutting board by two women. After some tormenting, the women cut off Patrick's hand, freeing the briefcase. They continue to torture him by inserting probes into him and removing some of his organs. The young boy (who appears throughout the movie) delivers Patrick's hand in a plastic bag to Pete's house. After finding the hand, Pete releases a falcon that symbolizes "The Phoenix." The other members are also kidnapped: Andy in a parking lot, Joe at a gas station and Pete on a rooftop.  ===Young Volcanoes=== The Vixens bring Pete, Andy and Joe to a dinner table, at which Patrick is already seated. They are strapped to chairs and hooked to intravenous drips. They are served blood wine, hookahs and snuffable colored powder resembling cocaine. The women then serve them cobbler, fruit and Patrick's organs. The drugs make them believe they are dancing with their captors and naked women wearing bloody animal masks, yet are left still bound to their chairs. The briefcase is delivered to a vehicle with the license plate "RATATAT".  ===Alone Together=== Patrick, Pete, Andy and Joe are bound and set up to be tormented in separate rooms in an abandoned building. Patrick is hooked to machines in a chapel, Pete surrounded by paparazzi-like mannequins, Joe subjected to angry children throwing food and Andy forced to listen to music and watch television. Pete seduces one of his captors, then kills her with a hook she was wearing. He runs down the corridors of the building looking for the others while escaping the Vixens. Pete frees "The Herald" ([[Big Sean]]) and while attempting to rescue Patrick, attaches the hook to where his hand was. Pete fails to free him as the women shot him with a tranquilizing dart. In the meantime, the device Patrick is hooked to slowly turns him more and more evil.  The band is forced, handcuffed and blindfolded, into a van.  ===My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up)=== "The Problem Solver" ([[2 Chainz]]), with assistance from Vixens, burn various Fall Out Boy merchandise. The video ends by showing the tied up and bound "Defenders" in the back of a van.  ===The Mighty Fall=== The van "The Defenders" are trapped in is set on fire, but they are unbound by Patrick's hook and escape in time. They are welcomed to a gang of children, armed with various weapons. The band flees to the woods, with the kids on their tail. All but Patrick are eventually caught and beaten by the children. Patrick escapes to an open patch of the forest. The leader of the children (the young boy featured in "The Phoenix") plays a boombox, the sound from which transforms Patrick to his evil state. The Herald ([[Big Sean]]) saves Patrick and "The Defenders" by killing the boy, yet is killed himself by the Vixens. The remaining children cease their violence and flee, while the band members they have beaten all collapse in the woods.  ===Just One Yesterday=== The band wakes up the next morning in the forest, separated and barely aware of what happened the night before. While desperately looking for help and civilization, they each encounter the same snake from the previous Young Volcanoes video, which triggers their memories. Patrick hitches a ride from a woman driving a truck ([[Foxes (singer)|Foxes]]) who finds and picks up the rest of the Defenders. She pulls up to an abandoned hospital, where it is revealed that she, "The Death Adder", is also evil. She plays her truck's radio, (the same music in the boy's boom box) sending Patrick back into his trance. Pete, Andy and Joe flee into the hospital as Patrick preys on them.  ===Where Did The Party Go=== Pete, Andy and Joe split up and hide in different parts of the hospital as Patrick searches for them. Patrick hallucinates, seeing zombie nurses and patients partying, yet still continues his hunt. Pete tries to fix a phone to dial for help, Andy treats his wounds and Joe hides in a closet. Eventually Patrick tracks down Joe and strangles him to death with an extension cord. As Pete and Andy come upon the murder, Patrick then exits his trance, horrified at what he has done.  ===Death Valley===  Joe, on his way to heaven, is stopped by the elevator boy (the deceased leader of the gang of children from "The Mighty Fall") and is sent to hell instead.  Patrick is detained by law enforcement and his hook is removed for booking and detainment. Pete and Andy are brought in for questioning. Joe is checked in to the nightclub of hell, where he meets "The Prince of Darkness" ([[Tommy Lee]]) and parties with him and the other souls there. After receiving a note with an address, Pete and Andy meet up with a secret informer from the inside, who explains who kidnapped them and their agenda. She presents Pete with a bass-neck sword and Andy a drum crossbow. Andy has a substantially long make out scene with the woman before they head off to the clan's headquarters. Joe is abruptly taken up a flight of stairs by two mysterious gentlemen, while Patrick is released by police to the Vixens.  It is revealed the Vixens are cult of music-hating women whose goal is to "Silence the Noise."  ===Rat-a-Tat=== "The Head Bitch in Charge" ([[Courtney Love]]) rallies her fellow cult members to destroy various instruments while Pete and Andy infiltrate the building in search of Patrick and the briefcase. Two of the Vixens drag Patrick to a room and strap him down, subjecting him to videos which further his hypnosis to a fully evil state. He is taken to The Head Bitch, who tests his music-hating abilities, which he successfully passes by destroying instruments. Pete and Andy finally find Patrick, the leader of the cult, and the briefcase. Pete escapes with the briefcase but Andy's throat is sliced by two vixens while covering for Pete. The scene ends with Patrick chasing after Pete.  ===Miss Missing You=== Patrick catches up with Pete in the iconic black and white Death Valley, and chases him through a junk yard and a trailer park. After running through and fighting in several homes, they battle head to head outside with people cheering them on. Pete stabs Patrick with his sword, but Patrick finishes him off with his hook, then dies from his wounds. The Vixens retrieve the briefcase, while Pete and Patrick lay lifeless in the sand.  ===Save Rock and Roll=== The elevator boy, unsure if Patrick is truly evil or not, sends him to purgatory. His evilness is tested by seeing whether he will murder someone. After refusing to, Patrick is sent to heaven where he is met by his band mates. They all receive communion and meet "God" ([[Elton John]]) who presents them with powerful instruments. After performing in heaven, "God" sends them back to earth to "Save Rock and Roll" and, with their instruments, they transform the cult women back to good. Unfortunately, the briefcase is opened by the evil cult and a demon emerges who then slays anyone in sight. The movie ends with Fall Out Boy (who are covered in blood) confronting the demon, with Pete using his power to neutralize the demon and causing its blood to splatter on "God".  
Young Ones (film)
 In a post-drought apocalypse United States, people kill for water. Ernest Holm lives with his son Jerome and daughter Mary in their small townhouse and field. His wife has been involved in an accident earlier and is now permanently hospitalized in a facility where she can walk while wired to a special frame. While everyone else has left the area, Ernest and his family remain, as Ernest believes that the land will grow once more if only there is irrigation. Ernest gets water for his family by delivering supplies to the "water men" who extract water from deep wells through a government deal. When his mule breaks its legs and he has to kill it, Ernest goes to Sam Lever's auction house and buys a robotic carrier machine called Simulit Shadow ("Sim") to replace it, beating the offers of Flem Lever, Sam's son, a young, troubled man who has been seeing Mary without Ernest's consent.  One morning, Ernest finds the Sim is missing, and he goes looking for it. When he gets to the water men, he is accused of stealing their supplies. He finds Flem transporting the stolen supplies with the Sim; Flem plans to sell them at the border. Ernest takes Flem captive, ties him to the machine, and aims to take the supplies back to the water men. When they stop due to dehydration, Flem convinces Ernest to rehydrate with the liquor they are transporting. Wanting to escape, Flem throws a stone at Ernest's head and [[frame-up|frames]] the machine for Ernest's death.  Flem marries Mary after helping the family obtain illegal irrigation from the water men, thus saving their farm, which was originally Flem's father's. But after finding out Ernest had overwhelming debts to repay to a bank, which is now going to repossess the farm, Flem tricks his friend Robbie into selling his baby behind his wife's back. Robbie is killed and the Sim is lost in an altercation with the buyers. However, the machine returns limping and mangled to its manufacturer, who resides in a city across the border. The owner, Calvin Hooyman, reaches Jerome at the Holm residence via CB radio, informing him about the machine.  Jerome crosses the border with the help of Anna, a girl who lives with the "settlers", people fighting back against the government's regulations and considered terrorists. Jerome meets Calvin, who gives the repaired Sim back to him, and shows Jerome how the machine's laser sensor behaves like a rudimentary video recorder. Jerome plays the recording and finds the truth about Ernest's death. Arriving home before Flem, Jerome questions him as to how the machine found its way home, since Flem claimed to have sold it in order to repay the debt. Flem's lies only infuriate Jerome more, but at first he takes no action. Instead, he lures Flem out in the desert by posing as Robbie via radio and letters, ultimately causing Flem to fall into a pit trap and break his legs. As Flem cries for help, Jerome, who has been secretly following him, comes at the pit's mouth. Flem realizes that Jerome knows about what happened to Ernest. He tries to elicit Jerome's mercy, but Jerome coldly shoots him in the head. Jerome ultimately decides to withhold these events and the circumstances of Ernest's death from Mary, who is pregnant with Flem's child. Brother and sister remain in the house, planning to bring their mother there from the hospital now that they can pay for her brace wires, and wishing the baby will be a girl.  The film is divided into three chapters, named after the main character in each of them: "Ernest Holm", "Flem Lever", and "Jerome Holm", respectively.  
Z Storm
 This is a story about the biggest financial fraud attempted in Hong Kong, directed at the Government of Hong Kong and all 7 million Hong Kong citizens... no one is free from the scheme.

High-profile chartered accountants, high ranking law enforcers, power lawyers, the super entrepreneurs; they all have their shares of play but none can really grasp the big picture; they are there only for what they desire most. When the wife of an up-rising star Superintendent of police force reported his corruption simply out of bitterness for being ill-treated, little did she know she is about to pull the head string from a very well weaved web of deceive, greed, sex, power, and last but not least, fear. The ICAC agent Luk ([[Louis Koo]]) who took charge of the simple complaint felt otherwise... it's his passion for justice that has been driving him all these years in the battle against bribery and corruption, even after losing his beloved wife. Further investigation soon revealed many unanswered questions and loose ends...the death of an ex-godfather status accountant of Hong Kong, the threats to even the seemingly harmless witnesses and informers, and the surfacing of a mysterious lady, all have connection with Luk's wanted list but with a background as simple and as tragic as a girl next door with cancer. As Luk dug deeper into the web, he is being hunted by trained foreign mercenaries; a tactic very seldom or never heard of in the history of Hong Kong's underworld! With the support of his superior the old but streetwise Deputy Chief of ICAC, Yu ([[Cheung Siu-fai]]), Luk eventually unlocked the door to the plan, but only after a bloodbath gun battle which almost cost him his life and that of the attractive mysterious woman, Angel ([[Dada Chan]]).

Zombeavers
 While transporting toxic chemicals, a pair of truckers (John Mayer and Bill Burr) strike a deer and lose one of their canisters.  It rolls into a river, floats downstream, and splashes several beavers at their dam.  Later, college students Mary, Zoe, and Jenn arrive at Mary's cousin's cabin near the dam.  Although Zoe and Jenn are distraught that there is no cell phone coverage, Mary insists that they spend the next two days without interruptions from technology or boys.  While swimming at the lake, the girls discover the beaver dam.  When Jenn swims closer to see a beaver, they are surprised by a bear.  Smyth, a local hunter, scares off the bear and admonishes the girls to stay away from the beavers and dress more appropriately.  At night, the girls' boyfriends – Buck, Tommy, and Sam – arrive and play a prank on them.  Annoyed, Mary orders them to leave, but Zoe, who knew they were coming, insists they stay.  Jenn talks Mary into letting them stay, as she wants to resolve her relationship issues with Sam, who has cheated on her.  As the couples separate, Jenn leaves to take a shower, only to be attacked by a beaver.  Tommy kills it with a baseball bat, but Jenn and Mary feel something is wrong with it beyond rabies.  They put the corpse in a bag and put it outside on the porch.  In the morning, they discover it is missing, and Jenn insists that it was not merely eaten by wildlife.  All but Jenn go swimming in the lake.  Sam and Mary discuss whether to tell Jenn about their affair, but they are interrupted when beavers chew off Buck's foot and scratch Tommy.  The same beaver that attacked Jenn earlier chases her back to the house.  She pins it to the counter with a knife, but not before it scratches her leg.  Sam throws Zoe's dog into the water as a distraction, and the rest of the group flee to the house, where they realize the beavers have cut the phone lines.  As zombie beavers surround the house, Tommy offers to leave with Buck to get help, and Zoe accompanies him.  The beavers bring down a tree in the road, and Tommy sets off on foot, only to be crushed by another falling tree.  Smyth rescues Buck and Zoe, and they return to the house, which the others have boarded up.  Unable to enter it, they go to the neighbors' house.  They discover the neighbors are dead, and their phone lines cut.  As a result of her wounds, Jenn turns into a beaver-like zombie and attacks Mary.  As Jenn's saliva falls in Mary's mouth, Sam rescues Mary by hitting Jenn from behind.  Mary and Sam lock themselves in the bathroom and check each other for scratches.  Satisfied that neither is wounded, they begin to have sex, but Jenn interrupts them and kills Sam by biting off his penis.  Meanwhile, Buck turns into a zombie and attacks Smyth.  Zoe escapes by jumping through a window, bloodying herself in the process.  As a beaver accidentally sets Mary's cousin's house on fire, Sam rises as a zombie.  Once Mary kills Sam, she reunites with Zoe.  Smyth, now zombified, shoots at them as they flee in his truck.  Jenn jumps on top the truck, but Zoe runs her over.  Together, Mary and Zoe reach the spot where Tommy died and turned into a zombie.  With the road blocked, they decide to walk.  Believing that Zoe may be bitten due to her bloody appearance, Mary holds her at gunpoint with a pistol recovered from Smyth's truck.  As Zoe protests that she is not infected, Mary begins changing into a zombie.  Zoe kills her with an axe and walks away.  On the road, she encounters the same truckers who had earlier dropped the canister, and they run over her accidentally.  In a post-credits sequence, a honeybee becomes infected from a corpse and returns to its hive in a zombified state.
