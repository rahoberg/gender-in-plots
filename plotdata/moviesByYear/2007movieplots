3:10 to Yuma (2007 film)
 Dan Evans (Bale) is an impoverished rancher and [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]] veteran. He owes money to Glen Hollander (Loftin) and when he fails to pay, two of Hollander's men set fire to his barn. The next morning, as Evans and his two sons William (Lerman) and Mark look for their herd, they stumble upon outlaw Ben Wade (Crowe) and his gang, who have taken advantage of Evans' cattle in order to block the road and ambush an armored [[stagecoach]] staffed by [[Pinkerton Government Services|Pinkerton]] agents. As Wade's outfit loots the upended stage, Wade discovers Evans and his two sons watching from the hills. Determining that they pose no threat to him and his gang, Wade takes their horses and tells Evans that he will leave them tied up on the road to [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]]. Wade's gang departs, and Evans rescues the lone surviving coach guard, Byron McElroy (Fonda), left alive but severely wounded by Wade.  Wade travels with his gang to Bisbee to celebrate at the local saloon and divide up the loot, then chooses to stay behind to enjoy the company of the barmaid while his gang departs. Evans arrives separately with McElroy and delivers him to Doc Potter (Tudyk), then tries in vain to negotiate with Hollander, who shoves him to the ground and departs. Enraged, Evans barges into the saloon looking for him, but instead encounters Wade emerging from an upstairs room. Evans coaxes a few dollars from Wade over the trouble the outlaw has caused him, delaying the outlaw long enough for the railroad men to ambush and arrest him.  The railroad's representative, Grayson Butterfield, enlists McElroy, Potter, Tucker (one of Hollander's men), and Evans, to deliver Wade to [[Contention City, Arizona|Contention]], where Wade will be put on the 3:10 afternoon train to [[Yuma Territorial Prison]]. Evans requests a $200 fee to deliver Wade for transport, which Butterfield accepts. From Evans' ranch, McElroy arranges a [[decoy]] wagon to distract Wade's gang, now led by [[Charlie Prince]], with the real prisoner transport departing later that night.  During the journey, both Tucker and McElroy provoke Wade, who in turn kills them. Wade attempts to escape, but is stopped when William appears, having followed the group all the way from the ranch. When the group is then attacked by [[Apache (tribe)|Apache]]s, Wade kills the attackers and escapes to a [[coolie|Chinese laborer]] construction camp, where the foreman captures him. Evans, William, Potter and Butterfield arrive to regain custody of their prisoner, but the local posse is unwilling to give him up, and a fight ensues. The group manages to escape, but Potter is killed in the process. The remaining foursome arrives in Contention hours before the train's arrival time and check into a hotel, where several [[Marshal#State and local marshals|local marshal]]s join them.  Wade's gang members ambush the decoy wagon, interrogating the lone survivor before killing him, then depart for Contention. Upon arriving, Prince offers a reward to any citizen who shoots any of Wade's captors, and numerous men volunteer, causing the town's marshals to desert immediately, only to be killed by Wade's men. Butterfield resigns as well, but agrees to keep William safe, as Evans is determined to complete the mission.  Evans escorts Wade out of the hotel, and the two make their way across town, evading continuous gunfire from the combined gang and townsmen. Wade surprises Evans and nearly strangles him, but relents when Evans reveals that delivering Wade to the train is not only to provide for his family, but to restore his own sense of honor, and give his sons something good to remember him for. Wade then admits he has already been to Yuma Prison and escaped twice, and agrees to board the train, allowing Evans' contract to be fulfilled.  Wade helps Evans evade his gang, and as he finally boards the train, congratulates Evans, but Prince appears from behind and shoots Evans despite Wade's order to stop. Wade steps off the train, and when Prince returns his gun belt, abruptly executes Prince along with the rest of his gang. William appears and draws his gun on Wade but does not kill him, instead turning to his dying father. Wade boards the train and politely surrenders his weapon. Evans dies as William tells him he accomplished his mission and got the money. As the train disappears around a bend, Wade whistles, and his faithful horse pricks up his ears and gallops after the train indicating that Wade is planning to escape.  
4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days
 In 1987, two university students in an unnamed [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romanian]] town, Otilia Mihartescu and Gabriela "Găbița" Dragut, are roommates in a dormitory. When Găbița becomes pregnant, the two young women arrange a meeting with Mr. Bebe in a hotel, where he is to perform an [[abortion in Romania|illegal abortion]].  At the college dorm, Găbița and Otilia review the items they need for the day. As Găbița nervously sits and waits, Otilia [[black market|barters and buys]] soap and cigarettes from the dormitory shop. Afterwards, Otilia takes a bus to visit her boyfriend Adi, from whom she borrows money. Adi asks Otilia to visit his family that night, as it is his mother's birthday. Otilia initially declines, relenting after Adi becomes upset.  Otilia heads to the Unirea hotel where Găbița has booked a room, only to be informed by an unfriendly receptionist that there is no reservation under Găbița's last name. Consequently, Otilia visits another hotel, the Tineretului, and after much begging and haggling, is able to book a room at an expensive rate. After speaking with Găbița on the telephone, Otilia goes to a rendezvous point to meet with Mr. Bebe, although he had asked Găbița that she meet him personally. Mr. Bebe grows angry upon hearing that Găbița is not at the planned hotel.  At the Tineretului, Mr. Bebe discovers that Găbița's claim that her pregnancy was in its second or third month was a lie, and that it has been at least four months. This changes the procedure and also adds the risk of a murder charge.  While the two women were certain that they would pay no more than 3,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]] for the abortion, it slowly becomes clear that Mr. Bebe expects both women to have sex with him. Desperate and distressed, Otilia has sex with Mr. Bebe so that he will not walk out on them, as does Găbița. Mr. Bebe then performs the abortion by injecting a probe and an unnamed fluid into Găbița's uterus, and leaves Otilia instructions on how to dispose of the fetus when it comes out. Otilia is exasperated by Găbița's lies, yet continues to help and care for her.  Otilia leaves Găbița at the Tineretului to attend Adi's mother's birthday party. She is still disturbed but stays and has dinner with Adi's mother's friends, who are mostly doctors. They converse about trivial matters while Otilia and Adi remain silent. After Otilia accepts a cigarette in front of Adi's parents, one of the guests starts talking about lost values and respect for elders. Adi and Otilia retreat to his room, where she tells him about Găbița's abortion. They begin debating what would happen if it were Otilia who was pregnant, as Adi is opposed to abortion. After the argument, Otilia calls Găbița from Adi's house. Găbița does not answer, so Otilia decides to return to the hotel.  When Otilia enters the hotel room Găbița is lying on the bed, and she tells Otilia that the fetus has been expelled and is in the bathroom. Otilia wraps the fetus with some towels and puts it in a bag, while Găbița asks her to bury it. Otilia walks outside, finally climbing to the top of a building, as Mr. Bebe had suggested, and dropping the bag in a trash chute. She returns to the Tineretului and finds Găbița sitting in its restaurant. Otilia sits and tells Găbița that they are never going to talk about the episode again. Otilia stares blankly at Găbița.

12 (2007 film)
 The [[jury]] decides whether a young [[Chechen people|Chechen]] boy is guilty of the murder of his stepfather, a Russian military officer. Initially it seems that the boy was the murderer. However, one of the jurors ([[Sergei Makovetsky]]) votes in favour of acquittal. Since the [[verdict]] must be rendered unanimously, the jurors review the case, and one by one come to the conclusion that the boy was framed. The murder was performed by criminals involved in the [[construction]] business. The discussion is repeatedly interrupted by [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s from the boy's [[First Chechen War|wartime]] childhood.  In the end the foreman states that he was sure the boy did not commit the crime but he will not vote in favour of acquittal since the acquitted boy will be subsequently killed by the same criminals. In addition, the foreman reveals that he is a former [[intelligence agency]] officer. After a brief argument, the foreman agrees to join the majority. Later the foreman tells the boy that he will find the murderers.  
Las 13 rosas
 In [[Siege of Madrid|Madrid in 1939]] during the final days of the Spanish Civil War, Virtudes and Carmen, two young idealistic Republican militants, are encouraging their neighbours to keep faith in the cause of the Republic. However, the entry of [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|victorious troops]] into the city is eminent. Fearing the bloody repression that was coming, many Republicans are fleeing the country while others are unable or unwilling to do so.  Julia, a streetcar attendant, and her friend Adelina, a Red Cross worker, are also active sympathizers of the Spanish Republic. While spending an evening in a nightclub watching musicians perform, one of the last bombings of the city takes place. In those dire circumstances they befriend Blanca, whose husband Enrique is the musicians' band leader.  The triumph of the Francoist troops marks a dark turning point in the lives of those who sympathized with the Republic. Canepa, one of the musicians in Enrique's band, is a Republican militant. Fearing for his life, he decides to leave the country. Blanca, Enrique's wife, gives him some money to help him on his way. Meanwhile, Julia strikes up a relationship with dapper young nationalist soldier Perico.  It is rumoured that there was a plot to assassinate Franco on his victorious entry into the capital, and the nationalists are seeking revenge. Although the girls have nothing to do with it, they have been targeted for their propagandistic leftist activities. The first to be arrested is Julia, who, before too long, is being sadistically tortured by the orders of Fontenla, the cold-hearted officer in charge of the interrogations. Adelina, Virtudes' co-worker, like most of the others is a member of a socialist group. She is turned in by her well-meaning father in the naïve belief that nothing serious will happen to her and that she is just wanted for questioning.  Canepa and Teo are turned in by friends and neighbours and are tortured. Canepa commits suicide while under arrest. Teo has better luck and is eventually released on the condition that he has to secretly help to identify and capture his friends, sympathisers of the Republic. With Teo's help, one by one the girls are arrested, and soon they have all been jailed. Only Carmen, the youngest of the girls of the group, realises Teo's double-crossing, but she is also arrested. Blanca also suffers the same fate. Her crime is to have given Canepa some money. After suffering heavy police interrogations, the young group of women are eventually transferred to an overcrowded prison.  The reunion of the girls in jail serves as a consolation to their dire circumstances. At one point, they even enjoy a bit of tap-dancing. Their families, including Adelina's grief-stricken father, are hoping that they will eventually be released. Blanca is worried about her small son that she was forced to leave behind. Her admirable behaviour and her serenity while in jail made her gain the respect of the woman in charge of the prison.  However, their situation worsens when the group of women complain of the terrible sanitary condition for the children imprisoned with their mothers. As a protest they jointly refused to sing the praises of the Franco regime. The fate of the 13 young women is sealed when two military officers and an innocent woman are killed in cold blood by a group of leftist militants. As a punishment, the regime orders the execution of some of the prisoners, though they have nothing to do with what has happened while they are in jail. A military court condemns the 48 men and 13 women to death in less than 48 hours.  Carmen, the youngest of all, is the only survivor of the group. Desolated, she listens to the shots that killed her terrified friends.  The final frame of the film asserts that the bulk of the content is verifiable from documentation and that the script relies heavily on actual dialogue or writings from the central characters.

28 Weeks Later
 During the original outbreak of the Rage Virus, Don, his wife Alice and four more survivors hide in a barricaded cottage on the outskirts of [[London]]. They hear a terrified boy pounding at their door and let him in. A few minutes later, they discover that the infected have followed the boy. The infected attack and kill most of the survivors, while Don, Alice and the boy are chased upstairs. Don pleads with Alice to abandon the boy but she refuses. He abandons them as the infected break into their room by busting out of the window. Don sprints to a nearby motorboat, narrowly escaping after a tussle with a recently turned survivor.  After the infected begin to die of starvation, [[NATO]] forces take control of [[Great Britain|Britain]]. Twenty-eight weeks after the outbreak, an American commanded force, under the command of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] Stone, brings in settlers. Among the new arrivals are Don and Alice's children, Tammy and Andy, who were out of the country during the outbreak. They are admitted to District One, a safe zone on the [[Isle of Dogs]], guarded by the [[United States Army|US Army]]. Sergeant Doyle, a [[Delta Force]] sniper and his friend, Chief Flynn, a helicopter pilot, are amongst the troops guarding the district. Tammy and Andy are reunited with their father, who was found by the US Army and has become the district's caretaker. In their new flat, Don fabricates a lie about the circumstances surrounding their mother's death.  That night, Andy dreams about forgetting his mother's face, so Tammy and Andy sneak out of the safe zone and return to their former home, where they collect family photographs and other mementos. To his shock, Andy finds Alice alive and uninfected in a semi-conscious, delirious state. The three are soon discovered by soldiers and taken back to District One. Alice is taken to a quarantine room, where she is tested and found to be an [[asymptomatic carrier]] of the rage virus.  Don makes an unauthorised visit to Alice in her isolation cell, begging her to forgive him. She accepts his apology and tells him she loves him; when they kiss, Don is infected, savagely kills her and goes on a rampage.  General Stone orders the building to be quarantined and orders a Code Red alert in District One. Civilians are herded into safe rooms but despite the precautions, Don breaks into a room full of people and starts a domino effect of rapid infection. The crowd, with half its members infected, breaks out of the safe room and into the streets. Scarlet, a US Army medical officer, rescues Tammy and Andy as the soldiers in District One are ordered to shoot indiscriminately. Doyle, unable to bring himself to comply with the order, abandons his post and escapes with Scarlet, Tammy, Andy and several others through the [[Greenwich Foot Tunnel]]. Stone orders District One to be firebombed but large numbers of the infected, including Don, escape the bombardment. Scarlet informs Doyle that the children might hold the key to a cure and must be protected.  Flynn arrives by helicopter to pick up Doyle but refuses to take anyone else, as they would be shot down for carrying people who might be infected. Flynn contacts Doyle by radio and tells him to leave the civilians and head to [[Wembley Stadium]]. Doyle ignores his instructions and escorts Andy, Tammy and Scarlet to Wembley. They break into an abandoned Volvo V70 to escape [[nerve gas]] released to kill the infected but are unable to start the car while soldiers with flamethrowers draw near. Doyle exits the car and sacrifices himself by push starting the car and is burned alive. Scarlet escapes an Apache gunship and drives Tammy and Andy into the [[London Underground]], where the trio continues on foot. Don ambushes and kills Scarlet, then bites Andy.  Tammy shoots Don before he can kill Andy, who remains symptom-free but an unknown carrier of the Rage virus. They continue to the stadium and are picked up by a reluctant Flynn, who flies them across the [[English Channel]] to [[France]], as instructed by Doyle. Twenty-eight days later, a French-accented voice requesting help is heard from the radio in Flynn's abandoned helicopter. A group of the infected are then seen running through a tunnel which, as they emerge into the open, is revealed to be the exit of the [[Paris Métro]] [[Trocadéro (Paris Métro)|Trocadéro Station]] with a view across the Seine to the nearby [[Eiffel Tower]].  
30 Days of Night (film)
 The town of [[Barrow, Alaska]] is preparing for its annual "30 Days of Night", a period during the winter when there is a month-long [[polar night]]. As the town gets ready, a stranger ([[Ben Foster]]) rows ashore from a large ship and sabotages the town's communications and transport to the outside world. Barrow's sheriff, [[Eben Olemaun|Eben Oleson]] ([[Josh Hartnett]]) investigates and also learns that his estranged wife, [[Stella Olemaun|Stella]] ([[Melissa George]]), missed the last plane and must stay the 30 days. That night, a [[coven]] of [[feral]] [[vampire]]s, led by Marlow ([[Danny Huston]]), attack and slaughter most of the townspeople, forcing Eben, Stella, Eben's younger brother Jake ([[Mark Rendall]]), and several other survivors to take shelter in a boarded-up house with a hidden attic. Marlow finds the stranger locked up in the station.  The stranger believed Marlow was going to turn him into a vampire. Marlow thanks him for doing what he asked, and then snaps his neck.  Marlow ironically comments to his fellow vampires: "The things they believe."  Eighteen days later, when a blizzard hits, the group uses the [[whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] to go to the general store for supplies, but are stranded after it ends. While the group heads for the station, Eben creates a diversion by having the vampires chase him to his grandmother's house, where he uses one of her ultraviolet lights to burn the face of Marlow's lover, Iris ([[Megan Franich]]), so badly that Marlow is forced to kill her. As he escapes, the town snow plow operator, Beau ([[Mark Boone Junior]]), creates another distraction with his tractor, killing many of the vampires, before trying to blow himself up; when he fails, Marlow crushes his head. Eben arrives at the station, where he is then forced to kill Carter ([[Nathaniel Lees]]), who has been bitten and is turning into a vampire.  Two weeks later, Stella and Eben see the deputy, Billy ([[Manu Bennett]]), signaling them with a flashlight and bring him back to the station, after finding out he killed his family to save them from a more painful death. The trio find the others have made for the [[utilidor]], a power and sewage treatment station that still has power, and head over there but are separated after Stella saves Gail Robbins (Rachel Maitland-Smith), a young girl whose family was slaughtered by a vampire named Zurial (John Rawls) who was stalking her. Eben and Billy make it to the utilidor but are attacked by Arvin ([[Andrew Stehlin]]), who bites Billy; Billy knocks Arvin into the heavy-duty shredder, and in doing so, painfully grinds his own hand to a stump by accident, before being killed by Eben because he is starting to turn.  As the month comes to an end, with the sun due to rise, the vampires start to burn down the town to destroy evidence of their presence, and prevent any survivors from telling the world what happened. Realizing Stella is trapped and that he cannot beat the vampires in his current state, Eben turns himself into a vampire by injecting himself with Billy's infected blood. He confronts Marlow, and they get into a vicious fight, before Marlow is finally killed by having a hole punched through his head, causing the remaining vampires to flee. Knowing he will die soon, Eben and Stella go off to watch the sunrise together, sharing one last kiss. As the sun comes up, Eben's body burns to ash in Stella's arms, while she stares at the sky, coming to grips with what has happened.

He reports the call to his secretary, Shelly ([[Amy Brenneman]]), asking for a risk assessment profile of suspects.  Gramm receives another phone threat while teaching and becomes suspicious of his students, particularly Mike Stempt ([[Benjamin McKenzie]]). The Dean of Students, Carol Johnson ([[Deborah Kara Unger]]), interrupts the class to report a bomb threat. Evacuating, Gramm finds threats written both on the classroom's overhead projector and on his car, which has been vandalized in the parking garage. Gramm is then met by his teaching assistant, Kim Cummings ([[Alicia Witt]]), who offers to help find the perpetrator. In the stairwell, Gramm encounters one of his students, Lauren Douglas ([[Leelee Sobieski]]), attacked by an unknown assailant and reports the assault to campus security.   Gramm and Kim go to his condo, where a package has been delivered. The package contains an audio tape of his kid sister, Kate, crying for help before being murdered. Gramm concludes that someone accessed his secure files to obtain the tape. Kim's ex-husband, Guy LaForge ([[Stephen Moyer]]), appears with a gun at the apartment door, but is shot and killed from behind by an assailant masked by a motorcycle helmet. A fire alarm is triggered by the sudden onset of smoke and the shooter flees through the crowd outside. Shortly after, Gramm's car explodes, having been rigged with a bomb.  Renting a cab, Gramm explains to Kim that his sister was killed decades earlier, when he left her alone in his apartment; the crime took exactly 88 minutes. Next, Gramm and Kim visit Sara Pollard ([[Leah Cairns]]), a woman Gramm slept with the night before, but find her murdered in her apartment with evidence incriminating Gramm. Carol calls Gramm and makes comments suggesting that she is the killer, demanding that Gramm meet her at his office. Shelly arrives at Sara's apartment and advises Gramm that she suspects Lauren was the one who stole the audio tape of Kate's death. Kim disappears from the apartment and later calls Gramm with a threat similar to Carol's, also demanding he meet her at the office.  Through prison visitation records, Gramm deduces that Forster's appeals attorney "Lydia Doherty" is a pseudonym for Lauren, surmising that she set up the frame on orders from Forster. Kim calls again, instructing Gramm to come to another nearby location on campus, where he finds Carol hanging over a seventh floor balcony; Kim is tied up and gagged nearby, held at gun point by Lauren. Lauren forces Gramm to "confess" on tape that he gave false testimony at Forster's trial. Special Agent Parks arrives and shoots Lauren, causing both Carol and Lauren to partially fall from the balcony. Gramm saves Carol from completing the fall, but Lauren comes loose and plummets to her death. When Forster calls asking to speak with Lauren, Gramm informs him of Lauren's death. He quips "Tick-tock, tick-tock, you got 12 hours to live" before throwing the phone into the void. Gramm flashes back to interactions with Kate and Janie Cates, then pockets the device that recorded his "confession". He shares knowing glances with Parks and Kim before walking away.  
1408 (film)
 Mike Enslin is a [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynical]], [[Skepticism|skeptical]] author who is estranged from his wife Lily after the death of their daughter Katie. Mike writes unsuccessful books evaluating supernatural events in which he has no belief. After his latest book, he receives an anonymous postcard depicting The Dolphin, a hotel on [[Lexington Avenue]] in [[New York City]] bearing the message, "Don't enter 1408." Viewing this as a challenge, Mike arrives at The Dolphin and specifically requests to book room 1408.  The [[hotel manager]], Gerald Olin, attempts to discourage him. Gerald explains to Mike that in the last 95 years, no one has lasted more than an hour inside of Room 1408; the latest count is 56 deaths, both suicides and "natural" deaths. The horrors began with a [[Upper class|wealthy]] businessman named Kevin O'Malley, who inexplicably committed suicide in the room when the hotel opened. Mike appears unmoved by the story, so Gerald attempts to bribe him a very expensive bottle of cognac to prevent him from entering 1408. Accepting the bottle, Mike still insists on staying in the room and the preparations are reluctantly made.  Once inside the room, Mike describes on his [[mini-cassette]] recorder the room's boring appearance and its unimpressive lack of supernatural behavior. During his examination, the clock radio starts playing "[[We've Only Just Begun]]", a hit song by [[The Carpenters]]. Mike assumes that Olin is pulling a prank to scare him. At 8:07, the song plays again and the clock's digital display changes to a countdown starting from "60:00." The window slams down and wounds his hand. He begins to see hallucinations and ghosts of the room's past victims, and visions of his own dead family members, including his father and Katie. Mike's attempts to leave are in vain: the brass room key breaks and is sucked into the lock and the doorknob falls off; climbing through the air ducts prompts an attack from the corpse of O'Malley; and when he tries to escape to an adjacent room by walking along the outside window ledge he sees the windows of the other rooms have disappeared.  Mike uses his laptop to contact Lily, pleading with her to call the police, but the sprinkler system [[short circuit]]s his laptop. The room temperature drops to subzero when the laptop suddenly begins to work again, and Lily tells him the police have entered 1408, but the room is empty. A [[doppelgänger]] of Mike appears in a video chat window and urges Lily to come to the hotel herself; it gives Mike a sly wink. The room shakes violently and Mike breaks a picture of a ship in a storm. Water pours from the broken picture, flooding the room. He surfaces on a beach and relives a surfing accident seen earlier in the film. His life continues from this point, and he reconciles with Lily.  Assuming his experience in 1408 was just a [[nightmare]], Lily encourages him to write a book about it. When visiting the post office to send the manuscript to his publisher, he recognizes members of a construction crew as Dolphin Hotel staff. They demolish the post office walls, revealing Mike is still trapped in the rubble of 1408. Katie's ghost confronts Mike, and after some reluctance he embraces her, but she dies and crumbles to dust. When the countdown ends, the room is suddenly restored to normal, and the clock radio resets itself to 60:00.  The "hotel operator" calls Mike. When Mike asks why he hasn't just been killed already, "she" informs him that guests enjoy free will, and as such he can relive the past hour over and over again, or use their "express checkout system". A [[hangman's noose]] appears and Mike has a vision of himself hanged, but he refuses to give in. Deciding to quit running, Mike improvises a [[Molotov cocktail]] from a bottle of [[cognac]] given to him by Olin, and sets the room on fire. The fire alarm sounds, the hotel is evacuated, and Lily is prevented from entering. After smoking a [[cigarette]], Mike breaks a window, causing a [[backdraft]]. Mike then lies down on the floor and laughs in victory upon destroying the room. Two firemen break into the room and drag him out, and he warns them to not go in. Olin, in his office, says "Well done, Mr. Enslin".  Mike survives, and he and Lily are seen back together in their home, although she is unsure of the supernatural events he has explained to her. Lily finds a box of Mike's possessions that were rescued from 1408 and suggests disposing of them. Mike takes the mini-cassette recorder from the box, saying, "Sometimes you can't get rid of bad memories. You've just got to live with them." Lily now realizes Mike is ready to move on from his daughter's death. Suddenly they hear Katie's voice on the recorder, confirming his account.  
200 Pounds Beauty
 Hanna Kang is an overweight [[phone sex]] part-timer and a [[ghost singer]] for Ammy, a famous pop singer who actually [[lip sync]]s instead of being famous for her own vocal talent. Other than that, Hanna has a huge crush for Sang-jun who's a director and whose arrogant father owns the entertainment company. One day, Ammy purposely insults Hanna's weight in front of Sang-jun during his birthday party, knowing well that Hanna likes him. While crying in the restroom, Hanna overhears Sang-jun telling Ammy that even though they are just using Hanna for her voice, they must be kind to her so she will not walk out on them. Heartbroken, Hanna attempts suicide but is interrupted by a phone call from one of her phone sex regulars who is a top plastic surgeon. She persuades him to perform a head-to-toe plastic surgery operation on her. Hanna puts herself in seclusion for a year as she recovers from the changes from the surgery and weight loss.  When she comes back from the hospital, Hanna is incredibly beautiful and slender, that even her best friend Jung-min cannot recognize her at first. With Jung-min's help, Hanna creates a new identity for herself; she is now a Korean-American from California named Jenny. After auditioning to be Ammy's secret vocalist again, she earns her own recording contract instead from Sang-jun, claiming that she is "all-natural". In the meantime, Ammy desperately tries to find Hanna by spending time with Hanna's father who is in a hospital due to mental problems, possibly [[Alzheimer's]]. Sang-jun orders Ammy to give up her search for Hanna and give Jenny a chance to help him finish her album. Ammy refuses out of fear for possible competition for album sales with Jenny and is determined to find Hanna because she will come back to her like always. After many encounters with Jenny, they both realize that Jenny is actually Hanna.  Jenny's debut single "[[Maria (Blondie song)|Maria]]" becomes a hit and in the party to celebrate it, Ammy brings Hanna's father in an attempt to blow her cover. Desperate to keep her true identity a secret, Hanna ignores her father. Jung-min gets furious about her indifferent behavior. After the party, Sang-jun reveals to Jenny that he knows her true identity but is now cold and distant. He seems unable to forgive her for lying to him but says that he will conduct her concert scheduled the next day. Hanna also confesses her love for him that made her to do such a thing. After realizing how worthless she was to him even as Jenny, Hanna tearfully refuses to have anything to do with him and leaves. When she tells the plastic surgeon about it, he makes Hanna realize that she's better off without Sang-jun. Before the concert, Ammy threatens Sang-jun that she will reveal Jenny`s deception if the concert was not cancelled. Even his father agrees and confronts Sang-jun for the deception after being sent photos by Ammy. He orders the release of Hanna’s X-Rated CD covers and the discontinuation of the concert, not wanting to lose money. Sang-jun stands up against her threat and his father's orders by refusing to cancel it. Sang-jun encourages a distraught Hanna to do this concert, not for the sake of the fans or the company but for herself. At the concert, Hanna proceeds tearfully to tell the large crowd her story: that she was a ghost singer to an ungrateful Ammy while she was overweight, how she went into a year of seclusion to heal from the changes from the surgery and that she has abandoned everything that is dear to her, including her best friend and father, to get to where she is. Sang-jun plays a tape of the old, obese Hanna, singing. The crowd, moved by her sincere confession, responds by chanting "It's okay". Hanna rekindles her relationships with her father and best friend. She drops the stage-name Jenny and re-releases a CD with her own name, Hanna, and becomes a highly successful music artist. Despite her having moved on from her crush on him, Sang-jun realizes the very thing about Hanna that had always drawn him to her was Hanna's innocence, and continues to promote her. It's also implied without the supportive fans and exposure of her lack of singing voice, Ammy has faded into obscurity.  During the post credits, Jung-min also asks to get a head-to-toe plastic surgery from the surgeon.

1612 (film)
 The film is set in Russia during the [[Time of Troubles]], a period of civil disorder, famine and [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–18)|Polish invasion]] that followed the fall of the [[Rurik dynasty]], which had ruled Russia in various capacities from 862 to 1598. The protagonist, Andrey, had been a servant at Tsar [[Boris Godunov]]'s court while he was a boy, where he became the sole witness to the murder of the tsar's family by the order of plotting [[boyars]]. Andrey is sold to slavery. Now, seven years later, he is bought by a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] mercenary, Alvaro Borja, who seeks to profit over this war by fighting for the Polish invading army. The company falls prey to a band of robbers and Alvaro is killed. Andrey and his friend Kostka know that serfs without a master are considered like runaways and will be hanged. Andrey disguises himself in his dead master's clothes and assumes his name, taking the guise of a "Spanish knight."  Andrey is hired by the Polish Lord Osina, who wants to capture Moscow and use Princess [[Xenia Godunova]] to raise himself to the Crown. As they approach a city, Andrey protects a Russian girl from the Polish soldiers. Andrey's true identity is discovered and he is arrested. Kostka however frees Andrey and steals Princess Xenia (she drank sleeping medicine) and with the help of his Russian girlfriend, they sneak over to the Russian garrison. Unfortunately the Russians tell them that Prince [[Dmitri Pozharsky]] had led most of the troops to Moscow with all the city cannons. Andrey then makes a cannon of leather. At dawn, the Polish army demands the city's surrender. Andrey fires a hot cannonball into the Polish ammunition storage, which explodes, killing most of the army surrounding the fortress. The next day, more Poles arrive and attack the city, but the Russians hold firm. Osina orders all the cannon on the gate breaking a way into the city. Meanwhile, Andrey moves their cannon off the wall and to the gate. The [[Husaria]] begin to charge. Andrey loads a chain shot into the cannon and they fire as the enemy closes, decapitating the Polish Hussars. The gate collapses and the rest begin to flee. Osina calls Andrey to negotiations, saying that if Xenia does not come out herself, he will kill her daughter. Andrey himself leads her out of the city.  Soon Andrey joins the Russians at Moscow. The [[Dmitri Pozharsky#Battle for Moscow|Battle for Moscow]] lasts for three days. The Polish flee in defeat and Osina is captured. Andrey calls him to a duel and kills him. The Russian nobles are angry at Xenia because she had converted to Catholicism, and send her to live in a monastery. Soon, a new Tsar is elected, [[Michael Romanov]], whose [[House of Romanov|dynasty]] rules Russia for the next 300 years.  
99 Francs (film)
 The film is a [[satire]] on the modern [[advertisement]] business. The plot mainly concerns the story of a commercial advertisement designer, Octave Parango ([[Jean Dujardin]]), who has an easy-going, highly paid job, and an active free life mainly consisting of [[narcotics|drugs]] and random one-time sexual relationships. However, he starts growing weary of his job, and after having his first ever long-time relationship with fellow worker Sophie ([[Vahina Giocante]]) fail miserably, he organises a revolt against the advertisement business and his own life. ''99 Francs'' (the title symbolises the worth of a paperback) is two separate stories: a dark, hallucinatory descent into a hell of drugs and self-indulgence, and a rather chirpy alternative ending to which the audience is invited as "a panel for an experiment". In the first, Octave plunges to his death after killing people with a car under the influence of drugs, killing the office hamster and causing the suicide of his best friend and his lover. In the second, Octave gives the world of advertising and capitalism the middle finger and escapes to a tropical paradise where he is joined by his lover and their child in "the best of worlds".  Whatever, the film closes with an announcement that 10% of the increasing millions invested in advertising every year would be sufficient to end famine.

1971 (2007 film)
   ===The Camp=== The story takes place in Pakistan in 1977, six years after the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. It takes place based on the role of Indian army who came forward to help in the freedom of Bangladesh from Pakistan on the orders from then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The title of the movie alludes to the year when this War between Bangladesh and Pakistan took place.  The scene opens to show a POW camp at an undisclosed location in Pakistan. Indian soldiers are holding a morning parade. As the Pakistanis Major Karamat and Colonel Sheriar Khan walk by, the Indians turn their backs on them in a gesture of disrespect. The cause for this disrespect is soon known as we see the Indian Major Suraj Singh (Manoj Bajpayee) being called out of barrack Number 6 for interrogation by the Pakistanis. He is from the 18 Rajputana Rifles and was caught in the Uri sector in December 1971 as he ran out of ammunition. Before being brought to this camp, he was held in Kot Lakhpat, Lahore, where he was punished twice for attempting to escape. Now, he was put in barrack Number 6 as punishment for a third attempt. Colonel Sheriar Khan taunts him as to the condition of his fellow POWs in the barracks and asks him who else aided him in his escape attempt. Major Suraj Singh refuses to reveal his accomplices, and is sent back to barrack Number 6 for a few more days. He has already spent three days there.  We see some of the other POWs; Captain Kabir (Kumud Mishra), Captain Jacob (Ravi Kishan) and Pali discussing the camp in general. They wonder why the Indians, who were so far held in various jails all over Pakistan, have been brought to this camp. They take note of the fact that the camp is well-facilitated and that they are receiving good treatment as POWs. We also see Karamat and Khan discussing the inmates of barrack Number 6. The inmates are Indian POWs from the 1965 and 1971 wars who have lost their sanity. This is Major Suraj Singh's punishment; to be imprisoned in this part of the POW camp. Out of magnanimityColonel Sheriar Khan orders that Suraj be released the next morning.  ===Arrival Of More POWs=== The next morning, an army truck is driving towards the camp.  This truck has a few more Indian POWs.  This group includes Flight Lieutenant Ram (Manav Kaul), Flight Lieutenant Gurtu (Deepak Dobriyal) and Colonel Puri.  The Flight Lieutenants, being youngsters, are of a bright disposition, and look for something or the other to be cheerful about despite their being captive.  When the truck stops at a side road and the POWs are allowed to relieve themselves, Ram and Gurtu contemplate the idea of jumping into the valley and running away.  Then, they give up the idea, as they are too weak to do so.  For consolation, they steal a guard's wallet and get a Pakistani army ID card.  They reach the camp and are introduced to the other inmates already present. No one has any idea as to the reason they were taken there.  ===Hope Against Hope=== Major Suraj Singh and his men, especially Captain Kabir, Captain Jacob and Subedar Ahmed, keep their own spirits alive by caring for the broken souls in barrack Number 6, and by remembering their own kin back home.  No matter how good the facilities in the camp, they are still prisoners and they hope to return home someday.  By asking the guards a few innocuous questions and putting their answers together, the POWs realize that they are in a place less than 200&nbsp;km from the Indo-Pak border.  (The place, it is revealed later, is Chaklala.) When Colonel Puri is told of this and the idea of an escape is put forward, he overrules it.  His reasons are that perhaps they will finally be repatriated and that a failed attempt could result in all of them being killed.  ===The Reason=== A jail in Multan, Pakistan, is being examined by a joint delegation of the International Red Cross Society and the Pakistan Human Rights Commission.  They are accompanied by some Indian ladies who claim that their kin are held prisoner.  Their proof is that letters written by their missing kin bear the addresses of Pakistani jails.  The women are being shown around by Colonel Shakoor, and they are distraught to see no trace of their loved ones here.  The head of the Human Rights Commission, Sabeena Jahangir, signs a document stating that they are satisfied with the results of the search.  Here we understand the reason why the Indian POWs were brought to Chaklala: The Pakistani military/government bowed to international pressure and allowed the delegation to examine the jails.  The POWs has to be hidden away in a secret camp for the duration of the delegation's visit in Pakistan.  ===The Repatriation And The Realization=== Colonel Shakoor arrives at the Chaklala camp; he informs Colonel Puri and Major Singh that all the POWs will be repatriated.  He also says that as there are some formalities to be fulfilled, they will have to remain there for nearly two months.  The POWs are further informed that the same night they will be treated to an open-air screening of a recent popular movie followed by a banquet. Major Singh, Captain Kabir and Subedar Ahmed are distrustful of Colonel Shakoor's words, although the other prisoners celebrate their imminent return home.  That night, while the movie is being screened, Ahmed steals a newspaper from an army jeep and calls Major Singh and Captains Kabir and Jacob into the barracks.  From reading the newspaper, they learn that [[General Zia Ul-Haq]] has overthrown [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in a military coup and formed a new government.  Further, General Zia has stated that all Indian soldiers who were taken prisoner so far have been returned and, as proof, he has allowed the International Red Cross Society to inspect the Pakistani jails.  Since no POW was found, General Zia has reasserted the Pakistani government's innocence in this matter.  The four soldiers now understand the reason why they were taken to this camp.  Also, that they were being provided with good facilities so that they would not think of escaping.  Then, they realize that they are being overheard and discover that the eavesdroppers are Ram and Gurtu.  They overpower them and are about to thrash the two, when the Flight Lieutenants inform them that they too wish to escape to India. They prove their willingness by producing the ID card they had stolen earlier.  ===The First Steps=== The six soldiers decide to escape, and they must waste no time.  They take two steps the same night. First, they request the Pakistanis for a group photo.  This request is granted. Second, at the dinner, Ahmed attempts to strike Jacob, for which he is punished by Colonel Puri the next morning.  When Ahmed refuses to bear out his punishment, Colonel Puri wishes to court-martial him. The POWs ask for the use of a barrack to serve as a courtroom, a request that is also granted.  The Pakistanis are preparing to celebrate the Pakistani Independence Day (14 August) by having a song performance by Ms. Sultana Khanum, a ghazal singer.  The Indians, who wish to celebrate the Indian Independence Day (15 August), ask for fresh uniforms, paints to make an Indian flag and jaggery for making a sweet drink.  The Pakistanis grant them all their requests in order to keep them pacified.  While the court martial is going on, Ram and Gurtu combine the paints to dye the uniforms in the colours of the Pakistani Army.  Maj. Karamat is presiding over the court martial.  Here, with Kabir as the prosecutor and Suraj as the defense, the would-be escapees impress upon Karamat that Puri hates Ahmed simply because he is a Muslim.  This prompts Karamat into starting the proceedings to implant Ahmed as a spy in the Indian Army.  ===Initial Success=== While Karamat is interviewing Ahmed to offer sending him back to India so that he can spy for the Pakistanis, Kabir and Jacob stealthily make their way to the camp periphery.  They trigger the alarm and run back into the camp before they can be seen. The guards conclude that it must have been triggered by a wild animal.  At this, Karamat switches off the alarm from the electricity room adjacent to his own office.  Ahmed follows him like a dimwitted man and sees the location of the switch.  As Ahmed's repatriation formalities are being fulfilled, he manages to steal from Karamat's office the accessories and insignia that are present on Pakistani uniforms.  Ahmed also learns that the electricity room houses the communications line and the power generator.  He passes on this information to Suraj Singh and the others (Kabir, Jacob, Ram and Gurtu).  The plan is to create a stampede on the night of 14 August and escape under the pretext of escorting the ghazal singer out of the camp.  But to cause a stampede, they need to detonate a bomb. For this, Ram and Gurtu go on a pickpocketing spree and bring back to Jacob (an explosives and topography expert) a lot of matchboxes.  They remove the phosphorus heads of the matchsticks and make a crude bomb out of the combined match-heads.  They intend to throw this bomb into the ammunitions room to create a blast.  Once the bomb is ready, they tie it to the lower side of the floorboards to hide it.  The group photograph has been given to Colonel Puri.  To steal it from him, Ram and Gurtu make an alcoholic drink out of the jaggery and soon many of the POWs are drunk.  Colonel Puri is too drunk to notice the real reason behind the drinking session.  The photo is stolen.  Out of this, the face of Suraj Singh is cut out and stuck onto the stolen ID card.  The fake Pakistani uniforms are ready. So are the bomb and the ID card. The six men just have to wait for the song performance before starting their action. At this point, Suraj tells the others that the real intent of the mission is to alert the Indian authorities of the presence of Indian POWs in Pakistan. He also tells them that one or more of them may die while escaping and that their only consolation will be that they will have died as escapees instead of as prisoners.  ===The Breakout=== While the floor is being cleaned with water that morning, the bomb gets soaked, but the escape team does not know this. As 14 August dawns, the six men wear two layers of uniforms; the Indian uniforms on top of the Pakistani ones. By evening, the ghazal singer is ready to give her song performance.  The senior Pakistani officers, including Shakoor and Karamat, are among the audience. The Indian POWs are allowed to sit as a separate audience to enjoy the songs. As the performance begins, Jacob and Kabir sneak away from the main POW group at separate times. Ahmed goes into Karamat's office, telling the guard that the Major has asked for his jacket. Once inside, he knocks the guard unconscious and through a side door lets in Kabir, who has changed into his Pakistani uniform. He goes into the electricity room to disconnect the communication lines and power lines. He cuts the communication lines first, then, as per the plan, he must wait for the blast before he can cut the power line.  Jacob reaches the crude bomb and realizes that it is now soaked. He tells Ahmed, who is now by his side, that the mission must be called off. Then he rushes off to stop Suraj. However, before Ahmed can stop Kabir, he impatiently cuts the power line, plunging the camp in darkness. Ahmed does the last thing left to him to save his friends. He runs to the ammunitions room, forces his way in, locks himself in and primes one of the grenades. In the few seconds before the blast, he closes his eyes and thinks of his family; his aged parents, his wife and his daughter whom he has never seen and who would now be six. The room blows up into a ball of fire.  The remaining five men carry out the plan as conceived. There is a stampede and a general confusion as the soldiers attempt to put out the fire. Suraj and his men escort the ghazal singer out of the camp in an army truck. A few Pakistani soldiers already inside the truck become their unwitting captives. The Indians are no longer POWs, they are now soldiers on a mission.  ===The Aftermath=== At the camp, the Pakistani guards take a head count of the prisoners and, seeing six of them missing, including Suraj Singh, discover that an escape has taken place. They try to locate the truck escorting Sultana Khanum. They also alert Major Bilal Mallik (Piyush Mishra), who is in charge of a helicopter, to help in their search.  Meanwhile, the escape truck has gone on a highway to Abbottabad. At a lonely spot, the escapees decide to get rid of their captives. One of them tries to rush his captors and in a scuffle shoots Jacob in the stomach. Suraj and Kabir shoot the Pakistani dead. Jacob lies to his comrades, saying that the bullet has just grazed him. The escapees relieve the Pakistani soldiers of their weapons and wallets and knock them unconscious. They also hide the body of the dead soldier. They are about to render Sultana unconscious, when she says that she was once the head of the Pakistan Human Rights Commission. She says that she was aware of the Red Cross raids across Pakistan in search of the Indian POWs. She is sympathetic to the plight of the POWs and promises to misguide the search party if she is left unharmed. In a touching line, she says to Suraj, "Hamaare mulk se thhoda yakeen hee lekar jaao." ("If nothing else, at least take home some trust from our country.")  ===The Night=== The escapees are in a different truck now. They remember the blast at the camp and understand that it was done by Ahmed. They have gone off the highway to Abbottabad and are on another one, which leads to Muzaffarabad. The search party, including Major Mallik, has reached the escape truck, where they find Sultana Khanum, who has been left unharmed. She says that the escapees were in plain clothes and were talking of going towards Islamabad. The searchers believe her and arrange for her to be sent to her home. However, Major Mallik notices that the military map is missing from the truck's dashboard. When he asks Colonel Shakoor if the escapees were in any way connected to the army, Shakoor answers that it does not matter and that the escaped prisoners have to be brought back. In the meanwhile, the Chaklala camp is hurriedly closed and the Indian POWs are moved out of there.  Major Mallik separates from the search party and heads out in his chopper to cover the highway to Muzaffarabad. At a checkpoint, the escapees, led by Suraj Singh, gain access with the help of the fake ID card. Suraj asks the guard the reason for the checkpoint and is told that there is a search on for six fugitives. From this, he understands that the Pakistanis do not want it to be known that the fugitives are actually POWs.  Sultana Khanum phones Sabeena Jahangir from a wayside hotel and informs her of the presence of Indian POWs in a camp in Chaklala. She says that she is ready to provide testimony to that effect.  By early dawn, the searchers converge at the military hospital in Abbottabad to glean information from the injured soldiers. Here, Colonel Sheriar Khan and Major Azzam Baig berate Major Karamat and Colonel Shakoor for letting the escape take place. When Major Mallik asks if the escapees are Indian POWs, they grudgingly tell him the truth, and he agrees to maintain the secrecy of the search. They then talk to an injured soldier, who tells them about the preparedness of the fugitives. When the soldier mentions that they even have an ID card, Major Mallik realizes that he had actually seen them passing through the checkpoint on the highway to Muzaffarabad. The searchers prepare to go there.  ===The Wild Chase At Muzaffarabad=== On the morning of 15 August, the escapees arrive at Muzaffarabad. The truck-driver goes on his way, and the soldiers check into a hotel. Once inside the hotel room, Suraj instructs Ram and Gurtu to purchase some necessary medical items from the local stores. He then asks Jacob to plot out an escape route on the map they took off the first escape truck. He charts out a route going up to Baramulla, India. This route avoids the main highway and goes through hills and villages. The last twenty kilometres have to be covered on foot, because the heavy snowfall makes it impossible for any vehicle to pass. Jacob then collapses and the others realize that he was not merely grazed by the bullet, but that his gunshot wound was life-threatening. Kabir holds him tightly while Suraj attempts to remove the bullet from his stomach.  Meanwhile, in the town, while Ram and Gurtu are purchasing medicines and painkillers for Jacob, Ram notices a military convoy approaching. The search party is here. He and Gurtu run to the hotel to warn the others. Although they were not seen by the searchers, the place is soon swarming with soldiers. In the hotel room, Jacob finds the pain unbearable and reaches for a pistol. Ram and Gurtu reach the room just in time to see him shoot himself in the head. Although the four men are stunned, they have no time to waste. They cover Jacob in a blanket, take the map and the bags, and flee through the window.  As they run through the side streets of the town, the Pakistanis are on their heels. When the fugitives reach the main street, they have to hide behind a truck as it is crowded with soldiers led by Colonel Shakoor. They cannot remain behind the truck for long, because the column of soldiers chasing them is getting closer. Then Ram spots a motorbike, he tells Suraj and the others to be ready to take it. Before they can stop him, he runs into Colonel Shakoor's view, shoots his guard and runs into a side-lane. As the soldiers run after him, the fugitives hide themselves under the tarpaulin of another truck, thereby escaping notice by the column that was chasing them. This column joins the other soldiers in the chase. As a straggler is attempting to start the motorbike, the escapees (Suraj, Kabir and Gurtu) run out of their hiding place, beat him unconscious and ride away on it.  Ram has taken control of an army jeep after killing a few soldiers, including Major Azzam Baig. He too has sustained a few bullet injuries, and is now leading the Pakistanis away from his friends. He now has only one pistol and one grenade for weapons. He leads the soldiers out of the town as far away as he can. The chasing convoy is led by Colonel Shakoor, who is berating his men to drive faster. Major Mallik is in the second jeep. Suddenly, Major Suraj Singh turns in from a dirt road and is riding next to the leading jeep. Colonel Shakoor stares into the faces of Suraj, Gurtu and Kabir. The jeep driver's face registers terror as he sees Kabir priming a grenade. Kabir lobs the grenade into the jeep as Suraj picks up speed and races away. In the next few seconds, the convoy comes to a standstill and Colonel Shakoor leaps out of his jeep. He runs a few steps and throws himself flat on the ground. The jeep explodes as the Indians race away. A stunned Major Mallik is unable to believe his eyes. The expression on his face sums up the scene: he did not expect the Indians to pull off a move like that.  ===The Sacrifice=== The men on the bike catch up with Ram, who is relieved to see them safe. Gurtu asks innocently, "Listen, sir, is this the road to Delhi?" then tells him to watch where he is driving. But their victory is short-lived as they are attacked by a truck coming from the opposite direction. Although Kabir and Gurtu manage to shoot the driver of the truck and the shooters in its front, Suraj is forced to divert the bike into a ditch. Ram stops the jeep and watches his friends careening wildly downslope. They hit a rock and the bike cartwheels, then lands on Kabir's right leg. As the bike slides down the slope, it drags him with it. Suraj and Gurtu are lucky to survive with only a few scratches.  Ram is shot by the soldiers who are climbing out of the back of the truck. Gurtu is climbing upslope to rush to his aid with a furious Suraj attempting to stop him. Ram, still alive, sees the scene: Shakoor and Mallik have caught up and are driving towards him, the soldiers from the truck ahead are running towards him, and Gurtu and Suraj are dangerously close to revealing their position in the ditch. He quickly turns his jeep around and, with the soldiers still running after him, drives straight at Shakoor's vehicle. Mallik, seated next to Shakoor, orders the driver to stop and reverse. He is sure that Ram is playing a fresh new trick, while Shakoor wants to get closer to Ram so that he can shoot him dead. Ram slams into them at high speed, causing serious injury to Shakoor, the soldiers in Shakoor's truck and to himself. Shakoor, who is now unconscious, is laid on the ground as Mallik orders for an ambulance. Mallik then walks to Ram's jeep to see what he was trying to do.  Ram is bleeding profusely, he has a few breaths' worth of life left in him and he has primed a grenade. When Mallik sees the grenade, he shouts a warning for everyone to run away. As they all run away from the jeep, Mallik leading them, it explodes. In the ditch, Suraj and Gurtu see the explosion. Suraj covers Gurtu's mouth so that his cries cannot be heard by the men on the road. They watch the jeep and the truck go up in flames, then Suraj forcibly turns Gurtu around and they come back to the motorbike, which has Kabir still partially pinned underneath it. The blast has claimed many lives, including Colonel Shakoor's. As Mallik directs the rescue, Colonel Sheriar Khan catches up. Simultaneously, the fugitives get the bike upright and drive away.  ===The Intervention=== While Mallik and Khan are directing the rescue, Sabeena Jahangir arrives there with the Red Cross delegates and questions Khan as to his lies regarding the Indian POWs. Mallik explains that this blast was the result of an accident involving two vehicles and that they are in no way connected to the POW issue. They go to the Muzaffarabad base, where in a closed room, Colonel Sheriar Khan is informed on the phone that a delegate has been sent to recall Sabeena Jahangir. When he expresses disbelief and frustration that the POW matter is now known, Mallik tells him that catching the POWs is now difficult. He says that in addition to being highly motivated, they are also military experts. He mentions Ram's suicide bombing of the trucks as proof of how far they are willing to go. But until the arrival of the delegate, he says, Colonel Sheriar Khan must keep Jahangir pacified. When Khan attempts to tell Jahangir that there is a misunderstanding regarding the accident and the blast, she says that the occurrence of one blast at Chaklala and within one day another one at Muzaffarabad is highly suspicious. She alleges that the Pakistani military have deceived the Red Cross and the Pakistani public by lying that there are no Indian POWs in the country. Just then, the High Commission delegate arrives and shows Jahangir an order to vacate the area immediately. She glares at Mallik and Khan, then leaves with her colleagues. As soon as she is gone, the soldiers spring into action resuming their search.  ===Saluting Fallen Comrades=== However, this intervention has bought off valuable time for the escapees. They have gone on the route marked by Jacob and reached the point from where they have to go by foot. The bike is anyway out of petrol. While Suraj Singh throws the bike down a mountainside, Gurtu has leaned Kabir against a tree and is making three mounds in the snow; one for each man who died on this mission. Seeing this, Suraj points out that they sacrificed their lives for their battle, so they must be respected as martyrs. He, Kabir and Gurtu stand up and salute this memorial. Then, they walk on into the snow, Kabir being held up by the others.  ===The Cold Night=== The Indian soldiers have reached a point where they must stop and wait until dark before resuming their journey. They risk being caught if they go any further while there is still light. Suraj and Gurtu tie a splint improvised out of twigs onto Kabir's fractured leg.  By nightfall, the Pakistanis have reached a stream where they retrieve the bike that was thrown down the mountain. Khan and Mallik disagree in their conclusions. While Khan is certain that the fugitives have died and that their bodies should be lying close by, Mallik thinks that they could have thrown the bike down the mountainside and continued on foot. Khan berates Mallik for overestimating the fugitives. Mallik steps aside, and while Khan continues the search in the vicinity, gives voice to his own thoughts: "When the bloody war was over, there was never any need to detain these soldiers. Not only have we incurred the curses of their kin, we have also created a nuisance for ourselves. If I say this aloud, I will be declared a traitor. If I don't, then this Pakistani conscience of mine will torment me for life."  Suraj awakens Gurtu and Kabir to continue their journey. Kabir is not able to move his leg. Suraj removes the shoe on his injured leg only to see that it has turned black. Kabir says that it is frostbite and that it will climb up his body. However, when he requests to be left behind, Suraj will not hear of it. He carries Kabir bodily on his back, and their trek continues. They can do nothing but walk on. They keep themselves sane by exchanging little jokes and talking about their hometowns. When Suraj stumbles under Kabir's weight, Kabir points out that this way a two-hour journey will stretch to six hours. Suraj will again hear none of it. Sometime later, Kabir tells Suraj that he respects him more than he would respect his own father. Suraj replies that in the army a senior officer is like a father anyway.  ===Unparalleled Heroism=== It is dawn. The three soldiers have stopped to rest by the side of a path winding through the mountains. Kabir and Gurtu are asleep; Suraj is sitting huddled next to them. He sees something far below him in the valley. He rises, then wakes up Gurtu and asks him to take a look. They strain their eyes. They cannot believe what they are seeing. It is an Indian army outpost with the Indian Flag raised above it. They cheer, scream, and laugh in jubilation. But when Gurtu tries to rouse Kabir, he falls limply to one side. He is dead. With nothing else left to do, Suraj and Gurtu bury Kabir in the snow and walk on towards the Indian side of the border. It is about a few hundred yards away.  Suddenly they hear the sound of a helicopter. It carries Colonel Sheriar Khan and Major Bilal Mallik. As Khan fires at them with a machine gun, Mallik cautions him that they are too close to the Line Of Control (LOC). As Suraj and Gurtu attempt to run, they end up taking a few bullet wounds. Gurtu is shot in his leg, which disables him from standing up. The Indian soldiers at the outpost, who see the helicopter, think that the Pakistanis are starting a skirmish. They get ready to fire a rocket.  Gurtu crawls into a rock alcove and asks Suraj to proceed alone without him. Suraj replies that he has no family back home in India and that if he reaches home he will do so with his companions. Suraj then says that they must survive for the sake of their comrades who died in the escape and for the sake of those who are still prisoners. Meanwhile, Mallik mutinies against Khan and orders the pilot to turn the chopper around. The Indians fire a rocket at the chopper. As the helicopter turns around and flies away behind the mountains, the rocket explodes harmlessly on a mountainside. On the ground, Gurtu is unable to walk, so Suraj seats him against a rock. He promises to bring help from the Indian side.  Major Suraj Singh calls out to the Indians, but he has been a prisoner for six years. As he calls for help, his voice stammers and fails many times. The Indians simply do not or cannot hear him. Then suddenly gunshots are heard and Suraj collapses. A column of Pakistani soldiers is running towards the two fugitives. Suraj is shot badly. The Indian soldiers rush to their defensive positions. As Gurtu is still recovering from the shock, Suraj struggles to his feet. He tells Gurtu that he will be back with help even before the Pakistanis arrive. He is still the father figure his men loved him for being. The Pakistanis are rushing on, screaming obscenities. Suraj runs towards the Indian outpost. As the Pakistanis fire at him, the Indians, thinking that a skirmish is on, fire back at the Pakistanis. This pins them down considerably so their firing on Suraj does not have much effect. Then the Indian officer sees Suraj through his binoculars and orders his men to stop firing as he realizes that the Pakistanis were chasing a fugitive. Then the Pakistanis are able to come out into the open and fire at Suraj. He nevertheless runs as hard as he can. There is an explosion close to his feet, probably a land mine, and he is thrown forward to the ground by the force of the blast.  Gurtu is looking at Suraj over the distance. His face has a look of peace. Suraj has reached the Indian side. He slowly stands up and looks ahead. He is home. He looks at the soldiers and at the flag above them. He is too overcome by emotion to say even a word. The Indians see a man in Pakistani army uniform before them. Suraj raises his right hand as if reaching for the flag. Then the Pakistanis fire one shot, which goes through Suraj's heart. He falls to the ground and dies.  The Pakistani soldiers have reached the border. Khan and Mallik make their way to their head. The Indian officer shouts a question across the no-man's-land, asking what the matter is. Khan replies that the dead fugitive was a deserter from the Pakistani army who was court-martialled and had killed two civilians while escaping. He asks the Indians to search the dead man for an ID card, which should confirm his identity. The Indians find on Suraj's person the fake ID card, which had got him through the Pakistani check post. The officer grants permission for the Pakistanis to take away the corpse and warns them to be careful in future. As Suraj's body is dragged back to the Pakistani side, Mallik removes his beret in a gesture of respect to the man who, in his own way, did reach his country.  ===Epilogue=== It is now 2007. The place is Multan Jail in Pakistan. We see an old man walking in the prison compound. He has made five little mounds of earth and he is putting a few flowers on them. He sits on the ground next to them and leafs through what was once Major Suraj Singh's prison diary. This old man is Gurtu. He now has only two motives in his life: to hope to return home and to keep alive the memory of his five friends.  The screen now blurs, and a Voice over informs us that there are still 54 Indian [[POW]]'s of the 1971 and the 1965 Indo Pak wars who are languishing in Pakistani Jails. They were last seen alive in 1988. Copies of original letters posted by them come up as the credits Roll  
30,000 Leagues Under the Sea
 In this modern retelling of the classic science-fiction tale, [[Captain Nemo]] uses his high-tech submarine to wreak vengeance on the surface world.  This version takes place in the present day.  It begins with the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] submarine USS ''Scotia'' following strange radar traces near the [[Mariana Trench]].  The sub runs into trouble and is lost, though not before getting off a rescue beacon.  The USS ''Abraham Lincoln'' finds the beacon and calls in the ''Aquanaut'' to assist in this deep-sea rescue.  The ''Aquanaut'', captained by Lt. Arronaux, has been developing a water-to-air converter that is thought to be useful in this sort of mission.  Command of the mission is, unfortunately, taken from Arronaux and given to Lt. Cmdr. Conceil (his ex-wife) who is presented as a "ball-buster" in contrast to Arronaux's confident but laid-back temperament.  She and her assistant Blackwell are both administrative theoretical-techie types and end up stripping the ''Aquanaut'' of equipment that leave the ''Aquanaut'' in trouble as they descend to the level the ''Scotia'' is wrecked at.  The equipment loss leads to the crew passing out for lack of oxygen.  They come to on board the ''Nautilus'' and meet an apparently charming Captain Nemo.  It soon becomes clear that the good captain is a bit unhinged and tending towards megalomania.  The ''Aquanaut'''s crew is imprisoned and brought out to be attached to a brainwashing machine.  Arronaux escaped his escort to the holding pens and is loose to try and pull everyone out.  He finds [[Submarine-launched ballistic missile|nuclear missiles]] from the ''Scotia'' in the process.  He is found and aided by Cooper, another abducted sailor.  The crew is able to make it back to their ship in an escape attempt but one is lost to Nemo's gunmen.  They find and board the ''Scotia'', finding that Nemo lied and much of the ''Scotia'''s crew is still alive.  Having reprogrammed the remote device Nemo had planted on the ''Aquanaut'', the ship is then sent back to the ''Nautilus'' where it intercepts the missiles attempting to fire.  The backlash scuttles the larger ship and it crashes into the underwater city of [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], presumably with total losses.  The Scotia is able to contact the ''Abraham Lincoln'' and the remainder of the rescue gets underway.  Conseil shows Arronaux stolen plans of Nemo's ship.

Aaja Nachle
 Dia ([[Madhuri Dixit]]) is a choreographer who lives in New York with her daughter Radha. One day she receives word that her old dance teacher, Makarand, is dying. She returns to her hometown [[Shamli]] with Radha, to find that he has already died and left her the responsibility of saving the deserted dance theatre, Ajanta, which is to be demolished to make way for a shopping mall.  Shamli has changed a great deal since Dia left. Her parents left the town in shame a decade ago, after she eloped with an American photographer, and their house is now owned by the strict Mr Chojar and his wife. Her childhood friend Najma is married to Farooque, a successful businessman. Both of them greet Dia coldly. The only ally she has left is her old friend Doctor Saab. To save Ajanta, Dia goes to petition the local MP Raja Uday Singh. He issues her a challenge; if she can put on a successful performance using only people from Shamli, he will cancel the demolition.  That night Dia dances in Ajanta and afterwards calls on the people to help her put up a performance of the famous Laila-Majnu play. Jeering at her, they leave the theatre one by one, but Raja remains behind, reminding her of the challenge. Refusing to accept defeat, Dia goes out into the street the next day to scout for talent. When she returns to the theatre she finds that a group of thugs are burning the set, after being ordered by a local election candidate, Chaudhary Om Singh. Instead of being angry, she is intrigued by the ring-leader, Imran, and makes a deal with Chaudhary - she will help him win the next election, if he will support Ajanta and if Imran plays Majnu. He agrees and Imran is forced to take on the role. After finding out about the casting of Imran, many girls flock to the theatre for the part of Laila. Among them is Anokhi, a tomboy who is in love with Imran. She begs Dia, who is reluctant because of her rough appearance and lack of talent, but agrees in the end, thinking that her love for Imran will make her the ideal Laila. Other parts in the play go to Mr Chojar, who wants to prove to his wife that he is not boring, Chaudhary who plays Laila’s father and Dia’s former fiancé Mohan, who is able to overcome his bitterness towards her.  With one month to put the show together, Dia struggles to get Imran and Anokhi to work together. With Dia’s support, Anokhi changes her attitude and appearance to get Imran to take her seriously and soon their relationship deepens. A few days before the show, Farooque pays Chaudhary to abandon Ajanta and makes Najma spread hurtful stories about Dia. Chaudhary tries to get Imran to give up his part, but Imran is aware of Chaudhary’s political intentions and refuses, leading him to be attacked by Chaudhary’s men while Anokhi tries to protect him.

Across the Universe (film)
 The film begins in an unspecified year of the 1960s with Jude, a young shipyard worker in [[Liverpool]], reminiscing about a girl he once knew and loved ("[[Girl (Beatles song)|Girl]]"). A few months prior, Jude enlists in the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] and jumps ship in [[New Jersey]], hoping to find his American [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] father, whom he has never met ("[[Hold Me Tight]]", "[[All My Loving]]"). Meanwhile, Lucy Carrigan worries about her boyfriend Daniel who is headed for service in the [[Vietnam War]]; while in [[Dayton, Ohio]], Prudence pines for a fellow female cheerleader ("[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]"), and then drops out of school in shame. Jude meets his father, who is a janitor at [[Princeton University]], and befriends Lucy's brother, the privileged and rebellious student Max ("[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]"). Lucy receives a letter from Daniel ("[[It Won't Be Long]]"), but when Max brings Jude home with him for [[Thanksgiving]], Jude becomes attracted to Lucy ("[[I've Just Seen a Face]]").  Max drops out of school and he and Jude move into a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] enclave in [[Greenwich Village]], living with aspiring singer Sadie. Daniel is killed in Vietnam and Jo-Jo's younger brother is killed in the [[1967 Detroit riot]] (combined "[[Let It Be (song)|Let It Be]]"). Guitar player Jo-Jo goes to New York to pursue his passion ("[[Come Together]]"). While Jo-Jo auditions for Sadie's band, Max becomes a taxi driver and Jude finds work as a freelance artist. They are soon joined by Prudence, who has hitchhiked to New York and left an abusive boyfriend.  Lucy decides to visit Max in New York before starting college ("[[Why Don't We Do It in the Road?]]"). She and Jude fall in love ("[[If I Fell]]"), while Max is [[Conscription|drafted]] into the army ("[[I Want You (She's So Heavy)]]"). Prudence is attracted to Sadie, and becomes depressed when Sadie and Jo-Jo begin a relationship. Prudence locks herself in a closet and has to be literally and [[Coming out|figuratively]] coaxed out of the closet ("[[Dear Prudence]]"), then disappears after wandering off during a peace rally at which Paco, the leader of the [[Students for a Democratic Society|Students for a Democratic Republic]] (SDR), is a speaker.  At a book function for existential drug guru Doctor Robert, Jude, Lucy, Jo-Jo, Sadie and Max drink punch laced with [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]. They embark with Doctor Robert on his "Beyond" bus ("[[I Am the Walrus]]"), end up stranded outside the compound of a [[Psychonautics|psychonaut]], and see Mr. Kite's bizarre circus where they are reunited with Prudence, who performs as Henry the Horse ("[[Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!]]", "[[Because (Beatles song)|Because]]").  Max is deployed to Vietnam, leading Lucy to become increasingly involved in the anti-war movement, especially with the SDR. Jude remains comparatively apolitical but devoted to Lucy ("[[Something (Beatles song)|Something]]"). Back in New York, Sadie is offered a chance to go on tour but is made the headliner of the group, separate from Jo-Jo and her backup band, leading to a bitter breakup and musical split between them on stage after he finds out ("[[Oh! Darling]]"). Jude dislikes the increasing amount of time that Lucy spends with the SDR and suspects that Paco is attempting to seduce Lucy, and this puts a strain on their relationship and affects Jude's art ("[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]"). Finally, Jude storms into the SDR office and points out the hypocrisy of the group's actions ("[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]"), leading to an argument with Lucy after which she leaves him ("[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]"). Jude follows Lucy to an [[Columbia University protests of 1968|anti-war demonstration at Columbia University]] ("[[Across the Universe]]") but when the police start arresting the protesters (including Lucy and Paco), Jude tries to help Lucy but is beaten by police and arrested ("[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]").  Unable to prove that he is the son of an American citizen, Jude is deported back to England, where he returns to his old job at the Liverpool shipyards ("[[A Day in the Life]] (instrumental)"). This is also revealed to be the time frame of the opening scene. Jo-Jo continues his music, playing solo guitar in bars, while the highly successful Sadie drowns her sorrow and loneliness in alcohol while on tour. Max is wounded in Vietnam and sent home, psychologically scarred and dependent on [[morphine]] ("[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]"). Lucy continues her activities with the SDR, but finds herself caught up as Paco leads [[Weather Underground|the movement deeper into violence]]. She finally leaves when she discovers that Paco is making bombs, but is surrounded by constant reminders of Jude and what they had shared ("[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]"). One of Paco's homemade bombs explodes, [[Greenwich Village townhouse explosion|killing him and his confederates]]; on reading this news in the local newspaper, Jude thinks that Lucy is dead, but upon learning from Max that she is alive, he arranges to return to New York legally ("[[Hey Jude]]").  Jo-Jo and Sadie, who have reconciled, put on a rooftop concert, with Prudence as a member of their band ("[[Don't Let Me Down (Beatles song)|Don't Let Me Down]]", as in the [[The Beatles' rooftop concert|real rooftop event]]). Max brings Jude to the rooftop, while Lucy nearly joins, but can't bring herself to face Jude again. When the police arrive to break up the concert, Jude manages to remain on the roof and begins to sing ("[[All You Need Is Love]]"). The police allow the band to rejoin him, while Lucy tries to get back to the building, but is blocked by the police. Max draws Jude's attention to an opposite rooftop where Lucy is standing and looking at him. Lucy and Jude gaze smilingly at each other across opposite rooftops as the performance concludes ("[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]", over credits).

The Air I Breathe
 Each of the elements of life is portrayed using four different people in the urban streets of [[Los Angeles]], with the gangster Fingers (Garcia) playing the character that intertwines all four individuals.  ;'''Happiness'''  [[Forest Whitaker]] plays a meek bank employee who loves [[butterflies]]. He accidentally overhears acquaintances discuss a fixed horse race, and decides to bet $50,000, borrowing from a bookie, Fingers. Unfortunately he loses the bet.  Fingers derives his name from his habit of cutting off the fingers of those who don’t pay back their debts. Fingers threatens Happiness, and Pleasure, Finger's enforcer, visits him to collect, but pities Happiness, so gives him a revolver and leaves. In desperation, Happiness robs the bank. While fleeing, he is slightly hit by a moving vehicle, then escapes to the top of a building.  Surrounded, the police order him to drop his gun. He does not comply, throwing the money bag off the roof, and is killed by the police. When he hits the ground his coat is spread out making him look like a butterfly.   ;'''Pleasure'''  [[Brendan Fraser]] plays a man with a sad past and an ability to see the future of the people he meets, an ability that deprives him of the pleasure of enjoying the surprises in life. When he was young, he was forced to defend his younger brother in a street fight against two teenagers. Pleasure won the fight but found his brother lying dead. Pleasure often has flashbacks of this scene throughout the film. Later in life, Pleasure joins Fingers' gang and becomes one of his favorites due mostly to his ability. He, however, cannot see the future of Trista (Gellar).  He is assigned to look after Fingers' visiting nephew, Tony. He has a vision of Tony climbing a fence and falling back. To avoid trouble, he leaves Tony in a club while working (collecting protection money). Unfortunately, one of the girls that Tony is with, high on drugs, staggers into the next room. When Tony follows her, they struggle over a gun, and an older mobster gets shot. Pleasure rescues Tony, and they run from the henchmen, ending at the fence of the earlier vision. Tony gets away, and it is Pleasure who is caught by the henchmen, severely beaten, and then treated by Love (Bacon) in a hospital.  ;'''Sorrow'''  [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] plays a somewhat morose up-and-coming pop singer/dancer with the stage name "Trista".  In flashback, it's revealed that as a young child, she saw her father killed when he was accidentally hit by a moving car, immediately after promising to 'be there for her', and the loss affects her deeply. Trista's manager is deeply indebted to Fingers, and embezzles Trista's money to pay Fingers, but that is not enough, so he assigns Trista's contract to Fingers. Trista, incensed, escapes from Fingers and meets Pleasure. Fingers, naturally, has already ordered his team to find her. Pleasure, sympathetic to her, helps Trista by letting her stay with him, knowing that his house is the only place Fingers wouldn't search for her. They become lovers, but soon Fingers finds out about her location, and kills Pleasure, causing Trista even more sorrow. Her [[blood group|blood type]] is [[Kell antigen system|Kp(a-b-)]], which she reveals when a TV interviewer asks her what is special about her. This becomes hopeful information when Love hears it on the television, as he is searching for that blood type, the same as Gina's, when he is trying to save her life.  ;'''Love'''  [[Kevin Bacon]] plays a doctor who is in love with his longtime friend Gina ([[Julie Delpy]]). He never confessed his love and, so, she married his best friend. Gina gets bitten by a poisonous snake and needs a rare type of blood. Desperate, Love races to the location where Trista is filming the interview; however, Trista's assistant is in the process of trying to help Trista run away. Love runs to Trista. Her bodyguards, thinking he is a crazed fan, grab him while Trista is accidentally knocked down, hits her head and ends up in the hospital. When she awakens, Fingers informs her that she will have to [[abortion|abort]] the baby that she has just become aware that she is carrying. In her sorrow that the baby, the one thing she has left of the man she loved (Pleasure) will be lost, she sneaks out of her room and goes to the roof to jump off and commit [[suicide]]. Love, by circumstance, sees her and races up in time to see her step off the ledge. He grabs the bed sheet that she had wrapped around her like a cape and catches her. He tells her she will have to come up and grab his hand for him to be able to pull her up. After she does this, the movie flashes to Gina, saved, awakening from her [[coma]]. Love loans Trista his car as a gift for saving Gina and she leaves the hospital.  ;'''Ending'''  Fingers looks for Trista at the hospital, but his efforts to find her are in vain, as she has already left. As Trista escapes in Love's car, she slightly hits Happiness as he runs in front of her car in his dash from the bank (in the scene that we saw from his point of view earlier); as she sits at the intersection, as she's coming to grips with all that has happened, the money bag Happiness threw from the top of the building lands on her car's rooftop. The film closes with Trista at an airport traveling away, the money bag providing her with all the financial support she needs to escape from Fingers and start a new life for herself and her baby abroad.

Wolf tracks several [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Aliens]] in the sewer and defeats many of them, and as the battle reaches the surface, several of them disperse into the town. Wolf pursues some to the power plant, where [[collateral damage]] from his plasma caster weapon causes a citywide [[power outage]]. Ricky and Jesse meet at the high school swimming pool, but are interrupted by Dale and his cohorts just as the power goes out and an Alien enters the pool, killing Dale's friends. Another Alien invades the O'Brien home, killing Tim while Kelly escapes with Molly. After the fry cook at the local diner where Carrie works is attacked by the Aliens, Carrie is also attacked after hearing the cook's screams and is impregnated by the Predalien with bellybusters and killed. Darcy discovers her body in horror but Sheriff Morales arrives and brings her with him.  Kelly, Molly, Ricky, Jesse, Dale, Dallas, and Sheriff Morales gather at a sporting goods store to collect weapons. Troops from the [[Colorado Army National Guard]] arrive, but are quickly killed by the Aliens. Wolf briefly captures Dallas inside the store to use as bait to lure the Aliens, but Dallas escapes. Several Aliens arrive and Wolf handily defeats them. Dale is killed by an Alien during the battle and one of Wolf's shoulder plasma casters is damaged. He removes his remaining one and modifies it into a hand-held blaster.  As the survivors attempt to escape Gunnison, they make radio contact with Colonel Stevens and are told that an air evacuation is being staged at the center of town. Dallas and Kelly are skeptical, as going to the center of town would cause them to become surrounded by the Aliens, and they along with Ricky, Jesse, Molly and a few others, go for the helicopter at the hospital to get out of town while Sheriff Morales and Darcy head to the evacuation zone. However, the hospital has been invaded and overrun by the Aliens and the Predalien, who has impregnated some pregnant women to breed more Aliens. Wolf soon arrives at the hospital where he dispatches more Aliens and during the battle, Jesse is accidentally killed by one of Wolf's [[Shuriken]] weapons, Ricky is injured by the Predalien, and Dallas takes possession of Wolf's plasma blaster after the Predator is attacked by an Alien (while being distracted by Ricky's gunfire after Jesse's death) and both tumble down an elevator shaft.  Dallas, Ricky, Kelly and Molly reach the roof and fight off several Aliens before escaping in the helicopter, while Wolf, having survived the fall, battles the Predalien on the roof in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. Wolf and the Predalien mortally wound each other just as a [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|military jet]] arrives. Rather than a rescue airlift, it executes a [[Tactical nuclear weapon|tactical nuclear]] strike that levels the entire city. The shock wave causes the fleeing helicopter to crash in a clearing, where the survivors are rescued by the military. Wolf's plasma blaster is confiscated, and Colonel Stevens presents it to Ms. Yutani. Yutani tells him that the world is not yet ready for this kind of advanced technology.

But it is a lawless land; the two young happy-go-lucky [[Conscription in Russia|conscripts]] who assist Nikolaevna on to an armoured train are assailed shortly after saying goodbye at the station.  On arrival at the army camp, Aleksandra is taken to her grandson's platoon area and told to wait. But she refuses to sit inside the tents because of the sweltering summer heat.

She returns to the tents to find Denis had returned. They hug and exchange pleasantries. Later Aleksandra meets her grandson's commanding officer who shows her around the base; he also questions her as to her reasons for visiting.

The next day she decides to leave the cantonments and visit the local market despite the reservations of the soldiers on guard duty. Nevertheless, she insists on going so they then ask her to get cigarettes and biscuits. In the town she discovers that many of the locals are hostile towards her because she is Russian. However she soon starts talking to an elderly Chechen woman named Malika who explains she was a teacher before the war. The local lady explains that many of the young people have been irreparably changed by the fighting. Malika gives Aleksandra some cigarettes and biscuits before inviting her back to her war-ravaged apartment where they drink tea and talk.  Aleksandra thanks Malika and promises to return and pay her for the supplies. A local boy is then asked to take Aleksandra back to the Russian army camp. Although initially aggressive to her because she is a Russian, his attitude softens when she tells him that people should not be labelled together and that intelligence is more powerful than war. On arrival back at base, Aleksandra distributes the cigarettes and biscuits among the soldiers. Some then take her to a mess where she is given a hot meal. Aleksandra then returns to Denis' quarters where she finds her grandson mulling over his life in the army after he had to strike a soldier for disobeying him. After talking about their lives (she wants to live more even though her body is getting old), Denis soon brightens up and plaits his grandmother's hair while she promises to find him a wife.  The next day, Aleksandra is woken up by Denis who tells her she has to leave now because he and his men are going on a five-day mission. Slowly the elderly lady gathers her things before making one last walk through the camp saying goodbye to the soldiers she met. At the gate, she says goodbye to Denis as he climbs onto an [[BTR-80|armoured vehicle]] and to his commanding officer who silently acknowledges the good her trip has done to her grandson and the men under his command.  Aleksandra then walks back to town where she meets Malika and her local friends. Refusing to take any money for the cigarettes and bisuits, the group walk Aleksandra back to the [[armoured train]]. Aleksandra gives Malika her address asking her to come and visit her in Russia. She then boards a rolling car. The train moves off with Aleksandra waving from the doorway. With the train's departure, Malika turns and walks away with a grim expression. Aleksandra rides along looking out across the desolate empty fields of Chechyna.

All the Days Before Tomorrow
 The film follows a non-linear convoluted journey through (4) different settings: One which represents today; one which represents protagonist Wes' dreamworld; and the remaining two representing the good times shared with Alison who is Wes' dearest and closest platonic friend. The movie has been made the same way as the memoirs it is trying to portray. Non-existence of time is one aspect of the protagonist that is loved by his friend. The film captures this time anomaly in their relationship with scenes of past memories in a non-linear sequence. It gives you a sense of the loneliness and lack of deep connection Alison is going through while trying to maintain her relationship with her beau in Tokyo, all while making you aware that Wes is only carrying on with his life by holding onto the best memories between them. (This is depicted in the opening scene when Alison is watching the shining window drapes which represent the same kind of drapes at a hotel where she stayed with Wes during a road trip through the Utah deserts).<ref name=imdb></ref><ref name=letterbox></ref><ref name=nytimes></ref><ref name=apple></ref><ref name=amazon></ref><ref name=youtube></ref>  When looking back at the movie in linear fashion, it starts with an unexpected phone call from Alison to Wes on a winter evening. Alison is about to leave LA to join her beau in Tokyo. She resisted calling him during her stay in LA but on the last night she finally gave in. They mutually agreed to stay at Wes' apartment overnight not only to catch-up on each other's lives, but to also re-establish the deep, meaningful bond they had with each other years ago. The film depicts frequent incidents from their past as they spend the night talking, painting fingernails, visiting the local store to purchase watermelon and finally sharing the bed in a non-sexual way.  Scenes from the past show that Alison and Wes met two summers prior while Alison's current boyfriend Kai was away at a super-computing related conference. Wes and Alison immediately had a great connection that developed further as they shared various joys and laughter of their lives. They even ended up visiting a bar to enjoy a night of dancing. There are also scenes from the previous summer when they both took a road trip across the Utah desert and share a great time depicted in a quiet serene backdrop with no signs of mundane life and worries. With each truly enjoying the others company, they stay in a hotel in separate beds where Alison finally confesses to Wes that she is very happy and wants things to stay as they are so they do not lose what has developed. Understanding Wes's dilemma too, she apologizes for being unable to offer anything more than friendship due to her relationship with Kai. During this time she makes a call to Kai and re-confirms their committed love. Despite Wes and Alison understanding each other's position, they eventually end up kissing while getting more drunk and casual towards end of a game of strip poker. Before things go too far, Alison realizes her mistake and begins to fill with guilt. Wes feels awkward at the situation too. The next morning, despite Wes' insistence that they drive back together as planned, Alison tells Wes that she wants to go back alone.  Interspersed between these scenes of past memories are monochromatic dream sequences featuring an ethereal, third character that appears to be Wes' guardian angel or physician. The conversations between Wes and his guardian angel further help Wes to understand himself, and to realize the deeper meanings of life and the cosmic connections between eternity with Alison. (There is one Christmas party scene shown in the movie that does not fit any of the above timelines or dream sequences.)  Finally with the recollection of good memories and an old platonic bond now re-established between Wes and Alison, it is the current day morning in Los Angeles. Alison wakes up only to find that it has started snowing in LA and flights are delayed. Now, Alison and Wes both get more time to share together.

An American Crime
 In 1965, sixteen-year-old [[Sylvia Likens]] ([[Ellen Page]]) and her disabled 15-year-old sister, Jenny ([[Hayley McFarland]]) enjoy themselves at a carnival circuit. Their parents, Lester ([[Nick Searcy]]) and Betty ([[Romy Rosemont]]), who work at the carnival circuit, reconcile their previously estranged relationship and agree to go on a tour together. To cope with these changes, they decide to leave the Likens sisters in the care of an impoverished single mother named [[Gertrude Baniszewski]] ([[Catherine Keener]]), since they have befriended her children at church.  Gertrude agrees to this since the parents have promised to pay her $20 per week to take care of the Likens sisters. Their stay is initially pleasant, until Lester’s weekly payment fails to arrive. Infuriated, Gertrude whips them with a belt in the basement. The payment, along with a letter from the parents, nevertheless arrives but Gertrude intentionally discards the letter and says nothing to the Likens girls. Her daughter, Paula ([[Ari Graynor]]), is later upset when Sylvia informs her abusive boyfriend about her secret pregnancy. Gertrude forces Sylvia to apologize for “spreading lies” and has her son Johnny (Tristan Jarred) restrain Sylvia so that Paula could beat her.  The rumors surrounding Paula’s pregnancy soon circulate around their school. Meanwhile, Jenny discovers the letter in the trash, prompting Sylvia to call them. The Baniszewski children notice her calling her parents and inform their mother. Gertrude believes that they stole the money from her to make the call (in reality, they traded empty Coke bottles in for money) and burns Sylvia’s hand with a cigarette. The abuse escalates as Gertrude accuses Sylvia of flirting with Andy, the father of Gertrude’s infant child son, and starting more rumors. Gertrude then forces Sylvia to insert an empty glass Coke bottle up her skirt in front of her children and orders Johnny and Stephanie's ([[Scout Taylor-Compton]]) boyfriend Coy Hubbard ([[Jeremy Sumpter]]) to push her down the basement stairs and lock her in.  Gertrude assures a fearful Jenny that Sylvia will stay in the basement “until she learns her lesson”. To cover up the situation, she instructs her children to maintain the fiction that Sylvia was sent to juvenile for her bad influence. With Gertrude’s knowledge and approval, Johnny regularly invites the neighborhood children to the basement to beat and burn Sylvia for fun. Paula soon feels guilty and tells her mother that she believes that Sylvia has been punished enough. Gertrude ignores her, but the local Reverend ([[Michael O'Keefe]]) arrives, hinting that Paula has confessed to him about her pregnancy and Sylvia’s ongoing abuse. Gertrude tells him that Sylvia was sent to juvenile. Once the Reverend leaves, Gertrude orders everyone into the basement.  In the basement, Gertrude restrains Sylvia on the floor and begins branding the words “I’M A PROSTITUTE AND PROUD OF IT!” on her abdomen with a heated needle. When Gertrude is unable to finish, she forces her teenage neighbor Ricky Hobbs ([[Evan Peters]]) to continue the branding. That night, Paula quietly helps Sylvia escape from the basement. Gertrude is awakened by one of her daughters and tries to prevent Sylvia's escape, but Paula stops her. Ricky finds her and drives her to her parents, who are horrified at Sylvia’s condition. They drive back to the Baniszewski household to make sure Jenny is okay. The escape is proved to be a hallucination, as Sylvia oversees a distraught Stephanie leaning over Sylvia's dead body. Gertrude believes that Sylvia is faking it.  When the police arrive, Jenny approaches one of the officers by saying "get me out of here and I'll tell you everything". At a murder trial, Jenny reveals to the prosecutor that Sylvia did not do anything to hurt Gertrude or anyone else and that Gertrude threatened her with the same treatment if she told anyone the truth. Gertrude denies any wrongdoing and blames her children and their friends for Sylvia’s death. Despite this, she is declared guilty of first-degree murder and is sentenced to life in prison. Sylvia's voiceover also narrates the fates of her other murderers. In her prison cell, Gertrude sees Sylvia’s ghost but before she attempts to apologize, the ghost disappears. It is also revealed that Gertrude was released on parole in 1985 but died five years later. The ghost of Sylvia visits her parents’ carnival circuit, where she states that it was the only place she ever felt safe.

Rather than cancel the concert and hand out refunds, Ian advises the Chipmunks to lip sync. With Claire's help, Dave is allowed into the concert, but is ejected by security. Witnessing the commotion, the Chipmunks realize that they've been tricked and, deciding that they have had enough of Ian, they stall the concert. Ian locks them in a cage and prepares to take them for the world tour. Dave tries to convince Ian to let the Chipmunks go, but Ian refuses. Ian then leaves in his limo with the Chipmunks, and Dave chases them, but the Chipmunks have already escaped to Dave's car. Dave immediately pulls over and admits that he loves them like his own family. Meanwhile, Ian looks in the cage, and is shocked to see that the Chipmunks have replaced themselves with international merchandising dolls.  Later that night, the Chipmunks are fully accepted as part of the family, and they invite Claire over for dinner again. Alvin accidentally creates a [[short circuit]] after having difficulty popping the [[cork (plug)|cork]] of a [[champagne]] bottle. Though Dave decides not to say his catchphrase, the short circuit causes a [[power outage|blackout]] in the kitchen. As a result, Dave can no longer prevent it.  In a mid-credits scene, Ian, now unemployed, tries to make three [[squirrels]] sing "[[Deck the Halls]]", but fails. After this, a message says "This film is dedicated to [[Ross Bagdasarian Sr.]], who was crazy enough to invent three singing chipmunks nearly fifty years ago".  
Amal (film)
 Amal Kumar ([[Rupinder Nagra]]) is an honest, hardworking sweet-natured autorickshaw driver who charges the metre rate and is never late to pick up his regular fares: the store merchant Pooja ([[Koel Purie]]) and a schoolboy who is the son of exacting lawyer Sapna Agarwal ([[Seema Biswas]]).  While riding in Amal's autorickshaw on one occasion, Pooja has her handbag snatched out of her hands by a beggar girl (Tanisha Chatterjee). Amal immediately pursues the girl and the chase ends when the beggar girl is hit by a car. Amal and Pooja take the girl to hospital. Amal visits the girl regularly, speaks to her doctor and makes sure to remind the nurses to take good care of her.  One day Amal offers his services to an old man who has been wandering the streets of New Delhi searching for an honest man. His identity is only revealed later in the film as local billionaire G.K. Jayaram ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]). After asking Amal some questions about his life, making insulting comments about his driving skills, and going back on his words with regard to his destination, G.K. pays the fare, and is surprised that Amal does not accept a three [[rupee]] tip.  G.K. Jayaram subsequently dies and leaves his entire estate to the one honest man he believes to have encountered – Amal. His will is not to be read until Amal reports to Jayaram's lawyer Sapna, who has no idea that Amal is her son's autorickshaw driver. If Amal is not found within a month, G.K.'s estate will be inherited by his family members. Sapna deploys Suresh ([[Roshan Seth]]), G.K.'s longtime companion, to find Amal, but Suresh and G.K.'s son Vivek hatch a plan to render the search for Amal ineffective so that after a month the Jayarams’ can claim inheritance.  In the meantime, although Priya's condition improves, the beggar girl is in need of a difficult surgery that would cost 50,000 rupees. Amal decides to sell his autorickshaw in order to pay for the girl's surgery. Priya dies on the operating table. Amal then takes up a janitor position at a local post office. Touched by Amal's kindness and self-sacrifice, Pooja digs into the money she has been saving for her dowry and buys a carburetor she knows is needed to fix an abandoned auto-rickshaw lying by Amal’s house. She takes it to Amal so he can install it and return to his usual business.  Meanwhile, Suresh starts questioning his actions after finding Amal and witnessing his honesty and sweet nature first-hand. He is reluctant to notify Sapna he has found G.K.'s heir but eventually does so the night before the deadline. He then informs Vivek that he is abandoning their original plan and is taking Amal to Sapna's the next day. Vivek attacks Suresh and chokes him to death.  The next morning, Sapna uses some of Suresh's notes and finds out that Amal is her son's autorickshaw driver. She manages to get Amal into the house to sign some papers. Amal, who is still unaware of the inheritance, opens G.K.’s letter and takes a long look at it but before Sapna provides any information, she receives a phone call and asks Amal to wait in the living room. Sapna is told that Suresh has died. Amal wants to be on time to meet Pooja and simply keeps on walking, leaving Sapna's residence. Out on the sidewalk, Amal is approached by a homeless girl who asks him for a piece of paper to draw on. Amal hands her the letter and drives away.  The homeless girl approaches Sapna's son and tells him that the paper Amal has given her to draw on has writing on it and may be of some importance. Sapna's son replies that it would make no difference, as Amal cannot read. The movie ends with Amal picking up Pooja, the two smiling at each other, and a voiceover by G.K. saying that he could not imagine what the man who did not want three rupees would do with three hundred million rupees.

American Gangster (film)
 In 1968, [[Frank Lucas (drug dealer)|Frank Lucas]] is the right-hand man of [[Harlem]] gangster [[Bumpy Johnson|Ellsworth "Bumpy" Johnson]]. When Johnson dies of a heart attack, Lucas takes control of the Harlem crime scene.  After handing in almost $1 million that he found in a mobster's car, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] detective [[Richie Roberts]] is ostracized in his precinct. After his exiled and addicted partner overdoses on a potent brand of  [[heroin]] called "Blue Magic", Captain Lou Toback puts Roberts in charge of a task force  that targets local suppliers. Lucas buys Blue Magic directly from producers in Thailand and smuggles it into the U.S. through returning [[Vietnam War]] servicemen. His low overhead allows him to eventually wholesale Blue Magic to most of the dealers in the New York area. With this monopoly, Lucas expands his control to nightclubs, casinos, and prostitution. He buys a mansion for his mother and recruits his five brothers, including Huey and Turner, as lieutenants to spread his empire. During his rise to becoming Harlem's crime boss, Lucas falls in love with Eva, a Puerto Rican beauty queen.  As Lucas' business prospers, he makes a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the [[Fight of the Century]] with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]] [[Italian-American Mafia|mafia]] boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure [[Nicky Barnes]], a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the [[Fall of Saigon]] cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.  Roberts' detectives witness Frank Lucas' cousin and driver shoot a woman and then use the threat of a long sentence to get him to wear a [[Covert listening device|wire]]. The gathered information allows Roberts and his task force to identify and search one of the last planes carrying Lucas' stock, discovering Blue Magic in the coffins of dead returning servicemen. With this evidence they obtain a [[Warrant (law)|warrant]] to follow the drugs into Newark's projects and Lucas' heroin processing facility. In the ensuing shootout, Steve Lucas, Frank Lucas' young nephew who gave up a promising career for the New York Yankees to join Lucas' crime family, is killed. Meanwhile, Trupo, whose prized [[Shelby Mustang]] Lucas had destroyed, and his men break into Lucas' mansion to steal his emergency cash supply hidden under the doghouse, killing the dog. As Lucas gets ready to go after Trupo, his mother dissuades him from killing a cop, warning him that she and Eva will leave him if he does. Lucas is arrested after Roberts' team conducts a raid on the shops run by his brothers.  In the police station, Lucas offers to bribe Roberts, but is rebuffed. Instead, Roberts offers Lucas a chance at a shorter jail sentence if he aids his investigation of dirty cops in the NYPD and Lucas duly provides Roberts with the names. In the end, three quarters of the New York [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] are arrested and convicted, and a distraught Trupo commits suicide. Roberts, having just passed the bar exam, defends Lucas as his first client. Lucas is sentenced to 70 years in prison, of which he serves 15 years and is released in 1991.  
American Pastime (film)
 The first scene shows the life of the Nomura family, a typical American family of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] descent in 1941, composed of Japanese-born parents and American-born children (in this case, two sons, Lane and Lyle).  They are forced to leave their home in [[Los Angeles]] following the infamous [[Executive Order 9066]], signed by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]. Order 9066 permitted the "exclusion" of Japanese Americans from the [[West Coast of the United States]], and actual historic footage shows the rounding up of these families, most of whom were (like the Nomura sons) born as American citizens.  The Nomuras find themselves in a dusty, windblown desert camp. The viewer sees some actual footage of Topaz War Relocation Center, shot by [[Dave Tatsuno]], using a camera which had been smuggled into the camp.  The elder Nomura had been a professional [[baseball]] player, and he rapidly forms an in-camp league. One of the guards, Billy Burrell ([[Gary Cole]]) is a minor-league baseball player, bitter about having been passed over by a recruiter from the [[New York Yankees]]. Many of the major leagues' top players were off to war, perhaps giving Burrell another opportunity with the Yankees.  Lane Nomura, the oldest son enlists in the Army, as a member of the [[442nd Regimental Combat Team]], the famed "Purple Heart Battalion." One guard, originally condemning the very idea of letting Japanese Americans into "our Army," changes his mind as he sees a list of men from Topaz who had been killed while rescuing a Texas battalion.  Lyle, the younger son, originally angry and rebellious over the internment, eventually finds motivation to succeed when the Topaz team challenges Burrell and the local minor league team, several of whose members are openly bigoted and hateful against the internees.

Anamorph (film)
 Stan Aubray ([[Willem Dafoe]]), is a seasoned, semi-retired detective with significant obsessive-compulsive disorder and struggling with alcoholism. Resigned to a teaching position for [[forensic psychology]], he is called back to active duty following the elaborately staged murder of a man in a high-rise apartment building. The victim is suspended and surrounded by photography lights, the room sealed off except for a pinhole, creating a projected [[camera obscura]] effect on the apartment wall. This crime scene bears many similarities to the Uncle Eddie murders, a series of similarly "artistic" killings, for which Stan was promoted following the prime suspect's death in an attempted arrest. Stan relates some of his difficulties to Sandy, a recovering alcoholic and former prostitute who is a friend of Stan and Crystal, the final victim of Uncle Eddie, and Stan's apparent former lover. Sandy invites Stan on a hiking trip with a group of friends, which Stan declines.  A second killing quickly follows the first, in which the butchered corpse's limbs are hung independently from wires, creating the image of a raven when viewed from the proper angle. Stan begins drinking heavily, even filling his coffee cup with vodka in the middle of work. He also begins to have friction with Detective Carl ([[Scott Speedman]]), a recently promoted detective who is resentful of Stan's aloof attitude. Following this, Stan returns home to find his apartment has been broken into, the thief stealing an antique [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] chair and replacing it with a taping of his inquiry following Crystal and Uncle Eddie's deaths. Stan also notices a painting identical to the camera obscura projection in an antiques store, also painted with identical pigments to the Uncle Eddie killings.  Stan visits Detective Jorge "George" Ruiz, his former partner until the Uncle Eddie murders. After reminiscing briefly, Stan doesn't inform Ruiz of the copycat killings, and departs. Partway home he realizes he is being followed, and chases his stalker, who escapes. The following morning, Stan is informed Ruiz has been found murdered, his abdomen opened and his innards removed, forming an inkwell of blood.  The scene includes a [[pantograph]] machine and a half-finished canvas. Using his former partner's blood, Stan paints the other half of the painting, forming the image of a screaming face. The other officers begin to suspect Stan. Attempting to replace his chair, Stan consults with Blair Collet, an antiques dealer who finds antique chairs for Stan, and likens Stan to the killer's patron, as he bought the painting from the antiques store, or his obsession, similar to [[Study after Velázquez's Portrait of Pope Innocent X|Francis Bacon's obsession with Pope Innocent]]. Blair then takes Stan to an art gallery which is filled with model depictions of the recent murders, including Stan's stolen chair. The curator informs them that the artist is Gerri Harden. Searching the art pieces, Stan finds a clay model of the raven, with hundreds of fingerprints still present on the clay. This leads them to a warehouse with a dummy model wearing a Gerri Harden name badge, and several paintings, when Stan realizes the name is an anagram from 'a red herring'. During this time, he receives a photograph of Sandy and her friends from the hiking trip.  The next day, Stan receives a call from the killer, who repeatedly tells him "a poison harms" (An anagram for [[anamorphosis]], the artistic technique he is using), and tells Stan to come see his next show, which is another empty warehouse containing diagrams of the final Uncle Eddie murders, including Crystal's, which, when viewed from high above, had the appearance of a body on a rock by a beach shore. Stan, at home, receives a call from Sandy with another invitation, when he realizes that the man who had been stalking him is in the picture. He fails to reach Sandy, and tries her AA group, when he learns her sponsor, the man in the picture, drove her away. Sandy is receiving a tattoo of angel's wings, provided by the killer. She blithely remarks that he might be too high to finish, and comments that she's never seen him high, and he responds that he'd never put that poison in his veins. Sandy begins to struggle, first for a chance to look at the tattoo, and then for a break, and the killer slits her throat. Stan appears at the studio, without having called in for backup. He sees Sandy slumped over as the killer walks past her. Stan follows the killer, wounding him in the shoulder before being stabbed. The killer drags him to the podium and the chair that they'd found the dummy in and props Stan in place. Stan, noticing the tattoo with an eye stenciled beneath it, places his head on Sandy's back, revealing that, when viewed in conjunction with the warehouse floor, spells out the word 'DEAD', a hallmark of the Uncle Eddie murders.  During this, Detective Carl, at his desk, notices a reflection in the first murder photo off his coffee cup, of the raven in the second murder. Searching the raven, he finds the face from the third killing, and in the third killing painting, finds an image of the studio they'd searched. The killer shoots Stan, just before Carl appears and guns down the killer. Stan, struggling for breath, leans back, and dies.

La Antena
 The movie begins with a pair of hands typing on a typewriter. The denizens of a nameless city "in the year XX" have lost their voices. People communicate by mouthing out words that are spelled mid-air. The only person who has kept the use of her voice is La Voz ("the voice"), a singer working for the sole TV channel broadcast in the city, run by Mr. TV, who desires La Voz. La Voz wears a hood over her head that hides away her face. She has a son called Tomás, an eyeless little kid who nonetheless also has a voice (although this is kept a secret). Tomás lives next door to Ana, whom he one day befriends after a letter addressed to his house is erroneously delivered to hers.  Ana's parents are estranged - he works for Mr. TV as a TV repairman, she is a nurse at a hospital. When Ana loses a "balloon man" owned by the channel, her father and grandfather are fired from the studio. Soon enough, Ana's father stumbles upon evidence that La Voz has been kidnapped, and, together with Mr. TV's vengeful son, they set out to spy on Mr. TV. Ana's father pays his ex-wife to let them into the hospital, where Mr. TV and his henchman Dr. Y (a scientist whose lower head has been replaced with a TV screen showing a mouth) subject La Voz to a series of experiments of dubious nature. They plan to use La Voz's unique power to finally subdue the denizens of the city. However, Dr. Y theorizes that a second voice might counter the effect of La Voz's. Mr. TV's outraged son comes out of hiding, is overpowered, and then put away, by his father's henchmen, whereas Ana's father manages to escape with the aid of his wife.  The reconciled couple manage to rescue Ana and Tomás from Mr. TV's henchmen (led by a masked, malformed man referred to as "the Rat Man") and meet with the grandfather. Since Mr. TV is going to broadcast La Voz's voice and thus subdue all citizens, they have to broadcast a second voice to counter the effect. The grandfather suggests using an old station, The Aerial, abandoned in the outskirts of the city, in the snowy mountains. Tomás, Ana and her parents don inflatable suits (equal to those donned by "balloon men") which send them floating up in the sky. Just as the grandfather finishes elevating them, the Rat Man and his henchmen arrive and shoot him. The family are then propelled away into the mountains.  Meanwhile, Mr. TV and Dr. Y initiate the broadcast during a boxing match. The citizens become hypnotized and subsequently fall asleep. Words then start oozing out of their bodies - the machine that sucked out their voice now takes their words out of them. In The Aerial, the Rat Man and his henchmen storm into the station, stopping short Tomás's transmission. Ana's father and the Rat Man fight over a gun and stumble into a secret room in the station that reveals The Aerial's director, a young girl fitted inside a glass orb that oversees the production of the drugged food that keeps citizens under Mr. TV's control.  The gun goes off and kills The Aerial's director, who turns into an old woman after dying, and Ana knocks down the Rat Man. Back at the lab, Tomás's transmission sends Dr. Y into a choking fit and is finished off by Mr. TV. The transmissions counter each other and the citizens wake up, now able to use their voice (albeit without being able to speak). In the end, the family comes out of The Aerial, trying their new voices.

Apa Khabar Orang Kampung
 The precise role of the [[Communist Party of Malaya]] (CPM) in [[Malaysian history]] is still a controversial and hotly contested one. It was a player in the anti-colonial struggle against occupying Japanese forces (from 1942–5) and later the returning British administration (1945–1957). However, its continual commitment to armed struggle in the post-Independence era depleted much public support.  In the propaganda war, the government made much of the fact that the CPM comprised mainly ethnic Chinese members and adopted an 'atheistic' political philosophy. As the nation is mainly Malay-Muslim, these were effective scare tactics in dissuading the population from having any sympathy towards the communists.  However, a large and influential division of the CPM, the [[10th Malay Regiment|10th Regiment]], comprised Malay-Muslim members. Many of its leaders such as [[Abdullah CD]], [[Rashid Maidin]], Abu Samah, [[Shamsiah Fakeh]], Kamaruzzaman Teh and [[Suriani Abdullah]] were iconic figures of rebellion and resistance. These men and women had no trouble reconciling radical left ideology with Islamic faith.  The 10th Regiment began a strategic retreat across the border into South Thailand in the mid-1950s. Many of the members would not see their home villages again for five decades.  From secret jungle hide-outs, they conducting guerrilla warfare against the armed forces of the day. When the government of China began diplomatic relations with Malaysia in the early 1980s, aid from Beijing stopped and life became more difficult. A formal ceasefire was signed in 1989.  This documentary takes a look at the present-day lives of the 10th Regiment figures who are still living in a village in South Thailand. (Others had either died or opted to return to Malaysia). They earn a living by farming and are no longer engaged in politics.  Almost everyone in the village is either above the age of 60 or below 15. This is because the middle generation often had to be sent out for adoption as children would have been inconvenient in secret guerrilla hideouts.  The children in the village will grow up as Thai citizens and soon the emotional link to Malaysia will be lost. School lessons are in Thai rather than Malay. Life here is tranquil and slow-moving; it rains often and the chickens roam freely.  Through interviews with the elders, we hear of how life in the jungle was like: the food, the battles, the acupuncture. But the narrative keeps breaking up. There are audio and visual disruptions. History refuses to be contained or told so neatly.  In the background, a Thai radio soap opera is heard. It tells the story of a king who suspects his pregnant wife of adultery, and so jails her.  
Apartment 1303
 Living on her own for the first time, Sayaka celebrates with her friends at her new 13th-floor apartment. During the party, she is seen acting strange before jumping to her death from her balcony. A little girl picks up a teddy bear lying near Sayaka's body and says: "There goes another one."  At Sayaka's funeral, her older sister Mariko sees the ghost of Sayaka, who whispers: "Mom pushed me." Their mother, deeply devastated by Sayaka’s death, seems to be falling into a world of insanity, which worries Mariko. At Sayaka's apartment, a little girl appears from next door and informs Mariko that all women who lived in #1303 have died.  While Mariko clears out the apartment, she repeatedly catches sight of Sayaka. She then comes across an earring that looked as if it’d been ripped out of someone's earlobe. Mariko wonders if this might be a clue. She meets a police detective, Sakurai,  who reveals that he’s been investigating a series of suicides at #1303 and he doesn’t believe it’s a coincidence. Mariko gives him the blood-streaked earring, believing it belongs to a previous tenant.  Mariko soon comes across a book about the first two tenants who lived in #1303: Yukiyo Sugiuchi and her mother. The mother became abusive towards Yukiyo for hiding food and having her ears pierced, which prompts her to rip the  earring out of Yukiyo's earlobe. Yukiyo reacts defensively to her mother’s violence with a [[butcher knife]], then watches while her mother crawls into a closet, where she bleeds to death. Six months later, the landlord reveals his plans to have Yukiyo and mother thrown out for failing to pay rent.  Upset and afraid, Yukiyo sees the ghost of her mother, who has been tormenting Yukiyo since her death. Yukiyo picks up a teddy bear, walks to her balcony and jumps to her death. Mariko discovers that since Yukiyo’s death, the next four tenants – with Sayaka as the latest – had moved into #1303 and eventually jumped to their death. The police ruled each case as a suicide.  Mariko learns her mother plans to visit #1303 to see Sayaka one more time and rushes to save her. Unknown to Mariko, the apartment has been rented out to several college students, who throw a party that night. During the party, Yukiyo pushes girls over the balcony. Mariko arrives and rushes to #1303. Yukiyo appears and Mariko accuses her of killing the previous tenants but Yukiyo denies this, revealing that her mother is the one who told her to throw them over because they were evil. Mariko returns Yukiyo’s earring to her while promising to look after #1303. The spirit seems to accept this and vanishes.  As Mariko awakens the following morning, Yukiyo pushes Mariko against the balcony and tells her that her mother has only one daughter. Mariko notices Sayaka watching just as she falls to her death. Standing next to her mother, the little girl says: "There goes another one." Then she and her mother vanish.

Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters
 Before the main feature, a faux theater [[concession stand]] advertisement plays. A group of anthropomorphic theater snacks, The Soda Dog Refreshment Band, sings until they are interrupted by another snack band (performed by [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]]). They proceed to loudly sing their own bizarre theater rules before finishing on a guitar solo.  The film properly begins in [[Egypt]], where [[Master Shake]], [[Frylock]], and [[Meatwad]] break free from the [[Sphinx]], and are attacked by an oversized [[Poodle]] who kills Frylock before Shake defeats it. Shake and Meatwad flee with Frylock's corpse and meet [[Abraham Lincoln|Time Lincoln]]. He helps revive Frylock; however, when government agents break into his house, Time Lincoln helps the Aqua Teens escape in a wooden [[rocket ship]]. Time Lincoln is shot, changing the timeline and resulting in the Confederate States of America's victory in the American Civil War and the government agents being made slaves to a black Kentucky Colonel as punishment for their crimes against the South. All this, however, is an elaborate story concocted by Shake to explain their origin to Meatwad. A triangular slice of [[watermelon]] named Walter Melon is flying about in a spaceship made from a hollowed-out watermelon. He begins observing events of the Aqua Teens on Earth, including a backyard concert performed by Meatwad. All unfolding according to his plan. Walter Melon is joined in the ship by [[Neil Peart]] from [[Rush (band)|Rush]], sitting at his drums.  Shake plans to work out on his new exercise machine, the "Insanoflex". Frylock notices that the machine isn't assembled properly and the instructions are nowhere to be found. He searches online for them and instead finds a website written in a rare dialect, with a message in English warning not to assemble the machine ever. The site however lists a phone number which Frylock calls. It is revealed to be the number of Emory and Oglethorpe, the Plutonians. Before they even bother to answer the phone, they discover the [[Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future]] on board with them. The Cybernetic Ghost explains to the two aliens the story of the Insanoflex: a machine, when assembled, will exercise a man into a super-being, who will attract all the women on Earth leading to massive [[inbreeding]] and the eventual extinction of mankind. To prevent this, the Ghost traveled to the past and stole a single screw that holds the machine together. The Plutonians point out to him that to get it assembled, someone could just buy another screw or shove a pencil in the screw hole. Back on Earth, Frylock finishes re-building the Insanoflex, with a pencil in the screw hole, somehow having obtained instructions. He discovers a missing M-shaped circuit board on the back panel. The trio visit [[Carl Brutananadilewski|Carl]], from whom Shake had stolen the machine, to see if he has the missing piece. After he refuses to tell them, Meatwad finds the address in the Insanoflex's box. Dr. Weird, whose abandoned asylum has been purchased and is being turned into condominiums around them, is visited by Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad. Frylock retrieves the missing circuit board and installs it into the machine upon returning home. Carl insists that as the rightful owner he should be the first to test out the machine. The Insanoflex straps him in and transforms itself into a giant one-eyed robot. The robot plays dance/techno music and heads for downtown [[Philadelphia]], all while Carl's strapped-in form is forced to exercise. Eventually, the robot begins laying metallic spherical eggs, which hatch into smaller versions of the machine.  The Aqua Teens, aided by an instructional workout video, find a way to destroy the machine by using music. With little time and a failed encounter with MC Pee Pants (reincarnated as a fly), the Aqua Teens have no choice but to have Shake play his music. Shake poorly plays his original song "Nude Love" on acoustic guitar, forcing the Insanoflex to commit suicide. Carl (now bulging with so much muscle that he can barely move) leaves with his newly found date, a female bodybuilder named Linda, and they head back to her condo while the Aqua Teens try to figure out a way to stop the newly hatched Insanoflexes from destroying the city.  As they travel to a possible lead back at Dr. Weird's asylum, Frylock begins to tell the origin story of the Aqua Teens: they were created by Dr. Weird, along with a [[Chicken nuggets|chicken nugget]] who had gone by the name of Chicken Bittle. In the flashback, Dr. Weird proclaims that the Aqua Teens were created for one purpose: to crash a jet into a brick wall. Realizing the pointlessness of this mission, Frylock diverted the jet and set a course to Africa, where they would try to use their intelligence to solve world hunger. Upon entering Africa, Bittle was attacked and eaten by a lion. The remaining Aqua Teens then tried to help a small village but instead scared them away. After realizing they couldn't be much help, they returned to America and rented out what is now their house in New Jersey. Shake and Meatwad state that they do not remember any of this, but Frylock explains it was because they were too busy playing [[Game Boy]] to pay any attention.  Meanwhile, Carl and Linda recline in her room, where she reveals "herself" to be Dr. Weird in disguise. He cuts off Carl's muscles and grafts them onto his own body. Frylock and Dr. Weird do battle while they argue back and forth about who created whom. Dr. Weird claims that it was Frylock who created him, not the other way around. Dr Weird shows Frylock a teddy bear filled with razor blades. Shake tries to take the teddy bear, but he loses his hand. Dr. Weird then reveals that the blue diamond on Frylock's back hides a [[VCR]], in which a video tape with false memories of Dr. Weird creating Frylock had been playing in Frylock's head. Frylock also admits that he is [[Transsexualism|transsexual]] lesbian trapped in a man's body. Just then, Walter Melon arrives in his ship. Meatwad mentions he saw the ship earlier. Shake calls him a liar and shoots him with a shotgun. Shake gets concerned when Meatwad doesn't reform like always. Walter tells Neil to play the Drum Solo Of Life to bring Meatwad back to life. Meanwhile, Shake tries to pick up the teddy bear for the 2nd time, but loses his other hand. Shake forgets about his hands and leaves it. Walter Melon explains he created the Aqua Teens and all the other characters, including the Insanoflex. His plan was so that they would all eventually kill each other and Walter would inherit all their real estate in order to create the "Insano-Gym". Everyone, however, informs Walter that they all rent and do not own any property, proving Walter's plan and everyone's existence had been useless and pointless. Walter storms off in his ship, threatening to tell their mother. Just then, the Teens see their alleged mother standing before them, revealed to be a 9-layer bean burrito. Shake unknowingly jumps out the window, Meatwad hugs her and Frylock states, "That's neat."  In an abrupt end, The Soda Dog Refreshment Gang come onscreen once again and sing the audience out.  In a [[post-credits scene]], The Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future is seen humping the TV in the Aqua Teens' living room. Then a female box of fries (presumably Frylock who got a [[Sexual reassignment surgery|sex change]]) comes in and says, "Time for bed, honey..."

Appleseed Ex Machina
   Two years after the incident at the utopian city Olympus, Deunan Knute and [[Briareos Hecatonchires]] of the counter-terrorism unit E-SWAT rescue a group of European Union officials from [[cyborg]]s. The duo returns to Olympus, where Briareos is confined to hospital until he recovers. Deunan continues E-SWAT work, meeting her new partner, Tereus, who surprisingly resembles Briareos' human form. Deunan demands an explanation and is given the tour of the new Bioroid production facility. During the tour, Hitomi, a bioroid that Deunan has befriended, is mentioned to now be a minister of political affairs. Tereus is actually a Bioroid; a prototype for a whole new production line of Bioroids to be soldiers without negative emotions to impact their judgment in fighting. As his physical and mental strength was found to be most desirable in E-SWAT, Briareos' [[DNA]] was used mostly in Tereus' design. Reluctantly, Deunan is partnered up with Tereus to evaluate his performance. Deunan notices that many Olympus citizens are wearing Connexus; a device on their ears which projects holographic data over the eyes.  Deunan, Lance and Hitomi visit Briareos, still recovering in hospital. Here, Lance states that out of the last five terrorist incidents, four of them have been by groups composed solely of cyborgs, with transmitted signals from surrounding locations, thus suggesting that digitally vulnerable cyborgs are actually being manipulated to perform these acts. Because many of these cyborgs consist of parts made by Poseidon, a multinational industrial conglomerate, an emissary is sent to Prime Minister Athena. The emissary denies Poseidon blame, but Olympus still boycotts them, which Poseidon finds undesirable as other world powers may follow suit.  Meanwhile, Hitomi hosts a birthday party, in which Deunan is happy to find Briareos attending now that he's fully recovered. Briareos meets Tereus for the first time — which makes him uncomfortable — but the two accept each other. Briareos also accepts Deunan's new partnership with Tereus and has found another partner, which upsets Deunan. She storms off, but is eventually joined by Tereus, who displays many of Briareos' personality traits, which causes further confusion for Deunan.  The next day, Athena and an assemblage of world leaders discuss making a global security network by merging all the satellites worldwide to prevent [[terrorism|terrorist]] attacks. ESWAT and the Olympus police forces set up barricades around the conference hall. ESWAT personnel detect the broadcast of an unknown signal. Soon, a variety of vehicles and ''non''-cybernetic humans begin to assault the conference, much to the confusion of ESWAT and the regular police. Even more strangely, at the same time, Aeacus kills an engineer on board an ESWAT transport, declaring, "We will all be one. I am Halcon" and destroys it to escape wearing his Land-Mate. Briareos rushes to the explosion, and initially tries to stop Aeacus but ends up killing him. As Deunan and Tereus arrive, Tereus uncovers the mysterious signal coming from robotic doves. Simultaneously, the unknown signal disappears, and the attackers collapse. A funeral is held sometime later for Aeacus.  At the same time all the satellites are joined, Briareos is nearly run down by an unmanned vehicle. He stops it but suddenly goes berserk and hacks into a public terminal, crashing the main satellite control, forcing Olympus to switch to a backup. Briareos is hospitalized, with the unknown signal ruled out as the cause of his outburst. Briareos gets suspicious of his cyborg doctor, Richard Kestner, who operated on him after his accident. He has Hitomi look up Kestner's files, learning that he once worked with Poseidon's Halcon Laboratories — but all records of his project are mysteriously erased. Briaereos escapes and locates Kestner, who confesses that he is part of a plan to "unify" humanity by erasing individuality, to which he attributes the source of human conflict. He reveals that he secretly injected Briareos with [[nanite]]s designed to take control of his body when his [[adrenaline]] is heated. Kestner commits suicide before the police arrive, making them think that Briareos killed him. Briareos escapes, but is cornered by Tereus. Deunan arrives with an antidote designed to suppress the nanites.  The virus Kestner placed in the backup network takes control of the satellites and, through these satellites, all people linked to the Connexus, compelling them to riot against Olympus. Believing that Poseidon knows something about all this, Briareos, Tereus and Deunan track down a Poseidon convoy to learn about Halcon. As they discover, Halcon was once the leading scientific laboratory until they started mind control experiments, which Poseidon was forced to end when the project lead Elizabeth Xander was killed in an accident. Poseidon assists the ESWAT officers in infiltrating the fortress where the Halcon signal is transmitting. Once they are in the control center, they discover that Xander was resurrected as a cyborg to control all those linked to the Connexus. Deunan manages to briefly free her from Halcon control with the last syringe of antidote. With little time before the virus retakes control, Xander frees the enthralled before she has Deunan kill her. The heroes then escape the collapsing fortress and return to Olympus.

Arctic Tale
 At the outset of the movie, Nanu emerges from the cave where she was born along with her brother, just born as well, and their mother. The two [[polar bear]] cubs play in the snow for a while until returning to their snow cave. The next day, the cubs start learning from their mother how to survive in the wild. One of the first things they find out by watching their mother is to stay away from grown male polar bears who are apt to kill them.  Seela is shown in the water just after birth with her mother and "Auntie" who helps protect the [[walrus]] calf during her early life. For her first life lesson, Seela is taught how to hoist herself onto an ice floe from the water without any help except watching her mother do the same. During this time, Auntie watches for predators. When a male polar bear comes along and starts swimming towards the walruses, Seela and her mother try to get away from him, but must rely on Auntie's help to stave off the polar bear's attack.  Next for the polar bear cubs is learning how to hunt for food. Their mother teaches them how to hunt for a [[fur seal]] by stamping down on the ice where she can smell the seal in a small cave underneath. After one failed attempt diving into the water, the mother gets the seal by this stamping method, so her cubs and a fox trailing them can eat the meat. Meanwhile, the young walrus feasts on [[clam]]s for three days with the rest of its herd on a clam bed they might revisit in another five years.  The two animals then take similar paths. They have to travel because shorter winters mean ice that freezes later and melts sooner, making it harder to survive and eat as the water of [[Arctic Ocean]] expands. Male polar bears pose a threat to both of the main creatures, as the cubs have to navigate around him and the walruses try to get away from being prey. After Nanu's brother dies, Nanu has to leave her mother earlier than is customary because of the changing climate conditions, but she still has trouble finding food on her own. Eventually, she finds a male bear who has killed a walrus, identified as Auntie, and aggressively persuades the male to let her share on the feast.  Finally being attracted to animals of the opposite sex, Nanu finds a mate whom she is seen playing with on screen. Seela waits until a particular male walrus's song appeals to her before diving into the water to meet him. ''Arctic Tale'' closes with the cycle being complete, as Nanu gives birth to two cubs of her own and Seela gives birth to a [[female]] calf.

  In 1881, young, starstruck [[Robert Ford (outlaw)|Robert "Bob" Ford]] ([[Casey Affleck]]) seeks out [[Jesse James]] ([[Brad Pitt]]) when the [[James-Younger Gang|James gang]] is planning a train robbery in Blue Cut, Missouri, making unsuccessful attempts to join the gang with the help of his older brother [[Charley Ford|Charley]] ([[Sam Rockwell]]), already a member. The train turns out to be carrying only a fraction of the money originally thought, and [[Frank James]] ([[Sam Shepard]]) tells Charley Ford that this robbery would be the last the James brothers would commit. Jesse returns home to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], bringing the Fords, [[Dick Liddil]] ([[Paul Schneider (actor)|Paul Schneider]]) and his cousin, [[Wood Hite]] ([[Jeremy Renner]]). Jesse sends Charley, Wood and Dick away, but insists that Bob stay. He wanted the younger man just for his help in moving furniture to a [[Jesse James Home Museum|new home]] in [[St. Joseph, Missouri]]. Bob becomes more admiring of James before being sent back to the farmhouse of his widowed sister, Martha Bolton, where he rejoins his brother Charley, Hite, and Liddil.  Liddil reveals to Bob that he is in collusion with another member of the James gang, [[James Robert Cummins|Jim Cummins]], to capture Jesse for a substantial [[bounty (reward)|bounty]]. Meanwhile, Jesse visits another gang member, [[Edward T. Miller (outlaw)|Ed Miller]] ([[Garret Dillahunt]]), who gives away information on Cummins' plot. Jesse kills Miller, then departs with Liddil to hunt down Cummins. Unable to locate him, Jesse viciously beats Albert Ford (Jesse Frechette), a young cousin of Bob and Charley. Liddil returns to the Bolton farmhouse, and argues with Hite, which ends with Bob Ford killing Hite. They dump his body in the woods to conceal the murder from Jesse.  Jesse and Charley Ford travel to St. Joseph where Jesse learns of Hite's disappearance, which Charley denies knowing anything about. Meanwhile, Bob goes to Kansas City [[Police Commissioner]] Henry Craig ([[Michael Parks]]), saying he knows Jesse James' whereabouts. To prove his allegiance with the James gang, Bob urges Craig to arrest Dick Liddil. Following Liddil's arrest and confession to participation in numerous gang robberies, Bob brokers a deal with the [[Governor of Missouri]], [[Thomas Theodore Crittenden|Thomas T. Crittenden]] ([[James Carville]]). He is given ten days to capture or kill Jesse James, and promised a substantial bounty and full pardon for murder.  Charley persuades Jesse to take Bob Ford into the gang; the brothers return to St. Joseph. Introduced as cousins to the Howards (the James' pseudonym), they stay with the family, including [[Zerelda Mimms|Zee James]] ([[Mary-Louise Parker]]) and their two children. Jesse wants to revive his gang by robberies with the Fords, beginning with the [[Platte City]] bank. On the morning of April 3, 1882, Jesse and the Ford brothers prepare to depart for the robbery. Jesse reads in the newspaper about the arrest and confessions of Liddil. While the three men are in the living room, Jesse removes his gun belt and climbs a chair to clean a dusty picture. Bob shoots Jesse in the back of the head and flees with Charley. They send a [[telegram]] to the governor to announce Jesse's death, for which they were to receive $10,000. However, they never receive more than $500 each.  After the killing, the Fords become celebrities, touring with a theatre show in [[Manhattan]] in which they re-enact the shooting, but people soon dislike that Bob shot Jesse, unarmed, in the back.

Assembly (film)
  In 1948, during the [[Huaihai Campaign]] of the [[Chinese Civil War]], Captain Gu Zidi leads the 9th Company of the [[People's Liberation Army]] 139th Regiment to capture a town controlled by the [[National Revolutionary Army]], during which they sustain heavy casualties. Angered by the death of his [[political commissar]], Gu attempts to execute the NRA soldiers who surrendered. As a result, he is thrown in jail for three days by his superior, Colonel Liu Zeshui. In jail, he befriends Wang Jincun, an enlisted man and former school-teacher who was jailed for cowardice. Upon being released, Gu and his 46 surviving men are sent to defend a coal mine on the bank of the Wen River, which is near [[Tai'an]], [[Shandong]]. They are ordered not to retreat until they hear a [[assembly (bugle call)|bugle call for assembly]]. With Liu's permission, Wang, being the most educated man in the company, becomes the 9th Company's new political commissar. Almost immediately after fortifying their position, the 9th Company comes under heavy attack by NRA forces. Having fended off a wave of enemy infantry, and destroyed two enemy tanks, only a handful of soldiers are still alive. At this point, some of the soldiers claim to hear the bugle call in the distance. Gu, who was temporarily deafened by an explosion, is reluctant to believe them and commands that they fight to the death. The entire 9th Company is killed except Gu, who is knocked unconscious by a tank shell.  PLA forces eventually recapture the area later and find Gu, unconscious and heavily wounded, and wearing an enemy uniform he stole while behind enemy lines. At the military hospital, Gu tries to explain that he was a captain in the PLA, and that, after being knocked unconscious, he awoke, put on the enemy uniform in order to steal food from nearby, and then bombed an enemy fuel depot before falling unconscious again. However, the PLA went through a reorganisation while Gu was in a coma, and hardly anyone remembers the existence of the 139th Regiment, whose members nearly all perished, so Gu is unable to verify his identity. He is scorned by the other patients who consider him a deserter. Gu volunteers to fight in the [[Korean War]] as an enlisted man, and during an artillery spotting mission, risks his life to save his commander, Lieutenant Zhao Erdou, from a [[landmine]], in the process losing his right eye. The two of them become close friends, and Zhao supports Gu's attempts to have his contributions and those of the 9th Company recognised.  Gu returns to the Wen River battlefield and tries to locate the mine. He is disappointed to see that the mine has been reactivated and that the old entrance has been buried underneath piles of coal. He encounters Wang's widow and convinces her to marry Zhao. As time passes, Zhao manages to discover the location of the tomb of Liu, the 139th Regiment's leader. Gu visits the tomb and finds that the curator is Liu's assistant and bodyguard, who survived the war but lost one of his arms. The curator confirms that the bugle call was never sounded, as the 9th Company was deliberately sacrificed to buy time for the rest of the regiment. Gu flies into a rage and fights with the curator but later manages to calm down.  Gu starts camping at the mine and attempts to dig out his men's bodies with a shovel, despite protests from the miners. When Wang's remains are found a month later, the PLA sends an official notice to the local government to honour the 9th Company. However, Gu remains inconsolable because he cannot find the remaining bodies. At this point, he experiences a flashback which reveals that, as enemy forces closed in, he and Wang buried the bodies of the others deep inside the mine. While Gu went out to continue fighting, a mortally wounded Wang blew up the entrance to prevent the enemy from capturing the bodies, killing himself in the process.  Years later, the remains of the other soldiers are found during an excavation for an irrigation project. The PLA erects a monument near the site and conducts a military funeral with full honours for the 9th Company. Gu finally finds peace. The ending titles say that Gu died in 1987 at the age of 71. He was abandoned by his parents when he was three months old due to famine in his hometown, and was found by a shoemaker in a millet field. He was named "Gu Zidi", which means "millet field".

Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water.  Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including the word "[[cunt]]": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter.   Briony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes it to her older visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a "sex maniac".

Cecilia and Robbie try to pass the incident off.   At dinner, Briony finds that Lola's twin brothers have run away, and Paul calls for a search of the estate grounds. In the course of it, Briony glimpses Lola being raped by a man. She goes to Lola, and they make statements to one another that appear to establish Robbie as the culprit. The belief is sustained during police questioning, and the earlier note is seen as corroborative evidence. Robbie's arrest and imprisonment follow.  About four years later, during [[World War II]], Robbie has been released from prison on condition that he join the [[British Army|army]], and is fighting in the [[Battle of France]]. Separated from his unit, he is making his way on foot to [[Dunkirk]], all the while thinking of his meeting with Cecilia in London six months earlier: they had renewed their love before she returned to her work as a nurse, and he set off to the French front.   Briony, now 18, has chosen to join Cecilia's old nursing unit at [[St Thomas' Hospital]] in London rather than go to the [[University of Cambridge]], because she wants to be of "practical use to society". She writes to her sister, but Cecilia has not forgiven her for lying in the investigation years before.   Robbie, who is falling gravely ill from an infected wound, finally arrives at the beaches of Dunkirk, where he waits to be [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuated]].  Later, Briony—who now regrets her lie—learns from a newsreel that Paul Marshall, who owns a factory supplying rations to the British army, is about to be married to Lola. Briony goes to the ceremony, and as the priest asks if anyone objects to the union, she recalls seeing Paul assault Lola. However, she remains silent. As Paul and Lola leave the church, they glance at Briony, but also say nothing.  Afterwards, Briony visits Cecilia to apologise to her directly. She is surprised to find her sister with Robbie, who is in London on leave. Briony apologises for her deceit, but Robbie is enraged that she has still not accepted responsibility for her actions, when soldiers younger than she have died in the war. Cecilia calms him down, and the couple ask Briony to confess and to have the legal record rectified. Briony agrees. However, she also has to tell them that Paul has married Lola. He is now most unlikely to be punished, as Lola will be [[Spousal privilege#England and Wales|unable to testify against her husband]], and Briony will be regarded as an unreliable witness.  Briony is now elderly and a successful novelist, giving an interview about her latest book that will cap her career; she is now dying of [[vascular dementia]]. She says that this autobiographical novel, entitled ''Atonement'', has been very difficult to write, because she did not know how to approach what she had done to Robbie and Cecilia. She has worked on it from the very beginning of her career. She confesses that the scene in the book describing her visit and apology to Cecilia and Robbie was entirely imaginary.   Cecilia and Robbie were never reunited: Robbie died of [[sepsis|septicaemia]] at Dunkirk on the morning of the day he was to be evacuated, and Cecilia drowned months later in the [[Balham station#Second World War|Balham tube station bombing]] during [[the Blitz]]. Briony hopes to give the two, in fiction, the happiness that she robbed them of in real life. The last scene shows an imagined, happily reunited Cecilia and Robbie living on in a house by the sea.

Anita Williams, Father Chanthakkadan and Radharamanan know who are behind this, but nothing can be done without sufficient evidence. And then Devan, who had seen R.C. Shekhar conducting the experiment on the rabbit, steals into Shekhar's lab and drinks the potion. He becomes invisible and sets out to save Maya.  Devan did manage to save Maya, but when yunus tries to shoot Maya, Devan comes in between and gets shot. Due to the potion he gets saved but as side effect of getting shot(which Shekhar warns no metallic objects should make a scratch on him) he turns into a gigantic monster and kills those who has done wrong to him and his family. After killing the baddies, Devan leaves Maya and the children and makes his abode in the deep ocean, with an end note saying that "to fight for the Justice, Devan will come back as Athisayan".

August Rush
 In 1995, Lyla Novacek ([[Keri Russell]]) is a cellist studying at the [[Juilliard School]] and living under strict rule of her father ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]). Louis Connelly ([[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]]) is the lead singer of "The Connelly Brothers", an [[Ireland|Irish]] rock band. Lyla and Louis meet at a party after their respective concerts, and have a [[Human sexual activity|sexual encounter]] on the rooftop. The day after, they separate in a hurry, and are unable to maintain contact as Lyla is ushered away by her father to [[Chicago]]. Lyla is also aware that she is pregnant. Later, when in [[New York City]], after an argument with her father over her unborn child, she is struck by a car. Due to the accident trauma, she gives birth prematurely, and her father secretly puts the baby boy up for adoption under her name, allowing Lyla to believe that her son died.  Eleven years later, Evan Taylor ([[Freddie Highmore]]) is living in a boys' [[orphanage]] outside New York City, where he meets Richard Jeffries ([[Terrence Howard]]), a [[social worker]] with Child and Family Services. Evan has the savant-like ability to hear music wherever he is, making him a bullying target for the older orphans. Convinced that his parents will find him, Evan runs away to New York City, "following the music" in the hope it will lead him to his family. He finds a boy named Arthur ([[Leon Thomas III]]) performing in [[Washington Square Park]].  Louis, who left the band the same night Lyla was struck, now lives in San Francisco as an agent, while Lyla has also given up performing and now lives in Chicago teaching music. Louis reconnects with his brothers at a birthday party for one of the other band members, and after an argument and fistfight over breaking up the band, he decides to reconnect with the woman he now knows is Lyla. Lyla is called to her father's deathbed, where he confesses that her son is alive and in New York, since her father believed that he was only doing it for both him and his daughter and that her son could have destroyed her future. Lyla abandons her father to his fate and heads to New York to look for her son.  Evan follows Arthur to his home in a condemned theater, and is taken in by Maxwell "Wizard" Wallace ([[Robin Williams]]), a vagrant, arrogant, and aggressive musician who teaches homeless children music and employs them as [[street performer]]s. Evan tries playing Wizard's prize guitar, Roxanne (a Gibson J200), and is so good that Wizard gives him the guitar and his old spot in Washington Square Park (both of which were previously Arthur's). He gives Evan the [[stage name]] "August Rush" and tries to market him to clubs. Seeing the posters that Jeffries has posted for the runaway Evan, Wizard destroys all the ones he finds, hoping to keep Evan and his gift for his own gain.  On arriving at Lyla's apartment in Chicago, Louis talks to one of her neighbors, who mistakenly tells Louis she is on her honeymoon. Despairing, he ends up in New York, where he gets his band back together. After Jeffries meets Wizard and Arthur on the street and becomes suspicious, the police raid the derelict theatre in which Wizard and his "children" are living. The police spot Arthur, but Evan draws their attention and runs; Wizard helps Evan evade the police, telling him never to reveal his real name to anyone. Evan (now "August") takes refuge in a church where a young girl, Hope ([[Jamia Simone Nash]]), introduces him to the piano and written music. He picks up both skills so quickly that Hope gets the attention of the parish pastor ([[Mykelti Williamson]]), who takes August to [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] where he once again impresses the faculty. A [[Rhapsody (music)|rhapsody]] takes shape from August's notes and homework.  In New York, Lyla goes to Jeffries' office, and Jeffries identifies Evan as her son. While looking for him, she takes up the cello again and accepts an offer to perform with the [[New York Philharmonic|Philharmonic]] at a series of concerts in [[Central Park]]. August is selected to perform the rhapsody he has been composing at the same concert. However, Wizard interrupts the rehearsal and claims to be his father, and manages to pull August out of the school.  On the day of the outdoor concert, August is back in his spot in Washington Square, while Wizard makes plans to smuggle him around the country to play. He meets Louis and, unaware of their blood relationship, they have an impromptu guitar duet. August tells him of his dilemma, and Louis encourages him to go. That evening, with help from Arthur, August escapes from Wizard through the [[Rapid transit|subway]] and heads for his concert. Louis, after his own performance with his reunited band, sees Lyla's name on one of the concert banners and also heads for the park. Jeffries finds a misplaced flyer for "August Rush" with a picture, and realizing August is Evan, also heads for the concert.  August arrives in time to conduct his rhapsody, which attracts both Lyla and Louis to the audience, where they are reunited. August finishes his rhapsody and as he turns to discover his parents, he smiles knowing that he has been right all along.

August Underground's Penance
  ''August Underground's Penance'' continues the series's [[narrative mode]] of showing the lives of serial killers (now just Peter, and his girlfriend Crusty) through their camera, though this installment abandons the "degraded footage" aspect employed by the first two films, being shot in high-definition.  After killing a man who breaks free of his restraints and tries to escape them, Peter and Crusty visit various locations in town, and enjoy some fireworks at a celebration. Peter is then shown in his basement, taunting a semi-conscious man who has had nails hammered into various parts of his body. Next, Peter and Crusty go on a hike, assault a vagrant they find sleeping under a bridge, and cut a man open so they can pull his gurgling intestines out. The two then attend a party, where Peter does drugs, Crusty flirts with other women, and a live rat is fed to a pet alligator.  Around [[Christmas]], Peter and Crusty break into a family's home. Peter bludgeons the father with a hammer, and suffocates the mother, who he is unsuccessful in trying to rape due to being unable to attain an erection. When the dead couple's young daughter stumbles onto the two intruders, Crusty strangles her. While Peter goes to shower, Crusty opens some of the family's presents, then falls asleep beside the corpses of the little girl, and her mother. Later, while watching a band perform, Crusty goes to an empty room with a man, with whom she has rough anal sex. Back in the basement, Peter and Crusty torture and murder several people they have imprisoned. Afterward, they take apart a dead deer, and with a friend's help, feed pieces of it to a lion. The two then enjoy several recreational activities, like shooting on a makeshift firing range, and racing ATVs.  As Peter beats a man to death with a hammer, Crusty drinks some of the spilled blood, then helps Peter dismember a female body. When Peter wakes up from a nap, he and Crusty get into an argument. Peter is then shown cutting the [[fetus]] out of a pregnant woman, an act which causes Crusty to break down. When his attempts at comforting Crusty fail, Peter rapes her, then goes into hysterics himself. Peter gets drunk, and proceeds to take his frustrations out on a woman in the cellar, while screaming insults at Crusty, who is still sobbing hysterically upstairs. When Peter passes out, Crusty throws alcohol and other fluids onto his body, while ranting about how much she hates him.  After beating and tying up a woman, Peter masturbates and smears his semen on her. When Crusty walks in on this, she gets into a physical fight with Peter; he beats her while she screams insults and profanities at him. When Peter falls asleep, Crusty spits on him, and strangles his captive to death. With the woman dead, Crusty breaks down again, and begins begging for forgiveness and rambling about how she "wants out". The film ends with Crusty going to the bathroom and committing suicide via self-asphyxiation.

Awarapan
 The storyline revolves around Shivam ([[Emraan Hashmi]]), a heart broken and introvert atheist, gangster, and right-hand man of Bharat Malik ([[Ashutosh Rana]]), officially a businessman who runs a chain of hotels in Hong Kong. Shivam is given the responsibility of one of these hotels, which he bears capably and well, making it much more successful than Malik's other hotels. Malik holds Shivam in the highest esteem due to Shivam's loyalty, reliability, and business acumen, and treats him like an adored son whom he entrusts with almost everything - indeed, more so than his biological son, Ronnie ([[Salil Acharya]]). This is the cause of much jealousy on Ronnie's part against Shivam, but due to Malik's outspoken support for Shivam, Ronnie does not dare do openly oppose him. Shivam has a very close childhood friend, Kabir ([[Shaad Randhawa]]), who assists him with everything.  Malik's brother, Rajan ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), and Rajan's spoilt son Munna ([[Purab Kohli]]) nurture a grudge against Shivam because of Shivam's repeated conflicts with Munna. Munna is mainly responsible for the start of most of these conflicts; he time and again puts Shivam down as Malik's slave, once by murdering an employee of Shivam's hotel who resisted Munna in bed. When Shivam comes to investigate this incident, Munna taunts him, the dead girl, and dares him to tell Malik, resulting in Shivam lashing out against Munna and all his henchmen. This causes an escalation of the feud between Munna, his father Rajan, and Shivam.  One day, Malik asks Shivam to keep an eye on his young mistress Reema ([[Mrinalini Sharma]]), whom he suspects of having an affair with someone else, while he is away on a brief business trip. Reema is a young Pakistani girl, a devout Muslim, and a victim of sex trafficking, whom Malik had 'bought' in the Bangkok flesh market. If Reema is found cheating on Malik, Shivam is to inform him immediately.  In Shivam's interactions with Reema, he recalls his lost love, Aliyah ([[Shriya Saran]]) in a series of flasbacks. Aliyah was a devout Muslim, who Shivam had met by chance in the marketplace one day. The duo eventually fell in love, but when her father saw them together, he wrathfully confronted them, reprimanding Aliyah physically in public for maintaining physical contact with her lover in a non-private place. He also exposed Shivam's gangster background to a shocked Aliyah, leading to Shivam's instantly offering her father his gun, saying that he was willing to let go of everything, start anew, and legitimately provide for Aliyah if he is allowed to be with her. Aliyah's father recovers from his initial surprise quickly, and shoots at Shivam with the gun, who ducks to avoid the bullet. The bullet hits Aliyah instead, killing her and temporarily driving Shivam over the edge. A feeling of guilt and sorrow, at Aliyah having died because he tried to save his own life, remains with him hereafter. Aliyah's father instantly commits suicide when he realizes what he has done.  Shivam discovers one night that Reema has a secret boyfriend Bilal (Rehaan Khan), who convinces her to run away with him back to Pakistan. Shivam informs Malik, who orders Reema's elimination. However, when he confronts the couple to eliminate them, she dares him to shoot her, claiming that freedom is her right, requesting mercy "for God's sake". Shivam is reminded of Aliyah's religious mannerisms, which bear a strong resemblance to Reema's, and is unable to shoot her, leaving her alive. Malik tries to reach Shivam, who severs contact with the former, leading to Malik finding out about his disobedience.  Shivam plans to quickly run away from Hong Kong back to India with Kabir, who is extremely unwilling to do so. Eventually, he betrays Shivam to Malik, whose regard for Kabir goes up. Malik has Shivam captured, and orders Ronnie to torture Shivam until he agrees to kill Reema when Shivam refuses to do so even after Malik offers him a second chance. Malik is shown to be genuinely hurt and sorrowful at what he perceives as Shivam's betrayal, and hands over Shivam's responsibilities in the business to Kabir. Malik makes up the old feud with Rajan and Munna, and merges their gangs and businesses, with Malik demanding that Shivam be brought before him alive so that Malik can kill him personally. This occurs in Kabir's presence, who is bitterly penitent to the point of not wishing to live any more over his betrayal of Shivam.  Shivam manages to escape Ronnie, and seeks refuge in the monastery of a monk whom he had once set free from certain death. He recovers from his injuries, and reminded of Aliyah and her belief in freedom, decides to not continue running all his life to save his own skin, but to "fulfill someone else's dreams" - namely, unite Bilal and Reema and send them to safety. He manages to save Bilal from Malik's henchmen, led by Kabir, whom Shivam still trusts and regards as his best friend, who tearfully reiterates that he is ready to die for Shivam, as he always was. Kabir takes Bilal to the monastery, where arrangements are made to ship Bilal and Reema to Hong Kong.  Shivam tracks Reema, killing Rajan when he taunts Reema and refuses to divulge where she is. At the cost of a knife wound to his side, he tricks Munna into revealing Malik's plans regarding Reema, which are to sell her to the person who "enjoys" her the most. Munna tells Shivam everything about it, including the location, believing Shivam to be crippled by his wounds, and is immediately killed by Shivam when he tries to run away upon realizing that is not the case. Shivam finds Reema and Malik, who is madly enraged at Shivam's standing against him, when he had cared for Shivam so much, deriding Shivam's new belief in God and freedom. Shivam kills Malik, escapes with Reema to the shipping docks, where Bilal is waiting. Kabir shows up to fight Malik's men and buy Shivam time, and is brutally murdered in the process. Bilal manages to force a reluctant Reema to escape to the ship, who is loath to leave Shivam behind. Ronnie and his men arrive and Shivam manages to kill them all in a gunfight, but is mortally wounded himself. As he lies dying, he comes to terms with his past, forgiving himself and envisioning Aliyah smiling down upon him. The movie ends with Reema in a conference in Pakistan, where she tells her story of the "awara" who sacrificed his life to save her, and incites those present to stand up for victims of trafficking.

The Baker (film)
 Milo ([[Damian Lewis]]) is a dissatisfied professional assassin. Cornering his latest target at his home, Milo has a change of heart and offers the man the chance to escape and assume a new identity, only for Bjorn ([[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]]), a rival assassin working for the same organization, to arrive and kill the man anyway. Bjorn makes it clear that he plans to use Milo's lapse in protocol to have his bosses order Milo's termination; they do so, assigning the kill to Bjorn. Milo narrowly escapes Bjorn's first attack, and after a conversation with his fellow assassin and friend Leo ([[Michael Gambon]]) heads to Leo's country property in Gwynfyd (actually [[Grosmont, Monmouthshire]]), [[Wales]] to hide out while Leo works on making things safe for Milo.c  When attempting to bury his gun case, Milo is knocked out by the remains of an exploding sheep, detonated by the unseen Eggs ([[Dyfan Dwyfor]]), a young conspiracy theorist who steals Milo's weapons while he is unconscious.  The unconscious Milo is found and taken home by Rhiannon ([[Kate Ashfield]]), local vet and part-time barmaid, who ensures he's healthy before returning him to his car. In the pub Milo meets landlord Bryn Morgan ([[Steve Spiers]]), who mistakes Milo for the village's new baker, as Leo's property is the former bakery.  Not wanting to raise suspicion Milo goes along with this, and adopts the alias "Milo Shakespeare", inspired by a bust of [[William Shakespeare]] he notices on the bar.  Milo stays in hiding while Bjorn attempts to track his location using a photo of the bakery left behind by Milo.  With Leo's efforts taking time, Milo commits to learning to bake to fit with his inadvertent cover identity.  However, unbeknownst to him, Eggs has correctly (if illogically) concluded that Milo is really an assassin, but erroneously assumes that the bakery is a front for his assassination business. Before long the rumor has spread throughout most of village, save for Rhiannon and a few others. Believing the rumor, local [[fish and chip shop]] owner Rhys Edwards ([[Anthony O'Donnell (actor)|Anthony O'Donnell]]) comes to Milo and asks him to "bake a cake" for his domineering wife Martha ([[Annette Badland]]), Milo completely missing the intended subtext. The next day, Rhys unknowingly leaves a gas burner open and unlit before he leaves for work, and Martha is killed by the ensuing explosion when she goes to use the toaster. Gwynfyd's residents assume Milo was responsible, proving the rumors true in their minds.  Over the next weeks Milo's business picks up considerably, with several people ordering "cakes" for others in town. Eggs has started working for Milo as his assistant, wanting to become an assassin himself. One night Milo prepares for a date with Rhiannon, while Eggs prepares for a "date" with Bob ([[Brian Hibbard]]), a local man in dispute with his neighbor Stan ([[Robert Page (actor)|Robert Page]]) over the annual "best garden" award. Eggs arrives at Bob's house as he eats dinner and, nearly losing his nerve, fires a silenced shot into the house blindly. When Bob clutches his stomach in agony Eggs panics and flees. Milo's date with Rhiannon goes well, but is interrupted when Eggs arrives, drunk and distraught over his first murder, though he passes out before he can explain.  Milo and Rhiannon take the unconscious Eggs back to the bakery, then have sex.  Afterward, Eggs regains consciousness and explains what happened to Milo, who is stunned to realize the pleasant townsfolk who visited his bakery were actually ordering assassinations on each other.  Rhiannon overhears the conversation and leaves, angry; Milo later tries to apologize for his past and not telling her sooner, but is rebuffed.  The next day Milo prepares to leave town, only to see Rhys fleeing the chip shop, stripped to his underwear and covered in various condiments; Milo and Eggs follow him to the pub.  After a brief interruption at the arrival of Bob, who explains to a stunned Eggs that he merely burned his stomach when something knocked his hot dinner onto it, Rhys tells Milo and the rest of the town that a blond man - Bjorn - tortured him for information on Milo, and has now kidnapped Rhiannon to draw Milo out.  Milo explains the truth behind Martha's death and his ignorance of their intent when placing cake orders with him to the now-ashamed townsfolk, then goes on to say that he wanted to get away from his life as an assassin and vows to rescue Rhiannon. He burns the list of "cake" orders in front of the townsfolk, explaining that "everyone deserves a second chance".  Milo confronts Bjorn, who reveals that his hatred of Milo stems from him rejecting Bjorn's desire to run away together with him, which Milo reminds him, not for the first time, "is not possible for so many reasons."  Milo challenges Bjorn to fight "properly" rather than just killing Rhiannon; the two duel with [[Foil (fencing)|foils]], which seems to reach a climax until they discover the weapons are safety-tipped and unable to wound. They then switch to staves, which quickly break, then hand-to-hand, where Milo bests Bjorn. As Milo goes to free Rhiannon, Bjorn pulls a gun, but stops when the townsfolk appear and surround him, demanding he release "our baker". After some talking Bjorn finally decides to leave Milo be in the hope that Rhiannon will break his heart, whereupon Eggs knocks him out with a shovel.  Some time later Milo is preparing a cake at the bakery, assisted by Eggs who has developed skills as a pastrycook, eclipsing Milo's own. Leo arrives while Milo is alone in the kitchen; he explains that he used Milo's exile as an opportunity to stage a "hostile takeover" of the company, and as he is now in charge Milo is free to return to work without fear of being killed. To Leo's surprise Milo turns him down, saying he intends to remain a baker and will pay him a fair price for the shop. Leo is confused until he sees Rhiannon enter the shop, and leaves silently when Milo steps away to greet her. The two then go out to greet the entire village, there to enjoy the grand opening of Milo's bakery, "Shakespeare's Cake".

Balls of Fury
 Eleven year old Randy Daytona becomes anxious when he learns that his father Peter has bet on his performance in the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] table tennis finals. During his first game between his opponent Karl Wolfschtagg from the [[German Democratic Republic]], Daytona has an accident and suffers an injury. Unable to continue, he loses the match. Loan sharks, in the employ of criminal mastermind Feng, murder his father, and Daytona leaves competitive ping-pong.  Nineteen years later, Daytona is dismissed from the Peppermill casino and meets [[FBI]] agent Ernie Rodriguez, who requests his assistance in arresting Feng for running guns. Feng's hidden jungle hideout hosts a black-market Ping-Pong tournament, and Daytona's invitation is a way for the FBI to infiltrate Feng's organization. When Daytona agrees, Rodriguez tells him to win enough championships that Feng's scouts notice him. After losing a local tournament, Daytona is apprenticed to a blind man in Chinatown named Wong, who was Feng's former mentor. Daytona also meets Wong's niece, Maggie. When locals vandalize Master Wong's house for violating their edict against teaching white people ping pong, Daytona is forced to play against "The Dragon", a young girl, in exchange for Wong's right to stay. After Daytona beats the Dragon, Feng's men take notice of his win and bring Daytona, Rodriguez, and Wong to Feng's facility.  Daytona handily beats his first opponent, Freddy "Fingers" Wilson, though he is unnerved to learn that the tournament is literally [[sudden death (sport)|sudden death]]—the loser is killed by a poisoned dart delivered by Feng's majordomo, Mahogany. After Daytona attempts unsuccessfully to escape, Feng invites him to join his side and reveals that he only finished half of Wong's training. He says it would be the ultimate satisfaction to win Daytona away from Wong. Feng also shows Daytona his specially modified ping-pong table. It is wired to special vests that give increasingly powerful and fatal electrical shocks for failure. Daytona informs Rodriguez of a hidden cache of illegal guns that are sufficient to put Feng in jail. While Rodriguez investigates the hidden facilities, Daytona defeats numerous opponents for his life.  Upon learning that Wolfschtagg is his last opponent, Daytona requests extraction. Rodriguez comes up with a plan to brutally injure Daytona, so that he has to quit. Rodriguez breaks Daytona's arm before Daytona can tell him that he has changed his mind. Feng discovers Rodriguez's attempts to contact the FBI and forces Daytona to face Wolfschtagg, then substitutes Maggie. When Wolfschtagg protests, Feng kills him. Daytona plays one-handed and tries to stall for time. Maggie tries to lose on purpose to sacrifice herself. However, Daytona uses his ping-pong expertise to hit Maggie with the ball. While this goes on, they escape together. Enraged, Feng orders them both executed. Mahogany shoots a poisonous dart at Daytona, but Maggie defends him with the ping-pong paddle. Daytona then throws the poisoned paddle back at Mahogany, killing her. The FBI swarms the place, during which the heroes attempt to escape, but Daytona's attempts to rescue Feng's sex slaves causes their capture. Feng plays Daytona to determine which of Wong's students is the superior ping pong player.  During the game, the facility's self-destruct sequence is activated, and Feng reveals there is no off-switch. He also states that he changed the rules so that the ball can now be bounced off any surface once and still be in play. As the self-destruct sequence countdown progresses, the game moves through several buildings and finally onto a bridge over a nearby river. After Wong informs Daytona that Feng has a weak backhand, Daytona exploits his weakness, and Feng is electrocuted, falling into the river. Daytona and his friends, along with Feng's slaves, escape in Wong's boat. Two months later, the major characters are reunited for the reopening of Master Wong's rebuilt Mushu shop.

Battle for Terra
 Mala ([[Evan Rachel Wood]]) and her friend Senn ([[Justin Long]]) are young alien creatures who live on Terra, a planet from a star system in the Milky Way. Terra is a peaceful planet of alien creatures who have a rich semi-advanced culture.  One day a large, mysterious object blocks the Terrian sun, piquing the Terrians' interest. However, since the Terrian culture bans the development of new technologies, such as telescopes, without the approval of the ruling council, none of the inhabitants are able to get a closer look at the huge object in their sky.  Mala, who is inventive and headstrong, goes against the rules of her community and creates a telescope, which she takes out into the dark empty area outside the Terrian city and uses to view the object and witnesses smaller objects coming from the large object that turn out to be incoming scout spaceships. She returns to the city to find that the scout spaceships have already started abducting Terrians (who willingly offer themselves to the scout spaceships mistaking them as their new "gods").  After Mala's own father, Roven ([[Dennis Quaid]]) is abducted she goads a ship into tailing her and lures it into a trap, which causes it to crash. Afterward, she saves the life of the pilot, revealed to be a human, an officer named Lieutenant Jim Stanton ([[Luke Wilson]]). After his personal robot assistant named Giddy ([[David Cross]]) warns Mala that Stanton will die without a supply of oxygen (which the Terrian atmosphere does not contain), she creates an oxygen generator and fills a tent with oxygen so that Jim can breathe, and eventually convinces Giddy to teach her human language. Giddy informs Mala that the mysterious object is a [[generation ship]] called The Ark, containing humans from [[Earth]].  Centuries beforehand, both [[Mars]] and [[Venus]] were [[terraformed]] by humans and colonized. But 200 years later, the two planets demanded independence from Earth, which the Earth government refused to grant them due to the high demand of resources from the two colonies. The dispute between the three planets escalated into a violent interplanetary war that left all three planets uninhabitable. The Ark, containing the remnants of the human race, traveled for several generations looking for a new home. When Stanton awakes the robot informs Stanton and Mala that a crucial part of the ship was damaged in the crash, so Mala offers to make a replacement part herself. When Stanton, Mala, and Giddy return to the crash site, they discover that the ship has been moved.  The trio track the ship to a huge underground military facility which had been built by a previous, warlike generation of the Terrians. The trio realizes that despite the current peaceful nature of the Terrian city, the elders have secretly retained the military technology from the dark days of war. After infiltrating the facility, fixing the ship and flying back to the Ark, Jim orders Mala to stay and goes to be debriefed.  Mala ventures off and finds Roven, but before she can rescue him, the human guards are alerted to her presence. While trying to save Mala, Roven sacrifices himself and two guards after breaching the hull. Mala is captured, but Stanton helps her escape back to Terra. The commander of the military wing of the Ark, General Hemmer ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]), takes power over the civilian leaders in a coup, and declares war on Terra, citing the deteriorating condition of the Ark. His goal is to annihilate the Terrians so that the humans can turn Terra into the new Earth. He plans to drop a huge machine onto the planet's surface—called the Terraformer—which will create an Earth-like atmosphere. Stanton is sent to be in the first group of space-fighters designated to defend the Terraformer, while General Hemmer will go down to the planet's surface in the Terraformer to personally supervise the terraforming process.  After the humans drop the Terraformer machine onto the surface, it begins to replace the native gases with oxygen and nitrogen, which will asphyxiate the aliens. The terrian elders bring out all of the hidden military technology from their secret base, and huge waves of Terrian glider-fighters attack the Terraformer. The human ships begin a huge battle against the high-tech alien glider-fighters.  Finally, as the Terraformer is close to completing its objective, Lieutenant Stanton realizes that annihilating all Terrians is morally wrong and turns his ship towards the Terraformer and attacks it. As his ship is damaged with anti-aircraft defensive fire, Stanton fires his air-to-air missiles at the Terraformer's command module, destroying it, and killing General Hemmer. His ship is destroyed in the resulting explosion and he dies peacefully, knowing he did a heroic deed.  An epilogue shows what happened in Terra some time later. The Terrians and the humans have decided to live in peace. With the Terraformer destroyed, the Terrian atmosphere becomes safe once again for the aliens. The Terrians create a sanctuary for the human colonists to live in, with an Earth-like atmosphere. In the human sanctuary, a large statue of Stanton is erected, in honor of his memory and sacrifice.

Bee Movie
 A young [[honey bee]] named Barry B. Benson ([[Jerry Seinfeld]]) has recently graduated from [[college]] and is about to enter the hive's Honex Industries honey-making workforce alongside his best friend Adam Flayman ([[Matthew Broderick]]). Barry is initially excited to join the workforce, but his courageous, [[non-conformist]] attitude emerges upon discovering that his choice of job will never change once picked. Later, the two bees run into a group of Pollen Jocks, bees who collect pollen from flowers outside the hive. The Jocks offer to take Barry outside the hive to a flower patch, and he accepts. While on his first pollen-gathering expedition in [[New York City]], Barry gets lost in the rain, and ends up on the balcony of a human [[Floristry|florist]] named Vanessa ([[Renée Zellweger]]). Upon noticing Barry, Vanessa's boyfriend Ken ([[Patrick Warburton]]) attempts to squash him, but Vanessa gently catches and releases Barry outside the window, saving his life.  Barry later returns to express his gratitude to Vanessa, breaking the sacred rule that bees are not supposed to communicate with humans. Barry and Vanessa develop a close bond, bordering on attraction, and spend time together frequently. Later, while Barry and Vanessa are walking through a [[grocery store]], Barry is horrified to discover that the humans have been stealing and eating the bees' [[honey]] for centuries. He decides to journey to Honey Farms, which supplies the grocery store with its honey. Furious at the poor treatment of the bees in the hive, including the use of [[bee smoker]]s to subdue the colony, Barry decides to sue the human race to put an end to the exploitation of bees.  Barry's mission attracts wide attention from bees and humans alike, and hundreds of people show up to watch the trial. Although Barry is up against tough defense attorney Layton T. Montgomery ([[John Goodman]]) the trial's first day goes well. That evening, Barry is having dinner with Vanessa when Ken shows up. Vanessa leaves the room, and Ken expresses to Barry that he hates the pair spending time together. When Barry leaves to use the restroom, Ken ambushes Barry and attempts to kill him, only for Vanessa to intervene and break up with Ken. The next day at the trial, Montgomery taunts the bees, which causes Adam to [[Stinger|sting]] him. Adam's actions jeopardize the bees' credibility and put his life in danger, though he manages to survive. While visiting Adam in the hospital, Barry notices two people [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] outside, and is struck by inspiration. The next day, Barry wins the trial by exposing the jury to the cruel treatment bees are subjected to, particularly the smoker, and humans are banned from stealing honey from bees ever again.  Having lost the trial, Montgomery cryptically warns Barry that a negative shift in the balance of nature is imminent. As it turns out, the sudden, massive stockpile of honey has put every bee out of a job, including the vitally important Pollen Jocks. As a result, without anything to pollinate them, the world's flowers slowly begin to die out. Before long, the only flowers left with healthy pollen are those in a flower parade called "The Tournament of Roses" in [[Pasadena, California]]. Barry and Vanessa travel to the parade and steal a parade float, which they load onto a plane to be delivered to the bees so they can re-pollinate the world's flowers. When the plane's pilot and copilot are [[Unconsciousness|knocked unconscious]], Vanessa is forced to land the plane, with help from Barry and the bees from Barry's hive.  Armed with the pollen of the last flowers, Barry and the Pollen Jocks manage to reverse the damage and save the world's flowers, restarting the bees' honey production. Humans and bees are seen working together, and certain brands of honey are now "bee-approved". Barry becomes a member of the Pollen Jocks, helping to pollinate the world's plants. Barry is also seen running a law firm inside Vanessa's flower shop, titled "Insects at Law", handling disputes between animals and humans. The film ends with Barry flying off to a flower patch with the Pollen Jocks.  
Becoming Jane
 Jane Austen is the younger daughter of Reverend George Austen and his wife and has yet to find a suitable husband. She aspires to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father.  Thomas Lefroy is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as "typical" for people in the profession. Tom makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile, she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley, the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham. Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue but increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love.  Tom, Jane, her brother Henry and Jane's rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide, conspire to receive an invitation from Tom's uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London, for the rich "Madame La Comtesse" and her friends. This visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane's brother, Edward. This would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane before and give a blessing for their marriage. Full of hope, Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge's place. In a flow of inspiration, she then begins the writing of ''First Impressions'', the manuscript that will become ''[[Pride and Prejudice]]''.  However, Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed, not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially.  Jane returns home and soon learns that Tom has become engaged to someone else at the arrangement of his family. Jane accepts the marriage proposal of Mr. Wisley, whom she had earlier declined. Later, Tom realises he cannot live without Jane, and returns, asking Jane to run away with him, for "what value will there be in life, if we are not together?" Jane agrees, and they leave, with only Jane's sister Cassandra knowing they plan to marry in secret.  On the way, Jane stumbles upon a letter from Tom's mother, and realises his situation: he sends money he receives from his uncle back to his parents and siblings, and his family cannot survive without it. She tells Tom that they cannot elope, not with so many people depending upon him. He insists that he and Jane must marry and tells her he will earn money, but Jane tells him that it will not be enough; he will never be able to make enough money to support his dependents with a High Court judge (his uncle) as an enemy and with a penniless wife. Distraught, Tom asks her if she loves him, and she replies, "Yes, but if our love destroys your family, then it will destroy itself, in a long, slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame." As she leaves, Jane catches a last glimpse of Tom through the carriage window as he briefly follows, the horses outpacing him.  Twenty years later, Jane, now a successful author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels. Tom's daughter asks Jane to read aloud, but as Jane rarely does so he remonstrates with his daughter using her name, which is also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to read. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from ''Pride and Prejudice'', while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet, and Tom joins the rest of the company in honouring Jane and her work with applause.  
Because I Said So (film)
 The movie focuses on Daphne ([[Diane Keaton]]), the loving but over-bearing mother of three women, in particular Milly ([[Mandy Moore]]). Her other daughters Maggie ([[Lauren Graham]]) and Mae ([[Piper Perabo]]) are happily married, but Milly has recently broken up with her boyfriend, and Daphne is concerned.  Daphne fears that her daughter cannot find a good man on her own, so she secretly places a personal ad for her daughter. She finds a potential candidate, Jason ([[Tom Everett Scott]]), and tries to orchestrate a chance meeting of the two. The plan seems flawless until Milly finds her own date, guitarist Johnny ([[Gabriel Macht]]), who happens to be a candidate Daphne rejected before. Milly is unaware of her mother's scheming and begins relationships with both Jason and Johnny at the same time, with neither aware of the other.  Inevitably, this double-dating takes its toll and Milly becomes estranged from both Jason and Johnny. In Jason's case, it is because she discovers Daphne's scheming. Meanwhile, Daphne stumbles upon her own perfect match after being alone for many years and begins to challenge her search for the perfect match for Milly. Milly also realizes she has a choice to be the daughter her mother wants her to be, or to be the woman she wants herself to be. Choosing the latter, which comes with a row with her mother, leads her to reconcile with Johnny, a relationship Daphne has realized she should have tried to orchestrate in the first place.  
Before the Devil Knows You're Dead
 ''Note: The story is explained here in its chronological order, rather than as it is presented in the film.''  Andy Hanson ([[Philip Seymour Hoffman]]) is a finance executive at a real estate firm in New York City. Facing an upcoming audit he knows will reveal his having embezzled from his employer (in support of a drug habit), Andy decides to escape to Brazil, believing there to exist no [[extradition]] treaty between Brazil and the United States. To raise the necessary funds for the trip and to establish himself once there, he hatches a scheme and enlists the aid of his brother, Hank ([[Ethan Hawke]]), himself in need of money to pay three months' back child support as well as his daughter's private school tuition.  Hank, meanwhile, has been having a long-standing affair with Andy's wife, Gina ([[Marisa Tomei]]), who has been unsatisfied with her marriage.  Of the two brothers, Hank is well-meaning, but weak-willed and cowardly, easily dominated by his stronger-willed older brother, Andy, a ruthless schemer. Andy in turn harbors great resentment that his younger and more attractive brother received more love and affection from his parents than he did during childhood. Andy devises a plan to rob their parents' jewelry store, to which Hank reluctantly agrees. Andy argues that he cannot go himself because he has been in the neighborhood recently, and could therefore be recognized. They assume that only Doris, an elderly woman who works for their parents, will be in the store. Andy states that just a toy gun is needed and that it is a victimless crime, because insurance will fully compensate their parents for the stolen items. Andy plans to fence the jewelry via a [[New York City]] dealer his father knows, and expects to net about US$120,000 from the robbery.  Without consulting Andy, Hank hires Bobby Lasorda ([[Brian F. O'Byrne]]), an acquaintance who is an experienced thief, to help him in the robbery, as he is too frightened to carry out the crime alone. Bobby reveals a real gun and decides he will commit the robbery himself; Hank just needs to wait in the car. Unbeknownst to the robbers, the brothers' mother Nanette ([[Rosemary Harris]]) happens to be filling in for Doris. The robbery goes awry when Nanette pulls a hidden gun on Bobby, causing a shootout; Bobby dies on the scene, and Nanette falls into a coma, dying a week later in the hospital after her husband Charles ([[Albert Finney]]) agrees to take her off life support. Charles, unsatisfied with the police's indifference, decides to investigate on his own, and he becomes obsessed with finding information about the crime and others involved in it. Shortly after the botched robbery, Hank is confronted by Bobby's brother-in-law Dex ([[Michael Shannon]]), who demands financial compensation for Bobby's death to provide for his sister, Chris ([[Aleksa Palladino]]), Bobby's widow.  While Andy is away from his office dealing with his mother's death, his superiors at work repeatedly try to contact him regarding irregularities in his department's accounts that have been revealed by the audit. At the wake for Nanette, Andy and Charles have a complex and emotional exchange, wherein Charles states he loves Andy despite their long-standing differences; Andy says he has always felt like an outsider in his father's house. When Andy questions his biological heritage, Charles slaps him. Andy and Gina immediately depart, and on the drive home Andy has an emotional breakdown over his relationship with his father. Later, at home, Gina tells Andy his boss has been trying to get in touch with him, and expresses her frustration with their marriage and Andy's growing coldness. Andy, preoccupied with covering up his embezzlement and trying to help Hank deal with Dex's blackmail, hardly reacts when Gina announces she is leaving him. Her desperate attempt to extract an emotional response from him – revealing her affair with Hank – fails, and she leaves.  Charles, searching for information about the robbery, visits the same fence Andy had contacted in New York City. After an acrimonious exchange that indicates Charles and the jeweler have known and disliked each other for decades, the jeweler hands Andy's business card to Charles, revealing to Charles that Andy recently came to him looking to fence some jewels. Charles immediately goes looking for Andy. Andy decides to resolve the blackmail situation with Hank by robbing a heroin dealer that he frequents, and then escape abroad. At the dealer's apartment, Andy and Hank overpower the dealer and steal his money. Hank is shocked when Andy kills the dealer and a client who happened to be present. The brothers then go to pay off Dex, but Andy impulsively kills him from fear of continued blackmail. Andy appears ready to kill Chris (Bobby's widow and Dex's sister) when Hank objects. Andy turns the gun on Hank, revealing that he knows about Hank and Gina's relationship. Hank begs Andy to kill him, but Andy hesitates. As Andy pauses over whether to shoot his brother, Chris shoots Andy with her brother's gun, wounding him. Hank leaves his brother and guiltily leaves some of the money behind for Chris before fleeing with the money, drugs and paraphernalia they robbed from the heroin dealer.  After leaving the fence, Charles tails Andy. He follows Andy from his apartment tower, watches as he goes to Hank's apartment, then follows his sons to their meeting with Chris, and finally follows Andy to the hospital where the paramedics take his wounded son. Andy breaks down and apologizes to his estranged father for the robbery, explaining Nanette's death was an accident. Charles seemingly accepts his apology. Charles then attaches Andy's heart monitor to himself and suffocates his son to death with a pillow. Andy struggles to stop his father, but in his weakened condition he is overpowered. As nurses rush to help Andy, Charles walks away.

Beneath (2007 film)
 On the way home from visiting her parents' grave, Christy ([[Nora Zehetner]]) crashes her car into a rock. The impact throws Christy to safety, but her older sister, Vanessa ([[Carly Pope]]), is trapped inside when the car explodes. Vanessa initially survives, though disfigured and completely burnt. Christy is sent to Pine Bluff Psychiatric Care Center for treatment while her sister is treated by her husband Dr. John Locke ([[Matthew Settle]]), at home with the assistance of the nurse Claire Wells (Eliza Norbury), and his rather stern mother, Mrs Locke ([[Gabrielle Rose (actress)|Gabrielle Rose]]). When Vanessa has a heart attack and dies, Christy has a breakdown at the funeral service screaming that her sister is alive in the coffin. Christy moves to California for pre-med, but remains haunted by nightmares and weird visions. Six years later, Christy returns to Edgemont for a funeral. Vanessa's husband and mother-in-law regard her coldly, but Amy ([[Jessica Amlee]]), Christy's niece who is afraid of "dark things" behind the walls of the house, asks her to stay.  Christy experiences blackouts and strange visions, the most prominent of which features a scarred, burnt woman clawing at a lid. She decides to investigate the death of her sister that she believes had been [[buried alive]]. The locals believe she has borderline personality disorder. She befriends a cop, Jeff ([[Warren Christie]]), and discovers that her sister was treated in the house's basement, which had tunnels connecting it to the rest of the house. She visits the father of Claire Wells, the nurse who treated her sister, who tells her the Lockes are evil and ruined Claire's life, and that Claire broke relations with her family and left the state after Vanessa died. Meanwhile, Christy's premonition that Mrs. Locke will die comes true.  Amy tells Christy about a monster which comes into her room through the wardrobe while she is sleeping and touches her cheek. While in Amy's bedroom, Christy hears noises from the wardrobe. She travels through a tunnel connecting the wardrobe and the basement and has another blackout and when she wakes, she discovers John next to her with scratches on his cheek. He threatens to press charges if she does not leave the house immediately. In the Lockes' boathouse, Christy finds a love letter from John to Claire revealing an affair between them and suggesting that Vanessa's death would be best for everyone. Christy is convinced that John and Claire gave Vanessa medication to induce her heart attack.  Christy shares her findings with Jeff. They visit the hospital staff connected to Vanessa's treatment, and a doctor tells them that Vanessa's treatment had been controlled entirely by John and Claire. He also says Vanessa's murder would be impossible to prove because her body would have decomposed completely by now, making an autopsy impossible. However, Christy points out that the coffin's lid would contain Vanessa's scratch marks, proving she was alive at the time of her burial. No one, including Jeff, believes Christy. Nonetheless, Christy opens Vanessa's coffin herself and is shocked to see it unscathed.   Christy returns to the house and apologizes to John.

Ben X
 Teenage Ben is frequently bullied at school. To escape his harsh reality, he turns to a virtual world by playing an online game, ''[[ArchLord]]''. In the game, he is a confident and brave hero. Moreover, he collaborates his adventures with another online user known in-game as Scarlite.  One day, Ben is being bullied again. During the class break, the bullies drag Ben on top of a table and pull his pants down, while classmates record the incident on their phones. With cruel remarks and teasing from his classmates, Ben becomes so humiliated and frustrated that he smashes the window with a chair. Ben is immediately sent to the headmaster's office, where the headmaster asks Ben to explain the incident. Ben, however, does not speak at all, leaving the issue unresolved. After that scene, it's revealed that Ben has been diagnosed with [[Asperger syndrome]], a form of [[autism]]. Things gets worse for Ben as the class incident gets posted on the internet. Feeling distraught about his life in general, Ben is even ready to leave his virtual world behind, where he tells Scarlite that he is ready to "endgame". Concerned, Scarlite sends a video message to Ben X (as Scarlite has no idea what Ben looks like) saying that there cannot be an endgame, unless there is a healer. Scarlite then tells Ben to meet her at the train station.  At the train station, Ben sees Scarlite, but does not go to her. Scarlite, assuming that Ben did not show up at all, goes to the train. Ben follows Scarlite onto the train and sits next to her, feeling nervous and excited at the same time. Just as the train approaches [[Brussels]], Scarlite asks Ben if he is all right. Ben does not reply and goes off, leaving Scarlite behind. Having not talked to Scarlite, Ben was contemplating suicide by jumping off the platform. As Ben was ready to jump, he is pulled back and it's revealed that it's Scarlite who did so. She later tells Ben that he can choose to either give up and take his own life or take revenge and fight, just like he would in Archlord. But, to make the decision, he needs to devise a plan.  Ben (with Scarlite) asks his parents to help. He has decided to commit [[suicide]] by jumping off the ferry. He does so, and captures the suicide on tape. Afterwards, a [[funeral]] was held for Ben, with everybody, including the bullies being present. As the funeral went on, the video then changes to Ben and his speech (which seems like a suicide note video). In the video, the bullies are exposed (as well as the classmates involved) of what they have done to Ben that day of the incident. Then, to everyone's shock, it was revealed that Ben is alive, by his shadow seen over the video and Ben being seen from the projecting room. It turns out that Ben had chosen to take revenge on the bullies by faking his own suicide. It was revealed that as he jumped off the ferry, his parents had caught him at the lower deck, as part of the plan.  Afterwards, Ben, Scarlite, his mother, and his brother are at a horse ranch in the country. The horse instructor shows Ben how to be friendly with the horse and tells him that "You must learn to feel, in order to feel good". Ben touches the horse gently, just as the instructor told him and feels happy. Ben then goes to Scarlite and talks to her. The horse instructor looks baffled, as it is revealed that Ben is actually talking to himself. Ben's mother then tells the horse instructor that everything is fine and Ben is happy.

They meet [[Hroðgar|King Hrothgar]], who needs a hero to slay [[Grendel]], a hideously malformed troll-like creature with appalling strength and cunning, who attacked and killed many of Hrothgar's warriors during a celebration in the [[mead hall]] [[Heorot]]. Upon arriving, Beowulf becomes attracted to Hrothgar's wife, Queen [[Wealtheow]], who reciprocates his interest.  Beowulf and his men celebrate in Heorot to lure Grendel out. When the beast attacks, Beowulf engages him unarmed and naked. During the fight, Beowulf discovers that Grendel has [[Hyperacusis|hypersensitive hearing]] and ruptures the creature's eardrum. Grendel shrinks in size and manages to escape only after Beowulf severs his arm, mortally wounding him. In thanks for freeing his kingdom from the monster, Hrothgar gives Beowulf his golden drinking horn, which commemorates Hrothgar's victory over the mighty [[dragon]] [[Fafnir]].  In his cave, [[Grendel's mother]] swears revenge over his corpse. She travels to Heorot and slaughters Beowulf's men while they are sleeping. Hrothgar tells both Beowulf and Wiglaf, who had been sleeping outside the hall during the attack, that it was the work of Grendel's mother. She is the last of the Water Demons, who were thought to have left the land. Beowulf and Wiglaf travel to the demon's cave to slay her. Beowulf enters the cave alone and encounters the demon, who takes the form of a beautiful woman. She seduces him with promises to make him king in exchange for the drinking horn and a son to replace Grendel. Beowulf returns to Heorot and announces he has killed the demon. Only Hrothgar is not fooled, as he too had been seduced by the demon; Grendel was the result of their tryst. Hrothgar crowns Beowulf king, then commits suicide by jumping from the castle parapet onto the beach below.  Years later, the elderly Beowulf is married to (though estranged from) Wealtheow, who has converted to Christianity. Beowulf has a mistress, Ursula, but his tryst with Grendel's mother has left him sterile. On the anniversary of Beowulf's victory against Grendel Unferth returns the golden drinking horn, which his slave had found on the moors. That night, a nearby village is destroyed by a [[The dragon (Beowulf)|dragon]], which then transforms into a golden figure, who orders Unferth to give a message to King Beowulf—the dragon's father.  Beowulf and Wiglaf go to the cave once again, and Beowulf enters the cave alone. When Grendel's mother appears, Beowulf gives her the golden horn, but she refuses to stop the attacks. The dragon attacks Beowulf's castle, threatening Wealtheow and Ursula. Despite his age, Beowulf goes to great lengths to stop the dragon, even [[dismemberment|slicing off his own arm]] in the process. Eventually, he kills the dragon by ripping its heart out, and he and the creature tumble to the rocky beach below the castle. As Wiglaf approaches him, Beowulf tries to tell the truth about his affair with Grendel's mother, but Wiglaf insists on keeping his legacy intact. Beowulf then dies.  As the new king, Wiglaf gives Beowulf a [[Norse funeral]]. Grendel's mother appears and gives Beowulf a final kiss before his burning ship sinks into the sea. Wiglaf sees the golden horn washed by the waves of the sea in the sand while Grendel's mother floats in the sea. As she smiles at him seductively, Wiglaf moves into the surf.

Bhool Bhulaiyaa
 Badri ([[Manoj Joshi (actor)|Manoj Joshi]]) heads a [[Brahmin]] family in whose ancestral palace in [[Rajasthan]] is believed to be haunted by the ghost of Manjulika, a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Indian classical dance|classical dancer]]. Siddharth ([[Shiney Ahuja]]) and Avni ([[Vidya Balan]]), the son and daughter-in-law of Badri's elder brother, return to their native village from the [[United States]] and decide to stay in their ancestral palace. This leads to Siddharth's childhood love interest Radha ([[Ameesha Patel]]), who is Badri's Daughter, becoming jealous but she immediately recovers. Siddharth is crowned as the king, his right to the throne.  The palace where Siddharth and Avni were staying was once occupied by Raja Vibhuti Narayan, who was Siddharth's ancestor. He had fallen in love with Manjulika, a dancer hailing from [[Bengal]]. But Manjulika was in love with Shashidhar, another dancer, who resided in a house just behind the palace and often met her secretly. On the night of Durgashtami, when the king gets to know of the affair and their plan to elope, he calls them to perform a dance one last time in the court. In the end, the king beheads Shashidhar and imprisons Manjulika in her room. Then on the day of the king's marriage, Manjulika hangs herself and swore that her spirit would not leave any king who lived in that very palace. Various omens started taking place after that, presuming that the "[[evil eye]]" may have befallen on the king. The king too dies under unknown circumstances. Soon, with the aid of powerful sorcerers, both Vibhuti's and Manjulika's spirits were locked up in a room in the third floor of the palace using a sacred talisman.  Events take a twist when Avni obtains a copy of the third floor room key and opens the forbidden locked room that contains the ghost of Manjulika. Unnatural events start taking place inside the palace. Avni falls in love with the place and learns about Manjulika and her tragic story. She becomes enamored with Manjulika. Badri and Batuk Shankar ([[Paresh Rawal]]) try to ward off the evil eye with the help of a priest, Shri Yagyaprakashji Bharti ([[Vikram Gokhale]]), but unfortunately the priest has gone to [[London]] and is unsure when he might return.  Siddharth starts suspecting Radha for all the strange occurrences. He thinks she has gone crazy since he was supposed to marry her, but married Avni instead. He calls his friend, psychiatrist Dr. Aditya Shrivastav ([[Akshay Kumar]]) from [[New York City|New York]], to try to figure out what the problem is with Radha. Once Aditya reaches the palace, things become comical, as everyone thinks he is a fool, though he is very intelligent. Aditya eventually realizes that Radha is not at fault, and that someone else behind it all, and falls in love with her. One night, he encounters Manjulika and dares her to strike. The ghost angrily vows to take her revenge on the auspicious day of [[Durga puja|Durgashtami]].  During the engagement of Siddharth's cousin Nandini, and Sharad Pradhan ([[Vineeth]]), Avni spills food on Sharad and takes him away to get him cleaned. When Aditya and Siddharth search for her, they see that there is a struggle between Avni and Sharad, and quickly intervene. Siddharth thinks that Sharad was violating Avni, but Aditya tells him that Avni is the real culprit, not Radha as previously suspected. It is revealed that Avni has [[dissociative identity disorder]], a disease that affects the person's identity, making them think they're someone else. Aditya explains that Avni is the one making all the strange things happen around the palace. He reveals that he visited Avni's hometown to gather information about her childhood and has factual evidence. He then tells the half-convinced Siddtharth to provoke Avni in order to make him realize that something is wrong. When Siddharth provokes her, Avni shows the dark personality of Manjulika before returning to her usual self, much to the horror and concern of Siddharth, who asks Aditya to save Avni.  During ''Durgashtami'', Aditya and Siddharth see Avni consumed in Manjulika's identity, dressed as her and dancing to the tunes Manjulika had been dancing to with her love, Shashidhar, before the king murdered him. The tragic love story of the old king Vibhuti Narayan, who loved Manjulika, who in turn loved Shashidhar, is revealed. Avni imagines herself as Manjulika and Sharad as Shashidhar, dancing in the court of the king. Avni completely assumes the identity of Manjulika and tries to kill her own husband Siddharth; she sees him as the king who had killed Manjulika's lover.  To cure Avni, Aditya triggers Manjulika's personality and makes her promise to leave Avni if she gets the opportunity to kill the king and take her revenge. The priest Shri Yagyaprakashji Bharti arrives and with his help, during the ritual of ''Durgashtami'', Aditya lays out an intricate plan to trick Manjulika into thinking she is killing the king when she is actually slaying a dummy. After the "murder", Manjulika, now [[Demon|content]], leaves Avni forever. Avni is healed and everything ends well. Aditya tells Radha, whom he has taken a liking to, that he will send his parents over if she is interested in marrying him, to which a happy Radha gives her silent consent.

Blades of Glory
 At the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 World Winter Sport Games]], rival [[single skating|men's singles skaters]] Chazz Michael Michaels, a skillful skater but raunchy sex addict, and Jimmy MacElroy, an equally talented but sheltered and effeminate skater, tie for gold.  While standing on the awards podium, the two have an argument that escalates into a fight and ends with the World Games mascot being accidentally set on fire.  As a result, the National Figure Skating Association strips both men of their medals and bans them from men's singles competition for life. Jimmy's competitive adoptive father, billionaire Darren MacElroy, immediately [[Disownment|disowns]] him and leaves him stranded on the side of the road.  Three and a half years later, both men have grudgingly taken on alternative occupations: Jimmy is working at a winter sporting goods store.  He gets demoted to stockroom duty when he refuses to listen to a little girl when she tells him her skating boot has been tied too tightly.  Chazz plays the role of "The Evil Wizard" in a children's skating show called "Grublets On Ice", until he is fired for ruining the show by being in a drunken stupor on stage.   Jimmy's obsessive stalker, Hector, tells him of a loophole in the ban allowing him to compete in [[pair skating]].  In hopes of entering the upcoming [[2006 Winter Olympics|World Winter Sport Games]], Jimmy contacts his old coach, Robert, but is unable to find a partner.  Jimmy's search for a last-minute partner leads him to Chazz, and Robert convinces the two to skate as the first-ever same-sex pairs team, because the regulations fail to state the genders of the pairs.  Robert informs them that to win, they will need to get along and perform an element that has never been performed successfully: The "Iron Lotus", an extremely complicated maneuver that Robert developed years ago.  However, it is also dangerous: the only attempt of the maneuver was "behind the [[Bamboo Curtain]]" in [[North Korea]], and resulted in the man [[decapitating]] the woman with his skate blade.  Nonetheless, they decide to attempt it as Robert is convinced that two males would be better suited for the move because of the physics of a same-sex team.  In the meantime, brother and sister competitors Stranz Van Waldenberg, and Fairchild Van Waldenberg are worried that their spot as the top team is threatened when Jimmy and Chaz perform well at a Winter Sports Games qualifier, command Katie Van Waldenberg, their younger sister, to disrupt the duo by going out with Jimmy and then having sex with Chazz.   Since Katie has fallen in love with Jimmy after going on a date with him, her elder siblings threaten to harm him if she does not comply.  Katie gets Chazz's attention after attending a sex addict's meeting as the newest member, then invites Chazz to her room, and tries to seduce him.  Chazz refuses out of respect for Jimmy, delighting Katie, but cannot resist grabbing her breasts.  Jimmy witnesses this and is outraged at Chazz's and Katie's betrayals.  Chazz attempts numerous times to apologize to Jimmy, but is unsuccessful.  In an attempt to sabotage the performance the following day, Stranz and Fairchild kidnap both Chazz and Jimmy, but both are able to escape. Chazz and Jimmy arrive in the ice rink just in time to compete, where they reconcile quickly and begin their routine.  Fairchild, seeing the two doing well, throws pearls onto the ice, causing Chazz to trip and break his ankle, rendering him unable to perform his role in the Iron Lotus.  Jimmy then offers to switch places with him.    Although they have never practiced the other's roles, they perform it perfectly, winning the competition. Jimmy reconciles with Katie, and Stranz and Fairchild are arrested due to the kidnappings and Stranz accidentally shooting a mascot. Stranz and Fairchild begin arguing, then [[Incest|kiss each other incestuously]] before they are handcuffed by the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. Jimmy and Chazz receive the gold medal and fly off into the sky via rockets on their skates. During the credits, Hector is seen playing with dolls of himself, Jimmy and Chazz.

Bleach: The DiamondDust Rebellion
 Soul Reapers of the 10th Division—led by its captain [[Tōshirō Hitsugaya]] and vice-captain [[List of Soul Reapers in Bleach#Rangiku Matsumoto|Rangiku Matsumoto]]—are sent to escort the "King's Seal". The rare artifact is stolen during transport by the deviated Soul Reaper Sōjirō Kusaka and two girls known as Ying and Yang. Hitsugaya seems to recognize the Soul Reaper, who wounds him and leaves, and abandons his post to pursue the man and leaves his squad behind to fend for themselves. Later, the Soul Society suspects Hitsugaya of treason, orders his immediate capture, and puts his whole squad under house arrest.  In the human world, Soul Reaper [[Ichigo Kurosaki]] is informed about the events happening in the Soul Society, and finds Hitsugaya, who passes out. Hitsugaya wakes up in Ichigo's house, and they are attacked by Ying and Yang. Ichigo fights, while Hitsugaya escapes and continues to avoid an attempt of capture by Soul Society. The suspect on him increases when Kusaka attacks a Soul Society's captain using Hyōrinmaru, a ''[[zanpakutō]]''—special swords used by Soul Reapers—with identical powers to Hitsugaya's one. Hitsugaya's capture is then made top priority and his execution is approved.  Through his wandering to avoid capture, Hitsugaya eventually manages to track Kusaka down, and it is revealed that the two managed to manifest the same ''zanpakutō''. Because Soul Society does not allow the same ''zanpakutō'' to be wielded by different people, the two were forced to fight to the death. Hitsugaya did not wish to fight, but had no other option as Kusaka attacked, claiming that he was the only one worthy of Hyōrinmaru. The authorities concluded that Hitsugaya was the true owner of Hyōrinmaru and carried out his execution. Kusaka died and was reborn as a Hollow in their world, the Hueco Mundo. Once he learned of the King's Seal and its powers, which allows the user to freely manipulate time, space and matter, he started his plan of revenge against the Soul Society.  Using the King's Seal, Sōjirō teleports Hitsugaya and himself to the Soul Society, needing Hitsugaya's power to break the seal. The Soul Reapers find and attack Hitsugaya and Kusaka, but are thrown back when Ichigo intervene. As Hitsugaya refuses, Kusaka breaks the seal himself, after which he transforms into a giant dragon-like creature made of ice. However, because he lacks the control which Hitsugaya possesses, the power goes berserk and threatens to destroy the Soul Society. A hoard of Hollows appears out of Kusaka's castle which he had generated out of the Kings' Seal. While several Soul Reapers face the Hollows, Ichigo and Hitsugaya storm up to the central tower. After they destroy Kusaka's dragon-like form, Hitsugaya impales Kusaka. Hitsugaya clears all charges and the King's Seal is restored. After the credits, he and Rangiku visit Kusaka's grave.  
Black Water (2007 film)
 Grace ([[Diana Glenn]]), her younger sister Lee ([[Maeve Dermody]]) and husband Adam (Andy Rodoreda) are going on the Blackwater Barry tour out in the Mangroves for fishing. After leaving the home of Grace's mother, Lee convinces the three to go to a crocodile exhibit. They learn that local males of that beast can grow to massive sizes and are extremely dangerous. Later that day, the trio go to a bar, where Lee suspects that Grace is pregnant when she refuses to have a drink.  The next day, Grace confirms Lee's suspicion, but Adam remains unaware. Once they arrive at the docks, their tour guide, Jim ([[Ben Oxenbould]]), arms himself with a six-shot revolver and the group sets off. After failing to catch any fish on the usual route, the boat is bumped by something in the water. Jim removes an old fuel can from the river, stating that it is what hit the boat. He then suggests that they steer off course deeper into the swamps, where he believes there may be larger fish. Once they veer off course, Grace begins to panic, but the others are unaware.  They arrive at a small clearing far from the course they should have taken, and Adam immediately snags a fish. Jim shouts words of advice while Lee, camera in hand, spots something in the distance. She alerts Grace, but after a second glance, sees nothing. Suddenly, the group is thrown about when the boat is bumped again. After a second, more powerful hit, the boat capsizes, dumping Grace, Adam, Lee and Jim into the water. Adam realizes a crocodile has attacked them and helps Grace into a nearby tree. He then searches the water for Lee, who is tangled up in ropes under the boat.  Grace sees the enormous crocodile nearby and convinces Adam to climb into the tree. Lee frees herself and swims out from under the boat. The beast swims after her as she struggles to climb atop the boat, but she manages to get on top. The beast thrashes the boat around in an attempt to throw her off. Adam and Grace distract the beast, which, defeated, swims away.  Grace and Adam plan a way to get Lee safely into their tree and realize they can use the ropes from the boat to pull it across. Lee throws a rope to Adam, who, with Grace's help, attempts to pull the boat to the tree. When their efforts have no effect, Adam believes the rope to be caught on a stump, and tells Lee she will have to swim across. Hesitant at first, she eventually slides off the boat into the water and begins to walk across to them when something splashes in the distance. Panicking, she runs to Adam and Grace who pull her up the tree. Grace and Lee suggest that they sit and wait for someone to come looking for them, but Adam states that no one saw them leave. Grace then suggests they climb across the trees to the mainland. She tells them she'll check out this possibility first and come back. She sees that they would not be able to climb across the trees, eventually having to swim across the river. On the way back to tell them the bad news, she finds Jim's ear floating in the water. Panicking frantically, she returns to Adam and Lee in the tree, keeping the discovery of the severed ear a secret.  After much waiting, Adam impatiently insists on making for the boat, and Lee and Grace agree. Adam climbs into the water and swims to the boat, then dives under it. The boat begins shaking back and forth violently and finally overturns. Adam then reappears over the side of the boat. Suddenly, the beast pulls him under the water, thrashing him about. Lee and Grace are overcome with sadness and despair when the beast surfaces with his body clenched in its teeth.  Grace tells Lee that they must finish Adam's plan to use the boat. Lee keeps watch for the beast while Grace attempts to get to the boat. When Grace grabs the boat rope, Lee spots the beast and alerts her. She panics and drops the rope, quickly returning to safety on the tree. She then attempts to reach the boat rope from a low-hanging branch, but the beast jumps out of the water and narrowly misses her. Terrified of the beast, the two sit and wait. They see Adam's body floating nearby. Later that night, the beast returns and begins eating Adam's body.  The next day the two see the boat is drifting away. Grace refuses to return to the boat, and Lee suggests they use the trees as a guide through the water. They make it halfway across the clearing to the other side when the beast surfaces in front of them. Grace and Lee flee back to the tree, however the beast grabs Grace's leg and pulls her underwater. The beast thrashes about, trying to drown her. Grace escapes and reaches the tree - however her leg has been heavily wounded.  Lee attempts to reach the boat while Grace's condition worsens. She reaches the boat and climbs inside. She attempts to turn on the motor when the beast jumps into the boat and attacks her. It catches her torso in its mouth and pulls her underwater. She falls unconscious.  Later, Lee awakens on a small island beside Jim's body. She bandages her broken finger with the fabric from her shirt and sees that her torso is bleeding. She takes Jim's gun and washes it off. She takes the remains of one of Jim's arms and uses it to try to lure the beast to her. When this fails, she stands up and looks around, unaware that the beast has surfaced behind her. She turns around as it attacks her. She tries to shoot the beast but the gun misfires. A chase ensues as she tries to run. After running, the beast in close pursuit, Lee turns around to see it has vanished. She looks around everywhere, gun in hand, waiting to shoot it. The beast surfaces in front of her, and the gun misfires again. The beast grabs her and pulls her underwater. Lee realizes that the hand holding the gun is in its mouth. She pulls the trigger while it thrashes her around and the gun shoots the beast in the head. The beast dies and Lee makes her way back to Grace.  After trying to wake Grace up, Lee realizes she has died from blood loss. She mourns the loss of her sister. Lee places Grace's body into the boat and begins paddling out of the mangrove. A noise behind her startles her, but she sees nothing and continues paddling to safety.

Blood Monkey
 Anthropological professor Conrad Hamilton attempts to study a new species of primate, possibly the missing link between humanity and the great ape, found in a hidden valley deep within the jungles of Thailand. Hamilton's initial research team tries to capture one of these new (and very large) primates, but fail and are all killed. Hamilton and his assistant Chenne, who survive because they are away from the camp site, scour the area looking for clues and remains of their team.  Meanwhile, another research team is inbound, this one a crew of college anthropology students with no idea of what they're in for. The students, Seth, Amy, Greg, Sydney, Josh, and Dani, are flown into a remote region of the Thai jungle, and picked up by a guide who drives them deeper into bush. He drops them off in a panic at the edge of trail/road, which leads further still into the foliage, claiming "bad things" are in there and won't go any further. He heads back the way he came, leaving the students to march forth into the unknown. They walk until they reach the end of trail and set up camp. As evening sets in, noises from the jungle raise suspicion until a set of glowing green eyes can be seen close by, watching. Just before the unknown creature attacks, Chenne arrives with a flare that scares off the unseen menace.  Chenne escorts the students to the relative safety of Professor Hamilton's camp, and the following day they meet the obsessed man and somewhat learn of his mission and their purpose. Hamilton professes of dream findings in an uncharted valley located deep within the jungle and their potential for career-launching documentation. He has Chenne confiscate their mobile phones and hand out information bracelets for each member that contain all of their emergency contact info, then he leads the slightly unwilling team to the valley entrance. After a pep talk, Hamilton convinces the students to continue and rappel down the cliffside and into the valley, although Josh is injured during the process.  On their first night in the valley, Hamilton passes around a skull and explains that it belongs to the creature he's looking for. The students cannot identify the skull since its characteristics are both human and primate in nature, but nearly twice the size of any known human or primate cranium. They are soon interrupted by a bloody survivor from the original research team, who Hamilton and Chenne quickly shelter and care for. The man dies shortly afterward, and Hamilton tells Chenne that the creatures let him go as a warning.  During the night, Sydney visits the outhouse, only to be dragged away into the jungle. The next morning, Hamilton tells the team that Sydney came to him scared and homesick and wanted to go home, so Hamilton has Chenne take her out of the jungle, leaving everyone suspicious. However, in another part of the jungle, Chenne is dragging Sydney through the brush and eventually leaves her, battered and beaten. Sydney eventually stumbles into an unseen creature that tears the right side of her face off.  The team continues to follow Hamilton and Chenne, who appear to be tracking something with a GPS reader. Unknown to the students, Hamilton is tracking each of the students by a hidden chipset in each of their bracelets. At the moment, he is tracking Sydney's bracelet. The team eventually demands more information about their expedition, and Hamilton comes mostly clean. The students remain unaware that they are being tracked, but resolve to steal the AK-47 in Hamilton's possession and maintain control of the situation to themselves. Seth begins leaving a trail through jungle by tying off pieces of cloth to trees.  On their third night, while the students are beginning to fashion their plan for the following day, a foul-smelling rain begins pouring down on their tents. Just as they recognize the smell as urine, Josh is yanked out of his tent and dragged up into the trees. Panic sets in as the team scatters and begins following his screams through the jungle. As Greg attempts to save Josh, Chenne accidentally shoots him, but then proceeds to tie him to a tree as bait. She camps out nearby with her gun, but one of the monsters sneaks up on Chenne and kills her before mauling Greg.  Hamilton runs across Seth during the chaos and knocks him unconscious after listening to his complaints. Hamilton locates the two remaining students, Dani and Amy, and continues his venture, ordering Dani to document everything with her video camera. Believing themselves to be the only survivors, both girls have little choice other than to follow the professor in hopes of being rescued. The professor successfully tracks Sydney's bracelet and finds it still attached to her severed arm which is dangling from a tree. Hamilton examines an apparent rigging done to the tree, only to spring a trap which results in several bamboo shoots impaling him through the back. He delivers a final address to the girls before he dies.  Just as they turn to run, it's revealed to be Seth, to their delight. They run back to their campsite, only to find it cleared of their tents and equipment. Completely panicked, they keep running while the monster seem to be following close by in the brush and in the trees. Dani is soon pulled up into the trees and killed, leaving only Seth and Amy standing. They run further still and reach a cave, where they see Seth’s entire cloth trail assembled and attached to the opening. They go into the cave and use the night vision from Dani's video camera to move around. At least one of the creatures follows them into the cave, grabs Seth and kills him.  Amy sheds light on one of the monsters for the first time, revealing it to be a large [[Gigantopithecus|Gorilla-like ape]] with a bloody set of fangs. Several more gorillas enter the cave and Amy screams in terror as one of them bears down on her and kills her.<ref></ref>

After Denise expresses an interest in Archie (believing he can afford 30+ dollars a gallon gasoline), he drives her home, but runs out of fuel. Archie turns to hunting animals, but they do not provide sufficient blood. He turns to larger prey such as predatory people, and eventually, settles for any victim after rebuilding a more efficient blood engine.  The government, which has been tracking Archie's progress, eventually offers him any position he wants, provided he can create more "Blood Cars" after the original is destroyed, and his existence is erased. Archie is concerned where the fuel for the new cars will come from, and the federal agents promise him it will come from invalids, convicted criminals, and the homeless. Archie agrees. Images of Archie's rise as President are cut with the government agents murdering Lorraine, Denise, his kindergarten students, and anyone that saw him developing the Blood Car.

Body (2007 film)
 Chon is an engineering student living in a rented house in [[Bangkok]] with his sister, Aye. Chon is having bad dreams, in which he is visited by a ghostly woman who appears to have been dismembered and put back together. He also sees a misshapen [[black cat]] and occasionally sees a [[fetus]]. Chon sometimes finds himself in places, such as a musical performance, and cannot remember how he got there.  After Chon slices his finger open while cleaning some [[prawn]]s for dinner (the prawns had started moving around and bleeding profusely), Chon's medical student sister Aye takes him to the hospital.  Chon is eventually referred to a Dr. Usa for psychiatric treatment. It becomes apparent to Dr. Usa that there is some connection between Chon, herself and her increasingly distant husband, Dr. Sethee.  In the course of Usa's investigation, she discovers there is a connection between her husband and a mysterious university lecturer, Dr. Dararai, who possesses supernatural powers of [[hypnosis]].  Meanwhile, Chon continues to have bad dreams, and they are becoming increasingly horrifying and real. He is repeatedly drawn to a spare room in his house, and when he opens the door, he sees a man chopping up a body. When the man turns his head to look at Chon, the man's face is Chon's. It turns out to be another dream and after discovering that Dararai has gone missing he realises that Dararai is dead and communicating with him, Dararai asks him to find her.  A teaching assistant whom Usa questioned about Dararai ends up being killed in a gruesome accident involving barbed wire around a university museum exhibit. A young doctor also meets his end in a vat of acid after talking to Chon about Dararai.  Chon comes to the conclusion that whoever tells of Dararai's disappearance is killed and tries to stop the killings, but is always too late.  Back at their rented house Chon is being tormented by Dararai again who constantly says "find me" and now discovers a secret room in the house (the one in his dreams) which he suspected earlier behind a cupboard and discovers burnt photos of Dararai and Sethee in what seems to be an intimate relationship. It now emerges that Sethee had an affair with Dararai and that Dararai took photos of themselves in bed with each other. Dararai wanted to [[blackmail]] Sethee with the photos or tell Usa and as a result Sethee met up with Dararai, drugged her drink, injected her with a paralysing liquid and chopped her to pieces (in the hidden room that Chon finds).  Chon is about to tell Usa that her husband has killed Dararai but while at her house he is again attacked by Dararai's ghost who says she will kill his sister, enraged Chon stabs her with a pole in front of Usa and Sethee's daughter May. After seeing May (who's scared and terrified) he leaves to find his sister.  These events between Usa, Chon, Sethee and Dararai(and her ghost) lead to the university hospital's [[morgue]], and body number 19. Chon goes to the morgue and discovers that the body in the morgue, which is in drawer 19, is actually Chon's body. Chon has, in fact, died a couple of years ago and Sethee who has a multiple personality disorder believes that he is Chon when in reality he has killed the teaching assistant, the doctor and has stabbed his own wife Usa who he believed was Dararai's ghost when he was believing he was Chon.  He is arrested but because of his mental health issues his trial is put on hold. A flashback occurs back to the scene when he is about to drug Dararai's drink. It is revealed that Dararai was aware that Sethee has drugged her drink hypnotises him and gives him a multiple personality disorder.  The flashback finishes and he is being escorted to prison in a van with his Lawyers in the van(to protect his safety). He escapes out of the van and runs from the police and lawyers, He runs in front of another van that is carrying metal poles on top. The van stops in time and doesn't run over Sethee but the metal poles are flung off the van and they all hit and impale Sethee. He is left on the road with lots of metal poles pieced inside him.  The last scene shows Sethee in hospital being operated on, he is unconscious but suddenly Dararai's ghost appears and it turns out her ghost wasn't part of Sethees mental mind but was real and was manipulating Sethee. She finally reveals that she forgives him and after clicking her fingers his mind goes back to normal but this makes Sethee conscious again and wakes him up halfway through his operation leaving him screaming in pain as Dararai disappears and the ending credits show.

Boarding Gate
 ===Paris=== After discussing his plans for retiring by selling on the shares in his security company to his debtors with his partner, André, aging underworld entrepreneur Miles Rennberg is paid a surprise visit at his Paris office by aggressive underworld [[gun moll|moll]] Sandra. Brazenly taunting him with her sexuality, she bluntly dissects their prior relationship—a nightmarish web of masochism, money, manipulation and dependency, pimping her out to dangerous clients in order to gain both a business advantage and perverse personal thrills.  She outlines her newest ambition, since their estrangement, of raising the necessary capital to run a nightclub in Beijing. Miles makes no pretense of the fact that he is less interested in the proposal than the woman, and encourages her to visit him at his apartment.  Without making any promises, Sandra leaves for her job at an import business, run by a young married couple: Lester and Sue Wong.  Sandra's own import sideline, drug running, is facilitated by her close bond of loyalty with low-ranking employee Lisa. Acting as her driver and lookout, Lisa escorts Sandra to the site of a drug deal that quickly goes sour when her buyer is revealed to be a Narcotics officer. Suspicious after Sandra's cool response to his earlier queries about a missing container in a recent shipment, Lester follows Sandra to the deal and accosts Lisa as she waits in the car. He sends Lisa away on his motorcycle and takes her place in the car.  After Sandra emerges, Lester drives her away from the scene. Expressing disappointment in her deceit, he takes her back to her apartment where it becomes clear that the two are romantically involved. After their sexual encounter, Lester receives a call from his wife and leaves.  Sandra appears to relent and arranges to visit Miles at his apartment. Goading him with recollections of their misdeeds, she reveals a deep-seated bitterness; she recalls, in particular, an incident where a group of Japanese clients she was entertaining drugged and raped her, and Miles' arousal at hearing the episode recounted in front of his girlfriend. They both drink and end up on the balcony. Sandra undresses and tries to instigate a violent sexual game, apparently of the genre they used to practice, by pinning Miles to the floor of the balcony and choking him with his own belt. Miles warns her off and leads her back inside to show her a pair of handcuffs, which he intends to use on her later in the evening. She expresses reluctance which he nonchalantly waves aside. When she tries to leave, he locks the door and pockets the keys.  After he takes a business call, she playfully restrains him with the handcuffs, then brutally shoots him in the head.  She quickly retraces her steps through the house, destroying evidence of her presence, and makes a swift exit with Miles' keys. Lester picks her up, gives her a modest sum of cash and the name of a contact in Hong Kong who will arrange her new life, promising to join her soon. Lisa first drives her to a club to establish an alibi, where the oppressive atmosphere and the noise provoke an aggressively traumatic and regretful response to her act.  ===Hong Kong=== Hours behind Lisa, Sandra arrives in Hong Kong. She makes her way to the address of Lester's contact, who in turn sends her to a nondescript office somewhere else in the city. She is told that her contact is waiting for her in an adjacent room, but as soon as she enters the door is locked behind her. In the labyrinthine mess of the locked office she eventually discovers the bound and murdered body of Lisa in a chair facing the back wall.  A manifestly wealthy, middle-aged Western woman arrives at the office and orders the men to bring Sandra out, chastising them for Lisa's death. Eventually, one of the men in the office is sent in after Sandra. Having switched clothes and positions with the corpse of Lisa, she manages to ambush the henchman and escape onto the streets. Whilst crossing on a ferry she cries over her last souvenir of her relationship with Miles, his keys, before dropping them into the water. With little money and no recourse to her credit cards or passport, due to risk of capture and extradition for Miles' murder, Sandra resorts to repeatedly calling Lester.  She eventually manages to contact his wife, Sue, who maintains that Lester is unavailable but agrees to meet Sandra in a karaoke club. Sue is evasive and aggressive, revealing that whilst she knew of Sandra's affair with Lester, Sandra was not her husband's first infidelity and he never really planned to leave his wife to join her. The whole venture was an attempt to raise the investment capital for the Beijing club, an enterprise in which Sue was fully complicit. Whilst she attempts to take everything in, Sue spikes Sandra's drink with a sedative.  In a back room, Sandra threatens Sue with a gun and demands more information; Sue pleads her innocence until she manages to talk Sandra into succumbing to the drug's sedative effects. She leaves Sandra unconscious on the floor. Sandra wakes in the home of the wealthy Western woman whom she escaped in the offices earlier. The woman explains that she owes someone a favour and sets Sandra up with papers and well-paid employment in Shanghai.  Nonetheless, Sandra eschews the easy escape and tracks Lester down in a Hong Kong shopping mall. She follows him up the staircase with an unsheathed knife, but as she prepares to stab him she is interrupted by a group of women coming the other way. Lester enters an expensive restaurant, meets with Miles' business partner, André, and leaves with a sports bag full of cash—possibly a payment for Miles' murder, which ensured that his shares did not pass to his unscrupulous creditors. Sandra follows Lester down to the doorway out to the car park, where he hesitates at the threshold as if aware of her presence. At the last moment, however, she finds herself unwilling to either kill or confront him. He drives away with the money.

Boku wa Imōto ni Koi o Suru
   Yori and Iku Yuki are twin brother and sister, who have been extremely close since they were born. During their childhood, Yori used to tell their parents that he would marry Iku. While their parents brushed this off as an innocent childhood fantasy, Yori knew that his feelings were more than an innocent crush on his sister. When they are fifteen, his feelings have grown stronger than before. Yori has by now understood that he has fallen deeply and hopelessly in love with Iku, which makes him feel ashamed. Due to that they share a bedroom, Yori finds it harder and harder to resist his feelings for her, so he begins to distance himself from her and acts coldly to her. Iku is hurt and shaken by his harsh treatment towards her, but she tries to remain cheerful and make him smile. One day during school, Yori gets into a fight after a classmate makes fun of Iku, and gets injured. Tomoka Kusunoki, Iku's best friend, tends to his injury and tries to comfort him. In midst of this, she suddenly kisses him and professes her love to him. When she asks him if she is good enough for him, he sees this as an opportunity to surpass his feelings for Iku. He proceeds to kiss her and has sex with her at a hotel. This encounter, however, does nothing to help him forget his lust for Iku. Tomoka mistakenly thinks that Yori reciprocates her feelings and calls him her boyfriend. Yori, however, decides to hide this from Iku so she won't get upset. He later tries a new strategy: go to an out-of-town high school. Days later, Yori and Iku get into a fight after Iku talks about her dreams of having a boyfriend and going on dates. Yori gets really mad about this and yells at Iku to shut up. Iku does but starts crying. While she is crying, he kisses her, which shocks her, and he confesses his love to her. Iku is taken aback by his confession and rejects his advances because he is her brother. However, she sees the sadness on his face and realizes that, while she is uncertain if she loves him more than a brother, she may lose him by rejecting him. She kisses him and feels uncomfortable by it, which Yori notices and tells her to wait until she is sure of her love for him. Over the next several days, they try to begin an intimate relationship, with Iku slowly growing adjusted to Yori's advances, and keeping their parents in the dark. Haruka Yano, Yori's best friend, immediately notices the twins' closeness but doesn't tell them. Iku continued to be torn between her guilt of committing twincest and her desire to remain together with Yori. Her guilt, however, completely disappears when she discovers that Yori is planning to enroll in a different high school and that he has been seeing Tomoka. She tries to have sex with Yori, but in the process, he rejects her because she still doesn't love him yet. The next day, as she sees Tomoka clinging to Yori, Iku realizes that she has finally fallen in love with Yori. After confessing to him, they skip school and flee to a church, where they remember playing at when they were little. They try to have sex in the church, but Iku tells him to stop because she feels that God is watching them. Yori agrees and decide to go home.  Soon after, during school, Tomoka talks with Iku and their friends about her first time with Yori, which angers Iku. Yori comes in and tells Tomoka that their relationship is over before leaving with Iku. Tomoka smiles while crying and doesn't understand why he broke up with her so suddenly. When someone mentions that Yori probably has someone else he likes, she quickly realizes that that person is Iku. Iku fights with Yori over his indiscretion with Tomoka. He hugs her as she tries to get away from him, but when she sees him cry, she gives into her feelings and hugs him back. Later that day, Iku has Yori meet up with her and tells him that she wants to make love to him right now, which shocks but pleases him. They go to a hotel, and after Iku is initially apprehensive, they finally have sex for the first time. Yori is thrilled that Iku is his, but feels guilty and asks for God to punish only him. Days later, they graduate from junior high school and Iku realizes that Yori still plans to leave for a different high school. Yori tells Yano the truth of his relationship with Iku, which Yano knew but he asks why is he still leaving. Yori says that he is torn between his desire to protect this relationship versus the obligation to destroy it. Yori tries to comfort Iku, who asks why he wants to go. Yori says he doesn't want to leave, but if he stays, they can't be a normal couple. However, if they were another city, where no one knows them, they could be a couple. Iku reluctantly agrees to let him go, with the promise that they will stay in touch.  Yori arrives at his high school, and to his horror, he finds that Tomoka has enrolled in the same school. She tries to get him to take her back, but he rejects her, which doesn't seem to bother her. For their sixteenth birthday, Yori and Iku receive cell phones, which makes easier for them to stay in contact. Iku visits with Yori as much as possible because Yori is allowed limited visits outside of the school. He befriends Takuma Kakinouchi and his girlfriend Mayu Taneda, who act as his confidants. For his birthday present to her, Yori gives Iku a diamond clover ring as a promise of eternal love. Separated from Yori for weeks at a time, Iku is placed in the care of Yano, who acts as her protector. Yano helps the twins see each other at school and even arranges them to spend the night together. When he tells Iku that he knows about the relationship, he assures her that he will keep it a secret. However, as he spends time with her, Yano slowly falls in love with Iku. Yori vows that he will never give Iku up, and the two best friends have a friendly rivalry over Iku, who is oblivious to Yano's feelings. The twins' parents mistake Yano as Iku's boyfriend and take an instant liking to him, but he says that they are not a couple. When he does tell Iku that he likes her, Iku rejects him because she loves Yori.  Yori soon realizes that Tomoka is determined to get revenge against him and Iku for breaking up with her. She has them get caught in Yori's room by fellow students several times in order to expel him, as girls are forbidden to be in boys' dorms. When Yori gets light punishments for the offenses, she takes a [[camera phone|cell phone picture]] of the two kissing and threatens to send it to everyone they know if he doesn't sleep with her. When he appears to accept the deal, he deletes the picture and tells her to leave him and Iku alone. Tomoka, however, refuses to listen and continues with her plan to expel him. Some time later, while Yano is at Iku's house, her father comes home and happily tells his wife that he ran into their longtime friend, Dr. Yuugo Mori, which takes her aback. He tells her that Yuugo has a daughter who is the same age as Yori and Iku, and promised to have Yori engaged to the girl. The twins' mother refuses this and asks about when he said the girl is similar to Yori. This sounds suspicious to Yano, who tells Yori that he thinks Iku might not be his sister. Yori rejects this possibility, even though he secretly hopes it is true. When Iku sneaks into the school to visit Yori, Tomoka hires a group of classmates to rape Iku. Fortunately, Yori catches them and punishes them and Tomoka. The school principal decides to expel Yori for continuing to let Iku into his dorm. Iku is happy of the news, which annoys Tomoka and calls her stupid. Yori defends Iku from Tomoka's insult, and she threatens to tell his mother about the twincestuous relationship. He doesn't believe her, but the twins find that their mother has overheard the conversation. Again, Yano lies, saying that Tomoka was joking and Iku is his girlfriend. Their mother does not believe them, but doesn't say it out of fear, and takes the twins home. Yori enrolls into Iku's high school, where they meet Yuugo's daughter Azusa. She notices that Yori and Iku don't resemble each other while she looks just like Yori. Azusa tells her father of how different the twins are, and after he invites the Yuki family over to his house and he sees Yori for the first time, he confronts their mother. Yori witnesses an intimate moment between the two and suspects that they may have had an affair. He later finds Iku's unfilled birth certificate and photographs of his parents with Yuugo. Azusa confesses to Yori that she believes they are half-siblings, and then Yuugo confesses that he has been in love with Yori's mother since college and he believes that he is Yori's biological father. He secretly uses a piece of Yori's hair to do a DNA test, which confirms his suspicions. He tells the twins' mother of the news and is shocked when she admits she knows Yori is his son. She had kept it a secret out of fear of ruining her family. Yori and Yano consulte a family friend of Yano’s, who says that the unfilled birth certificate could indicate Iku was abandoned as an infant and then adopted by their parents. After this, Yori makes his feelings for Iku clear to his mother, who reacts in shock. She tells Yori to stay away from Iku because they are siblings. Yori doesn't believe her and threatens to destroy the family if she tells anyone about the relationship. With his mother horrified, he takes Iku to their room. As they are making love, their mother confronts them and tells them that they are siblings, but Yori asks her to answer his question about Iku's birth certificate. She tells the twins and their father that they are twins, but half-twins; they are the result of [[heteropaternal superfecundation]]. She tells them that Yori is her son with Yuugo Mori and Iku is her daughter by her husband. Sixteen years ago, when she was about to marry her husband, Yuugo confessed his love to her, and although she had feelings for him, she refused him. At that moment, he kissed her and they had sex. She tried to forget about the betrayal and slept with her husband on the same day. Three months later, she found out she was pregnant with twins and was unsure who the father was, until the twins were born and saw the physical difference between them. She becomes physically ill after telling the story and lashes out at Yori for his twincest with Iku.  Realizing that they may be separated now that their parents know their secret, Yori and Iku run away from home with Yano's help and stay at his beach cottage. Yori tells Iku that if they had a child together, their parents will never have to separate them. Iku is hesitant at this idea, but agrees, and they make love in an attempt to conceive. Later on, they go to a church to pray, and Yori realizes Iku cannot give sacrifice their family to be with him and decides the right thing to do is to end the relationship. They decide to return home and reconcile with their parents. Yori decides to leave the family and go somewhere he can never be found so that his and Iku's feelings will fade away. Before departing, he cuts Iku's hair from what it looked like from her childhood at her request, and he slips out when she falls asleep. When she wakes up and finds him gone, Iku falls into a deep depression. However, she soon realizes that she never did anything for Yori and resolves to find him no matter how long it takes. Over the next ten years, Iku manages to get into a university and becomes a sales representative for Yano's company. Yano has frequently asked Iku to marry him, but she rejects him. During a trip to England, she goes to a library because she thinks it would be a place Yori would go to. They finally pass each other, but don't recognize the other until after a few seconds, and turn around and embrace. In the climax, Yori states that he is still in love with Iku.

The Bourne Ultimatum (film)
 Following his pursuit by Kirill (in ''[[The Bourne Supremacy (film)|The Bourne Supremacy]]''), [[Jason Bourne]] ([[Matt Damon]]) evades [[Moscow]] police while wounded and deals with more flashbacks of when he first joined Operation Treadstone. Six weeks later, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Deputy Director]] Pamela Landy ([[Joan Allen]]) divulges the audiotaped confession of Ward Abbott, the late former head of Treadstone, to [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Director]] Ezra Kramer ([[Scott Glenn]]). Meanwhile, in [[Turin]], journalist Simon Ross ([[Paddy Considine]]) of ''[[The Guardian]]'' meets an informant to learn about Bourne and Operation Blackbriar, the program succeeding Treadstone. The CIA tracks Ross as he returns to [[London]], after his mention of "Blackbriar" during a cell phone call to his editor is detected by the [[ECHELON]] system. Bourne reappears in [[Paris]] to inform Martin Kreutz ([[Daniel Brühl]]), the step-brother of his girlfriend Marie Helena Kreutz ([[Franka Potente]]), of her assassination in [[India]], also in the previous film.  Bourne reads Ross's articles and arranges a meeting with him at [[London Waterloo station]]. Bourne realizes that the CIA is following Ross and helps him evade capture for a while, but when he panics and ignores Bourne's instructions, Ross is shot and killed by Blackbriar assassin Paz ([[Édgar Ramírez]]), in the middle of a busy station, on orders of Deputy Director Noah Vosen ([[David Strathairn]]). Vosen's team, reluctantly assisted by Landy, analyzes Ross's notes and identifies his source as Neal Daniels ([[Colin Stinton]]), a CIA [[Station chief]] involved with Treadstone and Blackbriar. Bourne makes his way to Daniels' office in [[Madrid]] but finds it empty. He incapacitates gunmen sent by Vosen and Landy. Nicky Parsons ([[Julia Stiles]]), a former Treadstone operative who shares a history with Bourne, tells him that Daniels has fled to [[Tangier]] and aids his escape from an arriving CIA unit.  Nicky learns that Blackbriar "asset" Desh Bouksani ([[Joey Ansah]]) has been tasked with killing Daniels. Vosen sees that Nicky accessed information about Daniels and sends Bouksani after Nicky and Bourne as well, a decision with which Landy fiercely disagrees. Bourne follows Bouksani to Daniels but fails to prevent Daniels's death by a planted bomb. However, Bourne manages to kill Bouksani before he can kill Nicky. After sending Nicky into hiding, Bourne examines the contents of Daniels' briefcase and finds the address of the deep-cover CIA bureau in [[New York City]], where Vosen directs Blackbriar. Bourne travels to New York.  Landy receives a phone call from Bourne, which is intercepted by Vosen. When Landy tells him that his real name is David Webb and gives him the birth date "4-15-71", Bourne tells Landy to "get some rest" because she looks tired, tipping off that he is in New York and watching her from an overlooking building (a scene replicated from the end of the previous film). Vosen intercepts a text to Landy from Bourne of a location to meet up, and leaves his office with a tactical team. Bourne, however, waits for them all to leave, enters Vosen's office, and takes classified Blackbriar documents. When he realizes that he has been tricked, Vosen sends Paz after Bourne, but the resulting car chase ends with Bourne forcing Paz's car to crash into a concrete barrier. Bourne holds the injured Paz at gunpoint, but spares his life.  Bourne arrives at a hospital at 415 East 71st Street, having figured out Landy's coded message. Outside, Bourne meets Landy and gives her the Blackbriar files before going inside. Vosen also figures out Landy's code and warns Dr. Albert Hirsch ([[Albert Finney]]), who ran Treadstone's [[behavior modification]] program, that Bourne is coming. He follows Landy inside the building but is too late to stop her from faxing the Blackbriar documents out. Meanwhile, Hirsch is confronted by Bourne on an upper floor, who now remembers that he volunteered for Treadstone. As Bourne flees to the roof, he is confronted by Paz, who asks, "Why didn't you take the shot?"  Bourne repeats the dying words of The Professor in ''[[The Bourne Identity (2002 film)|The Bourne Identity]]'': "Look at us. Look at what they make you give." Paz lowers his gun, but Vosen appears and shoots at Bourne as he jumps into the [[East River]].  Some time later, Nicky watches a news broadcast about the exposure of Operation Blackbriar, the arrests of Hirsch and Vosen, a criminal investigation against Kramer, and the whereabouts of David Webb, a.k.a. Jason Bourne. Upon hearing that his body has not been found after a three-day search of the river, Nicky smiles. Bourne is shown swimming away in the East River.  
Boogeyman 2
 As young children Laura Porter and her brother Henry witness their parents' brutal murder by a hooded man, whom they believe to be the [[Bogeyman|Boogeyman]]. As an adult, Henry has attended group therapy, improving such that he is instead currently looking for work. Laura joins this group as he leaves, meeting the other members: [[Nyctophobia|nyctophobic]] Mark, [[Germaphobia|germaphobic]] Paul, [[Self-harm|masochistic]] Alison, [[Agoraphobia|agoraphobic]] and commitment-averse Darren, and Nicky, a [[bulimic]] girl who fears extreme weight gain.  Upon her joining, however, the members of the group are targeted and murdered one by one. All of their deaths relate to their fears: Mark falls down an elevator shaft, trying to escape from the darkness when the lights go out, and is torn in half. Paul accidentally consumes a cockroach while eating a bag of chips; he is given cleaning solution by a masked figure, and upon drinking it, burns a hole in his throat. Laura begins to suspect these deaths are not accidental. The hospital loses power, leaving Laura, Alison, Darren, Nicky, Dr. Jessica Ryan, and the receptionist Gloria in the dark. Gloria goes to the basement to turn the lights back on, but once the patients return to their rooms, Alison is tied to her bed by the Boogeyman. He places maggots on her arms, which burrow into her skin via her self-inflicted incisions, and she kills herself attempting to cut them out.  Dr. Ryan goes to the basement to check on Gloria, but is electrocuted by the Boogeyman while standing in a puddle of water. Laura finds a file on her brother and those of other patients with bogyphobia ([[phobia]] of the Boogeyman). She learns that all bogyphobia patients - including Tim Jensen, the protagonist of the first film - have committed suicide after being treated by Dr. Mitchell Allen. Darren and Nicky have sex in the locker room as Laura finds Alison; she alerts them to Alison's corpse, but they find upon returning that the blood and maggots have been cleaned up, leading them to believe that Laura is [[Hallucination|hallucinating]]. Darren and Nicky go to his room, where they argue about the viability of their relationship. Darren forces Nicky out of his room, and is then attacked by the Boogeyman, who disembowels him and removes his heart.  Laura finds Nicky on a basement table with hoses attached to her, pumping bile into her body until she explodes. The Boogeyman chases Laura through the hospital; along the way she finds Gloria's body and Dr. Ryan, barely alive and mumbling in a trance-like state. She also runs into Dr. Allen, who believes Laura committed the killings. He tries to sedate her, but is stopped by the Boogeyman, who stabs him and shoves two needles into his eyes. The Boogeyman is revealed to be Henry; Dr. Allen had locked him in a closet in an attempt to treat him of his bogyphobia, and the Boogeyman possessed Henry at that time. The chase ends when Laura decapitates the Boogeyman with gardening shears. The police arrive and discover that under the Boogeyman mask was Dr. Ryan; after killing Dr. Allen but prior to chasing Laura, Henry put the mask on the doctor and escaped. Laura realizes that Henry is running free and is framed for the murders and arrested.  In a [[post-credits scene]], the Boogeyman looks at a picture of Laura and Henry as adults before disappearing.  
Botched (film)
 Richie Donovan works as a professional thief for Groznyi, a wealthy businessman, to pay off his debt for being smuggled into the U.S. as a child. He pulls off an initially successful diamond heist, but it is botched when he is involved in two separate car accidents. He is given one last chance to pay off his debt by going to Russia to steal a priceless antique cross, locked in a safe in a [[Moscow]] penthouse apartment. Richie and his Russian accomplices, brothers Peter and Yuri, recover the cross; but their elevator becomes stuck on the uncompleted 13th floor. Believing the police have stopped the elevator, the thieves take their fellow passengers hostage to negotiate an escape. They agree to send one hostage down; but, when the elevator doors open on the ground floor, the hostage has mysteriously been beheaded.   The remaining hostages quickly divide into two groups: a Christian group consisting of Sonya, Helena and Katerina, who are later joined by Yuri, and another group consisting of nerdy Dmitry, beautiful Anna, and incompetent security guard Boris.  In the confusion, the Christian group seizes firearms and takes control, shooting Peter. Katerina is sent to stand guard over Richie and the remainder of the hostages, while Sonya takes Yuri to a chamber where he is to sacrificed by a wild man in armor named Alex. Yuri escapes, but he is impaled by one of Alex's traps, complete with disco music and lighting. In his rage, Alex kills Katerina, allowing Richie and the hostages to escape. They discover Alex's lair, where he has been watching everyone using security cameras. A photo reveals that Alex is the twin brother of Sonya, and they both believe themselves to be descendants of [[Ivan the Terrible]]. The group splits when Richie and Anna decide to chase after Alex, while Boris and Dmitry prefer to rig the room with various traps they have constructed and wait for Alex to come to them.  Richie and Anna manage to drive off Alex, though Richie is wounded and Anna loses part of her ear. Instead Alex confronts Boris and Dmitry, and starts chasing them through the building when their traps fail to deploy. Dmitry gets caught in his own snare, making him an easy target for Alex, while Sonya dupes Boris into deploying a malfunctioning trap, cutting his hand off. Boris cauterizes his arm but is also injected with a serum that restricts facial movement.  Alex drags Peter's body into his lair for a sacrifice. In doing so, he finds the cross and takes it for himself. Richie and Anna then unsuccessfully search Peter for the cross, only to discover that Peter miraculously survived the shooting. Alex is then attacked from three sides by Peter, Richie and an increasingly incoherent Boris. Though Alex easily kills Peter, Richie manages to impale him on his disco spikes, recovers the cross, then sets him on fire. As they are fleeing the building, Richie is strangled by Sonya, but Anna saves him by stabbing Sonya with her nail file. Security is alerted by Alex's body falling onto the floor below, allowing Richie and Anna to escape unencumbered.  Outside, they are met by Groznyi, who pays Richie handsomely for his work. Richie is enraged, having discovered that Grozniy is the brother of Sonya and Alex, and tells him that he will never work for him again; Grozniy replies that Richie will be back. Richie and Anna then depart for [[Los Angeles]].

One year later, Ed (Brian Presley), Henry (Jake Muxworthy) and Phil (Rider Strong), three recent Texas college grads, are enjoying a college beach bonfire in [[Galveston, Texas]]. They decide to head down to Mexico for the week to hit up the [[strip club]]s and take advantage of a lack of law enforcement.  Ed meets a bartender named Valeria ([[Martha Higareda]]) after being stabbed defending her in a barfight and falls in love with her, while Henry sets Phil up for his first sexual encounter with a prostitute, who is "barely 17".

Phil leaves early to give the prostitute's baby a teddy bear, and as he walks from the carnival alone, Phil reluctantly gets into a car with a couple of men who proceed to abduct him when he tries to leave.  The next morning, Henry and Ed notice that Phil did not come back, and the two begin to investigate, eventually teaming up with Ulises, after Henry gets shot and they find the local authorities and the townspeople utterly terrified of Phil's captors. Phil is revealed to be kept in a shack on a ranch under the watch of an American serial killer affiliated with the cult named Randall (Sean Astin), who wounds Phil after he tries to escape. The captors explain that they follow "some African [[West African Vodun|voodoo]]" called [[Palo (religion)|Palo Myombe]] and are preparing a human sacrifice (a "[[gringo]]", as opposed to the regular Mexican citizens they have been sacrificing) to get the power of [[Nganga]] for their drugs to be invisible to the border guards while smuggling them into the US.   Henry is later hacked to death by several men with machetes on the roof of their hotel, and Ed and Valeria decide to go with Ulises to go kill the men who abducted Phil. By then, it is too late to save Phil, however that doesn't stop Ulises from shooting the leader of the cult to death after being shot himself.  Ed, Valeria, and Ulises travel down the road to a house inhabited by an old man, where Ulises bleeds to death.

Bottom Feeder
 Billionaire Charles Deaver (Richard Fitzpatrick), who has been heavily disfigured by an automobile accident, seeks to save his life by investing in the work of Dr. Nathaniel Leech (James Binkley). Leech is a scientist developing a serum to regenerate dead cells, which he hopes to use to save his wife Miranda, who is dying of [[leukemia]]. When he presents the serum to Deaver, Leech explains that as the serum works, the patient will develop a ravenous hunger that must be treated with a special formula to avoid side effects. Deaver has his henchmen, including his top deputy Krendal (Wendy Anderson), brutally beat Leech; after Krendal shoots the doctor several times, Deaver orders his men to inject Leech with the serum and lock him in an underground tunnel system overnight, to see if the serum indeed works and regenerates him. As he does not have access to the accompanying formula, Leech's hunger quickly drives him to eat a rat and later a dog. He begins to mutate into a hybrid creature shortly thereafter.  A group of salvage workers led by Vince Stoker ([[Tom Sizemore]]) arrive at an abandoned hospital, hoping to find old equipment they can sell for quick cash. Stoker's niece, Sam (Amber Cull), is with the team for the first time. As they explore the hospital, they reach the tunnels beneath the building, which are coincidentally where Leech is trapped. Having now fully mutated into a giant, rat-like monster, Leech begins stalking and killing the workers. As their numbers dwindle, they too become trapped in the maze of tunnels and are forced to not only deal with the monster, but Deaver's men and Krendal, who Deaver has sent into the tunnels. Krendal is later revealed to be a [[double agent]] working for the government, whose mission is to acquire Leech's serum so it can be weaponized by the military.  When Stoker's remaining group encounters Krendal, she initially tries to capture and dispose of them, but she is forced to work together with them to survive when the monster attacks again. Stoker's friend, Otis (Martin Roach), manages to find equipment to use to fight the creature. Meanwhile, the monster manages to reach Deaver in his limousine and, remembering Deaver's betrayal of Leech, exacts revenge by decapitating Deaver. Down in the tunnels, Stoker, Sam and Krendal set timed explosives, intending to destroy the area to kill the creature. In order to buy Stoker and Sam time to escape, Krendal confronts the monster and is killed when it tears her jaw off. Otis returns with a large saw, and the group manage to finally kill the monster by cutting into its chest. Just as they finally kill the creature, however, the timers run out and the explosives detonate, killing Otis while Stoker and Sam barely survive.  Some time later, Stoker awakens in an unfamiliar hospital, where he learns from the doctor of Sam's survival. It quickly becomes apparent, however, that the reason why they survived is that they too have become infected with Leech's serum, due to the monster's blood splashing into their wounds as they killed it. The doctor, who is actually part of the government's operation, tells Stoker that he will be useful for the country as he connects a packet of the nutrient formula to Stoker's intravenous drip. He then leaves the room, leaving Stoker to cry out in pain from his overwhelming hunger.

 [[Andrew Garfield]] portrays Eric Wilson. The film commences when Eric is released from either a secure unit or prison under the name Jack Burridge. His past is told through flashbacks.  Eric Wilson befriends Philip Craig, who is a troublemaker and rescues him from a group of bullies. It is later disclosed that Philip is the victim of [[rape]] perpetrated by his older brother. Philip gets into an argument with a girl from their school who comes across the two boys [[loitering]] in a park. She criticizes them and refers to them as "scum" when she witnesses Philip vandalising a park sign with a Stanley knife. Philip approaches her and starts slashing at her forearms with the knife. He grabs the girl and drags her under a bridge. When Philip drops the knife, Eric picks it up, and follows them under the bridge. The girl is killed, although the film shows neither who kills her nor how.  Eric (dubbed as Boy A during the trial) and Philip are remanded into custody at secure units. Philip ends up dead, assumed to be suicide, but Eric believes that he may have been killed by youth offenders.  Eric is later released and is guided by [[rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]] worker Terry ([[Peter Mullan]]). Eric, shy and eager to be a good citizen again, builds up a new life under the name Jack Burridge. He finds a job, befriends his colleague Chris ([[Shaun Evans]]), falls in love with the office girl, Michelle ([[Katie Lyons]]), and rescues a little girl who would otherwise have died after a car crash. An article in a local newspaper portrays him as a hero and includes a picture of both boys in the story. Eric wants to be honest with Michelle and reveal his past, but Terry urges him not to do so because it is too dangerous. Terry is afraid that people may attack Eric because there is a reward of £20,000 for finding him. Terry argues that it is not dishonest because "Eric is history and Jack is a new person".  The rehabilitation worker is less satisfied with his own son. The son discovers Eric's true identity from newspaper articles about him being released, his new role as the hero and information he looks up without permission on his father's computer. Out of jealousy, he reveals this to the public and as a result, Eric loses his job and his best friend Chris distances himself from him. Michelle goes missing, and people suspect that Eric is somehow involved, though it is later revealed she has sequestered herself at home, devastated about the revelation that Jack is actually Eric.  Eric repeatedly tries to phone Terry but gets his voicemail. He flees from his home to avoid reporters and travels to [[Blackpool]]. There he meets (or imagines meeting) Michelle, who tells him she was not the one who revealed his past and would have eventually understood if he told her the truth, and then leaves. After saying farewell messages in voicemails to Terry and Chris, the film concludes with Eric standing over the edge of a pier.

Breach (film)
 [[Eric O'Neill]] ([[Ryan Phillippe]]) is a young [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] employee assigned to work undercover as a clerk to [[Robert Hanssen]] ([[Chris Cooper]]), a senior agent he is told is suspected of being a [[sexual deviant]]. Hanssen has been recalled from a detail post at the [[State Department]] to FBI headquarters ostensibly to head up a new division specializing in [[Information Assurance]]. Initially, Hanssen insists on a strict formality between the two men. He frequently rails against the [[bureaucracy]] of the FBI and complains that only those who regularly "shoot guns" are considered for senior positions instead of those, like himself, who are involved in vital national security matters. He calls the bureau's [[information technology]] systems antiquated and laments the lack of coordination and information exchange with other intelligence agencies.  Eventually, Hanssen becomes a friend and mentor to O'Neill and takes a personal interest in him and his wife Juliana ([[Caroline Dhavernas]]), who is suspicious of Hanssen and resents his intrusions. A devout [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] who is also a member of [[Opus Dei]], Hanssen urges O'Neill, a lapsed Catholic, and his secular [[East German]]-born wife to become active churchgoers.  O'Neill finds no evidence of Hanssen leading a secret double life and develops a growing respect for his boss, so he confronts his handler in the [[undercover]] assignment, Kate Burroughs ([[Laura Linney]]), and she admits that the sexual deviance allegations are only a secondary consideration. Hanssen is suspected of spying for the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]] for years and being responsible for the deaths of agents working for the United States. The entire Information Assurance Division that Hanssen now heads was created specifically to lure him away from his previous job as liaison to the State Department, and his office was specially constructed with hidden surveillance equipment. The investigation already includes fifty agents, and is personally overseen by FBI Director [[Louis Freeh]], who has been reading O'Neill's reports on Hanssen.  Director Freeh wants to catch Hanssen in an act of making a drop so that their case against Hanssen will be airtight, ensuring that he will cooperate and not leak the locations of any more agents or informants. O'Neill is ordered to obtain data from Hanssen's [[Palm Pilot]] and keep him occupied while FBI agents search his car and plant [[covert listening device]]s in it.  The tracking devices in Hanssen's car cause interference with the radio, which makes Hanssen suspicious. He also wonders why he was placed in an isolated position in the FBI only a few months before he is scheduled to retire. He tells O'Neill he believes he is being watched by Russian agents. The FBI intercepts a message he sends to his Russian handlers saying he will not provide any more information. O'Neill persuades Hanssen that he is not being trailed by the Russians or by him on behalf of the FBI. With his confidence restored, Hanssen makes one last [[dead drop]] of stolen information and the FBI catches him in the act.  Although he is assured promotion, O'Neill is discouraged with the toll the case has taken on his marriage and opts to leave the agency. When O'Neill leaves his office with his belongings, he unexpectedly encounters Hanssen in an elevator being escorted by arresting officers. A tearful Hanssen asks O'Neill to [[intercession|pray on his behalf]], and O'Neill promises he will.

David dies from his injuries, and Erica, while seriously injured, survives. Angry and traumatized, she attempts to purchase a gun. Terrified and unwilling to wait the month required to obtain a gun legally, she buys a [[Kahr K9]] semi-automatic pistol from a [[black market]] gun dealer.  When she stops at a convenience store, a man comes in screaming at the female cashier for not allowing him to see his kids, and shoots her. The killer then hears Erica's cell phone ringer, while attempting to clear out the till, and stalks her in the aisles. Just as the killer is about to find her, Erica is overcome with fear and shoots through the aisles and kills him. On another night, two men harass and threaten passengers in a subway car. The passengers all leave at the next stop except Erica. When the men, amazed that she was not threatened enough to leave, take it as a challenge and threaten her with a knife, Erica shoots them both dead. Another night, Erica attempts to save a prostitute by threatening the woman's pimp with her pistol. When he attempts to run them down with his car in retaliation, Erica shoots him in the head, causing his car to run over the prostitute. The prostitute is injured, but lives, and is taken to the hospital. All the while, Erica attempts to track down the men who killed David.  She strikes up a friendship with Detective Sean Mercer ([[Terrence Howard]]), who is investigating the vigilante crimes and who is initially unaware of her role in the deaths. Erica, in trying to find out if the detective is close to solving her case, as well as the vigilante killings, pretends to want to interview Mercer. During the interview, the detective asks her how she pulled it back together after her tragedy. She replies that she did not, and she had to become a different person from the one she was before. They talk several times after.  Erica and her boss, Carol, enter an elevator together in their office building. In the elevator, she overhears two men talking about the vigilante killer.  Erica's boss then gets her to take calls on her radio show to solicit the public's opinion on the vigilante killings. The various responses almost get her to confess to the killings, but once at the police station, she is unable to bring herself to do so. Mercer tells Erica about a criminal he has been pursuing for a long time, who has allegedly committed several murders, but Mercer is unable to bring him to justice.  When Erica kills the suspect that Detective Mercer had long been after, Mercer comes to suspect her as the killer. He attempts to set a trap for Erica by taking her along with him to interview the prostitute she had saved before, but the prostitute does not let on that she knows Erica. When Mercer is finally able to interview one of the subway car passengers, he gets a description of the probable vigilante, and learns that the person is a female rather than male as previously suspected. When the police bring in Erica to identify one of the suspects in her attack, she recognizes one of them, but does not identify him. After, Mercer meets Erica for coffee, during which he hints that he suspects her as the vigilante.  Informed by the police that they found her engagement ring at a pawn shop, she manages to hunt down a name, address and phone number at the pawn shop. With the phone number, she is able to track down one of the attacker's ex-girlfriends, who witnessed the whole attack via a video recording on a cellphone, but is too frightened to reveal information, fearing a similar reprisal. However, she forwards the video recording of Erica's attack to Erica's phone. Erica almost breaks down on seeing the video, then forwards it to detective Mercer. Erica, now armed with positive visual identification of all three attackers, is able to track them down.  At the climax of the film, Erica finds and confronts the men responsible for David's murder. She kills two, finding and releasing her dog in the process (which they had stolen and kept after the attack) and struggles with the third. Mercer arrives on the scene just as the third attacker had taken the upper hand and disarmed Erica, holding her in a choke-hold, and attempts to arrest him. Erica then retrieves her weapon and attempts to execute the attacker. Mercer persuades Erica to lower the gun, but after looking into her begging eyes, hands her his own for her to use a legal weapon to kill the last attacker. The attacker begs to be arrested, instead, insisting that it is Mercer's job to do so, Erica then executes her attacker. Mercer insists that Erica should wound him to help frame the attackers as being behind the vigilante killings. Mercer places Erica's gun in the last attacker's dead hand and Erica leaves the scene, eventually being joined by her dog in Central Park.

He rides the bus to school with his little sister May Belle ([[Bailee Madison]]), where he avoids the school bully Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton). In class, Jess is teased by classmates Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) and Gary Fulcher (Elliot Lawless), and meets new student Leslie Burke ([[AnnaSophia Robb]]). At recess, Jess enters a running event, for which he had been training at home. Leslie also enters and manages to beat all the boys, much to Jess' irritation. On the way home, Jess and Leslie learn that they are next-door neighbors.  Later in the evening Jess becomes frustrated when he finds that May Belle has drawn in his notebook, but his strict yet caring father ([[Robert Patrick]]) sides with her. He later watches them gardening together, disappointed that his father does not spend time with him. Moreover, his mother cherishes her daughter more than him. The next day at school, Leslie compliments Jess' drawing ability, and they soon become friends. After school, they venture into the woods and swing across a creek on a rope. Jess and Leslie find an abandoned tree house on the other side, and invent a new world, which they call Terabithia. The fantasy world, which is a reflection on their lives, comes to life through their eyes as they explore the surroundings. For the next few days, Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the tree house getting to know each other.  Leslie gives Jess an art kit on his birthday, much to his delight. Jess becomes angry with his father's attitude to him, and refuses the existence of Terabithia the next day at school. Afterwards, Jess apologizes to Leslie by giving her a puppy, whom she names Prince Terrien. Once in Terabithia, they fight with various creatures, including a troll resembling Janice, and a squirrel-like creature resembling Hoager, whom they name the 'Sqoager'. At school, Leslie becomes frustrated by Janice's fee for using the toilet. Jess and Leslie play a prank on Janice, and she becomes the laughing stock of everyone on the bus. Once Leslie's parents finish their book, she and Jess help paint their house. Jess is impressed by her parents' happiness, and smiles as he watches their family. At school, Leslie discovers from an upset Janice that her bullying is due to her abusive father, and the two become friends, with Janice later befriending Jess as well. Jess and Leslie take P.T. to Terabithia, where they fight off several creatures resembling students at their school, this time with the troll as their ally. When it starts raining, they decide to go home, and Jess looks on smiling as Leslie runs away.  The next morning, Ms. Edmunds ([[Zooey Deschanel]]), Jess' music teacher that Jess has a crush on, calls to invite him on a one-on-one field trip to an art museum. Jess tries to ask his mother's permission; however, she is half-asleep and he takes her mumbling as approval. Jess doesn't ask Leslie to accompany him, and merely looks at her house as they drive by. When he returns home, Jess finds that his father and mother were worried sick since they didn't know where he was. His father reveals to Jess that Leslie had died that morning by drowning in the rain-swollen creek after the rope she used to cross it broke. Jess, much to his horror, first denies it, then runs out of his house to check on Leslie, but he discovers the emergency vehicles surrounding her house, and has no choice but to accept Leslie's death.  The following day, Jess and his parents visit the Burke family home to pay their respects. Leslie's father, Bill Burke ([[Latham Gaines]]), tells Jess that she loved him, and thanks him for being a very good friend to her, since she had trouble making friends at her old school. Jess feels overwhelming guilt for Leslie's death, even lashing out at both Scott and May Belle, and imagining that a dark spirit from Terabithia is chasing after him, but his father eventually consoles him to keep their friendship alive for her sake.  Jess decides to re-imagine Terabithia and builds a bridge across the river to welcome a new ruler. He invites May Belle to Terabithia; she is delighted because she was previously denied any opportunity to enter. They bring back Terabithia in even greater splendor, with Jess as king and May Belle as princess.

El búfalo de la noche (film)
 It follows the plot line of the book, structuring it in a much more cinematic manner. The setting is contemporary [[México]], and the characters are college students, struggling to get ahead in a world that is getting more and more alienated, where physical contact fills the gaps in interpersonal communication.  Arriaga explained during an interview: "It's a novel I wrote after teaching at the university for some time. After some years I realized young people are getting more emotionally damaged, their capacity as human beings of being introspective and relating to each other is every time more deteriorated, this is precisely what the movie tries to reflect... Since the novel came out its natural audience has been people under thirty, who understand it better because they are going through the same confusion stages as the characters."<ref name="Interview for La Jornada Newspaper"></ref>  The apparent incongruency of the characters' actions, thoughts and personalities reflects a great deal of Latin American idiosyncrasies.  The director has stated: "The importance of making this film is the contradictions of the characters, that's what gets them close to real people. The stories of young people we get to see on the big screen at Latin America usually come from other countries, and therefore reflect a reality we do not have here; we dedicate this film to address these problems on Latin American youth with our own language... Before we started shooting I did not know México has a high rate of suicide and youth schizophrenia, one of the highest on the world. This told me we made the right choice in talking about these issues: besides entertaining, we want to make a portrait of Mexico, and a great deal of Latin America."<ref name="Interview for La Jornada Newspaper"/>

Then he requires them to get $300 from nowhere in a part of the town where they don't have any friends. Abby pawns her bracelet and Neil his watch to get the $300. He then requires Abby to deliver a document to Neil's office within twenty minutes, and Tom shows Neil a copy of document that contains details of Neil's hacking into customer accounts, which if leaked will ruin Neil. Neil watches Abby deliver the document from a distance. Neil and Abby try to rescue Sophie from a hotel, only to get caught by Tom, who makes Abby take off her dress and put on an enticing short dress in front of both of them.  Tom has one last test for Neil to save Sophie: he requires Neil to enter a house and kill the occupant - a coworker named Judy who Neil has been having an affair with. Neil is greeted warmly by Judy, and is desperately confused as he sees a picture of Tom on the mantel and learns that he and Judy are married. Tom enters the house and tells Neil to shoot Judy or he will kill Neil's daughter Sophie. Neil pulls the trigger but the gun isn't loaded. Ryan reveals he knows about their affair and tells Neil his daughter is safe at home.  As they return home, Neil lies to Abby and tells her that his boss was having an affair with Judy and Tom mistook Neil for that person, which is why Tom had tormented them the whole day. When they return home, Sophie is asleep and has been there the whole time. Abby reveals to Neil that their daughter had never been kidnapped, and Tom had concocted the entire day to let Neil experience for one day the pain he has undergone. Neil says that Abby has ruined his career by delivering the document to his office, but she tells him it was blank. Abby has paid Neil back for 24 hours a portion of the pain she has experienced since learning of his affair.

The mayor of the village tries to make the Americans' stay enjoyable and invites them to the 100th anniversary of the founding of the village, even though such a feast was celebrated only a few months before. Doiaru's daughter, Monica, develops a crush on an American soldier, but as she knows no English, she uses the help of a local geek, Andrei, who is in love with her.  The mayor and the rest of the villagers are incited into revolting against Doiaru and start a riot, during the course of which the train leaves and Doiaru dies.

Caótica Ana
  A synopsis prior to the release of the film stated:  :"''Caotica Ana'' is the story-journey of Ana during four years of her life, from 18 to 22. A countdown, 10, 9, 8, 7... until 0, like in hypnosis, through which Ana proves that she does not live alone, that her existence seems like a continuation of other lives of young women who died in a tragic way, all at the age of 22, and who live in the abyss of her unconscious memory. This is her chaos. Ana is the princess and the monster of this feminist fable against the tyranny of man."<ref name="caotica" /><ref name="IMDb-dates" />  
Captivity (film)
 A young man is being tortured. Two tubes are inserted into his nose, and truck battery acid is pumped in through one pipe, causing blood to pour out through the other. The man's captor then kills him with a large hammer.  Jennifer Tree ([[Elisha Cuthbert]]), a young fashion model and cover girl, had captured the attention of photographers and, for better or worse, the public at large. On an evening out alone, Jennifer is stalked and drugged. She wakes in a stupor to find herself captive and confined to a cell. A series of metal bins and numbered lockers abruptly swing open in front of her. They contain personal items taken from her apartment. She is forced to view videotapes containing images of the victims who were tortured previous to her captivity, as well as videotaped interviews she had given to the media in the past. Realizing there is no way out, Jennifer pleads and screams to anyone who might hear her.  During her confinement, she is subjected to various forms of psychological torture. Jennifer eventually finds she is not alone. A young man, Gary ([[Daniel Gillies]]), is being held captive in an adjoining cell. The two make contact and try to find out why they are being held. They both make it to a garage, where they find a car. As soon as they are about to start it, gas erupts in the car, knocking them both unconscious. They find themselves back in their cells, where Jennifer sees a tape of Gary being taken and tied to a chair with a gun held under his chin. After a while of Jennifer worrying, she sees Gary being thrown into his cell. She rushes to him and helps him.  They then proceed to have sex.  After Gary awakens, he discovers Jennifer had drunk a bottle of water that had a drug in it, to put her to sleep. He then gets up to wipe the blood off his nose.  While he's leaving, he makes sure that Jennifer is sound asleep before leaving the cell. Gary's key opens a door into a house, revealing that Gary and his older brother Ben are actually Jennifer's captors. Gary joins Ben in the kitchen, where they make sushi. Gary tells Ben that he is falling in love with Jennifer. Ben then puts something in the fridge. When he turns around, Gary stabs him. Gary then watches the same tape of the woman lying on the bed that was shown earlier. The boy stabbing his mother is revealed to have been Gary looking at a smirking Ben. After the tape, Gary is seen reviewing a series of pictures in an album, and then there is a knock at the door. At the sound, he rushes to hide the albums in a cabinet.  Gary slams the cabinet door, but it does not fully close. Gary answers the door to find two detectives looking for Ben. Gary tells them that his brother is not at home. The detectives enter the house, get comfortable, and ask to watch a big sports game on television. One of them flips the channel to the surveillance video of Jennifer sleeping. Seeing this, Gary shoots them both. He runs down to where Jennifer is being held and tells her that he has killed the perpetrators and it's time for them to go. He places Jennifer in a room and tells her to stay there.  One of the detectives, having survived the gunshot wound, jumps out at her.  Believing him to be one of her captors, she kills him with a bat. Jennifer then discovers the partially open cabinet and begins viewing the albums. Gary is in all of them. While she looks through the albums, Ben, also not yet dead, jumps out at her. However, Jennifer finishes him off by stabbing the knife more deeply into him.  After viewing the albums, Jennifer hears the detective's pager ring, and she goes through his personal belongings. Gary records Jennifer, who claims she belongs to him and will help him clean up the mess. She tricks him and sprays ammonia in his eyes before running off. On her way, she cuts a series of wires and electrical cords, which prevents the doors, code entries, and lights from working. Jennifer picks up a flashlight and the gun used on the detectives. She points the flashlight at the opposite wall through a poster of her, distracting Gary. Jennifer goes through the door and points the gun at Gary. Gary then tries to persuade her to put the gun down. When it's clear that she won't, he lunges toward her with a pocket knife, and she shoots him. Gary falls back and tries to lunge again, but she shoots him a second time and he falls back on the bed. Gary whispers to her while gasping for air. Jennifer shoots at her poster, which covered a window leading outside. She drops the gun and walks outside and then down the street, finally free.  === Alternate Ending === The film's original ending, shown in its entirety on the DVD, depicted a man being captured and tortured with acid before being murdered with a hammer. Through press clippings, the man is shown to be a serial killer of women, and his assailant is revealed to be Jennifer. This ending was re-edited and used as a [[cold open]] in the final cut.

There he meets Valery ([[Leonid Bichevin]]), a young man who is dating his niece and has come to take her to a party. On the way back from Leninsk to Leningrad Artemy's car breaks down and he goes into an isolated farmhouse to get help. Artemy gets to talking with the farmhouse owner, Alexey ([[Aleksei Serebryakov (actor)|Aleksei Serebryakov]]). The two drink together homemade alcohol and argue about faith in God and retribution from sins, the professor defending the Soviet atheist worldview. Artemy also encounters Alexey's wife, Antonina (Natalya Akimova), as well as Sunka (Mikhail Skryabin), a Vietnamese worker working at the farm, who seems to be practically a personal slave of Alexey's, and a third stranger who is not explained at the time. Sunka worker finally fixes Artemy's car and the professor drives on. Being too drunk, he prefers to return to his brother.  Meanwhile, Valery goes to a party by himself, since his girlfriend (Artemy's niece) needs to study. At the concert Valery meets another female student friend of his named Angelika (Agniya Kuznetsova), the daughter of a high-ranking [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] official, and they drink together. After the party, in search of more alcohol, Valery drives with her to a farm of moonshiners, which turns out to be the same farm Artemy had visited earlier. Valery tells Angelika to stay in the car while he gets the alcohol. However, instead of returning directly to the car, he gets drunk senseless with the moonshiner, Alexey. Angelika, waiting in the car, notices that she is being watched by a strange man. She gets scared, and tries to get help from Antonina, who gives the girl a shotgun and hides her in a barn. The stranger, who turns out to be a police officer Captain Zhurov (Aleksei Poluyan), enters the barn and takes away the gun. When Sunka tries to defend the girl, Zhurov murders him, then rapes the girl with a bottle (it appears that he himself is impotent). In the morning he handcuffs her, taking her to his flat in Leninsk, and keeps the girl handcuffed to a bedframe in his bedroom, watched over by his deranged alcoholic mother, while he brings local small-time criminals in to rape her, killing one after he fails to "please" the girl. The girl threatens that her fiancé, who is an army paratrooper, will save her. Captain Zhurov finds out, however, that her fiance had just been killed in Afghanistan. He arranges to have the zinc-lined coffin shipped to his apartment where he opens it and throws the corpse on the bed next to the screaming girl.  Alexey the moonshiner is arrested for the killing of his Sunka. Captain Zhurov visits Alexey in his cell and convinces him to take the blame for the crime in return for some unexplained earlier favors. Alexey gets a visit from his wife Antonina and explains to her why he has to agree to confess. Antonina meets Artemy, the professor whose testimony might exonerate her husband, but Artemy refuses to testify since that would jeopardize his academic career. Alexey is convicted, sentenced to the death penalty, and summarily executed. Antonina takes a shotgun and goes to Zhurov's apartment, where she encounters screaming Angelica still chained to the bed next to the rotting corpses. She shoots and kills Zhurov, then walks out without attempting to help the girl. Meanwhile, Artemy enters a church and asks to be baptized. In the last scenes Valery (who escaped the entire affair unscathed and without letting anyone know that he knows anything), is shown discussing business propositions with a friend of his (the son of Artemy, Slavic). The two are excited about the amount of money that can be made in the disintegrating country.  
Captain Abu Raed
 Abu Raed is an airport janitor at the [[Queen Alia International Airport]] in [[Amman]]. After finding a [[Royal Jordanian]] captain's hat in the trash, the neighborhood children mistake him for an airline pilot and beg him to tell them stories of his adventures. At first refusing, he later concedes and tells them about his fictional travels to England, France, and New York, earning the name "Captain Abu Raed"  An older child, Murad, knows who Abu Raed really is and sets out to prove the other children wrong, repeating the phrase "People like us don't grow up to be pilots." With some [[Jordanian dinar|dinars]] he found, Murad takes the other children on a taxi ride to the airport to show them the truth about Abu Raed. The children are heartbroken at seeing their idol on his hands and knees, scrubbing the floor.  It is later shown that Murad had stolen the money from his father Abu Murad, who, drunk after a hard day selling women's clothing on the street, often [[domestic violence|abused]] Murad's mother, Um Murad. Abu Murad was exceptionally mad about the loss of money and took it out on his wife.  Abu Raed, after being exposed as a phony, forgave Murad and gave him the pilot hat as a token of forgiveness. Later, Murad steals a model airplane and gets his hand burned by his father for it. Abu Raed is there to comfort him, creating a bond between the two. This event convinces Abu Raed to find a way to bring Murad, his younger brother, and his mother to safety.  Meanwhile, at the airport and on the bus home, Abu Raed gets to know Nour, a female pilot whose wealthy father poorly attempted to find her a husband. During a friendly visit to his home, he tells her about his past, including a deceased wife and son, Raed.  Abu Raed also had to deal with Tareq, one of the children whom he told stories to, whose father had him selling wafers on the street rather than going to school. Abu Raed knew he was a smart boy so he bought all of his wafers so Tareq could attend school. However, this was a mixed blessing as Abu Tareq would then give Tareq more wafers to sell, seeing as he was a good salesman.  One night, before Abu Murad gets home, Abu Raed develops a plan to protect Murad and his family. Nour volunteers to take them in, because her wealthy family owns a large house. She brings her car to the living area where Abu Raed and the Murads live, and they hurriedly pack the belongings of the Murad family. As they are about to leave, Murad runs back to retrieve the pilot's cap, a symbol of his dreams and aspirations. Nour then sets off for her house, as Tareq appears and asks what is going on, to which Abu Raed replies, "Nothing." Tareq becomes the last person, other than a drunk Abu Murad, to see Abu Raed alive.  Despite repeated warnings from Um Murad that "He's going to kill you", Abu Raed sits in the Murad apartment and awaits Abu Murad's return. Upon finding his house empty, Abu Murad threatens Abu Raed's life. Abu Raed is implied to have been killed in that apartment. Years later, a grown-up Murad is seen watching the airfield as a [[Royal Jordanian]] pilot.

Cassandra's Dream
 Brothers Terry ([[Colin Farrell]]) and Ian ([[Ewan McGregor]]), who live in [[South London]], were raised by a weak father Brian ([[John Benfield]]) who runs a restaurant, and a strong mother Dorothy ([[Clare Higgins]]) who taught her sons to look up to their uncle Howard ([[Tom Wilkinson]]), a successful plastic surgeon and businessman.  The brothers buy a sailboat at an oddly low price, despite its near pristine condition. They name it ''Cassandra's Dream'', after a greyhound that won Terry the money to buy the boat. Knowing nothing of [[Greek mythology]], they are unaware of the ominous antecedents of this name—the ancient prophetess [[Cassandra]], whose prophecies of doom went unheeded by those around her.  While driving home from a day's sailing in a borrowed car, Ian crosses paths with beautiful actress Angela Stark ([[Hayley Atwell]]), with whom he becomes infatuated.  Terry has a [[gambling addiction]] that sinks him deeper in debt. Ian wishes to invest in hotels in [[California]] to finance a new life with Angela.  To overcome their financial issues, they ask Howard for help. He agrees to help them, but asks for a favor in return: they must murder someone for him. Howard faces imprisonment for unspecified crimes and his future is threatened by Martin Burns ([[Phil Davis (actor)|Phil Davis]]), a former business partner who plans to testify against him. Howard asks his nephews to get rid of Burns, and in return he will reward them financially. After initial reluctance, the brothers agree.  They make two [[Improvised firearm|zip guns]], untraceable and easily destroyed. Lying in wait in Burns' home, their plan is foiled when Burns arrives with a woman. Their resolve shaken, they leave and agree to commit the murder the next day.  The next day, they succeed in carrying out the murder and later destroy the guns. Ian is content to move on as if nothing happened, but Terry is consumed by guilt and begins abusing alcohol and other drugs. His behavior frightens his fiancée ([[Sally Hawkins]]), who tells Ian about the situation and that Terry believes he has killed someone. After Terry confides that he wants to turn himself in to the police, Ian goes to Howard for advice. They agree there is no alternative but to get rid of Terry. Ian plans to poison Terry during an outing on the boat. Ian can't bring himself to kill his own brother, and attacks him in a fit of rage. In the chaos, Terry knocks Ian down the steps into the cabin, killing him.  The boat is later discovered adrift by the police, and the audience learns that Terry snapped and drowned himself after killing his brother. The last shot is of ''Cassandra's Dream'', still in beautiful condition despite the tragedies it set in motion.

Carved (film)
  As stories about the [[Kuchisake-onna]] ("The Slit-Mouthed Woman") spread through a Japanese town, an earthquake causes a corpse matching the entity's description (a woman with long hair, a [[trench coat]], scissors, and a white mask) to break out of a closet in an abandoned house. As that occurs, Noboru Matsuzaki (Haruhiko Kato), a teacher, hears a voice ask "Am I pretty?" At a [[playground]], a boy who had gone looking for the Kuchisake-onna with his friends is grabbed by the creature, which vanishes with him.  The boy's disappearance prompts the school where Noboru works to send the students home in groups, escorted by members of the staff. Mika Sasaki is reluctant to go home, admitting to a teacher, Kyôko Yamashita ([[Eriko Sato (actress)|Eriko Sato]]), that her mother hits her. Kyôko (who has a troubled relationship with her own daughter, who lives with her ex-husband) becomes agitated when Mika says she hates her mother, causing Mika to run away, right into the arms of the Kuchisake-onna, whose appearance was again [[Foreshadowing|foreshadowed]] by Noboru hearing a voice ask "Am I pretty?" As the Kuchisake-onna leaves with Mika, Mika knocks her mask off, revealing the woman's disfigured face.  At school, Noboru shows Kyôko a photograph of a woman who looks like the Kuchisake-onna. Noboru hears the voice again; as he heads toward it with Kyôko, he tells her that the picture is thirty years old. Noboru traces the voice to a house, and he and Kyôko save the boy inside from the Kuchisake-onna, whom Kyôko kills with a knife. The Kuchisake-onna's body turns into that of a neighboring housewife, revealing the Kuchisake-onna acts by possessing other women, whose infection is signified by them developing a cough.  Noboru tells Kyôko that the woman in the photo is Taeko Matsuzaki ([[Miki Mizuno]]), his dead mother, a sickly and unhinged woman who would physically abuse him and his siblings. One day, Taeko "disappeared" after killing Noboru's siblings, and after that, rumors and sightings of the Kuchisake-onna began. Noboru again hears the voice of the Kuchisake-onna, who has possessed the mother of Mika's friend, Natsuki Tamura. Natsuki is taken to the Kuchisake-onna's lair, where the Kuchisake-onna cuts her mouth, and murders the boy she had abducted from the playground. Mika cuts the ropes binding Natsuki, who escapes, but is too traumatized and injured to help with the search for Mika.  Kyôko looks through information on the Kuchisake-onna that the boy she saved had given her, and finds a note stating that the Kuchisake-onna's hideout is a deserted house with a red roof, a description which matches Noboru's childhood home. As he searches the house with Kyôko, Noboru remembers that his mother tried to have him [[Coup de grâce|mercy kill]] her, telling him that unless he decapitated her, she would come back and haunt others. Instead, Noboru slit his mother's mouth and stabbed her, then dressed her body up in coat and mask, and hid it in the closet.  Kyôko and Noboru find Mika in the basement, and are attacked by the Kuchisake-onna. The Kuchisake-onna wounds Kyôko, then captures Noboru and Mika, takes them down to the basement, and brutalizes them. Finding a knife, Kyôko stabs the Kuchisake-onna in the neck with it, killing and leaving behind the body of Natsuki's mother. Mika's mother, who had gone off to look for her daughter on her own, arrives at the house, and becomes the new host of the Kuchisake-onna. To give Kyôko and Mika the chance to escape, Noboru fends off the Kuchisake-onna but is fatally wounded. Before dying, he beheads her, convinced that doing so will finally vanquish her. The decapitation fails to stop the Kuchisake-onna, and some time later, the spirit takes over Kyôko while she is visiting her daughter.

When the man arrives and starts a [[Electrical generator|generator]], it appears that the storage room is his home. Victoria escapes and runs back toward the crowd.  She has scarcely returned when the [[Prefecture of Police]] burst in and interrupt the rave. Victoria is caught up in a mob and hits her head, and when she regains consciousness she is alone in the catacombs. She encounters a man named Henri who tries to help her, but every exit they come to is blocked.  Henri falls through a rotted walkway while they are searching for a way out and injures his leg. Victoria tries to help him, but eventually gives up; she takes his map and leaves him in the dark, striking out on her own. When she finds an exit she is frightened by someone on the other side trying to get in, and she flees, fearing it is the Antichrist.  After a chase through the tunnels she hides behind a wall column, armed with a mining pick.  When the pursuer approaches, she strikes out blindly with the pick and hits him.    Shortly after, Carolyn and her friends show up and tell Victoria that it was all just a prank.  They wonder why Victoria is crying until they see Jean-Michel lying dead, felled by the blow of Victoria's pick.  Carolyn screams at the exhausted and terrified Victoria, who lashes out with the pick and kills Carolyn and her remaining friends.  Escaping at last from the catacombs, covered in blood, Victoria returns to the airport in a taxi, and repeats the voice-over line which started the film.

Seven years later Mr. Tripathi ([[Anjan Srivastav]]), the head of India's hockey association, meets with Khan's friend—and hockey advocate—Uttamaji ([[Mohit Chauhan (actor)|Mohit Chauhan]]) to discuss the [[India women's national field hockey team|Indian women's hockey team]]. According to Tripathi, the team has no future since the only long-term role for women is to "cook and clean". Uttamaji, however, tells him that Kabir Khan (whom no one has seen for seven years) wants to coach the team. Initially sceptical, Tripathi agrees to the arrangement.  Khan finds himself in charge of a group of 16 young women (each [[States and union territories of India|representing a different state]]), divided by their competitive nature and regional prejudices. Komal Chautala ([[Chitrashi Rawat]]), a village girl from [[Haryana]], clashes with Preeti Sabarwal ([[Sagarika Ghatge]]) from [[Chandigarh]]; short-tempered Balbir Kaur ([[Tanya Abrol]]) from [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] bullies Rani Dispotta (Seema Azmi) and Soimoi Kerketa (Nisha Nair), who are from remote villages in [[Jharkhand]]. Mary Ralte (Kimi Laldawla) from [[Mizoram]] and Molly Zimik (Masochon "Chon Chon" Zimik), from [[Manipur]] in [[North-East India]], face widespread [[Ethnic relations in India#Prejudice and discrimination against North-East Indians|racial discrimination]] and sexual harassment. Team captain Vidya Sharma ([[Vidya Malvade]]) must choose between hockey and the wishes of her husband Rakesh's ([[Nakul Vaid]]) family, and Preeti's fiancé—Abhimanyu Singh ([[Vivan Bhatena]]), vice-captain of the [[India national cricket team]]—feels threatened by her involvement with the team.  Khan realizes that he can make the girls winners only if he can help them overcome their differences. During his first few days as coach he benches several players who refuse to follow his rules—including Bindiya Naik ([[Shilpa Shukla]]), his most experienced player. In response, Bindiya repeatedly encourages the other players to defy Khan. When she finally succeeds, Khan angrily resigns; however, he invites the staff and team to a farewell lunch at [[McDonald's]]. During the lunch, local boys [[Eve teasing|make a pass]] at Mary; Balbir attacks them, triggering a brawl between the boys and the team. Khan, recognizing that they are acting as one for the first time, prevents the staff from intervening; he only stops a man from hitting one of the women from behind with a [[cricket bat]], telling him that there are no cowards in hockey. In an about-face, after the fight the women ask Khan to remain as their coach.  The team faces new challenges. When Tripathi refuses to send the women's team to [[Australia]] for the World Cup, Khan proposes a match against the men’s team. Although his team loses, their performance inspires Tripathi to send them to Australia after all. Bindiya is upset with Khan for choosing Vidya over her as the Captain of the team. The result sees a loss in the tournament with a 7-0 to [[Hockeyroos|Australia]]. When Khan confronts Bindiya about her behavior on the field, Bindiya responds by seducing Khan to which he rejects her advances and asks her to stay away from the game. Khan goes on to train the girls and again which is followed by victories over [[England women's national field hockey team|England]], [[Spain women's national field hockey team|Spain]], [[South Africa women's national field hockey team|South Africa]],  [[Black Sticks Women|New Zealand]], [[Las Leonas|Argentina]]. Just before their game with Korea, Khan approaches Bindiya to go back in the field and break the strategy of 'Man to Man' marking by Korean team so they can win the match. Bindiya goes on to the field and with the help of Gunjan Lakhani manages to beat [[Korea women's national field hockey team|South Korea]]. They are again matched with Australia for the final; this time, they defeat the Hockeyroos for the World Cup. When the team returns home their families treat them with greater respect and Khan, his good name restored, returns with his mother to their ancestral home.

Chain Kulii Ki Main Kulii
 Karan (Zain Khan) is a thirteen-year-old boy who lives in a dilapidated orphanage owned by a stern, uncouth warden, John "Hitler" Kakkad ([[Rajesh Khera]]). Karan has two dreams: one is to have parents and the other is to be a big [[Cricket]]er. His inspiration is [[Kapil Dev]], since he has been brought up on the motivating stories of India's [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983 World Cup win]] by the orphanage caretaker, Bholu Dada ([[Sushil Parashar]]), a loving and a gentle old man. Karan's best friend in the orphanage is Daboo (Dieptiman Chowdhury) who often lends his gentle ears to the aspirations which Karan lives on.   His dreams take a turn when one day, he lays his hands on an old cricket bat which Karan is convinced is the bat that Kapil Dev used to win the 1983 World Cup; for him, the bat becomes a magic bat. One day by a stroke of luck, the coach of the [[India national cricket team|Indian cricket team]] spots Karan playing cricket and is highly impressed by his batting skill. At that point in town, the Indian cricket team has been going through a "rough patch".   Karan and his magical bat are inducted into the Indian cricket team as the opening batsman along with the captain, Varun ([[Rahul Bose]]). When Karan marches onto the pitch and wins the match for India, he soon becomes the nation's heartthrob. Although he was formerly rejected by adopting couples, he is now the most sought after kid in the country. However, Raghav ([[Raj Bhansali]]), the orphanage bully, hates him and feels that if Karan did not have the magic bat he would have never made it to the cricket team. Raghav now wants the magic bat at any cost. Karan and Varun develop a strong emotional bond deeper than fellow cricketers. Karan has no parents and Varun has parents, but is estranged with his father and does not want to accept him. Karan strongly believes that parents are the best gift endowed by God and succeeds in uniting Varun with his father.   At the final 5th one day match between India and [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]], events spiral out of control and Karan's magic bat is destroyed by Raghav. Karan is a nervous wreck, but Varun makes him realise that the bat actually never had any magic but it was in the players viz. Kapil during 1983 World Cup and now Karan himself. With Karan's help, India wins the match. After the match, Karan decides to stop playing and re-join the team when he is older. Varun and his girlfriend, Malini ([[Meera Vasudevan]]) decide to adopt Karan.  
Centigrade (film)
 A Man ([[Colin Cunningham]]) awakens one morning with a hangover to discover that he has been taken hostage aboard his old, run down trailer which is being towed down the highway by a mysterious black truck; he desperately tries to find a way out of the sealed vehicle before he burns inside. [[Colin Cunningham]] describes the movie as follows: "''Centigrade'', in a nutshell, is about a guy who lives in an old dilapidated, busted-up trailer. There's no wheels on it. It's just laying dead in the weeds. [The owner] does a bad thing, and he wakes up in the morning and [the trailer is] rolling down the highway. It's being towed by a big, black pickup truck.  The doors won't open and the windows won't break and he can't get out. That's essentially what it's about. It's about a man trapped."<ref>[http://www.gateworld.net/news/2008/08/cunningham_heats_up_with_centigr.shtml GateWorld - August 29, 2008]</ref>  
Changathipoocha
 ''Changathipoocha'' tells the story of two aged brothers Sreedharan Nair ([[Nedumudi Venu]]), who is also the Kunnathur [[Panchayath]] President and Raman Nair ([[Jagathy Sreekumar]]), the opposition leader who are constantly at loggerheads owing differences in opinion regarding ancestral property. Raman Nair is also known as 'Kuliru', because he always goes out without wearing shirt. But everyone else in their family, including Sreedharan Nair's daughter Priya ([[Ramya Nambeeshan]]) and Raman Nair's daughter Sreedevi ([[Radhika (Malayalam actress)|Radhika]]) are close to each other, sharing every part of their family fun. The news about the return of their sister Bhanumathi, who had been away for years, creates shock to Raman Nair especially because Bhanumathi's share of the property is at present under his control and even the house he is living in rightfully belongs to her.  The other news to follow was that Bhanumathi's son on their way back proposes to marry one of his cousins, Priya or Sreedevi. Raman Nair expects that if Bhanumathi's son marries Priya, Sreedharan Nair's daughter, he would be losing all the wealth. So with the aid of Purushottaman Nair (Kochupreman), who is Raman Nair's manager, they come up with a solution. They plans the entry of someone else as a hired lover who could be made to fall in love with Priya and thus to create more tension for Sreedharan Nair, even before the arrival of Bhanumathi and her son.  According to this deed arrives Sivankutty ([[Jayasurya]]), who is entrusted with the job of making Priya fall in love with him, so that Raman Nair could score a victory over Sreedharan Nair. Sivan is actually the brother-in-law of Purushottaman Nair and owes a large amount of money to many people, who are constantly after him. Sivankutty takes up the 'job' to solve his financial problems. A mix-up takes place as Sivan who was to fall in love with Priya, accidentally falls for Sridevi.  In the end, after a series of comic confusions, Sivankutty marries Sridevi.  
The Chair (film)
 ''Danielle'' (Alanna Chisholm), a psychology student, moves into a beautiful Victorian house, but immediately begins to suffer apparent manifestations of a spirit haunting the residence. Alarmed, she calls her sister, Anna (Lauren Roy), who initially believes that Danielle is suffering a relapse of a hinted-at psychiatric disorder.  Discovering a "fog" in her hallway, Danielle follows it to the closet of the spare room, discovering a small concealed room inside the wall. Danielle investigates the history of the house: she learns of Mordechai Zymytryk (Paul Soren), who mesmerized a convicted child-killer named Crowe as punishment for the torture and subsequent death of Zymytryk's own grandson. She also begins to exhibit signs of possession.  Influenced by the spirit, Danielle begins rebuilding a chair with straps and gears, using parts that have been scattered around the house. Attacking her sister, she straps her to the device, revealing its name and purpose: it is a panic vest, the chain and gears tightening the device around the victim's chest each time they exhale. Danielle is summoned downstairs by Jacob (Nickolas Tortolano), and Anna seizes the opportunity to escape.  Anna makes her way to the site of a disused asylum where Crowe was supposedly buried, she is distressed to find the building is long gone. A car arrived, revealing Zymytryk, who is still alive, and offers to aid Anna to find the body and end the curse he created. He tells Anna that he will summon Crowe's spirit and that it will jump into his body, at which point she must kill Zymytryk. He warns her that no matter what he says, she must go through his death. Meanwhile, Danielle has lured Jacob into the house and strapped him into the panic vest.  Completing the ritual, Zymytryk snatches the gun from Anna, claiming that the Crowe "didn't jump". Heeding the man's advice, Anna attacks him with a shovel and races back to Danielle. Anna frees Jacob from the panic vest, turning when the little boy addresses Danielle, concealed in the shadows. Danielle admits that she can still "feel" the killer; at this moment Jacob murders Anna with the crowbar she had brought inside as a weapon.  As the credits roll, the viewer enters an unfamiliar kitchen, zooming in on the stove. Jacob appears, turning on an element and placing a pair of scissors on top, in an eerie to an earlier scene.  
Chander Bari
   The Sanyals are a large extended family composed of the nonagenarian grandfather, (Haradhan Banerjee), his son (Ranjit Mallick), daughter-in-law (Laboni Sarkar) who rules over the house like a female Hitler, reincarnated, and their children of whom two, a daughter (Koel Mallick) and son (Rishi Kaushik) live together in a beautiful mansion in Bhawanipur. There seems to be more servants in their house than family members, extending the virtues and parameters of the ideal ‘joint’ family. The film starts with everyone being excited about the return of the elder son (Babul Supriyo) from US, where he had gone for some business related work. However, all hell breaks loose, when he returns with a wife (Rituparna Sengupta) and her child from a former marriage in tow. Her first husband with underworld links was killed in police crossfire. Everyone accepts the new additions to the Sanyal family except the mother-in-law who refuses to even acknowledge her presence. The story revolves around how these two women build bridges to keep the joint family intact, with most of the credit going to the beautiful daughter-in-law who can sing, dance, cook, clean, supervise, nurse and even do matchmaking in her own way – in short, being politically appropriate and offering a perfect celluloid example of a matrimonial ‘bride wanted’ classified ad.  
Chapter 27
 On December 8, 1980, [[Mark David Chapman]] shocked the world by murdering 40-year-old musician and activist, [[John Lennon]], outside [[The Dakota]], his New York apartment building. Chapman's motives were fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character [[Holden Caulfield]] and his similar misadventures in [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''. In one instant, an anonymous, socially awkward and mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of [[The Beatles]], who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome with a desire to kill him, altered the course of the history of music.  A man whose painfully restless mind thrashes about uncontrollably between paranoia, sociopathic lying and delusion is summed up in such character revealing comments as "I'm too vulnerable for a world full of pain and lies" and "Everyone is cracked and broken. You have to find something to fix you. To give you what you need. To make you whole again."  From his lies to cab drivers (identifying himself as The Beatles' sound engineer) to his socially unacceptable behavior around Jude, a young fan he meets outside The Dakota, to his argument with paparazzi photographer Paul, Chapman keeps the psychoses bubbling below the surface as his grasp on reality deteriorates into a completely misguided rage.  
Charlie Wilson's War (film)
 In 1980, Congressman [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] is more interested in partying than legislating, frequently throwing huge galas and staffing his congressional office with young, attractive women. His social life eventually brings about a federal investigation into allegations of his cocaine use, conducted by federal prosecutor [[Rudy Giuliani]] as part of a larger investigation into congressional misconduct. The investigation results in no charge against Charlie.  A friend and romantic interest, [[Joanne Herring]], encourages Charlie to do more to help the [[Pashtun people|Afghan people]], and persuades Charlie to visit the Pakistani leadership. The Pakistanis complain about the inadequate support of the U.S. to oppose the [[Soviet Union]], and they insist that Charlie visit a major Pakistan-based Afghan refugee camp. Charlie is deeply moved by their misery and determination to fight, but is frustrated by the regional CIA personnel's insistence on a low key approach against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Charlie returns home to lead an effort to substantially increase funding to the mujahideen.  As part of this effort, Charlie befriends maverick CIA operative [[Gust Avrakotos]] and his understaffed Afghanistan group to find a better strategy, especially including a means to counter the Soviets' formidable [[Mi-24]] helicopter gunship. This group was composed in part of members of the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]], including a young paramilitary officer named [[Michael G. Vickers|Michael Vickers]]. As a result, Charlie's deft political bargaining for the necessary funding and Avrakotos' careful planning using those resources, such as supplying the guerrillas with [[FIM-92 Stinger]] missile launchers, turns the Soviet occupation into a deadly quagmire with their heavy fighting vehicles being destroyed at a crippling rate. Charlie enlists the support of [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]] for Soviet weapons and consumables, and [[Pakistan]] for distribution of arms.  The CIA's anti-communism budget evolves from $5 million to over $500 million (with the same amount matched by [[Saudi Arabia]]), startling several congressmen. This effort by Charlie ultimately evolves into a major portion of the U.S. foreign policy known as the [[Reagan Doctrine]], under which the U.S. expanded assistance beyond just the mujahideen and began also supporting other anti-communist resistance movements around the world. Charlie states that senior Pentagon official [[Michael Pillsbury]] persuaded President [[Ronald Reagan]] to provide the Stingers to the Afghans.  Charlie follows Gust's guidance to seek support for post-Soviet occupation Afghanistan, but finds no enthusiasm in the government for even the modest measures he proposes. In the end, Charlie receives a major commendation for his support of the U.S. clandestine services, but his pride is tempered by his fears of the [[Blowback (intelligence)|blowback]] his secret efforts could yield in the future and the implications of U.S. disengagement from Afghanistan.

Charlie Bartlett
 The son of a depressed but doting mother ([[Hope Davis]]) and a father who is serving time for [[tax evasion]], wealthy teenager Charlie Bartlett ([[Anton Yelchin]]) who has [[ADHD]]—after being expelled from several private academies for various infractions—enrolls in a public school run by embittered alcoholic Principal Nathan Gardner ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]), who was formerly a history teacher. Unable to fit in with most of his fellow students, Charlie forms an alliance with school bully Murphy Bivens ([[Tyler Hilton]]) and offers him half the proceeds from the sale of a variety of prescription drugs Charlie obtains by feigning physical and emotional symptoms during sessions with different psychiatrists.  Before long, his natural charm and likability positions him as the school's resident therapist, who offers advice within the confines of the boys' bathroom. Charlie's social life noticeably improves as he gains the confidence and admiration of the student body and begins to date the principal's rebellious daughter, Susan ([[Kat Dennings]]).  Complications arise when seriously depressed Kip Crombwell ([[Mark Rendall]]) attempts [[suicide]] by swallowing a handful of [[anti-depressant]]s provided by Charlie. Charlie befriends Kip after having an in-depth conversation with Principal Gardner. Charlie discovers Kip is writing a play about adolescent issues and pitches it to Gardner who is, at first, unsure but agrees when Kip says that it would make him less inclined to attempt suicide again. The students then have trouble with the student lounge; security cameras get installed, and they start a riot.  One day, Charlie comes by Susan's house to pick her up for a date and he gives her a pharmacy bag. Mr. Gardner comes out and, thinking the bag is full of "inappropriate items", attempts to grab Susan's to make her go into the house. Charlie warns Mr. Gardner not to touch Susan, but he pushes Charlie instead. Charlie then punches Gardner as a reflex, and even though he tries to apologize, the principal is not forgiving. Susan and Charlie drive off, and the bag turns out to contain a nicotine gum to help Susan quit smoking cigarettes.  That night, the students are all in the student lounge when the cops arrive. They arrest Charlie for assault, Principal Gardner is fired, and the kids trash the lounge building. Charlie is released, and before the play, stops by Mr. Gardner's house to invite him. Charlie finds Mr. Gardner heavily intoxicated and waving a revolver. They get into a heated argument which culminates in Charlie falling into the pool after attempting to tackle Mr. Gardner, thinking he is about to commit suicide. Mr. Gardner, appearing sober, comes to his senses and dives into the pool to save Charlie and states that he was not attempting to commit suicide because he has too many responsibilities to do such a thing. They talk over their problems about Charlie's father and Susan, and then go to the play. Mr. Gardner takes up his old job as a history teacher again (and is now much happier), and Charlie finally gains the confidence to visit his father in prison (something he had felt uncomfortable about earlier in the film). The film ends with Charlie applying for a summer internship at a psychiatric institute.

Chicago Massacre: Richard Speck
  Growing up in rural Texas, [[Richard Speck]] is abused physically, psychologically and possibly sexually by his stepfather. Becoming a delinquent in his teenage years, Speck is eventually sentenced to psychiatric counseling, which he avoids by hopping a train out of town. Speck subsequently marries a woman named Sissy, who leaves him due to his violent, demeaning mistreatment of her. After the divorce, Speck moves to Chicago, where he makes the acquaintance of a student nurse named Sharon. One night in 1966, an intoxicated Speck, needing money for a trip to New Orleans, breaks into Sharon's [[dormitory]], intent on robbing her and her eight roommates. Speck experiences a [[psychotic break]] during the burglary, and ends up raping and torture-murdering Sharon and seven of the other women; the sole survivor, Sondra Azano, makes it through the night by hiding under a bed.  Speck spends the proceeding days drifting in and out of motels and bars in an inebriated haze, at one point confessing his crimes to a prostitute, who he then assaults. The officers who respond to the disturbance, unaware that Speck is wanted for mass murder, merely confiscate his firearm. Speck winds up in a [[flophouse]], where he attempts suicide by slitting his wrists. Speck survives and is hospitalized. While treating Speck, a physician realizes that he is the killer that the police are looking for after spotting the "Born to Raise Hell" tattoo on Speck's arm.  Speck is placed under arrest, and identified at the hospital by Sondra. Initially given the death penalty for his crimes, Speck's sentence is reduced to 400-1200 years, to be served in the [[Joliet Correctional Center]]. Speck refuses to attend any of his parole hearings, is uncooperative in therapy, and resigns himself to spending the rest of his life behind bars, where he dies of a heart attack in 1991. Four years later, a video of Speck (who has burgeoning breasts due to smuggled female hormones that he has been taking) doing drugs and bantering with his cellmate and lover was leaked. In the footage, the strung out Speck at one point declares, "Hell, if they knew how much fun I was havin' in here, they'd let me loose!"

Chill Out, Scooby-Doo!
 On a climbing expedition in the [[Himalayas]], Professor Jeffries is led by his Sherpa, Pemba, to a high point on a mountain using an ancient tablet. Jeffries is out looking for the [[Yeti|Abominable Snowman]], who lives in the mountains. He's convinced that the Snowman lives close by, but Pemba tells him he won't lead Jeffries anymore, as it would be intruding on the territory of the Abominable Snowman. Jeffries, who seems to care about the Snowman over their safety, decides to cut the rope and continue. As soon as Jeffries fades from view, Pemba sees the outline of a large creature in front of him.  Meanwhile, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]], [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] and [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] are on vacation in [[Paris]]. However, [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] and [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] have not arrived yet, and the gang wonders where they are. Shaggy and Scooby are in a small plane that they think is going to Paris, but is really going to the Himalayas to drop off Alphonse LaFleur, a French hunter and trapper. LaFleur wants to find and kill the Snowman, and is taking Shaggy and Scooby along as bait. LaFleur then locks Shaggy and Scooby up with his equipment, and throws them off the plane. Shaggy, realizing they are not going to Paris, manages to get a quick phone call through to Fred before the phone goes dead. Fred uses the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] on his phone to track them, and then he, Daphne and Velma, head to the Himalayas to find them.  Meanwhile, Shaggy and Scooby manage to land near a small village on the mountain, where Professor Jefferies and Pemba currently are. Jeffries tells Pemba he never should have left him, and that he almost died on the mountain. Many of the other villagers are leaving, fearing the creature and its wrath. Shaggy and Scooby go to the High Lama to ask for a phone to call their friends. The High Lama, a strange person, tells them there is only a phone on the [[weather station]] nearby. The High Lama is uneasy about letting them go in, but lets them. In the room is a statue of the Snowman holding a very large [[crystal]], which the High Lama says it protects the villagers from the Abominable Snowman's powers. They then meet Pemba's sister Minga, who has decided to stay in the village. Minga constantly listens to the radio, and has a crush on the DJ from the station that she's listening to. Pemba tells her to leave the village, and he, Shaggy, Scooby and Jeffries (who says that everyone should stick together), decide to go to the weather station. LaFleur arrives, and decides to accompany them.  As they travel, Minga runs up to them and says that she heard on the radio that a big storm is approaching. Shaggy wonders how there could be any radio reception so high up, and Pemba tells him there isn't, as it's just the weather station man pretending to be a DJ. Pemba realizes that Minga has a crush on the weatherman and deduces that she's just tagging along with them as an excuse to meet him. Minga denies this, and explains that there really is a storm coming. Everyone looks up and sees a dark cloud, and they decide to set up camp to wait out the storm. During the night, Jeffries gets out of his tent and leaves with his sled, which is filled with [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and other explosives. Some time later, the Snowman attacks Shaggy and Scooby. LaFleur tries to capture the Snowman, but all his traps backfire on the Snowman, instead working on him. Scooby and Shaggy manage to lose the Snowman but get lost themselves. However, they are relieved to see a snowplow approach them. In the snowplow is [[Scooby-Doo! and the Loch Ness Monster|Del Chillman]], whom the gang had met before. Del takes them to the weather station, where he works. Chillman tells them he decided to take the job so he could find out if the legend of the creature is true. He also reveals that he's the DJ/weatherman. He had the radio just to do weather reports, but plays songs to pass the time.  Meanwhile, Fred, Daphne and Velma get to the village and see it is deserted. They follow Shaggy’s tracks and see where the party camped the night before, and also the footprints of the Snowman. Velma notes that they are not very deep in the snow. They find Pemba, who was caught by one of LaFleur's traps. Minga is nowhere to be found and Jeffries is still gone, so the gang decides to split up and search for everyone else. At the weather station, Del goes out to look for the others. Once he leaves, the Snowman appears and attacks Shaggy and Scooby. As they run away, LaFleur shows up and tries to capture the creature, but falls of a cliff, apparently to his death. Scooby and Shaggy manage to escape and find their way to the lost kingdom of Shangri-La, but are pursued by the Snowman.  Del catches up to the rest of the gang, but finds the weather station destroyed and some [[helium]] tanks missing. As Scooby and Shaggy walk around the city, the Abominable Snowman appears and chases them. Daphne and Pemba find a large cave and go inside, and conclude that is where the Snowman lives. They also find an empty helium case. Shaggy and Scooby lose the Snowman again, and everyone meets up in an old [[Mining|mine]], each coming from a different direction. There, they see Jeffries mining for lots of crystals like the one on the Yeti statue. They conclude he is the Snowman and capture him, although he denies it. Then the Snowman appears and chases everyone, while Jeffries gets free and follows them. The Snowman chases Shaggy, Scooby, and Jeffries down the mountain. Jeffries attempts to get the crystals  in the mine cart that Scooby and Shaggy are riding in. The rest of the gang prepares a trap for the Snowman, but Shaggy, Scooby and Jeffries get caught in it. The High Lama comes out to see what happened. Then an [[avalanche]] starts, and almost crushes Velma and Del, but the Snowman saves them at the last moment. The Snowman is revealed to be Minga, who has been behind the mystery from the very beginning. She used the helium to fly, which caused the footprints to not be as deep. Minga confesses that she did it so that Del wouldn't stop broadcasting his radio show (also her way of admitting that she has feelings for Del). Del's touched by what Minga says, and finds it romantic. Jeffries is taken to jail because he was taking the crystals for his own gain. The gang wonders if there really is a Snowman, but then LaFleur appears and tells them that something saved him from his fall and brought him to the village (assumably the real Snowman).  The gang, along with Del and Minga (who are now boyfriend and girlfriend), return to Paris for their vacation. Unfortunately, Fred gets on the wrong plane and somehow ends up in the Amazon. The others go to find Fred, with Daphne complaining, "I'd like to have a vacation that actually ''stays'' a vacation.".

Just then, Sanjana's father comes in a helicopter. Seeing her dad, she runs to him and tells him not to hit Charan as he did not kidnap her but saved her. At first Sanjana's father tells to leave him, and the goons leave him, but when Sanjana tells him that she wants and loves him, her father tells the goons to kill him. The goons hit Charan on the head, he falls down, and they go away. Then, a member of the company for which Charan works searches for him on a boat, finds him, and takes him back.

He tells Biku to kidnap Sanjana, and Biku does the same when the exchange of Sanjana and Charan's mother goes. In the process, gunfire takes place where Sanjana's father's men get shot. Charan also retaliates with a gun and kills some of Biku's men, but Biku gets away with Sanjana. Sanjana's father gets shot in the leg, and in emotion ,tells Charan that he saw how much he loves his mother and screams that someone is taking away his fiancé away, so he reminds him to go and get her.

The goons take Charan with hands tied to an island where Mattu Bhai and Biku are there.  Mattu Bhai, without killing him and Sanjana, as suggested by his son Biku, lets them escape saying he would hunt them, but Charan kills all of Mattu Bhai's men and finally kills Biku.

Ann and her father ([[Lalu Alex]]) share a very friendly and open relationship. Her mother is no more. Nandana's two older siblings had love marriages that her father didn't approve of. Therefore, he sends her to the all-girls college in order to avoid her falling in love with another boy. After 50 years, the college can be opened up for men as well. When the principal asks for this change, the parents (and the trio) strongly disagree, and thus the college is kept as an all-girls college.  However, one seat in the PG courses is open to a boy and thus enters Shyam ([[Prithviraj Sukumaran|Prithiviraj]]), who has earned himself 9 suspensions from 3 other colleges. The trio immediately dislikes his entrance to their world. In his first day, Shyam encounters a few mishaps like an encounter with Maxi pads and having to use the ladies [[restroom]]. Meanwhile, there is a designer named Ranjith (Jayasurya), who is after Nandhana to be a model in his Femina show. The trio rags Shyam into wearing ladies' petticoat, as there is a rule that says "all students must wear a petticoat," which earns both Ann & Shyam a suspension for 15 days.  After the 15 days, when they both return to school, Ann tricks Shyam into running for the chairperson position against Preetha, a student that is much loved and the trio's nemesis. When Shyam finds out, he gets angry with Ann. However, he takes it all in good humor and befriends the trio. He decides to keep running for the chairperson position. Hearing this Preetha resigns and Shyam wins. Shyam and Ann mutually start liking each other but never express their love for each other.  Meanwhile, Ann's dad finds a guy for Ann and asks her to meet the boy at a hotel. Ann spoils it by acting like a traditional and naive girl who stammers when she speaks. However, the guy comes to know the truth and takes it all as a joke, and the marriage is fixed between him and Ann at a party. Later that night, Ann admits to her dad that she's in love with Shyam. Her dad tells her that if Shyam admits his love to her first, then he'll accept them. If not, she agrees that she will marry whoever her father chooses for her.  Meanwhile, Shyam goes to Ann's fiancé's house, drunk, and tells him that he and Ann are in love. Ann finds out and when she questions Shyam about it; he says it is because he was trying to save her from a marriage she doesn't like. Ranjith admits to Shyam that he's in love with Nandana as well.  Meanwhile, after some months later, the Youth Festival is taking place in Ernakulam and the college has a chance to participate in it. Shyam is chosen to lead the show. He brings in Renjith and his other friends in the college to help out with the show. At the rehearsal of a play for the Youth Festival, Ann takes a few pictures of Shyam and Nandana rehearsing together. Nandhana's father receives these pictures and he sends people to beat up Shyam, but Shyam manages to beat them. He then gets mad at Ann, since he believes she sent those pictures to Nandhana's father. In his outburst, he also admits that he liked Ann. Nandhana is also mad at Ann and moves out of their room.  On one of the days of the Youth Festival, Nandhana's father receives more photos of her with Shyam and comes to the college to hurt him. Nandhana's mother calls her and informs her, so she searches for Shyam and ends up at the hotel room that they used to store costumes and such for the festival. The police come and arrest them for human trafficking. However, another officer sets them free as he believes them to be innocent, but as they come out of the police station, the press is there and the story is published in the newspaper.  Nandhana's father and Shyam's mother expects the two to get married now. Also, posters and such are put up all over the college making fun of Nandhana and Shyam. The PTA is called for a meeting, and it is revealed by Ann and Susanna that it was Preetha who send the pictures to Nandhana's father and informed the police as she had feelings for Shyam and felt cheated when he showed more attention to Ann. At the meeting, it is also revealed that Ranjith and Nandhana are married, and Nandhana's father accepts the couples.  The trio once again become friends, but Ann refuses to make up with Shyam because in her mind he'll never understand her. Finally, during the play, a semi-drunk Shyam and Ann ends up together after a lengthy and beautiful dialogue from Shyam.  
Chop Shop (film)
 ''Chop Shop'' tells the story of Alejandro "Ale" (Alejandro Polanco), a 12-year-old Latino street orphan from [[Queens, New York]]. The film opens with Ale waiting by a roadside with several other men for work. A man in pickup truck arrives looking for two workers. He tells Ale that he is not needed but Ale jumps into the back of the truck anyway. After realizing that Ale is in the back, he stops the truck and sends Ale on his way with some money for breakfast. Ale spends rest of the day selling chocolate and candy to passengers on trains with his friend Carlos (Carlos Zapata). After they finish selling the candy, Carlos informs Ale that Rob (Rob Sowulski), the owner of an auto repair shop in [[Willets Point, Queens|Willets Point]], is looking for new workers.  Ale soon begins working at the repair shop, which Rob has also allowed him to live in. He is soon joined by his sister Isamar ("Izzy", played by Isamar Gonzales) who he finds work for in a food van that sells food to workers on the street. Ale later finds a van being sold by Carlos' uncle that he believes he can fix up and turn into his and Izzy's own food van business. The two begin saving their money to buy the $4,500 van. One night, Ale and Carlos go to the nearby [[truck stop]] to see the [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] working. There they discover that Isamar is working as a prostitute.

She then scares them away and they go flying up into the sky.  
Chris & Don
 ''Chris & Don'' tells the story of a romance that began on the [[beaches of Santa Monica]] in the 1950s,  when Christopher Isherwood at age 48 met Don Bachardy who then was eighteen years old. Isherwood, an established author with works such as ''[[The Berlin Stories]]'', which helped inspire much of ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'', helped Bachardy discover and develop his affinity for drawing and painting as he became a renowned portrait painter during the second half of the 20th century to the present. The documentary includes insight from friends, including [[Liza Minnelli]] and [[John Boorman]], who tell of the countless struggles the two faced as one of the first openly gay couples in [[Hollywood]]. Despite the age difference, the couple endured until Isherwood succumbed to prostate cancer in 1986.  
Chill (film)
 The film was based on [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s "[[Cool Air]]".<ref>According to DVD case.</ref> Similar plot elements include the fact that the doctor in the film (played by Shaun Kurtz) is named Dr. Muñoz as in Lovecraft's story, and must live in refrigerated conditions in order to survive. There is also a mention of the [[Necronomicon]] in the film; while this does not occur in Lovecraft's "Cool Air", it does serve in the movie as a clue to its Lovecraftian inspiration. Part of the plot hinges on the refrigeration system breaking down, again as in the Lovecraft story. Physically, the character of Dr Muñoz in the film does not resemble the character described in Lovcecraft's story, nor does he speak with a Spanish accent.  Overall, however, the plot of the movie moves away from the Lovecraft story in depicting Muñoz as the controller of a [[serial killer]] preying on prostitutes. Muñoz lives in the back of a deli which he runs, and the protagonist Sam ([[Thomas Calabro]]), a writer who comes to work at the deli for survival money, gets dragged into the web of killings. Sam also falls in love with a woman named Maria ([[Ashley Laurence]]) who runs a clothing stores across the street and is being threatened by a local cop, Detective Defazio ([[James Russo]]), whom she dated once.  The DVD packaging for the Australian release through Flashback Entertainment does not feature Lovecraft's name anywhere, though the American packaging indicates that Lovecraft's tale inspired the movie. The film is omitted from Charles P. Mitchell's otherwise fairly comprehensive ''The Complete H.P. Lovecraft Filmography'' (Greenwood Press, 2001), possibly because the makers of ''Chill'' did not overtly capitalise on Lovecraft's name.  The ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' summarizes the plot as "Let's just say someone dies but cheats Death by harvesting flesh and dabbling in the occult."<ref>Allan Walton, "[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07122/782697-390.stm 'Chill,' people]," ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (May 02, 2007).</ref>

She uses the wand to expand the slipper so that it can fit Anastasia, and the Grand Duke declares she must be the girl the Prince is looking for. Cinderella arrives on the scene too late, and Lady Tremaine destroys Cinderella's other slipper – the only clue to her identity that she was the girl who danced with the Prince on the night of the ball. Cinderella decides to follow Lady Tremaine and her stepsisters to the palace with Jaq and Gus.  At first the Prince claims Anastasia is not the girl he danced with at the ball, but Lady Tremaine uses the wand to alter his memory, and he accepts Anastasia as his bride. Jaq and Gus witness this and inform Cinderella that Lady Tremaine has the Fairy Godmother's wand. Cinderella poses as a maid to get into the Tremaines' room, but she is spotted by Lady Tremaine and captured by the palace guards as an intruder. Cinderella briefly touches the Prince's hand and he begins to recognize her, but Lady Tremaine orders Cinderella placed on the next ship out of the kingdom. The mice find the Prince and explain the whole story to him, and he rides off to intercept the ship just as it leaves port. The Prince embraces Cinderella and his true memories return. He asks her to marry him, and she accepts.  The Prince brings Cinderella back to the palace and explains everything to the King and the Grand Duke. The King orders the Tremaines arrested, but they escape using the wand. As Cinderella prepares for her wedding, Lady Tremaine emerges with Anastasia, who has been magically transformed into a doppelgänger of Cinderella. Lady Tremaine then transports Cinderella, Jaq and Gus into the castle grounds, where they are to be taken to their deaths in a twisted pumpkin carriage with Lucifer as its human driver, but they manage to defeat Lucifer and escape, leaving Lucifer stranded in the woods.  Cinderella races to the castle as the vows are about to be exchanged. At the last moment, Anastasia's conscience gets the best of her and she turns the Prince down. Lady Tremaine and Drizella reveal themselves in their anger. The King orders the Tremaines arrested, but Lady Tremaine uses the wand to fend off the guards, turning them into animals. During the scuffle the wand's magic is deflected, and Lady Tremaine and Drizella are turned into toads and transported to the castle cellar. Retrieving the wand, Anastasia reverts herself to her original form, and Cinderella restores the Fairy Godmother. The Fairy Godmother offers to reverse the timeline to its original state, but Cinderella and the Prince decline. The pair are married and live happily ever after "again".  In a mid-credits scene, Lady Tremaine and Drizella are turned back into their original selves, but dressed up as maids, much to their horror.

She also says the same thing to "Rudolph" the reindeer and Brian tells her that if she wanders off again, The "Mall Ghost" will eat her. They then go to the skating rink.  Meanwhile, Leonard Cardoza ([[Chris Kattan]]) and Sheldon Cardoza ([[Preston Lacy]]) are talking about using counterfeit money to get real money in exchange. They have a whole bag full of it. In an argument, Leo accidentally knocks the bag off the ledge and into the skating rink. Brian and Mary find it and not knowing that it is phoney money, leave to buy themselves stuff. Mary thinks Santa gave her this as an early present. Ginger ([[Carmen Electra]]) goes to the Cardoza brothers and gets mad at them for losing the bag. The Cardoza's go to the rink to find the kids but they have already left. They then have a montage of trying to find them in different places even though they are right beneath their noses. The kids buy a motorcycle while Wayne is having a tough time buying a gift for his wife who is still in LA after getting bumped. In the backroom, Gordon McLoosh ([[Tim Curry]]) from the RCMP comes to investigate the case of how counterfeit money is appearing all over the mall with the story of two kids claiming that they won the lottery. They find an address where they wanted the motorcycle to be delivered. They go to the home and think, with all the unpacked boxes everywhere, they are going the move (which is odd, considering they just got there). They find a family photo and use it as evidence.

Brian and Mary are spending counterfeit money, Wayne is being unknowingly tracked down for nothing and is having troubles buying gifts, Danny can't find Brain or Mary at Santa's Village, and the Cardozas are trying to find them. However, Danny goes to a roller coaster to find them and finally meets the girl at the water park and she invites him to some [[Booster Juice]].

At the Los Angeles Airport, Judy Saunders ([[Rachel Hayward]]), the wife, is stuck waiting for her plane. There, she meets Kristopher Kringle (Same actor who plays Santa) who informs her that he got bumped too and that she shouldn't worry because "things always work themselves out one way or another". He then leaves to his plane and shocks Judy after he knows her name.  After leaving the bar, Wayne gets arrested by McLoosh but even though he explains that he is innocent, McLoosh thinks otherwise. Brian and Mary witness this and after Brian explains what happened to Mary, the Cardozas finally catch up to them and chase them. The kids bump into Ginger but Brian finds out that the Cardozas work for Ginger and run away again. Elsewhere, Wayne is getting interrogated but still has no idea what is going on. Brian and Mary dodge the Cardozas and ditch the bag on a mannequin. They lead the Cardozas into the back hallways of the mall. Brian and Mary get scared after seeing the shadow of a wolf and get locked in another room with Leonard. Mary runs one way and Brian runs the other. Leonard goes for Brian. Brian leads him up stairs to where they feed the sharks and Leonard is right behind him. But Brian is one step ahead as he covered the floor with slippery fish and Leonard falls into the shark tank. Brian leaves the back hallways and runs right into Danny. Brian explains the whole situation to him and then find Mary being taken care of by The Mall Ghost (Same actor as Kristopher Kringle) but once they leave, Brian and Mary get left behind a little and see Danny and Shane get arrested. Now, the fate of their Christmas is in the hands of Brian and Mary. They must get revenge on Leonard and Sheldon. The Cardozas meet up with Ginger again to say they haven't retrieved the bag yet. She is furious and tells them to go find them with a no holds barred as Brian motorcycles by with it. The chase starts as the Cardozas and Brian chase each other on the motorcycles. Mary from above, drops a water balloon on Ginger and she starts chasing Mary. Brian makes them dive through a clothing kiosk and covers Leonard's face so he is now blindly driving. Mary goes back into the hallways and lures Ginger onto the roof. After a sharp turn, the Cardozas break a window and fall into the water park. On the roof, Mary tricks Ginger into going on a cracked window dome and Ginger falls through but just slightly grabs the ledge preventing her from falling into the water where the sea lions are performing. This catches the eye of McLoosh and his agents get suspicious. Mary throws the money down and when she hits below the agents arrest her. Just when the agents find out that the money is the counterfeit, mall security bring the Cardozas to McLoosh. The Saunders family gets released and Wayne is very upset at Danny for leaving Mary with Brian. On their way out, they walk into Sam Nichols (Same actor as Mall Ghost) who owns the mall. He says that he is willing to give Wayne a job. At home, they forgot about getting a tree, presents, or anything. The next morning, Judy was able to get home before Christmas and the kids marvel as they see presents. The turkey is even ready. Mary gets a letter from Santa saying that he is the one responsible for everything. The movie ends with Mary waving at Santa from the window. Proving that Christmas miracles do happen.

Nagisa is repeating her last year due to illness most of the previous year, and she does not know what to do. Tomoya suggests she finds something new to do at school, and she comes up with restarting the Drama Club. By the time the [[sakura]] trees are done blooming, Nagisa has already started hand-making posters advertising the drama club's reformation, with an old group mascot called "The Big Dango Family". Tomoya and his good friend [[List of Clannad characters#Youhei Sunohara|Youhei Sunohara]], who used to play soccer, help Nagisa with putting them up around the school, but the student council president, [[List of Clannad characters#Tomoyo Sakagami|Tomoyo Sakagami]], and [[List of Clannad characters#Kyou Fujibayashi|Kyou Fujibayashi]], quickly goes around using red paint to deface the posters and write 'invalid' on them because of school policy.

[[List of Clannad characters#Kouko Ibuki|Kouko Ibuki]], the teacher who had been the adviser for the drama club before it disbanded, gets involved by telling Nagisa that if she can gather more members then she will talk to the school about reforming the club.

He finds a discarded human-sized doll and uses it as a body to travel around the world on an old bicycle. After some searching, he finds a large sakura tree known as the "Tree of Promises" where he believes he will meet the person he has felt is with him in this illusionary world.  When the school festival finally begins, Nagisa reveals that she has not finished the script, but still wants to go on with the play since the story is still within her. Nagisa has her performance in the evening, so in the meantime Nagisa hangs out with Tomoya and Youhei. During lunch, she tells them her story why she wanted to do drama was due to her parents formally having been theater actors, but they both had to give up acting after Nagisa was born. Nagisa wants to do drama so as to continue her parents' dreams in her footsteps. For the play, Sanae gives Nagisa her wedding dress to use as her costume, much to Akio's surprise. Nagisa starts with her monologue without a hitch, and during her recitation Kouko gives stage directions to Tomoya and Youhei via headsets. Gradually, Tomoya comes to realize that the story Nagisa is reciting is the same dream that he has had, and is shocked to find that Nagisa also had the same dream of the illusionary world. At the play's conclusion, Tomoya believes that he and Nagisa were meant to be together and confesses his love to her.  Shortly after the festival, Nagisa's health falters once again and she has to take another leave of absence from school, meaning it is not until a year after Tomoya's class graduated that Nagisa is able to graduate high school as well. After this, Tomoya and Nagisa start living together in a small apartment in town while Tomoya is recruited full-time at Yusuke's electrical company as well, Nagisa works part-time as a waitress at a local family restaurant, and Youhei becomes a businessman in Tokyo. Eventually, Nagisa becomes pregnant, but her doctor informs her family and Tomoya that if she gives birth to the child, due to having weak constitution, she may die in the process. After the meeting, they agree on telling Nagisa. Tomoya and Nagisa's parents take her to the beach where she decides the name [[List of Clannad characters#Ushio Okazaki|Ushio]] for the child. Despite the doctors warning, she insists that she will be fine. One winter night, Nagisa finally gives birth to a baby girl Ushio and Nagisa dies giving birth. This causes Tomoya to go into deep depression, during which he does not go to work, or even visit his daughter who is now being raised by Nagisa's parents.  For the past five years, Tomoya's friends try to get him out of his depression, but Tomoya is very stubborn. Then one rainy night, Tomoya's father [[List of Clannad characters#Naoyuki Okazaki|Naoyuki Okazaki]] comes over and tells Tomoya that he is putting Ushio in the same relationship he did when his mother died, which greatly surprises him. Later, Naoyuki requested Tomoya's friends: Youhei, Tomoyo, Kyou, Kouko and her husband Yusuke to take him out on a retreat for a few days in order to break his depression, and they take Tomoya out of his house so fast he does not even know what is going on. Once they tell him on the train, Tomoya is dead set on going back home but Yusuke convinces him to stay. When they arrive at their destination, Tomoya searches for another platform at the station, anticipating this, Akio and Sanae were waiting for him with Ushio. Just as Tomoya begins to walk away, his friends arrive blocking his way, then Tomoya turns around back at Ushio, she runs towards him holding a stuffed dango.

When he corners Julie, Breckel's girlfriend, he is confronted by Conrad, who shoots him several times after talking briefly about McStarley's past. Conrad grabs McStarley's two machine guns and chases down Breckel, who is fleeing the island in a helicopter. After emptying the two guns firing at the helicopter, he is given McStarley's re-activated ankle bomb by Julie. Conrad throws it into the helicopter, and Breckel reaches for it, however, the helicopter explodes, and crashes into a cliff, killing Breckel and bringing his vicious game to an end.

The film ends with Conrad smiling slowly.  
The Comebacks
  Coach Lambeau Fields ([[David Koechner]]) is pathetic. He has the distinction of being the worst coach in the history of sports anyone can recall. A loser of enormous proportions, the incompetent and seemingly hopeless coach is convinced by fellow coach Freddie Wiseman ([[Carl Weathers]]) to return to the field for one last shot. Assuring his long suffering wife, Barb ([[Melora Hardin]]), that he will not ignore his family, Coach moves them to Plainfolk, Texas where he hopes to redeem himself and his reputation. Here he begins yet another attempt to improve his abysmal record - this time as the coach of the football team at Heartland State University. But he is saddled with a team of misfits - most of whom don't know the difference between a line of scrimmage and a line at the cafeteria.  Although the team and townsfolk are leery of the newcomer's approach, the Coach uses his unorthodox methods to whip this group of rag-tags into shape - both on and off the field. While the audience follows their winding road to the playoffs, the film pokes fun at the clichés and conventions of other sports flicks. The team does make progress, so much so that they actually make it to the South-Southwest Conference Championship at the 2nd Annual Toilet Bowl.  Facing their fiercest opponents yet and yearning to win the big game, The Comebacks face off with the Lone Star State Unbeatables. And as every great sports team has always done, The Comebacks use ingenuity and unorthodox measures in the final showdown where the best team win. The Comebacks are victorious, but Lambeau is subsequently knocked down in a surprise attack by a bus with Freddie driving it, who laughs manically as Lambeau is in pain. Lambeau groans in agony.

Some years earlier, Dial had been seconds away from taking down notorious terrorist cell leader Ali Mahmoud Jahar (Nikolay Sotirov) but his carelessness allowed Jahar to escape, marking his assignment as a failure.  Now Collins wants Dial to complete his task by assassinating Jahar, who has been captured and is now in the custody of the [[Metropolitan Police Service|police]] in London, England. Provided with a safe house, passports, and an assistant, Terry Winchell (Richard Harrington), Dial is off to London to complete unfinished business. Disguised as a priest, Dial gets into position in a church bell tower across the street from the building that Jahar is being brought into. When Jahar is brought out of the police van, his head is covered by a jacket, leaving Dial without a clean shot. Not wanting to fail again, Dial patiently waits for his opportunity.  Moments later, from his high vantage point, Dial spots Jahar standing inside the building with his back to the window. Dial grasps the opportunity and shoots through the glass, fatally hitting Jahar in back of his head.

The Counterfeiters (2007 film)
 The film begins shortly after the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], with a man arriving in [[Monte Carlo]]. After checking into an expensive hotel and paying with cash, he takes in the high life of Monte Carlo, successfully gambling in a [[casino]] and attracting the attention of a beautiful French woman. Later, she discovers [[Identification in Nazi camps|tattooed numerals]] on his arm, revealing him as a survivor of the [[Nazi concentration camp]]s.  The film then flashes back to Berlin in 1936, where the man, [[Salomon Smolianoff|Salomon Sorowitsch]], is revealed as a successful [[forgery|forger]] of currency and [[passport]]s. Caught by the police, he is imprisoned, first in a [[labor camp|labour camp]], then in [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen concentration camp]] near [[Linz]]. In an effort to secure himself protection and meagre comforts at the camp, he turns his forging skills to portraiture, attracting the attention of the guards, who commission him to paint them and their families in exchange for extra food rations.  Sorowitsch's talents bring him wider attention, and he is transferred out of the concentration camp. Brought in front of the police officer who arrested him in Berlin, he finds himself put together with other prisoners with artistic or printing talents, and begins working in a special section of the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] devoted to forgery. The counterfeiters are kept in relatively humane conditions, with comfortable bunks, a washroom and adequate food, although their guards continue to subject them to brutality and insults. His fellow prisoners have a range of backgrounds from Jewish bank managers to political agitators, and while some are content to work for the Nazis to avoid the [[extermination camp]]s, others see their efforts as supporting the German war effort.  At first, self-preservation appears to guide Sorowitsch, but his motives for forging for the Nazis are complicated by his growing concern for his fellow prisoners, his awareness of their role in the wider war against the Nazis, and his professional pride in counterfeiting the US dollar, a currency he was previously unable to forge.  Sorowitsch juggles the Nazi demands for progress, his co-counterfeiters' determination to [[sabotage]] the operation, and his loyalties to his fellow prisoners. The prisoners successfully counterfeit the [[British pound]] but intentionally delay the forgery of the US dollar. Gradually, the inmates discern slivers of evidence that the war has turned decidedly against the Nazis. One day the camp guards suddenly announce that the printing machines are to be dismantled and shipped away, which leads the counterfeiters to fear that they will finally be killed. Before anything happens to them, the German guards flee the camp in advance of the [[Red Army]]. Starving prisoners from other parts of the camp, armed with confiscated weapons, take over and break into the compound where the counterfeiters had been held in relative luxury. Until the insurrectionists see the well-fed printers' prison tattoos, they believe them to be [[SS]] officers and threaten to shoot them. The counterfeiters then must account for their forging actions to the half-dead prisoners.  The film then returns to post-war Monte Carlo, where Sorowitsch, apparently disgusted by the life he is now leading on the currency that he forged for the Nazis, intentionally gambles it all away. Sitting alone afterward on the beach, he is joined by the French woman, concerned after his seemingly disastrous losses at the table. Dancing slowly together on the beach, she continues to remark on all the money he has lost, to which he replies, laughing, "We can always make more".

At their trial, Spence and Hogan use the questionable yet free services of their friend who has now passed the bar exam. The judge ([[Carolyn Hennesy]]) asks to see them in her chambers. With their lawyer momentarily outside, Hogan contends to running a legit dating service as a true cougar fan. She considers acquitting them if Spence proves he feels like Hogan. Wearing revealing clothes under her robe, she kisses Spence. He goes along with it and they make out right on her desk.  Spence invites the lawyer's wife to a new party.

Crazy (2007 film)
 ''Crazy'' is the story of a legendary guitar player who emerged from Nashville in the 1950s. Blessed with incomparable, natural talent, [[Hank Garland]] quickly established his reputation as the finest sessions player in Nashville. Artists such as [[Roy Orbison]], [[Patsy Cline]], [[The Everly Brothers]], and [[Elvis Presley]] all sought Hank’s brilliant playing for their recordings. Moving effortlessly from country, to rock-a-billy, to jazz, Hank was also quickly recognized by the likes of [[Dave Brubeck]], [[Gary Burton]], [[Joe Morello]], and [[Joe Benjamin]].  The Nashville scene was a unique place in the 50’s – dominated by a small group of executives and musicians who controlled the studios, labels and unions. Hank, in his arrogance and pursuit of musical excellence, often came into conflict with the business, social and racial culture he found both restrictive and frequently frustrating.  Some people say that a near-fatal car accident, which Hank suffered, was a result of tragic response to dreams unfulfilled. Others will say that the subsequent electro-shock therapy, which was ordered by his doctors, may have contributed to ending Hank’s playing career at the age of thirty-one.

Croc (film)

Jack McQuade (Peter Tuinstra) runs a [[crocodile]] farm in Thailand with the help of his nephew Theo (Scott Hazell) and Jack's sister (and Theo's mother) Allison (Elizabeth Healey). Jack is being constantly harassed by a new neighboring resort owned by the Konsong brothers. They want to get Jack shut down because they have buildings on the land and want to steal the rest. The Konsong brothers set animal welfare, bill collectors, and tax collectors on the farm. As animal welfare investigator Evelyn Namwong (Sherry Phungprasert) refuses to shut down the farm, having found only minor violations, she is fired. After two teenagers are eaten by a crocodile, the Konsongs send goons to break in and release three of the farm's crocodiles. Jack's crocodiles are blamed and he gets orders to shut down until further notice.  The beast that killed the teens reappears and eats a young boy near the docks. Its filmed by a tourist nearby and identified as a 20-foot [[salt water crocodile]]. Being much much larger and of a different species than Jack's, his farm's name is cleared and he is able to reopen.  With the beast continuing to snack on the local population, Jack and Evelyn run into Hawkins ([[Michael Madsen]]), a man who has been hunting it for months to get revenge for its many victims. They join forces to find and kill the beast. While they are talking, they hear gunfire and  two hunters claiming to have killed the beast which is actually one of Jack's escaped crocs. They quickly rush over, only to see the real beast kill one of the hunters.  While they hunt the beast, the Konsongs send someone to kill Allison, who paid his taxes and other bills to help him out. The goon tries to run her down, but misses. He leaves behind his cell phone which links him back to Andy Konsong.  Andy heads home to warn his brother that their plot has been uncovered, only to find pieces of him floating in a bloodied pool. The beast was in the pool when he was swimming and killed him. Panicked, Andy calls 911, but then gets sick to his stomach. While he's throwing up in the pool, the beast emerges and kills him.  When Evelyn, Jack, Hawkins, and the crocodile farm manager go looking for the beast's pit, Allison and Theo follow in a small boat. The beast appears and snatches Allison from the boat, much to Theo's horror. Jack and the rest of the team continue searching for the pit underwater while Hawkins and Theo go to search on land. They find the pit and, to their relief, Allison, who is unconscious but still alive. She wakes up to find the beast with its jaws right in front of her head, but it leaves when it hears Jack calling for her. It comes up behind Jack, gets a hold of his foot, and drags him underwater.

Crows Zero
 Newly transferred high school senior Genji Takiya ([[Shun Oguri]]) arrives at Suzuran All-Boys High School, an institution infamous for its population of violent [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquents]]. During the freshman orientation assembly, yakuza arrive at the school seeking vengeance on third-year Serizawa Tamao ([[Takayuki Yamada]]) for assaulting some members of their gang. The thugs mistake Genji for their target and a brawl ensues on the school field. Meanwhile, Serizawa is visiting his best friend Tatsukawa Tokio (Kenta Kiritani), who has just been discharged from a hospital. Upon returning to the school, Serizawa witnesses Genji defeat the last of the yakuza.  That night, Genji goes a nightclub he frequents and meets R&B singer Aizawa Ruka ([[Meisa Kuroki]]). He then goes to see his father, yakuza boss Takiya Hideo ([[Goro Kishitani]]), to whom he proclaims his ambition to conquer Suzuran, a feat which Hideo himself had attempted in his youth, but failed. Genji makes Hideo promise to acknowledge him as his successor should he succeed. The next day, Genji challenges Serizawa to a fight, but is halted by Tokio. He tells Genji that if he really wants to make an impression he should begin by defeating Rindaman, a legendary fighter at the school. After Rindaman refuses his challenge, Genji encounters Katagiri Ken (Kyosuke Yabe), one of the yakuza who'd come to the school the previous day. He attacks Genji in retaliation for getting his gang arrested, but is taken down with a single punch. Humbled, Ken goes with Genji to the club where they discuss the latter's plans for Suzuran.  Following advice from Ken, Genji begins building his army, called "Genji Perfect Seiha" (a.k.a. "GPS"). Anticipating the brewing conflict, Serizawa also begins recruiting factions for his own cause. Genji succeeds in rallying several strong members, including Tamura Chūta, Makise Takashi, and Izaki Shun. Serizawa is alarmed by Genji's rapid rise to power, but chooses not to take action. One of Serizawa's lieutenants, Tokaji Yūji, is not so ambivalent and begins covertly attacking members of the GPS, severely beating Chūta and putting Izaki in the hospital. The provocations cause tensions between the two armies to rise drastically, but Genji is prevented from acting by Makise. One night, Tokio and Serizawa visit the nightclub and encounter Genji. As Tokio runs interference between the opposing leaders, he suffers a seizure and is rushed to a hospital, where he learns that he has a [[cerebral aneurysm]] which requires surgery. Despite initial hesitation about the procedure's 30% success rate, Tokio agrees to the operation.  Tokaji approaches Bandō Hideto, leader of "The Front of Armament" biker gang, with a plan to kidnap Ruka and further aggravate Genji. Elsewhere, yakuza boss Yazaki Jōji orders Ken to kill Genji, disregarding the fact that doing so will incite a war between the yakuza organizations. The task proves to be too much for Ken, who has grown fond of Genji and begins lamenting his decision to become a yakuza in the first place. He decides to inform Takiya Hideo of the plot to kill his son. Genji gets a call from Ruka, who tells him that she is being held hostage by men with skulls on their jackets, and that her captors mentioned the name "Bandō". Surmising that her captors are The Armament, Genji gathers the GPS and proceeds to the biker gang's headquarters. A fight ensues, but Genji soon realizes that the men they are fighting are missing their trademark skull patches. Bandō demands an end to fight, revealing that he'd ordered the skulls be removed after part of The Armament aligned with Tokaji. After locating Tokaji and saving Ruka, Genji decides it's finally time for war against Serizawa. They decide to fight at 5:00pm the following day, at the same time that Tokio will undergo his operation, with Serizawa believing it will allow him to fight alongside Tokio.  The next day, as the battle begins, the tide seems to be in Serizawa's favor, but after Bandō's faction of The Armament arrives and joins the GPS, the odds are evened out. The fighting continues until only Serizawa and Genji are left standing. Meanwhile, Ken is taken to the harbor to be executed for disobeying the order to kill Genji. Yazaki gives Ken his coat as a parting gift before shooting him in the back. He falls into the water and begins to sink. Genji and Serizawa fight well into the night, and though injured and exhausted, Genji eventually gains the upper hand and triumphs. Clinging to consciousness, Serizawa receives a call from the hospital informing him that Tokio's operation was a success. Back at the docks, Ken suddenly recovers and swims to the surface. He discovers that the coat Yazaki had given to him was bulletproof, and that his "execution" was a ploy to allow him to leave the organization and live a different life.  Several days later, Genji again challenges Rindaman, the final obstacle on his path to ruling Suzuran. Rindaman expresses his belief that Suzuran can never be truly conquered, and that there will always be someone left to fight. The film ends as the skirmish between Genji and Rindaman begins.

His children have been cared for by their maternal grandmother, Kat, for years, but she dies of lung cancer. Before her death, Kat asks Monty to take custody of his daughters, since their mother and his ex-wife, Jennifer, is a drug addict who wants nothing to do with the girls and lives with her boyfriend, Joe, the main drug dealer in the neighborhood who has the town in fear. Monty is reluctant to do so, but agrees. During Kat's funeral, Jennifer disrupts the service, demands her daughters live with her and sues for custody.

Monty, Jennifer, Joe, and Joe's thugs are all arrested, and Julia sees a report on the incident, in which Monty is identified as having been falsely convicted of rape.  Jennifer and Joe are facing drug charges in court, because cocaine and marijuana was found in Joe's car and house, while Monty is to be charged with assault. Julia represents Monty, apologizing for not hearing his side of the story.

D-War
 The story follows the adventures of Ethan Kendrick ([[Jason Behr]]), charged in his childhood by the enigmatic Jack ([[Robert Forster]]) to protect the Yuh Yi Joo, an individual born able to change an [[Imoogi]] chosen by [[heaven]] into a Celestial Dragon, from a corrupt Imoogi identified as "Buraki", who was prevented from obtaining it in the past by Ethan and Jack's previous [[incarnations]]. To this end, Jack gives Ethan a [[medallion]] formerly belonging to Ethan's previous incarnation Haram, and reveals that the reincarnated Yuh Yi Joo is Sarah Daniels ([[Amanda Brooks]]), whom Ethan will find in Los Angeles.  15 years after this revelation, Buraki invades the city, bent on capturing Sarah; whereupon Ethan, now a television news anchor, rescues her, conveys the knowledge of her purpose, and attempts to save her from Buraki, during which they eventually regain the memories of their past lives. During the resulting chase, Buraki's "Atrox Army" enters the city and engages the [[United States Army]], the [[United States Air Force]], and the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] in battle. Here, the Atrox Army is shown to consist of black-armored, humanoid knight warriors; [[theropod]]-like [[cavalry]] called "Shaconnes"; small, winged [[Western dragon]]s called "Bulcos"; and immense, slow-moving reptiles carrying [[rocket]]-launchers on their backs, identified in the dialogue as "Dawdlers". Despite losses, this army overwhelms the human forces, while Ethan and Sarah escape the city, but are subsequently captured by the Bulcos and taken to a menacing fortress in the midst of a darkened desert landscape. There, as Buraki emerges from the fortress to consume Sarah, Ethan's medallion unleashes power that destroys the Atrox Army. Ethan then attempts to prevent Buraki from consuming Sarah, but he is knocked away, whereupon the chosen Good Imoogi emerges from the fortress and attacks Buraki. The two Imoogi, good and evil, engage each other in a duel that Buraki appears to win after seemingly snapping the Good Imoogi's neck. Having won the fight, Buraki again approaches Sarah; but having offered herself to him, she instead gives her power to the injured Good Imoogi who absorbs it. Sarah faints, and the Good Imoogi becomes the Celestial Dragon, continuing the duel until it finally destroys Buraki.  After Buraki is destroyed, Sarah dissolves into a [[spirit]] form, and the Celestial Dragon permits her to speak to Ethan, whom she promises to "love...for all eternity"; then withdraws Sarah into its body and ascends to the heavens. Jack appears behind Ethan, reminding him that the two of them "have been given a great honor" to take part in this transformation, and vanishes, presumably never to be seen again. After whispering "Goodbye old man", Ethan walks away into the desert.

The Darjeeling Limited
 A businessman in India fails to catch his train—called "The Darjeeling Limited"—as it pulls out of a station; he is beaten to it by a younger man, Peter Whitman. Peter reunites with brothers Francis and Jack on board, the three having not seen each other since their father's funeral a year earlier.  Francis has recently survived a near-fatal motorcycle accident (leaving his face and head covered in bandages), and thus wishes to reconnect with his brothers on a journey of spiritual self-discovery. He is also secretly searching for their mother, whom the brothers have not seen in many years. With the help of his assistant Brendan, Francis draws up a strict itinerary for the trip and takes his brothers' passports to prevent them from getting off the train too early. The three also continue to grieve over their father's death: carrying bags and suitcases marked with his initials, along with other personal items that belonged to him.  The train takes the brothers through the countryside and to various [[Hindu]] temples, though animosity builds as Jack and Peter become annoyed with Francis' controlling behavior. Francis eventually reveals that they will be meeting with their mother, who has become a nun living at a Christian convent in the [[Himalayas]]. Peter and Jack are upset, knowing they wouldn't have come if they had been told this earlier. The tension finally comes to a head and the three fight on the train, disturbing the other passengers. The Chief Steward, whom the brothers have repeatedly annoyed, has them thrown off with all their luggage. Brendan subsequently quits and returns to the train after giving the boys a letter from their mother; its contents imply that she doesn't want to see them. The brothers thus decide to leave India, go their separate ways, and never return.   After trekking through the wilderness, the brothers see three young boys fall into a river while attempting to pull a raft across it. Jack and Francis rescue two of the boys, but Peter fails to save the third, who dies. They carry the body back to the boys' village, where they spend the night and are warmly treated. They attend the funeral the next day and experience a flashback: the three brothers (accompanied by Alice) are shown heading to their father's funeral, and then stopping to pick up his Porsche from the repair shop, even though the car is not ready. It is revealed that their father's death was a result of him being hit by a taxi, and that their mother did not attend the funeral.   Back in the present, the brothers arrive at the airport, but the brothers suddenly decide to rip up their tickets and go visit their mother. They then reach the convent, where their mother is surprised but happy to see them (and Francis offhandedly implies that his accident was actually a suicide attempt). That night, after the brothers confront their mother for abandoning them, the family gathers together in silence and reconcile. The brothers awake the next morning to find their mother gone, leaving them their breakfast. They decide not to wait for her to return.  At the train station, the three brothers run for another train called "Bengal Lancer" and gleefully discard all their father's suitcases and bags to catch it. On board, Francis offers to return Peter and Jack their passports, but is told instead to hold onto them.  
Dark Matter (film)
 The film is inspired by the true story of [[Gang Lu]], a former graduate student who killed four faculty members and one student at the [[University of Iowa]]. However, the story has substantial differences in plot and character motivation.  Liu Xing ([[Liu Ye (actor)|Liu Ye]]) is a humble but brilliant Chinese student who arrives at Valley State University and makes a bumpy transition into American life with the help of Joanna Silver ([[Meryl Streep]]). Silver is a wealthy university patron who has a fascination with Chinese culture and takes a liking to Liu Xing. Xing joins a select [[cosmology]] group under the direction of his hero, the famous cosmologist Professor Jacob Reiser ([[Aidan Quinn]]). The group is working to create a model of the [[origins of the universe]], based on Reiser's theory. Xing's enormous talent leads him quickly to become Reiser's protégé, and it seems that only hard work stands between him and a bright future in science.  Xing is obsessed with the study of [[dark matter]], an unseen substance that he believes shapes the universe, and a theory that conflicts with the Reiser model. Xing makes scientific breakthroughs of his own which improve the Reiser model. Without Professor Reiser's approval, Liu Xing proposes to research dark matter for his doctoral dissertation. Reiser explains to Xing that this type of research is too complicated and suggests that he should pick a simpler dissertation topic.  Refusing to work with Xing, Reiser finds a new protégé in Feng Gang (Lloyd Suh), another Chinese student who was Xing's rival in undergraduate school in Beijing. Professor Reiser approves of Feng's dissertation proposal as it sticks to the Reiser model. Feng's English skills are far superior to his fellow Chinese students', and he refuses to speak in Mandarin with them. Feng changes his name to Laurence so that Americans would be more comfortable pronouncing his name.  Without the permission of Professor Reiser, Xing publishes an article in an astronomy journal. Reiser is enraged by this and refuses to accept Xing's doctoral dissertation.  At a graduation party for the Chinese students it is announced that Laurence Feng has won the university's science dissertation prize for that year. Joanna Silver urges Professor Reiser to do something to help Liu Xing. Reiser informs her that he has written a "very fine" recommendation for him.     Xing does not graduate and finds his dream of winning the Nobel Prize shattered. He goes on to sell beauty products to try to make money. His roommate offers to find him a job in China, but Xing refuses to leave. A few months pass and Xing mails all of his money to his parents in China.  One day, Xing returns to campus. He heads into an auditorium where Laurence Feng is giving a presentation to the cosmology department. Unable to cope with his emotions, Xing pulls a revolver out of his coat and begins firing, shooting Laurence and Reiser before making his way to Reiser's office and shooting himself in the head.

The Dark Hour (2007 film)
 The film follows a group of eight people who living in a crumbling, unknown installation. They are survivors of a cataclysmic war. Maria (group leader), Pablo (her boyfriend), Jesus, Lucas, Mateo, Magda, and teen Ana all live together. Judas and Pedro (Maria's former lover) live away from the others. Jesus, the only young boy, films everything on a digicam. Jesus and Ana visit Judas in the basement whenever possible, as he treats them like adults. On the way to his rooms they pass decrepit corridors that are out of bounds, although Jesus leaves food for the "Solitary Child" that lives in the area.  Old TV sets show 1950s cartoons and science films with propaganda messages about destroying an unnamed enemy. Another film declares the enemy had developed a virus that destroys skin, making the infected victim constantly bleed but never die.   The survivors can't leave the complex and live in fear of the "Strangers" and "Invisibles" (only seen as a green mist in the corridors). The survivors' only defense is to cut the complex's power and heat; the Dark (or Cold) Hour of the title. The "Strangers" are the infected mentioned in the propaganda films. When food, medical supplies and ammunition begin to run out they must travel to a supply depot outside of their underground safe zone.  Pablo, Pedro and Lucas are chosen to get the supplies. Pablo is frightened when a Stranger begins stalking them. Pedro uses the confusion to push Pablo into a room full of Strangers, letting him become infected. Pablo's death devastates Maria and makes the other survivors question their future. Mateo wonders if it would be better if the group made a suicide pact instead of face such a bleak future.   The complex is then invaded by the Invisibles. Ana stumbles into the green mist and frantically tries to get into another room. Mateo rescues her and they kiss briefly.  The next day the Solitary Child shows up because his home was overrun by Strangers. As he is cleaned up by the children the others organize an attack on the Strangers. Magda learns of Mateo and Ana's kiss and slaps him for taking advantage. During the attack Mateo and Lucas are infected and killed by their comrades. A Stranger slips past them, though, and chases the children until he touches Jesus. The children escape and hide in a fridge until the others rescue them. Pedro wants to kill Jesus, but is stopped by the others. Unlike everyone else Jesus doesn't become infected. Maria later finds Pedro who has become paranoid and talks about the voices behind the walls. Maria tackles him and a shotgun is heard going off. Magda, Judas and the children find an armed Pedro and an injured Maria. While they talk Pedro stares into the distance, watching the Invisibles come up behind the survivors.  Pedro walks into the green lights while the others run away, supporting Maria. As they run they shoot at the lights. Coming to a garage Judas opens the doors and they run outside for the first time, where it's nighttime. They drop their weapons and sit in a town square, surrounded by Strangers. Jesus looks into his digicam and says they will have to join the Strangers, but at least it won't hurt.  Jesus looks at the sky where the Earth suddenly rises over the buildings. As the camera pulls back it's revealed that the complex is under a geodesic dome on the moon. The Earth is clearly surrounded by debris and is shown to be completely shattered to the core.

Panicked, she calls the police, who cannot help without more evidence of a crime. She decides to meet Tim and the children in Chinatown, but they do not show up.  In the evening, Tim suddenly appears at the house, apparently badly injured. Before dying, he tells Nathalie that the children have been abducted. She immediately informs the police, but when the detective, James Gates, arrives, the body is gone and the site has been cleaned up leaving no evidence that Nathalie is telling the truth. Later a police officer, Phil Warren arrives to question Nathalie. Warren is revealed to be corrupt and overpowers Nathalie. Graphically depicted in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], he tells Nathalie that Tim had been hired by the Persian [[Mafia|Mafioso]] Maho and had burst in on a drug deal organised by Maho, killing those present before running off with a million dollars in cash and the [[cocaine]]. Convinced that the drugs are hidden in the house, he tells her he has killed her son Jeremy with a chainsaw and will kill Elisabeth as well if he is not told where drugs and money are, Warren then tortures Nathalie in an attempt to get the information out of her, cutting off a finger and a toe with [[pruning shears]]. Nathalie eventually manages to break free and kills Warren with a broken bottle.  Then a mysterious man by the name of Daniel appears who informs her he had been following Warren. He offers to help her, tends to her wounds and calms her down. His story is somewhat different (also depicted in flashback) - that Tim had chanced upon a drug deal that had gone bad and that he had got hold of the two cases entirely innocently before disappearing. However, it is then revealed that Daniel's intentions are less honourable than they appeared - he drugs Nathalie and disposes of Warren's body. Daniel explains how he tortured and killed Nathalie's loved ones before torturing Nathalie herself with a hammer. Although under the effects of a local [[Anesthesia|anaesthesia]], she head-butts Daniel and is able to plunge a hypodermic into his eye before killing him with a knife.  Severely wounded, she clambers up the stairs when the phone begins to a ring. It is Detective Gates who is also corrupt. Gates sends her daughter Elisabeth in and points a [[sniper rifle]] at her head, ordering Nathalie to reveal the location of the money and drugs and to not move or he will shoot her daughter. Remembering their dogs disappearance, Nathalie suspects it has something to do with where the money is buried so Nathalie and Elisabeth attempt to come up with the answer through a riddle posed in one of Tim's old children's songs which reveals the location to them. As Nathalie bends to pick up a pencil however, Gates shoots Elisabeth in the shoulder. Nathalie picks up Daniel's pistol and shoots Gates as he enters the house.  Nathalie runs alone to the cornfield and meets Tim there, who has their son. The true story is revealed - Gates had employed Tim as an [[informant|informer]] and was supposed to give him Moha. As Gates was one of the most corrupt cops in the precinct, Tim was ordered to kill Maha and bring him the drugs and money. Tim slipped some [[Parathion|E 605]] into the coffee at the diner killing the mafiosi and then shoots the other party when they arrive to make the deal. Nathalie was his last obstacle but, as Tim is about to shoot her, he is shot by his daughter Elisabeth from behind. Nathalie and the children begin a new life.

After Jamie is released from custody by Detective Jim Lipton due to lack of evidence, he spots inside Billy's box a mysterious message about "Mary Shaw", a deceased ventriloquist from his hometown, Raven's Fair.  At Raven's Fair, Jamie visits his estranged and wealthy father, Edward (who uses a wheelchair), and his much-younger wife, Ella, for information regarding Mary Shaw. Dismissing them as superstitions, Jamie arranges for Lisa's funeral with the help of a local mortician, Henry Walker. Jamie meets Henry's senile wife, Marion, who tells him of the danger of Mary and her puppet, Billy. After burying Billy, Jamie is confronted by Detective Lipton in his motel room, the latter still doubting Jamie, and digs up Billy, after Jamie leaves the cemetery where Mary Shaw and the rest of her dummies are buried.   Henry tells Jamie about Shaw. Shaw was a famous ventriloquist who was publicly humiliated when a boy, Michael, rudely claimed that he could see her lips moving during her performance. Michael disappeared some weeks later, and his family blamed it on Shaw and lynched her. Her last wish was to have her body turned into a dummy and buried with her 101 dolls. Henry, then the young son of the local mortician, saw Shaw (after she was turned to a dummy) rise up, but Henry was spared thanks to his having kept his mouth shut. This is because Shaw takes her revenge by killing only those who scream. Jamie finds out that Michael, the first victim, was his great uncle; the Ashen family were the ones who killed Shaw by cutting out her tongue, and she has been seeking revenge against their entire bloodline by killing them in the same way.  While crawling under the house after discovering Marion with the Billy puppet, Henry is killed by Shaw, who steals his tongue. Detective Lipton discovers that all of Shaw's dolls have been dug up. He informs Jamie, who receives a call from "Henry," asking him to go to Shaw's theatre. There, both Jamie and Detective Lipton discover 100 of the dolls lined up with Michael's body, which has been turned into a marionette. Through a clown doll, Shaw reveals to Jamie that she killed his wife because she was pregnant with his son, thus killing any potential newborn of the Ashen family. Jamie and Lipton burn the theatre and all of Shaw's dolls, though in the process, Shaw successfully makes Detective Lipton scream and kills him.  Back at his father's residence, Jamie is confronted by Mary Shaw, but he repels her by throwing Billy (the 101st and last of the remaining dummies) into the fireplace. He is horrified to learn that his father had already died a long time ago; the current "Edward" is the corpse converted into a doll that is controlled by Ella, who is the "perfect doll" for Shaw, created just before her death. He screams as Ella, possessed by Mary Shaw, lunges at him.  The film ends with Jamie reciting a nursery rhyme about Shaw and a photo album with human puppets is shown: Lisa, Henry, Detective Lipton, Edward, Ella, and Jamie himself.

Dear Friends (2007 film)
 ''Dear Friends'' follows a high-school student named Rina (played by [[Keiko Kitagawa]]) who believes that friends are not necessary and that they can only be used in times of need. Thus, she is unable to maintain a decent relationship with her friends and classmates. Her family's relationship is also lacking; her father does not care much about his family and her mother is over-protective.  Rina spends a lot of her time going to a club in [[Shibuya]] where Yousuke (played by [[Masaya Kikawada]]) is the disc jockey with her friends Hiroko (played by [[Airi Toriyama]]) and Emi (played by [[Hatsune Matsushima]]). (In the opening scene, Rina has "borrowed" Hiroko's boyfriend for sex, infuriating Hiroko.) Yousuke falls for Rina, but her attitude has a feral edge, and they neck but stop short of having sex.  After obtaining a large amount of money under false pretenses (i.e. claiming she is pregnant when she is not and forcing the guy [not Hiroko's boyfriend or Yousuke] to pay for the abortion) and spending it on a bottle of [[Dom Pérignon (wine)|Dom Pérignon]] (which she sprays over everyone at the club), Rina collapses on the dance floor. She eventually discovers that she has [[cancer]] ([[non-Hodgkin lymphoma]]) and becomes hospitalized for an indefinite amount of time. In the hospital, she is not visited by her family, but by one of her classmates named Maki (played by [[Yuika Motokariya]]). Although Maki tells Rina that they were friends in primary school, Rina does not remember her, so Maki takes the opportunity to re-connect with her. A young girl, Kanae, (played by [[Mao Sasaki]]) who is also hospitalized tries to become friends with Rina, but she holds fast onto her mantra of friends being unnecessary.  Throughout her hospitalization, Rina begins to lose hope as her well-being falls apart. Her hair falls out from the chemotherapy and she looks pale and thin. Rina learns that Kanae also had cancer ([[leukemia]]), and has died after a bone marrow transplant failed. Rina must undergo a [[mastectomy]] as the cancer has spread to her left breast. She decides to commit [[suicide]] by jumping off the hospital's rooftop. Before she can jump, however, she is confronted by Maki, who stabs herself in the chest with a knife and declares that she will share the same pain as Rina and that she does not want to lose her friend. Maki has suicidal tendencies (as evidenced by scars on her wrist), but sees in her relationship with Rina a reason to keep living. Rina shows some hope again when she realizes that she can find friendship in Maki, but she does not see Maki while the latter recovers from the stab wound.  Hiroko and Emi then visit Rina in the hospital ward. Hiroko throws away a love letter from Yousuke to Rina that she was supposed to deliver, then claims that she and Emi had three-way sex with him. Emi acknowledges this (even though it is new to her).  After treatment, Rina is discharged. She tries to go back to her party lifestyle, but cannot force herself to behave as she once did. She goes back to the club, where Emi apologizes for the hospital visit (claiming that Hiroko put her up to it) and states that Hiroko overdosed on drugs. Rina decides she is ready to have sex with Yousuke, but he has second thoughts after seeing Rina's mastectomy scar.   Rina goes back to the hospital rooftop to jump, but is stopped by the head nurse. The head nurse says that Maki wanted her to live, but Rina claims that Maki has not seen her recently. Then, another nurse pushes a zombie-like Maki in a wheelchair onto the rooftop. Maki says that the only reason she is still living is so that she could meet friends like Rina. Maki has a terminal illness: an unspecified [[neurodegenerative disease]]. Rina finds her purpose in life, fully recovered from cancer, applies to nursing school, becomes a nurse, and takes care of Maki during her final days. After three months, Maki dies.

The story begins on the  day of their father's funeral. Robert arrives, having flown First Class, but declines to help finance the funeral, leaving Daniel to cover all the expenses. As guests begin to arrive, Daniel struggles to complete a [[eulogy]], even though everyone expects Robert will be the one to deliver it.  Daniel's cousin Martha ([[Daisy Donovan]]) and her fiancé Simon ([[Alan Tudyk]]) are desperate to make a good impression on Martha's father Victor ([[Peter Egan]]). Their hopes for doing so are dashed when Martha, hoping to calm Simon's nerves, gives him what she believes is [[Valium]] but is actually a [[hallucinogen]]ic [[designer drug]] manufactured by her brother Troy ([[Kris Marshall]]), a pharmacy student.   An American man named Peter ([[Peter Dinklage]]), who has [[Dwarfism|dwarfism]], introduces himself to Daniel, who is too busy to speak to him at that moment and suggests they talk later. The service begins and the hallucinating Simon, certain he sees the coffin moving, tips it over, causing the body to spill out onto the floor. During the ensuing chaos, Simon is told why he is acting as he is, so he panics and locks himself in the bathroom. Martha tries to persuade him to open the door while fending off the unwelcome advances of Justin ([[Ewen Bremner]]), with whom she once had a [[one-night stand]] that she would like to forget. Simon climbs onto the roof naked and threatens to jump.   While most of the guests are watching Simon on the roof, Peter meets privately with Daniel and Robert and reveals he was their father's lover. Unhappy that he was left nothing in their father's will, Peter shows them compromising photographs, trying to [[blackmail]] the family for £15,000. The brothers panic, bind and gag Peter, and give him what they believe is Valium to calm him down. Peter manages to free himself, but falls and hits his head on a glass coffee table. Troy and [[Germaphobia|germaphobic]] family friend Howard ([[Andy Nyman]]) believe Peter to be dead. Forced to dispose of the body as quickly and surreptitiously as possible, Daniel and Robert place it in the casket with their father. Martha tells Simon that she is pregnant with their child, and she takes him off the roof, much to everyone's relief.  Once everyone returns, the service resumes. Daniel's awkward eulogy is interrupted when the still-alive Peter leaps from the coffin and the photos fall out for everyone, including Daniel and Robert's mother Sandra ([[Jane Asher]]), to see. Daniel demands everyone to stay calm, declares his father was a good man, although clearly one with secrets, and finally proceeds to deliver an impromptu tribute.  In the evening, after all the mourners (including Peter) have left, Robert tells Daniel that he plans on taking their mother to New York so that Daniel and Jane can finally buy their own flat. Their conversation is interrupted when Jane tells them that Uncle Alfie ([[Peter Vaughan]]) had a panic attack over Simon, so she gave him some "Valium." The film ends with Uncle Alfie on the roof naked, as Simon had been.  
Death Defying Acts
 In 1926, 13 years after his mother's death, [[illusionist]] Harry Houdini ([[Guy Pearce]]) has begun debunking mystics, [[psychic]]s and others who claim to have [[paranormal]] powers. He offers US$10,000 to anyone who can quote his mother's dying words to him.  Impoverished and uneducated [[Scot]]tish [[con artist]] Mary McGarvie ([[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]) and her daughter Benji ([[Saoirse Ronan]]) set their sights on Houdini's reward when he visits [[Edinburgh]] on tour. Mary's psychic act pulls in the public: Benji surreptitiously gathers information on members of the audience, information Mary uses to con them into believing they can reach out to their deceased loved ones.  Their only obstacle is Houdini's protective manager, Sugarman ([[Timothy Spall]]). Mary manages to charm the unsuspecting magician, but as they spend more and more time together, Sugarman intervenes, trying to prevent Houdini from becoming entangled with Mary, of whom he is suspicious.  Sugarman's main desire is to see Mary and Benji gone; they claim they will be gone for good once they secure the reward for finding out what Houdini's mother said to him on her death bed. Sugarman realizes he can't get rid of them as easily as he had hoped. Mary is caught trying to open Houdini's chest and covers up by saying she was just searching for something to channel the psychic energy of the deceased.  Benji gets the key to the chest from Sugarman. When Mary and Benji fail to turn up any useful information, they turn again to Sugarman. He tells them that Houdini was out doing a show and missed seeing his mother before she died. When the time comes, Mary is unable to perform the experiment and attempts to leave.  At this point Benji starts having a fit on the ground and claims to be channelling Houdini's mother on her death bed, uttering the words of the [[Kaddish]] and addressing Houdini as "Ehrich", his real name, and speaking partly in German and partly in German-accented English asking where he is, and why he is not with her. This could be interpreted as either a genuine [[seance]] or a very skillful and convincing impersonation by the young artist. When the note he wrote to confirm the veracity of the experiment was removed from its safe and shown to be blank, Houdini reveals the "eternal shame" he feels because he wasn't able to reach his mother before she died, and thus was unable to comfort her in her moment of death, or to hear her final words. The McGarvies are awarded the $10,000.   Mary is disgruntled because she believes Harry does not love her as she believed. When he says he does, they become romantically involved before Houdini leaves for his last performance, in [[Montreal]]. During his travels, he is climbing a set of stairs when a "Red-Haired Prankster" punches him in the stomach while he was not prepared, rupturing his [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], eventually killing him.  
Dead Tone
 The film begins with a sleepover of children. They prank call people while playing the game Seventy Five. Meanwhile, their parents are in the other room having drinks. The rules of the game are that you must keep a random person on the line for 75 seconds, and they must believe what you’re saying. As the night goes on the kids go to bed, a man whom the kids recently called calls back, before jumping from a closet and killing all the parents in the house with an [[axe]] as the children hide in their bedrooms.  Ten years later, Chuck ([[Josh Hammond]]) is murdered in his house by an unknown figure. Two detectives, Detective Anne Hastings ([[Gwendoline Yeo]]) and Detective John Criton ([[Rutger Hauer]]) discover Chuck was one of the children involved in the Waley murders 10 years previously. They begin an investigation and find more of the survivors have been murdered. Meanwhile, Brandon ([[Jonathan Chase (actor)|Jonathan Chase]]) is throwing a party at his fathers secluded mansion. Brandon invites his ex-girlfriend, Karina (Judy Taylor), so he can try to get back together with her, but she insists that her group of friends also come, including Marcus ([[Brian Hooks]]), Roxy ([[Cherie Johnson]]), Shawn ([[Germán Legarreta]]), Kareem ([[Antwon Tanner]]), Scott ([[Wil Horneff]]) and Jody ([[Aimee Garcia]]).  As the group arrive and the party starts, Brandon and his friend Cal (Austin Basis) show everyone around, revealing that the house is filled with cameras which can be monitored on screens in the monitoring room, due to the house previously being used as a reality show set. After a few hours of partying, Marcus suggests a game of Seventy Five. Various people take part, until one caller murders someone for the group to hear. They all decide to not answer the phone and continue with their night. As the party finishes and most people leave, Karina and Brandon reconcile. Becky ([[Ellen Woglom]]) and Julie (Soraya Kelley) stay up partying with two boys. However, the killer soon arrives at the house and decapitates Becky, before killing the boys and Julie. The killer proceeds to decapitate a boy in the hot tub before drowning his girlfriend. Kareem witnesses the murders and rounds up Roxy, Marcus and Anna ([[Denyce Lawton]]) to leave. The group split up to warn the others. Marcus and Anna find Jody and Cal, however they are soon attacked by the killer who murders Anna, while the others flee into Brandon and Karina's room. After Kareem and Roxy arrive with an unconscious Scott, who Kareem accidentally knocked out, the group lock themselves in the room. Brandon blames Marcus for the murders, causing a fight to break out.  After a while of waiting, Brandon and Karina leave to retrieve keys for Brandon's car, while Marcus and Kareem search for Shawn. The killer soon attacks Brandon and Karina, and Brandon is eventually axed in the back, killing him. The killer then throws Karina off the balcony, however she survives and runs into the monitor room to hide. Meanwhile, Cal goes outside to try and hot wire a car. As he succeeds, the killer appears and beats him to death, although he does manage to summon help to the house. Marcus and Kareem return to the room only to find it empty, before discovering Roxy has been killed. They find Scott, but are soon attacked. However, Marcus and Kareem manage to overpower the killer and pin them to the ground. As Kareem urges Scott to kill him, he instead murders Kareem. Marcus hides in the monitor room with Karina, watching in horror as Jody and then Shawn are murdered.  Scott soon comes to the monitoring room, with his accomplice ([[Kyle Turley]]), who is revealed to be an inmate from the mental hospital they both recently escaped from. He goes on to reveal that he is, in fact, Scott's twin brother, William, and that he murdered Scott before they left for the party. William tells Marcus he blames him for the deaths of his parents all those years ago as he was the one that wanted to play Seventy Five. William then turns on his accomplice, stabbing him, before a fight breaks out between him, Karina and Marcus. Eventually, William stabs Karina to death. While Marcus swings the axe to kill William, Detectives Anne and John arrive and shoot Marcus, believing he is the killer. As Anne and John comfort William, the accomplice rises with an axe and swings it towards the detectives.

Dead Time: Kala
 In an unnamed [[dystopian]] country, two cops, Eros ([[Ario Bayu]]) and Hendro Waluyo ([[August Melasz]]) investigate a case of five people being burned alive after a woman shouted them as thieves. Meanwhile, a down-on-luck [[narcoleptic]] journalist, Janus (Fachry Albar), is late to attend his divorce with Sari (Shanty). He searches the recent news and meets the widow of one of the burned victims, a pregnant woman named Ratih. Sneaking on her conversation with a nurse through a hidden tape recorder, Janus later watches as Ratih is hit by a bus outside the hospital and passes out from his narcolepsy, mysteriously waking up inside the hospital afterwards. Janus and his friend, Soebandi, hear from the tape a [[Javanese language|Javanese]] prose quoted by Ratih of something that is in "Bukit Bendonowongso, in front of Candi Tujuh Anak Tangga". When the two part ways, a pale white-skinned creature, Pindoro (Yose Rizal Manua) follows Soebandi and apparently beheads him. Janus is taken for questioning by Eros; after the latter leaves, fellow cop Bambang Sutrisno (Frans Tumbuan) threatens Janus to tell him the contents of the tape.  From the hospital records, Janus visits Ratih's house and learns from Ratih's neighbors that in the span of a week, Ratih, her husband, and her father, Ronggoweni, died. The only surviving family of Ratih is her sister, Ranti (Fahrani), who currently works as a lounge singer. Ranti warns Janus not to disclose the prose to anyone else; should he does so, either him or the person he tells to must die. Following the lounge's closing, Ranti is kidnapped, and when Janus tries to rescue her, he is captured too. Janus wakes up to the Minister of Arts, Heryo Wibowo (Arswendi Nasution), and is poured with gasoline to be immolated alive before his narcolepsy takes over. Eros visits the crime scene again, learning from a witness that the woman who shouted at the thieves is a relative of one of them, suggesting Ranti. He visits Ronggoweni's house and faces Pindoro, but the latter does not harm him. Later, Eros and Hendro discuss over the collapsing state of their nation, with Hendro reciting a hopeful prophecy that soon, the "King of Justice" will arrive to stabilize her. Hendro also tells Eros that Ranti is from the family of an aide of the First President. Eros confirms this by visiting the library, in which he finds a photo of Ronggoweni's inauguration and the search for the treasure of the First President.  Janus wakes up in his imprisonment room, alone and unscathed, and meets Sari. She apologizes and the two reconcile. Sari, upon being told the prose, says that she knows where the treasure is located. However, their reconciliation is a ruse, as Sari immediately calls Heryo. The two meet outside the city where Heryo shoots Sari after she has told him the treasure's location. Heryo is then chased by Pindoro until he is beheaded. Janus, depressed when he learns of Sari's death, moves out the city to commit suicide, but Pindoro catches him at the last second and brings him to safety. He is then captured by a group led by Bambang and a minister. Eros and Hendro, meanwhile, find Ranti during their search for the treasure's location who tells them that her father had been forced by his son-in-law to disclose the treasure; true to the taboo, he committed suicide and his daughter and son-in-law followed him soon afterward. What they did not know is that one more person (Janus) had also learned about the treasure. At the library, a book informed them that the treasure was bestowed to the kings of [[Nusantara]] for uniting the country, and the First President, knowing of the fighting the treasure would inflict, ordered nine of his aide to hide it. Pindoro is a supernatural creature tasked to protect the treasure, but as he is intangible he never committed the murders, meaning that a mortal did them. Shortly after, Pindoro suddenly appears and takes Ranti with him.  Hendro recites the prophecy again, attested since the time of [[Jayabaya]], which reveals that "when the republic turned half a century, fighting for the treasure shall ignite, and a sleeper shall become the keeper of the secret of the treasure"; Janus is in fact the "sleeper". He, while being imprisoned in a bus, tells everyone present of the secret. Shortly thereafter, Ranti appears and kills everyone save Janus, revealing herself as the mortal protector of the keeper, having taken the role from her father. Janus is taken to Bukit Bendonowongso, with Eros tailing Bambang, but Ranti appears and massacres nearly everyone present, including Bambang. Just when Eros  decides to let himself die rather than Janus, Ranti and Pindoro kneel before him, revealing him as the "King of Justice". The film ends with silhouettes of the four leaving Bukit Bendonowongso, while Hendro recites the final part of the prophecy: "The sleeper shall disclose the secret with the king, the leader who shall take the country to prosperity. They and their protector shall meet near the hill, but their meeting is not an easy task, for evils shall unite to hinder them."  
Death of a Ghost Hunter
 [[Ghost hunting|Ghost hunter]] Carter Simms is offered $5,000 to stay a weekend in the Masterson house to investigate [[paranormal activity]]. The owner of the house also hires Colin Green as the videographer and Yvette Sandoval as a journalist. Together they set up equipment and begin searching for evidence of ghosts or paranormal activity.  The group is then joined by Mary Young Mortensen, a young member of the Mastersons' church. She claims she was also sent by owner of the house to assist in the investigation. She also states that she is there to protect the reputations of the Mastersons because they were great members of their church.  The group stays in the Masterson house for three days. Several mysterious things happen: The room temperature in the master bedroom lowers dramatically in a short period; a chair moves on its own; a gunshot and mysterious voices are recorded and some ghostly figures are recorded on video.  By the beginning of day three, Colin gets a call from the owner of the house and it turns out Mary Young Mortensen was never supposed to be at the house; so Carter forces Mary to leave.  Later that night, nothing much is happening, but the group reviews a video tape and sees a figure in the guest house. As they are going to investigate the guest house, we flash to a scene where Mary is on a radio talk show concerned about the people out to discredit the good name of the Mastersons.  She convinces herself she needs to stop them and returns to the house.  Mary then begins killing all members of the group, writes a note, and commits suicide much like the mother did in the opening scenes of the movie.  It turns out Mary was the small child left by the mother in the opening scene. She was rescued before she drowned and apparently adopted by the first officer to arrive on the scene. As Mary is preparing for her suicide, she tells the sordid story of the Mastersons, involving the imprisonment, rape and torture of her mother who eventually became pregnant with her. The birth of Mary caused Mrs. Masterson to kill her family and Mary's mother.  As the movie ends, it switches to a scene where Carter is seen looking at and into an infrared camera. She is now a ghost in the house, unable to leave along with the other ghosts.

After gang leader, De Costa ([[Clare Perkins]]), identifies her cousin Barry's body, she tells her henchman, Cory (Faisal Mohmmed), that she asked Barry to put a hit on Castro  but knew he did not go to do it alone as he loved company. De Costa questions the shopkeeper and finds out that a policeman has been let into their gang. She arranges a meeting with the gang and gang member, Danny (Chris Tummings), admits to letting Stan into their gang but claims he did not know that he was a policeman.

Later that evening, Clayderman questions Clarkie about a black 4x4 seen leaving the scene of the shooting and Clarkie's car was seen driving down the road of the main witness (Jamal). After Clarkie replies that he is not the only person that drives a 4x4 and that he sold his car to someone local, Clayderman states that his car has been impounded for forensics to match the tyres with fragments found on the parking lot rooftop, but does not arrest Clarkie.  
December Boys
 This film is a [[coming of age]] picture for the four main characters, and how their lives change over one Christmas holiday. The film is set in late 1960s Australia. Four orphan boys from a [[Roman Catholic Church in Australia|Roman Catholic]] [[orphanage]] in the [[Outback|outback of Australia]]  Maps, Misty, Spark and Spit  were all born in the month of December, and for their birthday, they are sent on a holiday to the beach to stay with Mr. and Mrs. McAnsh. While there, they meet Fearless, a man who claims to be the risk motorbike rider in the nearby carnival, and his wife, Teresa. Misty, Spark and Spit instantly become closer to Teresa, but Maps, eldest of the four, is still reluctant to talk to her. He instead finds more fun in spending time with an older teenage girl named Lucy, who had come to the beach to stay with her uncle. He often goes up to a place with strange rocks, and meets her there.  A few days later, the orphans peek through a window in Fearless' house to see Teresa undressing, but Misty, being the most religious of the four, throws a rock at the wall to make them go away. Misty runs back to Mr. McAnsh's house and looks through the small opening of a door to see someone in the shower, only to find that it is the sickly  Mrs. McAnsh. They soon discover that she has [[breast cancer]].  One night, Misty overhears Fearless talking to his friends about the possibility of [[Adoption|adopting]] one of the orphans. Excited about the opportunity to finally have parents, he keeps it to himself until he decides to reveal it to a priest who has driven to the beach for the orphans' confessions. The other boys realise that he is taking too long, and once he is finished, they force it out of him with the threat of Spit spitting on him while he is pinned to the ground. Misty, Spark and Spit are eager to compete for the love of the seemingly perfect Fearless and Teresa, but Maps is less than excited, even saying to Lucy, "What's the big deal about parents, anyway?" Maps experiences his first kiss with Lucy, and soon loses his [[virginity]] to her in one of the caves of the Remarkable Rocks.  There, she tells him to promise that he will always remember her as his first. The next day, he goes up to the Remarkable Rocks, only to find Lucy is not there. Her uncle tells him that she's left the beach to return to her father, and will not likely be back until next summer. Heartbroken, he goes to the carnival to find Fearless and talk to him, but discovers that he is not a motorbike rider there, and instead cleans up after the animals. Furious that he'd lied all along, he finds a painting made by Misty of him as the son of Fearless and Teresa, and destroys it. Misty attacks him and hits him with the fragments of the frame he'd put the painting in, and the bond between the four orphans is broken.  Fearless finds Maps in the cave of the Remarkable Rocks, and explains to him what had really happened. It is revealed to that Fearless was formerly a bike rider, and did all of the stunts with Teresa riding on the back of the bike. Then, there was an accident that kept Teresa in the hospital for nearly a year, making her unable to have children. That was the reason they had wanted to adopt one of the orphans.  Maps returns to the beach and finds out from Spark and Spit that Misty has gone into the water, and is drowning. Maps goes after him despite the fact that he cannot swim. Both he and Misty nearly drown. Underwater, they open their eyes to see a vision of the Virgin Mary, possibly meaning that they are dying. Before they can reach out to it, the two boys are grabbed by Fearless and brought back to the shore. Maps and Misty reconcile with each other and the four are friends again.  The next day, the boys are called to Fearless' and Teresa's house for an announcement. There, they reveal the couple is going to adopt Misty. He takes leave of his friends and he watches on the front porch with Fearless and Teresa as the other three orphans walk away and begin playing on some rocks down the beach. Misty realises that they are his true family, and asks Fearless and Teresa if he can stay with them instead. They accept, and he returns home with the orphans.  Many decades later, Misty, as an old man, drives to the same beach along with the ashes of Maps, who had recently died while working as a priest in Africa helping refugees, and Lucy's ring that she gave to Maps on that holiday long ago.  He meets up with Spark and Spit, and they toss the ashes and ring loose into the wind from the hill above the beach, remembering Maps and their time there, with a cheer to "The December Boys."

While Nick and Brendan are driving home, they talk about the latter's potential future as a professional hockey player. They stop at a [[gas station]] in a bad part of town and during a robbery of the gas station, Joe Darley, a new gang member, slices Brendan's throat with a machete. Nick ambushes the thugs, pulls off Joe's mask and sees his face, but Joe escapes to get hit by a car. Nick rushes Brendan to the hospital, but Brendan dies.  Nick identifies Joe in a line-up, but while meeting with the district attorney, he becomes angry when the DA presents a case that the defense will cut a deal for three to five years of jail time. The DA explains that Nick is the only witness, there were no surveillance cameras, and the defense could gain sympathy for Darley. At a pre-trial hearing, Nick recants his identification so Joe will go free. He follows the gang to their hideout, returning later and stabbing Joe while he is alone. The gang leader, Billy, wants revenge. One of the gang members says his sister saw a man in a suit the night where Joe was killed.

Sitting on the same pew, Billy claims that he turned Nick into a vicious cold-blooded killer, just like him. Nick pulls out one of his guns and kills Billy.  With his family now avenged, Nick returns home, watches his own family's movies and awaits his inevitable arrest. Detective Wallis comes to arrest Nick, but informs him that Lucas has moved and will now live. Nick becomes relieved and looks at the television, which shows the family singing on the couch. Nick's final fate remains unknown.  === Alternative ending === In the extended version of the film, Nick succumbs to his injuries.

After being interrupted by a passing-by officer, the two resume their activity only for tentacles to erupt from Delia's chest.  In an Evolutionary Biology class held by Prof. Erwin Buckton (Tobin Bell), the first film's protagonist, Luke Callahan (Corey Sevier), is shown to have survived his encounter with Alex (Meghan Ory). Part of the class are Sam Compton (Tyler Johnston) and Stephanie Baxter (Kailin See). When Prof. Buckton's class ends, Luke sees from a distance one of the aliens he had a hand in killing previously: Constance Snowden (Kim Poirier). Constance now is under the guise of a doctor. He later visits his psychiatrist, Dr. Alana Geisner (Dina Meyer). Though he tells her the Aliens and the events of the first film are a product of his dreams and hallucinations instead of actual events, he reveals to her that he doesn't know how he survived, only that he woke up in a hospital days later being attended by a psychiatrist. Dr. Geisner hands Luke a full container of Anti-Hallucigens which only seems to make Luke more agitated.  Sam returns to his dorm room where his friends and dormmates - Henry Robbins, Peter Brunson and Nick Dean - hatch a sex-fuel competition to see who can hook-up with the most co-eds by the end of the summer with the winner earning a hefty sum of cash. It involves recording the event as proof while also keeping it all a big secret. Initially against the idea, Sam is convinced to join.  Another alien disguised as an attractive human female, Jasmine (Lindsay Maxwell), is caught speeding by the same officer from the start of the film. She seduces but accidentally kills the officer.  Luke mistakens Stephanie for Constance but is able to ease the situation. The two chat while heading for Stephanie's dorm about Constance which Luke says was a girl his best friend used to like but she did bad things to him. All the while Constance has been viewing them from a far. Now the leader of the Decoys, Constance warns her fellow Decoys, Jasmine and Delia, not to leave behind bodies for the police to find. Learning from Luke's survival, Constance deduces that their mates need to have passion and must be slowly aroused and excited even further. Using this tactic, the Decoys use their telepathy to figure out their intended mates fetishes and secret desires. Constance heads over to Prof. Buckton's office where she falsely warns him that Luke is a paranoid and delusional man obsessed with aliens. Buckton would later find Luke drawing remarkably detailed sketches of the Decoys with one looking very similar to Constance.  Sam, Henry, Peter and Nick head for a bar to initiate their competition. Only Nick succeeds. Later that night, Henry meets Delia who discovers his fetish of leopard skin clothes. In spite of it all, Henry resists her due to him being a virgin. An old friend of Sam's, Arnold Steiner, discovers the four's competition and persuades them to let him join. Despite having been told to keep it a secret, Arnold blurts it out to several of their male schoolmates who then want to partake. Arnold gets seduced by Jasmine. He borrows Sam's phone and follows Jasmine outside to the cold. Jasmine dresses up as a Dominatrix which has the desired effect the Decoys want. Jasmine successfully mates with Arnold but is interrupted by Sam who saw partial footage of Arnold in danger sent from his phone before it froze over. Sam finds a paralyzed Arnold and his phone and calls for the police. But Arnold's body ends up missing causing the police to dismiss Sam's call as a prank and claim that Arnold simply left.  Stephanie tells Sam of Luke's supposed hallucinations of the aliens and informs him that they are "allergic to fire". Peter encounters Delia who dresses up like a school girl. Delia fails in her attempt as Peter accidentally turns on the heating system. Peter relays what happened to Sam and Henry, saying that she was "allergic to fire". Sam rushes over to Stephanie's dorm and then they break into Luke's dormroom where they find multiple newspaper clippings about aliens and frozen bodies. Stephanie opens a window claiming, "It's too hot in here."  Luke has another appointment with Dr. Geisner who at first he suspected of being a Decoy. Dr. Geisner clears up that she isn't and that Luke can trust her. Luke meets Sam outside who reveals believes him. Luke sees Constance and chases after her but is hindered by Sam and a hospital guard. Dr. Geisner has him detained as a patient, but Sam would later sneak him out of the hospital.  Luke and Sam set out to find the Decoys in a Hawaiian theme party. The telltale sign being the lack of belly buttons. Sam finds a now blonde Stephanie dressed sexily being surrounded by boys. Stephanie takes Sam outside to the cold to escape the heat of the party. Meanwhile, Nick starts making out with Jasmine with Peter watching the live recording. Jasmine's tentacles burst from her chest but Nick is able to hold her off. Peter goes to get Sam and Henry for help. Sam luckily finds Stephanie's belly button. Stephanie realizes that Sam and Luke suspected her of being an alien and was about to walk away mad until Peter gets their attention. They see the footage of Nick being attacked by Jasmine. They arrive to Nick's aid and save him, as Jasmine takes off.  Luke realizes the Decoys have been using the hospital's morgue as a hideout and a nest due to the morgue being rarely used and cold. The group gathers some flares, prepares Molotov Cocktails and makes makeshift Flamethrowers using a lighter taped to a bottle of hairspray. In the hospital, Henry kills Delia, Peter and Nick kill Angeline, and Sam and Stephanie kill Jasmine for Arnold's sake. Dr. Geisner makes it in time to see the last Decoy Constance in her true form and assists Luke in killing her. Sam and Stephanie get together which makes Sam the winner since he actually got a girlfriend instead of a fling.  The group hear a sound from another room. There they find the missing victims including Prof. Buckton and Arnold who are still alive but cold and unconscious. Alien offspring soon start breaking out of their father's chests and the group is last heard screaming. The words "The End... Maybe" appear on screen before fading to black.

The Deaths of Ian Stone
 Ian Stone is an average man. He loves [[ice hockey]] but lives for his girlfriend, Jenny Walker. Late one night while driving home from a painful loss on the ice, Ian thinks he sees a dead body near the railroad tracks. Investigating the grisly discovery, Ian is attacked by the "corpse", forced onto the tracks and run over by a train.  He wakes up in an office cubicle. He is older and living with a beautiful woman named Medea. Jenny is not his girlfriend, just a co-worker, and one of a number of apparently familiar faces.  Ian meets a strange old man who tells him he is in danger. The old man tells him that he is being hunted by the Harvesters, a group of mind-controlling characters who cannot be killed and feed off human fear. He explains that every day, at different times and different places, the clocks stop and they come after him to kill him. The only problem is that Ian won't stay dead. He wakes in a new life, a new place, only for the cycle to repeat itself. Suddenly one of the Harvesters attacks the old man and Ian runs. They chase Ian back to his apartment where Medea, who is clearly one of them, is waiting. Once again, Ian is killed.  He wakes to find he is a junkie in a rundown apartment, with Jenny living a few doors down. He implores her to remember him, desperately reaching out and searching for someone to help him make sense of what's going on. When the Harvesters come again Jenny and Ian have no choice but to run. As they seek refuge on a subway train heading out of town, Jenny confesses to her memories of Ian's former lives. Later on, the old man meets Ian in the train again while Jenny sleeps. It is then that the old man reveals that he is one of the Harvesters, and hints at Ian's involvement with them.  When they disembark they are again confronted by a group of Harvesters, each a mass of pulsating veins, pitch-black muscles and flesh. Some of the barely human faces are recognizable from Ian's previous lives, including Medea who reveals a shocking truth: Ian was one of these monsters until he rebelled against the colony and managed to kill one other Harvester, and Medea used to be his "mate". Medea tries to force Ian to feed again and return to the "fold", but Ian resists.  Medea and the Harvesters attack once more, and she explains that his rebellion came after his first encounter with Jenny. So moved was he by the girl that he wished to live a mortal life with her. Before Medea can harm Jenny, however, a final change comes over Ian with the help of Gray, the old Harvester who had helped him before. Apparently Ian found a sustenance that was far superior to fear or pain, and so did the old man: love. Making this connection to a human being changes the specific nature of a Harvester, which allowed the old man (and now Ian) to kill the members of their kind. Gray had urged Ian to protect Jenny out of experience; having lost his love to the Harvesters, he could only feed on fear again and he spent what remained of his life slowly starving himself and trying to find love again. Gray implores Ian to feed from him and tap into those emotions of affection and kinship; Gray dies while restoring Ian. Ian regains his true power: his Harvester-self is finally born out of his human flesh, uniquely exuding goodness rather than malevolence. He now has the capacity to turn the tables on these creatures and to feed on their fear and to give life. He then rescues Jenny, who is being stalked by the clan.  Ian creates a new life for himself and Jenny, in which he is a successful professional hockey player with her at his side. Jenny has no recollection of their harrowing adventure; but Ian, having realized his abilities, will begin to take the fight to the Harvesters.

Delta Farce
 Larry ([[Larry the Cable Guy]]), Bill ([[Bill Engvall]]), and Everett ([[DJ Qualls]]) are three friends who each have their own shares of misfortune: Larry was a waiter who lost his job after attempting to publicly propose to his girlfriend (who turned out to be cheating on him) while on the job, causing him to insult a customer. Bill is living off a [[slip and fall]] lawsuit settlement, but is almost constantly berated by his wife over their living conditions (and implied to be unable to divorce due to his wife having [[blackmail]] against him), and Everett is an inept security guard who was fired after only four days as a police officer, after crashing his car at a nail salon. The three are members of the State Military Reserves, although their duties in the reserve consist mostly of drinking and partying at the reserve center once a month.  However, with manpower shortages from the [[Iraq War]], the three find themselves called to [[active duty]] to be deployed to the [[Fallujah during the Iraq War|occupation of Fallujah]]. The hard nosed Sergeant Kilgore ([[Keith David]]) is assigned to prepare them for activation and deployment. After a very brief period of training, they are loaded on a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]] transport plane bound for [[Iraq]].  During a thunderstorm over northern [[Mexico]], the transport pilots dump some of their cargo to reduce their load. Unfortunately, the three were asleep in the [[Humvee]] that was dropped and Sergeant Kilgore was pulled out along with the cargo as he was seeing where his men had gone. When the three wake up, seeing only desert around them, they believe they have arrived in Iraq. Sergeant Kilgore is knocked unconscious in the landing. The three believe he is dead and bury him in a very shallow grave, then proceed to drive off to search for [[Insurgency|insurgents]] and members of [[Al-Qaeda]] to attack. Shortly after they leave, Sergeant Kilgore regains consciousness, quickly climbs out of the very shallow grave and pursues his clueless subordinates.  The three soldiers quickly find themselves in the small village of La Miranda, believing they are helping the town fight off terrorists and insurgents. The village of La Miranda is being plagued by the attacks of a bandit gang led by Carlos Santana ([[Danny Trejo]]; a source of recurring humor is that he has the same name as [[Carlos Santana|the famous guitar player]]). Chasing away the bandits with a show of firepower, they become heroes to the villagers and capture a bandit to interrogate. Meanwhile, Sergeant Kilgore follows along the path of his subordinates, encountering significant misfortune.  While enjoying the hospitality of La Miranda, the men eventually realize they are in Mexico, not Iraq. Realizing the potential trouble they are in, the three men decide to return the favor to the villagers by helping them improve the village. Later, Bill sneaks away from town to call home and talk to his wife, while Larry and Everett prepare for the bandits to return. Bill is captured by Santana's gang, and in a showdown in La Miranda they recover him and chase Santana and his men away (although Sergeant Kilgore finally catches up, arriving at precisely the wrong moment and is captured by Santana).  The three soldiers then decide to deal with Santana and his men by following them to their hideout, where Santana's men engage in bizarre entertainment like forcing kidnapped comedians to perform for them and holding [[lucha libre]] matches. Everett distracts them by posing as a luchador while Larry and Bill rescue Sergeant Kilgore. Sergeant Kilgore and Bill then plant [[dynamite]] in their trucks while Larry rescues Everett as his distraction wears off. The group escapes as the trucks of the bandits explode.  Mustering everything they have to destroy the village of La Miranda, Santana's bandits ride into town on horseback, escorting a [[World War II]] surplus [[M4 Sherman|Sherman tank]]. The group manages to incapacitate the tank with a vintage cannon and rally the townsfolk to resist the bandits.  At that moment, military helicopters come over the horizon and a large number of American soldiers storm the town. Bill's wife has been calling the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]] and telling anyone who would listen about the three being stranded in Mexico, until they finally began searching for the group and found them. The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] has arranged for a cover-up to call the entire mishap "Operation Sombrero", a U.S. [[Counter-terrorism|anti-terrorism]] operation done with the (retroactive) permission of the Mexican government and Santana's gang labeled as terrorists.  In the end, all four receive the [[Silver Star]], and Bill receives the [[Purple Heart]] for being shot in the posterior during the final battle. Sergeant Kilgore creates a successful workout program in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], Everett becomes a popular professional wrestler in Mexico, Bill sues the Mexican government for his injuries and uses the money to buy a house in [[California]] and Larry founds his own restaurant in Mexico and marries Maria, the daughter of La Miranda's mayor. Carlos is sent into rehab and becomes a comedian.

But soon, she realizes she cannot camouflage her feelings towards Billu and enjoys being in the company of Billu and his friends, when the unexpected occurs.  Susi acts peculiar when a long-lost friend meets her at a restaurant. She denies knowing her, despite her friend Revathi’s ([[Meenal]]) attempts to talk to her. Feeling insulted, Revathi walks away, much to the dismay and confusion of Billu and his friends. Susi, who gets emotionally high-strung, leaves the restaurant in a jiffy too. Susi, at this juncture, comes out with the truth to Billu. Affected with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post traumatic event disorder]] after an accident, Susi has forgotten events that happened in a span of three years. Billu, who takes her to the doctor Devasaghayam ([[Raghuvaran]]), learns that this condition can be cured, but when she does get cured, Susi will not be in a position to remember whatever happened and whoever she met at Chennai - Billu included.  This disheartens Susi to a major extent, and she persuades Billu to promise her that he would never leave her, even if she were to forget him due to her condition. Billu promises her that he would never leave her, come whatever may. Billu’s conversation with Chidambaram infuriates the latter and he immediately arrives in Chennai with his goons. When he is all set to leave for Bangalore with his daughter, the residents rise to the occasion and flock against Chidambaram. Deciding to play it safe, Chidambaram agrees to the engagement between Billu and Susi, and cunningly, thrashes Billu after making him arrive at a place far from his locality, at the outskirts. The helpless Susi travels along with her father, escorted by his men, to Bangalore.  When Billu meets Susi at her residence, he gets nothing less than shocked as she has been cured, and she fails to recognize him. But Billu, who had given a word to his beloved that he would never leave her, is not the one to relent. How he tries relentlessly to convince her and what happens with Susi forms the rest of the story.

The Devil's Chair
 The film begins with Nick West lighting a cigarette in the dark and introducing himself to some unknown audience. He proceeds to recount the events he allegedly witnessed, claiming to be a "victim". It is implied that the whole story is told exclusively through his point of view.  Nick brings the easy and filthy Sammy to the abandoned Blackwater Asylum for using acid and having sex. They find a weird chair and Nick proposes kinky sex to Sammy; however the device traps and kills Sammy. Nick is arrested and considered insane, being sentenced to the Hildon Mental Institute in spite of claiming that supernatural forces killed Sammy. Four years later, the honorable Cambridge professor Dr. Willard proposes Nick's psychiatrist, Dr. Clairebourne (Nadja Brand), release him under his custody for an experimental treatment: exposing the truth to Nick by bringing him back to the crime scene. Dr. Clairebourne opposes, explaining that Nick still has severe delusions, but in the end she accepts. Nick is introduced to Dr. Willard, who expresses his desire to write a book about West and his experiences. With Dr. Willard assuming full responsibility for Nick, Dr. Willard, his assistant, Melissa, and the students Rachel Fowles and Brett Wilson, go with Nick to the Blackwater Asylum.  West begins to feel uneasy when the group enter the asylum, but a sympathetic Rachel tells him that he can leave tomorrow morning if he wants to, promising she won't tell the doctor. The group find the infamous chair. Dr. Willard reveals that the asylum warden was known to practice highly controversial methods of treatment. The night nears, and Dr. Willard tells everyone to go to sleep to have a fresh start tomorrow. In private, he confesses to Nick that the book he wants to write isn't actually about Nick, but about the chair. He admits to believing that Nick's "hallucinations" were actually real events. Willard shows him the warden's journal, from which he learned about the chair: it was used to test the warden's theory about the existence of the human soul. Nick becomes seemingly disturbed, as he says he actually came to believe he killed Sammy, but now isn't sure anymore.  As Nick is trying to sleep, he is approached by Rachel, who wants to prove to him that there is nothing supernatural about the chair. As she sits on it, she accidentally triggers the chair's controls and disappears. She is shown to have been transported into a dark building, where she is hunted by a demonic creature. Melissa persuades a skeptical Brett to sit in the chair, after which she triggers it, sending Brett into the same place as Rachel. Nick then willingly uses the chair to transport himself, believing he can save Rachel. The doctor and Melissa are shown to have plotted this all along. The events unfold quickly as Willard betrays Melissa, forcing her into the chair. He then transports himself. The group reunites as Rachel struggles against the creature. With the rest of the group incapacitated, the doctor subdues Nick and chants incantations, hoping to turn the beast to his side; however, Nick fights him off and, smiling, says that it is he who controls the Demon. In a plot twist, it is revealed that the chair itself and the demonic forces were just a product of Nick's imagination. It becomes evident that Nick assaulted the students and the doctor in the asylum, killing Brett. He then proceeds to rape Rachel and kill the doctor and Melissa. Lastly, he kills Rachel as she tries to escape.  After the massacre, a bloodied Nick gets into the car and chats with a woman who looks like Rachel sitting inside, asking her if she minds driving off with a "crazy person". She smiles and kisses him. However, the scene is then revealed to be another of Nick's hallucinations and he is then seen driving away from the asylum alone.

Adi tells Manav to steal a painting from the house. They decide to sell it to the son of the late Businessman Dwiwedi. But, however, Manav accidentally picks up a blank painting not knowing the reality. They humorously sell the painting for Rs.20,000 to him. They then pick up the original painting with the intention to sell it to Mr. Aggarwal not knowing that he has been murdered. The case is handled by Inspector Kulkarni. He learns that before Mr. Aggrawal was murdered he was speaking on the phone to somebody and he mentioned the words 'horse' and 'grass'. He interprets these words to be some code language. Unfortunately the four arrive at Agrawal's residence. Kulkarni demands to see the painting. Seeing the horse and grass he immediately arrests them.  While travelling on the highway Kulkarni drops the four on the road after realising that they are innocent. The four are overjoyed until they suddenly witness a car accident of  Don Bose. He tells them that he has hidden a treasure of 10 Crores in the St. Sebastian garden in [[Goa]] under a big 'W'. He tells them to divide the money equally among themselves and then dies. They come across Inspector Kabir Nayak who has been trying to arrest Bose for the past ten years. He tries to extract information from the four but in vain, they escape from there and decide to travel to Goa. Desperate for his promotion, Kabir is determined to capture the four. All four friends steal Boman's car which belongs to his father Nari ([[Asrani]]), who loves his car more than his son and threw his son out after he damaged his car. The friends manage to steal their car but not before hitting Nari on the head and making him unconscious. Unfortunately, Roy loses control of the car in a forest and hits it against a tree breaking both headlights. They decide to spend the night in the car. The next day Kabir is transferred to [[Yavatmal]] for failing to capture Bose. Furious he walks towards his table where Nari is waiting for him to file a complaint against his son for stealing his car. He gives Kabir the photos of Boman and his car. Meanwhile, all four come across a broken bridge which is the only way through the forest. They decide to jump the car but Boman is reluctant to do so. Unfortunately they manage to jump the car on the other side but it blasts off.  Kabir tracks the four down after discovering the destroyed car. He is able to learn the location of the treasure due to Manav's dumbness. He ties all four of them to a tree and sets off. However they manage to escape and it is revealed that Roy had actually cut the engine wires of Kabir's car so he must have not gone too far. They reach a dhabha and pretend to be detectives. They make the villagers believe that Kabir is a member of the Pasha gang and lures them to capture him for the reward would be Rs. 15 lakhs. Unfortunately Kabir defeats the villagers and he and the four arrive at a settlement - 60% would belong to the four and 40% would belong to Kabir. But Boman insists on having his money separately for damaging his car from the rest of the three. Consequently, a fight ensues and is decided that whoever reaches the treasure first would take all the money.  All four part ways and try to reach Goa as soon as possible. Roy encounters a dacoit Babubhai ([[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]]) and agree to divide the money among themselves provided they reach Goa as soon as possible. Boman also encounters his father. Though Nari initially wants to kill his son, changes his mind after he learns about the ten crores. Adi and Manav travel together. Kabir nearly escapes death as he hangs off a cliff and is rescued by some school children whose school bus he stole. All of them go through a series of humorous adventures before reaching Goa. Unfortunately all of them (except Kabir) reach the garden at the same time. Finally Roy explains that it is useless finding the treasure alone and all agree to find the money together. They all search for the big 'W'.  Manav is able to locate the Palm trees which make the shape of a 'W' when a crow poos on Adi. But Kabir arrives there and tells them to divide the money against them to which all agree. They dig there and are able to find the money. But again a fight ensues over the payment for the damage of the car. All are enraged when Adi and Manav decide to pay the money as one unit but are separate units while taking money. The fight goes on during which Kabir takes all the money and runs. He tries to escape in a hot air balloon on a beach but finds it tied to a pole. He dives in an effort to cut the rope but is beaten up by the rest who pursue him. The balloon blows off shore and all are disheartened.  Conditions change when the wind changes direction and the balloon again blows onshore. They follow the balloon in a towing van. The balloon clashes against a pole and the bag falls down. All of them try to collect as much money as they can when suddenly some spot lights focus on them and a crowd cheers loudly behind them. They are actually standing in stage where a function is being held by an organisation named 'Help Orphans'. Seeing the money everybody thinks they have come here to donate money. All of them get emotional and all decide to donate the money for the orphans. The film ends on a happy note conveying that the fate of the money was already decided. It never belonged to the four friends. They were just a medium which helped the money reach its true destination.

However, Noelle finally gives in to his request. They drive out to the desert and bunk down in a warehouse. Noelle does the deed, cooks his innards, eats him, and then steps out for a smoke. A man shows up at the warehouse looking for old furniture, wanders into the grisly scene, and calls the police.  
Disturbia (film)
 Troubled by the death of his father in an auto accident, Kale Brecht attacks his [[Spanish language|Spanish]] teacher when the teacher invokes his father while reprimanding him. For the assault, he is sentenced by a sympathetic judge to three months under [[house arrest]] with an [[ankle monitor]] and a [[proximity sensor]]. Detective Parker explains the system to Kale and his mother Julie. Initially, the teen just plays video games, but he is soon grounded by Julie and loses his access to the [[iTunes Music Store]], [[Xbox Live]], and his television.  Kale's boredom leads him to watch the neighborhood, including the two neighbor boys who play pranks on him, his next-door neighbor Robert Turner, and Ashley Carlson, the new girl in town. One night, Kale becomes suspicious of Robert Turner, who returns home in a 1967 [[Ford Mustang]] with a dented fender that matches the description given on a news report of a serial killer at large. Kale's best friend Ronnie visits to spy on Ashley and, when they accidentally alert her to their hijinks, the curious girl joins them in spying on Turner. Kale observes a young woman Turner had picked up from a nightclub as she flees the house in a panic but later appears to leave in her car.  Ashley throws a party and teases Kale, knowing he is watching. He plays non-party music loudly to needle her, and Ashley comes over to stop it. But the two flirt and start to make out, distracting each other while blood splatters on Turner's windows. Later, as Kale and Ashley watch, Turner drags a heavy bag to his garage. Kale gets Ashley to follow Turner, but he confronts her in her car with a calm, but threatening manner. Meanwhile, Ronnie successfully breaks into Turner's garage with a camera but gets trapped when the garage door closes. Kale leaves to rescue him but alerts the police upon leaving his property with the ankle monitor. The police come and search the garage but show Kale the bag contains a roadkill deer. Julie then goes across the street to talk to Turner to ask him not to press charges, while Ronnie reveals that he has escaped from Turner's house.  When Kale watches the tape Ronnie made in Turner's house, he notices a dead body in plastic in a vent. Next door, Turner takes Julie captive and enters Kale's house, knocking out Ronnie and binding and gagging Kale. The killer reveals his plan to frame Kale for the murders of Ronnie and Julie and make it appear Kale then committed suicide. When Ashley arrives, interrupting the plan, the two teens barricade themselves in a room, where Ashley unties Kale, and they flee out a window. Kale's ankle monitor again alerts the police, and he enters Turner's home to search for his mother. In a hidden room, Kale finds ample evidence of Turner's previous murders. The officer who monitors Kale arrives at the scene but is killed by Turner. Kale stumbles upon the decaying remains of murder victims and finds his mother bound and gagged. Turner appears and, in the ensuing confrontation, Kale fatally stabs him with a pair of gardening shears.  In the aftermath, Kale is shown having his ankle bracelet removed by the authorities for good behavior, getting back at the two boys from earlier pranks and making out with Ashley on his sofa, while Ronnie is playfully video taping them.  
The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)
 The first third of the film is told from the main character's, Jean-Dominique Bauby ([[Mathieu Amalric]]), or Jean-Do as his friends call him, first person perspective. The film opens as Bauby wakes from his three-week coma in a hospital in [[Berck-sur-Mer]], [[France]]. After an initial rather over-optimistic analysis from one doctor, a [[neurologist]] explains that he has [[locked-in syndrome]], an extremely rare condition in which the patient is almost completely physically paralyzed, but remains mentally normal. At first, the viewer primarily hears Bauby's "thoughts" (he thinks he is speaking but no one hears him), which are inaccessible to the other characters (who are seen through his one functioning eye).  A speech therapist and physical therapist try to help Bauby become as functional as possible. Bauby cannot speak, but he develops a [[Partner assisted scanning|system of communication]] with his [[speech and language therapist]] by blinking his left eye as she reads a list of letters to laboriously spell out his messages, letter by letter.  Gradually, the film's restricted point of view broadens out, and the viewer begins to see Bauby from "outside", in addition to experiencing incidents from his past, including a visit to [[Lourdes]]. He also fantasizes, imagining beaches, mountains, the [[Empress Eugénie]] and an erotic feast with one of his transcriptionists. It is revealed that Bauby had been editor of the popular French fashion magazine ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', and that he had a deal to write a book (which was originally going to be based on ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' but from a female perspective). He decides that he will still write a book, using his slow and exhausting communication technique. A woman from the publishing house with which Bauby had the original book contract is brought in to take dictation.  The new book explains what it is like to now be him, trapped in his body, which he sees as being within an old-fashioned deep-sea diving suit with a brass helmet, which is called a ''scaphandre'' in French, as in the original title. Others around see his spirit, still alive, as a "Butterfly".  The story of Bauby's writing is juxtaposed with his recollections and regrets until his stroke.  We see his three children, their mother (whom he never married), his mistress, his friends, and his father. He encounters people from his past whose lives bear similarities to his own "entrapment": a friend who was kidnapped in Beirut and held in solitary confinement for four years, and his own 92-year-old father, who is confined to his own apartment, because he is too frail to descend four flights of stairs.  Bauby eventually completes his memoir and hears the critics' responses. He dies of [[pneumonia]] ten days after its publication. The closing credits are accentuated by reversed shootings of breaking [[glacier]] ice (the forward versions are used in the opening credits), accompanied by the [[The Mescaleros|Joe Strummer & the Mescaleros]] song "Ramshackle Day Parade".  
Do It for Johnny
 With the help of their indie production team and Johnny Depp fans around the world, Garcia and Baxendale chronicle their quest to hand deliver the guitar and script to Johnny Depp, all the while filming their journey.  
Doctor Bari
 The film is about three doctors.  
Dororo
 ''Dororo'' is a thriller [[manga]], which revolves around a ''[[rōnin]]'' named   and young orphan thief named  during the [[Sengoku period]]. The un-named child was born malformed, limbless and without facial features or internal organs. This was the result of his birth father ''[[daimyō]]'' Daigō Kagemitsu forging a pact with 48 sealed [[demon]]s so that he might rule the world. In return, he promised the demons could each obtain a piece of his unborn child's body. This enabled them to roam free and commit atrocities along the countryside.  After his mother was forced to set him adrift on the river, lest he be killed by his father, the infant was subsequently found and raised by Dr. Jukai, a medicine man who used healing magic and alchemical methods to give the child [[prostheses]] crafted from the remains of children who had died in the war. The boy became nearly invincible against any mortal blow as a result of the prostheses and healing magic. Grafted into his left arm was a very special blade that a travelling storyteller presented to Dr. Jukai, believing it was fated to be within his possession given that ever since the boy had been discovered, the doctor had been visited by [[goblin]]s. As revealed in a short tale about the blade's origin, the blade had been forged out of vengeance to kill goblins as well as other supernatural entities.  After the doctor was forced to send him on his way because he was attracting demons, the young man learned from a ghostly voice of the curse that had been set upon him at birth and that by killing the demons responsible he could reclaim the stolen pieces of his body and thus regain his humanity. Across his travels, he earned the name  among other names for his inhuman nature. On one such hunt of a demon, Hyakkimaru came across a young orphan thief named Dororo who thereafter travels by his side through the war-torn countryside. When Hyakkimaru met Dororo, he had already killed 15 demons.  Throughout their journey, Hyakkimaru killed 6 more demons, bringing the total to 21. Along the way, Hyakkimaru learns that Dororo was hiding a big secret. Dororo's father, Bandit Hibukuro, hid money he saved up on his raids on Bone Cape to later be distributed to the people squeezed dry by the samurai. Itachi, a bandit who betrayed Hibukuro and sided with the authorities, crippled Hibukuro. Hibukuro escaped with limping legs, along with his wife and young Dororo. Hibukuro dies trying to let his family escape. Fearing that she will die, Dororo's mother prayed to [[Buddha]] and, with her blood, drew the map that will lead him to Bone Cape. Three days later, she froze to death.  With Hibukuro out of the way, Itachi kidnapped Dororo. He knew about the map on Dororo's back which lead them to the Cape. They had a mysterious [[Sailor|boatman]] ferry them to the Cape but unbeknownst to them, he had two demon sharks with him. One of the [[shark]]s ate half of Itachi's bandits while the other shark left with the boatman, leaving them stranded with a shark. With half of Itachi's bandits dead from a demon shark, Dororo and the remaining bandits managed to kill the shark. The boatman and the second shark caught up with Dororo and the bandits. Dororo was able to separate the boatman and the shark. Hyakkimaru caught up with struggle and used his sword to stab the shark in one of its eyes. It escaped. They held the boatman as prisoner. Then they landed on Bone Cape.  As time flew by and night fell, the bandits were getting thirsty. The boatman told them of a spring not too far from their camp. The rest of the bandits — except for Itachi, Dororo, the boatman, and Hyakkimaru — left to drink from the well. Later, when Dororo went to check on them, he found corpses and blood leading to the half-blind shark. Dororo telepathically told Hyakkimaru of the deaths and he came, ready to kill the shark. Hyakkimaru killed the shark and the boatman and left them drift at sea. Hyakkimaru got his real voice back.  With the demons out of the way, Itachi went to search for the money but only found a letter, stating that Hibukuro thought Itachi might come looking for the treasure so he hid it somewhere else. As the sun rises, the [[Magistrate]] under the pretense of getting rid of the bandits but in actually, came for the treasure. Hyakkimaru, Dororo, and Itachi were able to kill them. Itachi was left for dead, and Hyakkimaru and Dororo continued on their journey.  Some time passes. When Hyakkimaru learns that his father, Daigo Kagemitsu, was possessed by the 48 demons, he went to try and slay them. Things were bad on Daigo's land; citizens were forced to build a [[fort]] for him. Behind Daigo's back, the slaves were planning a rebellion but one of the slaves told Daigo of their plans. The slaves would run when a fire signal was lit. Daigo was ready. As the slaves ran, his [[Archery|archer]]s shoot and killed many. The remaining slaves hid in a tunnel they built under the fort.  Hyakkimaru forcefully separated Dororo and ran in the fort. Dororo was caught by the slaves and joined them in their ambush. Daigo's soldiers caught Dororo. Daigo told Hyakkimaru to kill him and Daigo will gain his trust. Hyakkimaru acted as he is about to kill Dororo but turned around and threw his sword into the dark. The thing he stabbed was the physical manifestation of the 48 demons. Hyakkimaru was able to kill it but some of the demons managed to escape. With the slaves entering through the tunnel, they were able to open up the big entrance doors and attacked Daigo's soldiers. Daigo, too weak from more than half of the demons dead, left with his wife to someplace far away.  Hyakkimaru parted with Dororo. He wanted Dororo, who was actually a female disguised as a male, to grow up to be a beautiful lady. Hyakkimaru also wanted Dororo to fight alongside the farmers against those in power because Dororo's father was a farmer. Hyakkimaru gave his sword, the one that Dororo wanted throughout the series, to Dororo. Hyakkimaru will continue his journey alone and they will meet again when Hyakkimaru's body is whole. They parted, with Dororo crying at the doors. It wasn't until 50 years later when the last of the 48 demons was slain.  
Doraemon: Nobita's New Great Adventure into the Underworld
 Frustrated by the multitude of problems at school and at home, Nobita wonders if his life would be easier if magic really existed. He then asks Doraemon for his what-if-telephone-booth gadget which allows both to go to a parallel world where magic is ordinary to all. In the fascinating alternate reality, they find out that a demonic planet is approaching and threatens the lives of everyone over there. moni , Nobita, and their friends must then find a hidden tome written by a wizard that defeated a similar menace a long time ago.  The story begins with Professor Mangetsu, a Japanese [[astrophysicist]] and his daughter, Miyoko, are informed and startled about the approach of a giant black hole that previously destroyed the space probe Voyager 5. It is confirmed that this black hole will completely destroy Earth and its inhabitants.  Back to Nobita's house, the boy is bored of the real world and wish for the existence of a Magical world where he can use magic to solve everything. However, Doraemon states that magic is just a superstition and there is no way such world could be created. At the same time when they re-enter their room, a life-sized statue of Doraemon fell down from the sky, which staggered both. As they fix the problems, Gian and Suneo call them as they found another statue of Nobita out on the field. Doraemon and Nobita are confused and choose to leave these statues in their backyard. Until night, the family was surprised when the statues appear inside of the house, in another standing position. Doraemon and Nobita don't have time to find out the truth, so they simply put the statues in Doraemon's magic pocket. At midnight, Doraemon suddenly catches a stomachache and rushes to the future to check, where his pain stops and he denies to have a scan through to detect the problem. He returns to the 21st century, where Nobita tells him that they can use the "What if" Telephone Booth to materialize a Magic World.  Yet, as the world fills with magic, Nobita discovers that they can't still use magic, since magic, just like science, is what they need to learn. He is bored again, and wants to return to normal world. Yet, as Gian and Suneo tease him on his disability of riding a broom, he is motivated and gets into magic training. After all, what he could do was blowing Shizuka's skirt up. When they finish training, the flock sees a falling object coming down to Earth. They fly there to examine, where they meet Miyoko, now is a high-class magic user and who saves moni and ali from the attack of a demonic monkey. She leads them back to her house, where her father reveals the approach of Magic Planet, which will destroy Earth very soon. He also reveals the secret of Miyoko's mom, which she has dealt with the Demon King to save Miyoko from a deadly disease. The only way to save Earth, according to Professor Mangetsu, is noted in the tome of magic, written by Nirnaeth, a man who borrowed powers from the Moon, and hidden somewhere on Earth.  Satisfied of what he achieved, Nobita wishes to go back to normal world. But as they arrived home, they were terrified when the Booth has been dumped by their mom and totally broken. The two got into conflict. Later, an earthquake erupts and as the news are cast, Doraemon and Nobita head to Miyoko's home, where they save Miyoko from being killed by a dragon. Miyoko then reveals that her father has been taken to the Magic Planet, and she escaped due to luck, and asks for helps from Doraemon and Nobita to save her father. Eventually, she leaves alone as she doesn't want to endanger her friends.  As natural disasters occur more and more, Doraemon's group decides to help Miyoko to find the tome to defeat the demons. However, as they possess the tome, Miyako then strikes at Gian to get the tome, and discloses her disguise and shows herself as Medusa, a demoness under control of the Demon King. She can't reach the tome under protection of the anti-demon power source, so she has taken advantage of Doraemon's group to help her possess the secret paper. She forms a glacier, trying to kill the group by locking them under very cold temperature. Yet, the group escapes. They also find that the tome was actually divided into two halves, which provides them a fortunate chance to save Earth. At instance, they found Miyoko in the appearance of a mouse, whose curse is cured under the moon. As Doraemon has the fear of mice, the group casts different spells to turn Miyoko into a cat, as their power can't lift the curse. United, they then go to Magic Planet to defeat the Demon King and rescue Miyoko's father.  The group manages to break into the Demon Castle, armed with silver arrows to kill the Demon King by shooting the arrows into his heart, and Moon Torch Light for defense. However, for a reason they don't know, the arrows don't work and they are chased away. Only Nobita and Doraemon manage to escape while the rest are captured and locked inside the Castle. Doraemon figures out that they can redo everything by going back in time to stop themselves from requesting to change the real world into magic world. Nevertheless, they end up being chalked in stone by Medusa, who followed them through the Time and Space Continuum.  Doraemi, Doraemon's sister, discovers the statues of later Doraemon and Nobita inside the pocket of earlier Doraemon, and uses the Time Cape to bring the statues back to their normal forms. Cheerful, Doraemon and Nobita plan to use Doraemi's Phone Booth to return to the real world. But Nobita, who realizes that the world will still be threatened even when they go back to normal, decides to stay and finish the battle with the Demon King. They arrive on the Magic Planet again and rescue their friends, including Miyoko and Professor Mangetsu. They then head to the moon, where they believe Medusa has been to and trying to destroy the moon guarding power. The Demon King, enraged by the actions of Doraemon's group, bring his whole army to invade Earth at once.  At the moon, Doraemon's group fails to stop Medusa from destroying the moon's power that protects the Earth. The energy flow flushes out so powerfully that it destroys the demonic form of Medusa, revealing that she is Miyoko's mother. Miyoko and Professor Mangetsu, weep when knowing the truth, and moni's mother tells that her soul has been taken away when she dealt with the Demon King, so she can't exist for long in human form. She also reveals that there is a red moon on Magic Planet, which is the Demon King's heart, explaining the reason why the arrows didn't successfully kill the Demon King at the first opportunity. She then disappears, with Miyoko and her father remain crying. The group, on the flying carpet, then race to the approaching Magic Planet in order to destroy the heart of the Demon King. It was nearly impossible at the first moment as the demon army is too many and the group is surrounded. Doraemon suddenly comes up with a brilliant idea. He casts the Everywhere Door into space to go through, and they reappear close to the Demon King's heart. Nobita throws the arrow that has been enlarged by Enlarging Torch Light, and they successfully destroy the heart, along with the Magic Planet and the whole demonic army like [[Big Bang]].  At the credit, when the final song takes place, they return to Earth and rebuild Miyoko's home, with Miyoko bidding the group farewell. In the real world, Miyoko and her father, and the whole space center are happy to see the black hole vanished before reaching Earth. Nobita then reorders the real world, in which they nearly forget everything about the magic world, and even think that it was just a dream. Nobita tries to cast a spell, and surprisingly blows Shizuka's skirt up once again. He thinks it was because of wind, but a scene of a broom on the treetop (the one they used in an attempt to escape Medusa) is shown, stating that everything really happened.  
Don (2007 film)
 The story begins when a teen named Suri escapes and finds a drug dealer tormenting some little boys. Suri guns down the drug dealer. One of the boys, Raghava, expresses his wish to join him. The rest of the boys become Suri's helpers and eventually his henchmen.  The film continues 20 years later with Suri ([[Akkineni Nagarjuna]]) and Raghava ([[Raghava Lawrence]]), and with the establishment of the fact that Suri is the don with a golden heart. Then, of course, he has Raghava as his sidekick who adores him to death. Together, they rule the underworld of Andhra Pradesh. Since Suri is the unopposed kingpin, he even has time for a song and dance on his birthday with his basti people. Everything is peaceful and hunky dory. But only until Stephen/Feroz ([[Kelly Dorjee]]) enters the scene. He is a feared don throughout India who wants to add Andhra Pradesh to his underworld fiefdom. That’s what sets off the battle of the dons.  Suri refuses to work with Stephen/Feroz, which upsets him. In many attempts to kill Suri, Stephen's/Feroz's men get killed. Rathnam ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) wants to kill Raghava. Suri lets Raghava kill Rathnam because Rathnam hosted a hideout for Stephen's/Feroz's men in Hyderabad. Meanwhile, Suri falls in love with Priya ([[Anushka Shetty]]) (because of the three things he wants in his wife: to be kind, beautiful, and not afraid of him). At first, she doesn't like him, but later she also begins to like him.  Raghava also finds a girl he likes. In that process, he is cornered, where his fiancé Nandhini ([[Nikita Thukral]]) ends up being on the villains side. Raghava is killed.

Determined to win, Suri continues the fight and thrashes up Stephen/Feroz and his two well-trained women bodyguards. The fight ends with Stephen/Feroz getting killed by Suri, and he warns Stephen's/Feroz's remaining men not to be like their boss, or else they will end up like him.  
Dog Days of Summer (film)
 ''Dog Days of Summer'' opens with adult Philip Walden paying a visit to the unnamed town where he grew up. In a voiceover, he expresses his disgust over the ramshackle, broken down state of things, and, with trepidation, recalls "the summer I unwillingly grew up."  That summer kicked off with the arrival of Eli (Will Patton), as witnessed by preteen Philip (Devon Gearhart) and best friend Jackson (Colin Ford). The two boys stare in awe as Eli tumbles out of his ancient-looking car and invite the townsfolk over to look at his amazing model circus.  It's not long before Eli convinces the mayor to pay him to create a scale model of the town for the upcoming bisesquicentennial. Philip and Jackson, both dealing with troubles at home, glom onto Eli, using his old camera to take pictures of the town for Eli to use as inspiration. Despite its picture-perfect surface, Philip's town is anything but idyllic. His father is a minister, but not exactly the heroic kind—more the philandering kind. Jackson's blind father drinks his life away, mourning the loss of Jackson's mother to a car crash. Both boys are lost in a sea of adult emotions, with neither the maturity nor the resources to cope. As the boys take pictures for Eli, they watch the lives of those they love unraveling around them, and struggle to hang onto their dream of an uncomplicated life where the sun is always high and the river is filled with fish...  
Dog Altogether
 ''Dog Altogether'' is the story of Joseph ([[Peter Mullan]]), a man who is plagued by a violence and rage that is driving him to self-destruction. As he falls further into turmoil, Joseph scours the landscape in search of a single grain of redemption that might restore hope to his fractured life.  
Donkey Xote
 The film begins with a narration of the story as told by Cervantes, but the narrator is interrupted by the donkey Rucio ([[Luis Posada]]) who insists on telling the "true" story of the adventure: Don Quixote ([[José Luis Gil]]) was not crazy, but in fact an intelligent and passionate person. In Rucio's re-telling of his adventure with Don Quixote and his squire, Sancho Panza ([[Andreu Buenafuente]]), we learn that Rucio wishes he were Quixote's horse, and that the horse, Rocinante ([[David Fernández (actor)|David Fernández]]), hates leaving his stable.  As it develops, Dulcinea ([[Sonia Ferrer]]) has a difficult time choosing between the knight and his wealthy sidekick. The rivalry between Quixote and Panza leads the two on a journey across Spain to Barcelona as they both vie for the beautiful woman's affections. To defend his honor among the imposters, the real Quixote must duel and win against the Knight of the Moon in order to learn the true identity of Dulcinea.  
Dorm of the Dead
 A professor returns to Arkham University with the blood of a zombie.  As he tests it on the students, Amy accidentally initiates a zombie attack.  During the confusion, bully Clare targets goths Sarah and Allison for involuntary conversion into zombies.  
Dororo (film)
 The film's storyline has some major differences from that of the manga, most notably Dororo being a young woman, as envisioned in the video game, assuming the identity of a man. It is unclear if (s)he truly identifies as male, as in the manga, or feels pressured into fulfilling the role due to previous life experiences. In spite of others seeing through his brash and often violent exterior, Dororo rarely concedes to his true emotions and refuses to be a "proper" woman. Hyakkimaru and Dororo are significantly older than their manga incarnations, as well.  When her father was killed by Daigo when he attempted to call the warlord out, a girl and her mother escaped into the wilderness. At her mother's dying request, in order to carry on her father's insurmountable vendetta against Daigo, the child takes on a man's identity and grows up without a permanent home or any friends. As a result, he becomes a thief to make a living. Throughout his life, he's denied any name, citing that the best thieves never revealed their names as doing so meant they could be hunted and arrested. Only after travelling with Hyakkimaru does he decide to take on the name "Dororo", as that name had been one of many that Hyakkimaru had acquired during his previous travels. Although Hyakkimaru explained it as meaning "Little Monster," Dororo felt that it suited him better while Hyakkimaru kept his previous name.  Abandoned at birth, Hyakkimaru's body was sold to demons by his birth father, resulting in his lacking 48 body parts. He only survives because he is discovered by a master spellcaster, who takes pity on him and replaces his missing body parts with those of deceased children. From a young age, Hyakkimaru attracts a disproportionate amount of attention from supernatural beings, especially malignant ones. This supernatural magnetism results in the death of his adopted father. Hyakkimaru is emotionally destroyed but begins questing to destroy the demons and regain the body stolen from him at birth.  Among the demons Hyakkimaru encounters are a [[Jorōgumo]], the moth demoness  who abducted abandoned children in order to feed her Hanyō offspring, a cherry blossom tree monster and a lizard monster. After killing a [[Daitengu]] and regaining his right arm, Hyakkimaru learns that his curse was his birth father's doing and this man was in fact Daigo. Killing a pair of dog demons who tormented him about this revelation, Hyakkimaru gains his real eyes and is later confronted at daybreak by Tahōmaru, the man he learned to be his younger brother. Expressing jealous rage towards Hyakkimaru due to their mother's feelings for him, Tahōmaru's resulting anger brings about a confrontation in which he is accidentally killed by Hyakkimaru. By then, Daigo arrives and cuts down his wife while she, despite her own despair over Tahōmaru's death, tries to persuade Daigo to spare Hyakkimaru's life, now their only living son. Though he came close to killing his father, Hyakkimaru refused and spared his father while telling him to strive for and create the utopia that Tahōmaru had once envisioned. However, with the promise of reviving Tahōmaru from the dead, Daigo sold his body to one of the demons with whom he made the original pact. Dororo tried to convince Daigo not to do it, telling him that the demon would use his body to rule the land and cause greater despair and suffering among the people. Daigo accepted the proposal nonetheless, but was able to muster enough control to hold the monster at bay for Hyakkimaru to kill him. Once dead, Hyakkimaru regained his heart, yet complained that the pain in his chest did not subside afterward, an indication that he was feeling remorse for the first time in his life. Though later offered the throne, Hyakkimaru declines and entrusts his brother with it as he and Dororo continue their quest to kill the remaining 24 demons.  
Don't Waste Your Time, Johnny!
   
Dreamland (2007 film)
 In the Nevada mountains between Las Vegas and Reno in the desolate nuclear testing grounds of Dreamland ([[Area 51]]), a young couple Megan ([[Jackie Kreisler]]) and Dylan ([[Shane Elliott]]) stop in a greasy spoon cafe where they learn about the Area 51 government base a few miles away. After they get back on the road, Dylan turns on the radio.  The only broadcast he can find is a speech from [[Adolf Hitler]] at the 1936 Olympic Games. The car dies and a visitor appears from another moment in time. When Megan and Dylan look closely they realize that it is Hitler from the past. Past and present intersect throughout the film. Demonic versions of those long dead are also encountered.  
Drive-Thru (film)
  Brandon Meeks (Edward DeRuiter), Tony (Haven Lamoureux) and their girlfriends, Brittany (Jessica Landon) and Tiffany (Nicole Cavazos) arrive at the fast food restaurant "Hella Burger". Upon placing an order at the drive-thru, the group are introduced to the restaurant's mascot, Horny the Clown (voiced by Gordon Clapp) via intercom. The group is continuously insulted after Brandon mouths off to him, causing a furious Tony to enter.  He searches the restaurant and hears a commotion coming from the kitchen. After looking around in the walk-in cooler, Horny suddenly jumps out and attacks him across the room before dunking him face first in the deep fryer. Brandon soon enters, only to find Tony dead in the deep fryer with his face burnt off, much to his horror. He is then attacked and murdered by Horny with a [[Cleaver (knife)|meat cleaver]]. Horny then proceeds outside and brutally murders Brittany and Tiffany when they discover the bodies of their boyfriends in the backseat.  Meanwhile, Mackenzie ([[Leighton Meester]]) is having a house party with her boyfriend Fisher ([[Nicholas D'Agosto]]), and friends Val (Sita Young), Van ([[Penn Badgley]]) and Starfire ([[Rachael Bella]]). The group find a [[ouija board]] and decide to ask it what their future will hold, to which the ouija board spells out "N1KLPL8", a message that is unclear until the next day when the group see a news bulletin, showing the message is the license plate on Brandon's car. The following day at school, Val is ambushed by Horny in the locker room. Mackenzie complains that someone stole her camera at the party, but after school the janitor, Eddie ([[Sean Whalen]]), gives her the camera.  Mackenzie stays behind to develop the photos, and discovers that they show the deaths of the four murdered teenagers. Horny chases Mackenzie into the gymnasium, where she finds Val's head has been placed in a modified microwave, that when turned on causes her head to explode. Horny chases Mackenzie throughout the school, where she finds Lenny has been hanged, before bumping into a police officer, who fails to find any bodies. Mackenzie is taken down to the police station with her mom, Marcia ([[Melora Hardin]]) and dad, Bill ([[Paul Ganus]]) to be questioned by Detective Brenda Chase ([[Lola Glaudini]]) and Detective Dwayne Crockers ([[Larry Joe Campbell]]). The two detectives don't believe Mackenzie's story, but do suspect Lenny as the killer.  The next day, the detectives visit Jack Benjamin (John Gilbert), the owner of Hella Burger, who proves to be no help in solving the case. That night, Mackenzie and Fisher get ready to work at a carnival's haunted house.

Jarrod is more interested in Lily's workmate, Jenny ([[Chelsie Preston Crayford]]). With Jenny not at work one day, Jarrod gives Lily an invitation to his "dress as your favourite animal" party to pass along to her, but Jenny crumples it up and throws it away upon receiving it. Lily retrieves it from the rubbish.  The party is sparsely attended with what are apparently teenage and adult customers of Jarrod's store, all dressed extravagantly as their favourite animal. Jarrod is impressed with Lily's shark costume as well as her savant-like [[video game]] skills, making it to the finals of a ''Fight Man'' video game competition, though she loses to defending champion, Jarrod because she spends their contest staring at him. They go to Jarrod's room and he questions Lily and learns her parents are dead, having had heart attacks. He says both his brother, Gordon, and his mother are dead. He says his mother died by getting kicked in the head by a cow. They kiss and have brief sex.  Lily now considers Jarrod her boyfriend and hangs out around his shop. They set a date one night to see a film at the local cinema. Jarrod fails to turn up. He comes by Lily's house later that night to apologize, saying he was depressed and needed to be alone. He later says that he has to kill a man in his hometown who used to bully him in high school, but laments he has no car to get there. Lily asks her brother Damon, and he agrees to drive Jarrod and Lily to Jarrod's home.  On the way to Jarrod's home town, Damon offers Lily and Jarrod apples to eat. Jarrod takes a bite only to discover his apple is rotten. He throws it out the window into a river they are driving past. This apple then becomes the representation of Jarrod in several [[claymation]] scenes of the film. Upon arriving, Damon and Lily discover that the family is just as bizarre as Jarrod himself. Jarrod's sister (Nancy) and brother-in-law (Doug) seem to sell all kinds of "sell from home products", like questionable [[make-up]] kits, knives and their own athletic jumpsuit [[clothing line]] "Awesome apparel". Jarrod's dad, Jonah, is a withdrawn man in a wheelchair.  Jarrod spends his time alternating between trying to win his dad's affection and training for his impending fight with his high school bully Eric Elisi. It becomes clear his father loved his other son Gordon much more than Jarrod. Gordon was very successful, winning many ribbons, especially in running. When Lily asks how Gordon died, Jarrod says that he died saving a kid from a fire at the school. Lily meets with Mason—Jarrod's best friend and computer geek—to find out that Eric will return from Samoa the next day. The three then creep up to Eric's house to drop off Jarrod's invitation to the fight between the two of them.  Gordon's fiancee, Tracy, comes over. She seems to be a person of similar success to Gordon and Jarrod's father even loves her more than Jarrod. Jarrod tries to impress his father with the news he's dating Lily, but father isn't impressed. The two go to the beach and Lily finds a rock shaped like a heart that she shows Jarrod. He tells her that he must break up with her, as he's too busy with the revenge mission and "too complex" for a relationship. Lily is visibly upset but tries to hide it. Jarrod takes flowers over to Tracy's house and spends the day with her on the beach trying to impress her with his "fighting skills". She isn't impressed.  Meanwhile, it's been revealed that Jarrod has a little girl from a random sexual encounter at a party, who is nine whom he sees only occasionally. Lily and the girl walk with Jonah around town coming to a hill. He refuses to go any farther, holding the wheels of his wheelchair and finally getting up out of his wheelchair and walking himself and his wheelchair home, exposing that he doesn't need it. Lily and the girl continue up the hill where the girl says that "That's where my Uncle Gordon died", revealing that Gordon did not die saving a child from a fire as Jarrod had said, but by committing suicide.  They return home and the family eats dinner. Lily tells a silly joke and the whole group gets along very well. Jarrod comes home to find the group laughing and then kills the mood by saying that he'd been with Tracy all day and that they'd been laughing harder. Jarrod's father Jonah spends most of his time watching an old tape of Gordon winning a cross country meet and reliving the victory that he felt at that time. In the video, Gordon wins the race and is congratulated obsessively by his father. Tracy comes over and the two are celebrating. Jarrod then attempts to come over and is pushed away by the father. Seeing his father watching this and feeling even more alienated, Jarrod falsely announces that he is dating Tracy. Jonah is crushed. Lily, annoyed by this, leaves the house and takes her [[sleeping bag]] from the tent, choosing to sleep over on the other side of the yard instead, stubbornly refusing Jarrod's offer to use it. He moves the tent to her and sleeps inside it, although it collapses on top of him.  Annoyed by Jarrod's behavior, Lily decides to go with Doug and Nancy to a local party. She gets very drunk and dances with a lot of boys while Jarrod jealously looks on. Eventually, she runs off, ripping off all her clothes and sleeping in the bushes somewhere. In the morning, she returns, and Jarrod tells her he didn't get any sleep that night worrying about her.  That afternoon, Jarrod, with his family and friends watching, confronts Eric and finds out that Eric is paralyzed and uses a [[wheelchair]].  Eric apologizes for how he bullied him in high school, but Jarrod attacks him anyway with a set of [[nunchucks]]. Despite his condition, Eric is able to easily wrestle Jarrod to the ground and only relents in his attacks when Jarrod's father tells him to leave him alone.  Jarrod is depressed about his fight with Eric but Lily finds him and attempts to cheer him up. Lily tells him she is leaving for home on the following day—but that could change. At the bus stop, Jarrod is waiting for her, presenting her with a bouquet of [[Lily|lilies]]. They reconcile and journey back on a bus together.

Lotte, a university student, offers to help her with food, clothes, and a place to stay—a gesture which is not particularly welcomed by her mother, Susanne. Ayten and Lotte become lovers and Lotte decides to help Ayten search for her mother. The quest is cut short when a traffic stop exposes Ayten's illegal status and she attempts a claim of [[Right of asylum|political asylum]]. Despite Susanne's financial support, Germany rules that Ayten has no legitimate fear of political persecution. She is deported and immediately imprisoned.  Lotte is devastated. She travels to Turkey to try to free Ayten, but quickly realizes how little hope there is, as she is facing 15 to 20 years in jail. Susanne pleads with her to think of her future and return home. When Lotte refuses, her mother denies her any further assistance. Lotte gravitates to Nejat's bookstore and ends up renting a spare room from him.  Finally granted a prison visit with Ayten, Lotte complies with her imprisoned lover's request and retrieves the handgun Ayten grabbed in the riot. But Lotte's bag, with the gun inside, is snatched by a crew of boys that she then chases through their neighborhood. When finally she finds them in a vacant lot, one of them is inspecting the gun. She demands he return it, but he points it at her and fires, killing her instantly.  ;The Edge of Heaven (literally, On the Other Side) Upon his release, Ali is deported to Turkey, returning to his property in [[Trabzon]] on the Black Sea coast.  After her daughter's death, Susanne goes to Istanbul to see where her daughter had been living the past few months. She meets Nejat and reads her daughter's diary; she decides to take on her daughter's mission of freeing Ayten from prison. Susanne's visit to Ayten—an offer of forgiveness and support—leads the younger woman to exercise her right of repentance. As a result, she wins her freedom.  Susanne asks Nejat about the story behind a [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayram]] festival they hear about, learning that it commemorates [[Islamic view of Abraham#The Sacrifice|Ibrahim's sacrifice of his son Ishmael]]. She comments that there is the same story in [[Book of Genesis|the Bible]], where [[Abraham]] is asked to sacrifice his son Isaac. Nejat reminisces about being scared by the story as a child and asking his father if he would sacrifice him if God told him to. When asked by Susanne what his father's answer was, Nejat tells her that his father said "He would make God his enemy in order to protect me."  Nejat removes the flyer of Yeter from the shop's noticeboard. He asks Susanne to look after his shop while he is gone, and drives to Trabzon, where his father is living.  Susanne offers Ayten a place to stay with her at Nejat's house. When Nejat arrives in Trabzon, his father is out fishing, so he waits for him on the beach.  
Earth (2007 film)
 Over the course of a calendar year, ''Earth'' takes the viewer on a journey from the [[North Pole]] in January to the [[South Pole|South]] in December, revealing how plants and animals respond to the power of the sun and the changing seasons. The film focuses on three particular species, the [[polar bear]], [[African bush elephant]] and [[humpback whale]].  Starting in the high [[Arctic]] in January, as the darkness of winter gives way to the sun, a mother polar bear is shown emerging from her den with two new cubs. She needs food and must lead her cubs to her hunting ground on the [[sea ice]] before it begins to break up. By April, the sun never sets, and by August all the sea ice has melted. The mother and cubs have retreated to dry land, but a male polar bear is trapped at sea and must seek out land by swimming. He reaches an island with a [[walrus]] colony but is too exhausted to make a successful kill. He dies from injuries sustained in a walrus attack.  African bush elephants are filmed from the air as they negotiate a [[dust storm]] in the [[Kalahari Desert]]. June is the dry season and they must follow ancient paths passed down through generations to reach watering holes. A mother and calf are separated from the herd in the storm but manage to reach shelter. The matriarch leads the herd to a temporary watering hole, but they must share it with hungry [[lion]]s and scavenger [[white-backed vulture]]s. The lions are shown attacking a solitary elephant at night, when their superior vision gives them the upper hand. The herd times its arrival at the [[Okavango Delta]] to coincide with seasonal floodwaters which transform the desert into a lush water world.  A humpback whale mother and calf are filmed from the air and underwater at their breeding grounds in the shallow seas of the [[tropics]]. There is nothing here for the mother to eat, so she must guide her calf on a  journey south to the rich feeding grounds near [[Antarctica]], the longest migration of any marine mammal. En route, they navigate dangerous seas where [[great white shark]]s are filmed breaching as they hunt. [[Sea lion]]s, and [[sailfish]] and [[dolphin]]s combine to bait a shoal of small fish. By October they enter polar waters, and by December the Antarctic sun has melted the sea ice to form sheltered bays. Here, the whales are shown feeding on [[krill]] by trapping them in bubble nets.  The stories of these individual creatures are woven into the film alongside a great many additional scenes. The supporting cast of animals include [[mandarin duck]]lings filmed jumping from their tree hole nest, [[Arctic wolf|Arctic wolves]] hunting [[caribou]], [[cheetah]] hunting [[Thomson's gazelle]], [[elephant]]s charging at [[white-backed vulture]], [[birds of paradise]] displaying in the [[New Guinea]] [[rainforest]], [[Adelie penguins]] in the Antarctic and [[demoiselle crane]]s on their autumn migration across the [[Himalayas]].  [[Time-lapse photography]] is used to show the blossoming of spring flowers, seasonal changes to [[deciduous forest]]s, clouds sweeping up Himalayan valleys, and the growth of jungle [[spore]]s and [[fungi]].

Elizabeth: The Golden Age
  In 1585, Catholic Spain ruled by King [[Philip II of Spain]] is the most powerful country in the world. Seeing Protestant England as a threat, and in retaliation for English piracy of Spanish ships, Philip plots war. He plans to take over England and make his daughter, [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]], the Queen of England in Elizabeth's place. Meanwhile, [[Elizabeth I of England]] is being pressured by her advisor, [[Francis Walsingham]], to marry, for if she dies without an heir, the throne will pass to her cousin, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], who is Catholic.  English explorer [[Walter Raleigh]] is presented at Elizabeth's court, having returned from the [[New World]]. Elizabeth is attracted to Raleigh, enthralled by his tales of exploration, and asks [[Elizabeth Raleigh|Bess Throckmorton]], her most favored lady-in-waiting, to observe him. Bess also finds Raleigh attractive and secretly begins an affair with him. With tensions strained between England and Spain, Elizabeth seeks guidance from her astrologer, Dr. [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]].  [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] in London conspire with Philip to assassinate Elizabeth and replace her with Mary, in what Philip calls "The English Enterprise", historically known as the [[Babington Plot]]. From her imprisonment, Mary sends secret correspondence to the Jesuits, who recruit [[Anthony Babington]] to assassinate Elizabeth. Walsingham continues to warn Elizabeth of Spain's rising power and of the Catholics' plots against her. However she, unlike her predecessor and half-sister [[Mary I of England]], refuses to force her people to share her religious beliefs.  Walsingham's Catholic brother, who knows of the plot against Elizabeth is jailed and Walsingham reveals Spain's plot to Elizabeth, who angrily confronts the Spanish diplomats. The Spanish ambassador feigns ignorance, accuses Elizabeth of receiving Spanish gold from pirates, and insinuates that she has a sexual relationship with Raleigh. Enraged, Elizabeth throws the Spaniards out of court. Meanwhile, Philip is cutting down the forests of Spain to build the [[Spanish Armada]], to invade England. Mary writes letters condoning the plot.  Babington storms into a cathedral where Elizabeth is praying and fires a pistol at her, though Elizabeth is unharmed as it is revealed that there was no bullet in the gun. As Elizabeth learns of Mary's involvement in the plot, Walsingham insists Mary be executed to quell any possible revolt. Elizabeth is reluctant, but nevertheless agrees. Mary is tried for high treason and is beheaded. Walsingham sees that this was part of the Jesuits' plan all along. Philip had never intended Mary to become queen, but since the Pope and other Catholic leaders regarded Mary as the true Queen of England, Philip uses Mary's death to obtain papal approval for war. The "murder" of the last legitimate Catholic in the line of succession gives Philip the pretext he needs to invade England.  Bess reveals to Raleigh in private that she is pregnant with his child, and pleads with him to leave. Instead, the couple marries in secret. When Elizabeth confronts Bess later, she confesses that she is indeed pregnant with Raleigh's child, and that Raleigh is her husband. An infuriated Elizabeth berates Bess, reminding her that she cannot marry without royal consent. She then banishes Bess from court and has Raleigh imprisoned for the crime of seducing a ward of the Queen.  As the Spanish Armada begins its approach up the English Channel, Elizabeth forgives Bess and sets Raleigh free to join [[Sir Francis Drake]] in the battle. The ships of the Armada vastly outnumber England's, but a storm blows the Armada toward the beaches, endangering its formation and ships that becomes vulnerable for English [[fire ship]]s. Elizabeth, back at her coastal headquarters, walks out to the cliffs and watches the Spanish Armada sink in flames as the English prevail over Spain.  She then visits Raleigh and Bess and blesses their child. Elizabeth seemingly triumphs personally through her ordeal, again resigned to her role as the Virgin Queen and mother to the English people.  
Eklavya: The Royal Guard
 Contemporary India. A majestic fort. A royal dynasty that no longer rules. A king without a kingdom. Yet Eklavya ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), their royal guard, lives in a time warp. He lives only to protect the fort, the dynasty, and the king. For nine generations Eklavya's family has protected Devigarh, a centuries-old citadel in Rajasthan. His marksmanship is the stuff of legends. His unflinching loyalty inspires ballads. Eklavya has spent his entire life serving the royals and closely guarding their secrets but now he's getting old and increasingly blind. Unable to cope with the suffocating customs of his land, the heir, Prince Harshwardhan ([[Saif Ali Khan]]), has stayed away in London. But the sudden demise of the queen, Rani Suhasinidevi ([[Sharmila Tagore]]), forces the Prince back to the kingdom he had left behind. The queen leaves a letter for her son in which she tells him that his biological father is actually Eklavya.  The Prince's return brings a rush of joy into the moribund fort. His mentally challenged twin sister, Princess Nandini ([[Raima Sen]]), and his childhood love, Rajjo ([[Vidya Balan]]), are delighted to see him. But the joy of reunion is short-lived.  There is unrest in the kingdom: Farmers are being stripped of their lands. The king, Rana Jaywardhan ([[Boman Irani]]), influenced by his brother, Rana Jyotiwardhan ([[Jackie Shroff]]), supports the atrocities being forced upon the helpless peasants. The king receives a death threat over the phone. An irreverent police officer, Pannalal Chohar ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), is called in to investigate. But he might be too late. The fragile peace of the land is suddenly shattered by a barrage of bullets. Jaywardhan instructs his brother to kill Eklavya in a fit of rage but his brother betrays him and kills him and his driver (Rajjo's father). And amidst the mayhem, the safely guarded secrets of the fort are revealed.  Eklavya suspects Jyotiwardhan and his son, Udaywardhan ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]), are responsible for Jaywardhan's death. He kills Udaywardhan and leads Jyotiwardhan to Udaywardhan's body, intending to kill him and fulfill his oath, whereupon Jyotiwardhan reveals to Eklavya that it was the prince who ordered the murder of the king. Shouting in denial, Eklavya kills Jyotiwardhan, knowing he must face the young Prince, his own son, in order to finally fulfill his [[dharma]].  Harshwardhan, overcome with guilt, reveals his own hand in the murder of Jaywardhan to Rajjo, who leaves him because his actions also caused the death of her father. When Eklavya comes to the palace to kill the Prince, he explains why he killed the king. The King had murdered the Queen when she, in her semi-conscious state, kept saying Eklavya's name. Eklavya finally fulfills his dharma, by sparing his son's life and declaring the original Eklavya wrong. Rajjo eventually forgives Harshwardhan because she believes that he is truly sorry for his actions and Pannalal finds a suicide note saying that Udaywardhan and Jyotiwardhan, afraid that they were about to be caught, jumped in front of a train.

Elite Squad
  Captain Roberto Nascimento ([[Wagner Moura]]), of [[Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais|BOPE]], narrates the film, briefly explaining how the police and the drug lords of [[Rio de Janeiro]] cooperate with each other (policemen collect periodic bribes and drug lords are left free to operate) in the 1990s.  In 1997, [[in medias res]], [[Military Police of Rio de Janeiro State|officer]] Captain Oliveira (Marcelo Valle) and his colleagues are shown driving through [[Morro da Babilônia]] towards a [[funk carioca|baile funk]]. Meanwhile, novice police officers André Matias ([[:pt:André Ramiro|André Ramiro]]) and Neto Gouveia (Caio Junqueira) are shown riding a motorcycle at the same [[favela]], though not with the other officers. From a vantage point, Neto uses the telescope of a [[sniper rifle]] to check on the officers as they talk to some drug traffickers. Neto shoots one of them and provokes a deadly gunfight between police and thugs, both sides unaware of where the bullet came from. Mathias and Neto leave the scene. Meanwhile, Nascimento and his men head to the shootout to rescue the officers.  Six months earlier, Nascimento and his wife Rosane (Maria Ribeiro) are shown during her pregnancy of their first child. Unwilling to be an absent father to his child,  Nascimento decides to search for a worthy successor. This coincides with an operation at [[Morro dos Prazeres]] set to make the location safe for the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]], who will spend the night in the [[Archbishop]]'s home located near the slum buildings. Because the operation requires daily trips into the favela filled with heavily armed criminals, Nascimento strongly opposes it, but is forced by his commander to accept it as his last mission.  Meanwhile, Neto and Matias debut as police officers. Both hold high moral grounds and rebuff everyday [[Bribery|payoff]] offers, but are soon disillusioned to realize their superiors are corrupt. While Neto begins working as a supervisor at the police [[auto mechanic]] shop, Matias is responsible for registering and filing every police complaint in a small archive office with fellow other officers. Both share a small apartment in Rio and are long-time friends and flatmates.  Parallel to his work as a police officer, Matias attends [[Law school]], where he befriends Roberta ([[Fernanda de Freitas]]), Edu (Paulo Viela) and Maria ([[Fernanda Machado]]) (whom he later dates), who are all members of a [[Non-Governmental Organization|NGO]] that supports poor children from a local favela. Roberta dates Rodrigues, who helps Maria run the organization and represents a [[Senator]] who sponsors the NGO.  The three of them smoke marijuana regularly provided by Edu, who serves as a drug dealer at the university. Edu is supplied and bossed by Baiano ([[Fábio Lago]]), a major drug lord, who allows the NGO to operate as long as it doesn't interfere with his business or bring police attention to his area. Due to the NGO's and Maria's connections to the local criminals, Matias keeps his job at the police as a secret from his classmates.  Neto is soon tired of working at the autoshop, but fails to be transferred to another department. During a routine patrol with Captain Fabio ([[Milhem Cortaz]]), he learns about corruption schemes adopted by police officers. Looking to raise enough money to fix as many police cars as possible at once, Neto comes up with a plan to steal the bribes Oliveira collects periodically and asks Matias and Fabio to help him. Fabio declines, since he will not have a share in it.  The duo succeeds in stealing the money, but Oliveira finds out about their involvement and punishes them by demoting both to [[cook (profession)|cook]]s at the battalion's kitchen. However, Oliveira believes they were just following Fabio's orders, and has him attend a false police report at the Morro da Babilônia during a baile funk. Realizing it's all a plan to execute him, Fabio warns Neto and Matias, who follow him and arrive at the vantage point to protect Fabio (the first scene of the film). When one of the dealers reaches for his gun, Neto precipitately shoots him, starting the gunfight seen earlier. Fabio escapes and Neto and Matias, unexperienced and underarmed, are soon cornered by the thugs.  Meanwhile, Nascimento is confronted by a woman trying to locate the body of her son, who worked as a lookout for the drug lords. She believes her son was killed as a punishment after BOPE managed to storm in the slum and that Nascimento is responsible because he let him go. Feeling guilty and thinking of his upcoming child, Nascimento gathers some officers and searches for the body. During the search, Nascimento is informed of the situation at Babilônia and ordered to intervene.  After rescuing the officers, he meets Matias and Neto and orders them to bring the local lord's body down to the base of the slum, during which Matias is photographed by the press. Soon after, the two friends, along with Fabio, apply for BOPE's training program. Matias is motivated by his devotion to the police, Neto is avid for more action, and Fabio is just trying to avoid Oliveira. Meanwhile, Nascimento's son, Rafael, is born.  At the NGO office, Baiano confronts Maria and her friends with a newspaper featuring Matias's picture and warns them to keep policemen out of his territory. Meanwhile, BOPE's training program takes place over a few weeks in the jungle. The course turns out to be a tough challenge, subjecting its aspiring officers to extreme physical and psychological tests. Many candidates quit the program, including Fabio, but Neto and Matias reach the final level, where they are brought into Nascimento's final operation. To celebrate his approval, Neto gets a BOPE [[tattoo]] in his arm.  Back to college, Matias is rejected by Maria and her friends after his exposure as a cop. Later, he confronts Edu and orders him to arrange a meeting with Romerito (a boy he befriended at the NGO), to whom he had promised a new pair of glasses. Aware of the risk he would run if he enters the slum, he demands Edu arrange him a meeting with Romerito at the base of the slum. However, upon returning home, Neto informs Matias that he has been invited for a job interview in a prestigious law firm that will conflict with his meeting with Romerito. Matias is reluctant because he knows it was arranged by Maria when they were still together, but Neto insists he attends it and offers to deliver the glasses to Romerito in Matias' place.  Edu reveals Matia's plan to Baiano and the drug lord decides to kill the cop. Neto ends up ambushed and mortally wounded by Baiano and his men, who then notice Neto's BOPE tattoo and realize he's from BOPE. Horrified that they just killed an elite officer, meaning that BOPE wouldn't rest until they hunted him down for revenge, Baiano goes into hiding, fearing for his life and becomes increasingly paranoid.  Matias, Nascimento and other BOPE officers make daily incursions into Baiano's slum to torture dealers into telling them of his whereabouts. After one of them reveals Edu tipped Baiano, Matias storms in a [[peace walk]], beats Edu up and insults Maria and the others. Later, BOPE finally locate and corner Baiano. Nascimento holds him at gunpoint, but Baiano pleads to not to be shot in the face, saying that it would ruin the funeral. Angrily amused at Baiano's pleading, despite his horrific crimes, Nascimento grabs a shotgun and hands it over to Matias, wanting him to finish Baiano off as both to avenge Neto, and prove himself. As Baiano continues to plead to not be shot in the face, the screen fades to black just as Matias's shot is heard.

Evan Almighty
 Newly elected to [[United States Congress|Congress]], former local television news reporter Evan Baxter ([[Steve Carell]]) leaves his hometown of [[Buffalo, New York]] and later moves to the fictional community of Prestige Crest, Virginia, where his congressional campaign officially declares that he will change the world. Evan prays to [[God in Christianity|God]] ([[Morgan Freeman]]) to give him this opportunity. His wife, Joan ([[Lauren Graham]]), also prays that she, Evan and their three sons ([[Jimmy Bennett]], [[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]], and [[Johnny Simmons]]) will be closer together as a family. On his first day in Congress, Evan receives a letter from his greedy boss, Chuck Long ([[John Goodman]]), who provides him with a prime office, his three congressional staffers ([[Wanda Sykes]], [[John Michael Higgins]] and [[Jonah Hill]]), and the opportunity to join Long as the junior co-sponsor to his Citizens' Integration of Public Lands Act (CINPLAN) bill. Over the next several days, strange events in Evan's life occur:   #Eight vacant lots in Prestige Crest are purchased under his name, and ancient tools and [[gopher wood]] are delivered there. #Animals start follow Evan around even into Congress. #He uncontrollably starts growing a beard that would never go away no matter how many times he shaves. #The number 614 starts appearing throughout his daily routines.   Evan comes to realize that this number actually refers to the verse in the [[Book of Genesis]], where God instructs [[Noah]] to build [[Noah's Ark|an Ark]] in preparation for a [[Flood myth|flood]]. Although Evan initially rejects this idea, God himself starts appearing to Evan in various guises, assuring him a flood is coming and the only way Evan can save the world will be to save his community instead. Evan himself decides to start building the ark with the tools and materials provided, giving him an opportunity to get closer to his sons, though Joan sees this as a mid-life crisis.  Although Evan still maintains his career in Congress, his appearance and the animals that keep following him start to become very disruptive. God reappears and provides Evan a robe, though warns him the flood will come mid-day on September 22. When Evan dons the robe, he finds he is unable to wear any other clothes, the robe seemingly displacing anything else he wears. Outraged by Evan's slothful appearance, Long fires him and his name is removed from the Public Land Act bill. Evan suspects God had him fired to spend more time on the ark, and continues to do so, becoming a public spectacle and of ridicule. Believing that Evan has gone insane, Joan leaves him, although she encounters God in disguise as a waiter at a diner. After hearing her concern about Evan's mental state, God assures Joan that she should see this as an opportunity for the entire family to get closer to each other. Joan is inspired and finally returns to help Evan finish the ark to prepare for the flood.  As September 22 nears, many people have come out to support Evan's project, including the staffers he had. One shows Evan researches that he had found on Long, specifically that he had planned to build Prestige Crest after damming off a nearby water source, but Long had cut many corners in building the dam. The staffers suspect Long would do the same with the Public Land Act Bill. On September 22, with the ark complete, the police try to destroy the ark with a wrecking ball, as it violates land codes. As animals start to amass near the ark, and rain falls, Evan realizes that the flood will be a result of Long's dam failing, destroying Prestige Crest. He warns the onlookers to either evacuate or get aboard the ark as he loads his entire family and the gathered animals aboard. The dam indeed breaks, destroying all the houses of Prestige Crest, but Evan's foresight saves all the lives there. The ark later floods the streets of [[Washington D.C.]] and comes to its final destination in front of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] during the controversial vote of the Public Land Act Bill, interrupting it. This results in Evan accusing Long's cost-cutting for the dam's failure, leading to several other members of Congress voting against the bill.  Long is being put under investigation for his profiteering and ethics, while all the animals are returned to their natural habitats. Evan is finally reinstated in Congress, all the changes forced on him by God no longer remaining. Evan re-encounters God during the hike, and expresses concern that he did not need to build the ark to show the problem with Long's dam, but God retorts that Evan's life is now perfect as he prayed for, being closer to his family and having changed the world for the better through his one [[random act of kindness|Act of Random Kindness]] (ARK). During the film's closing credits, God issues a new commandment to the outgoing audience: "Thou shalt do the dance." This is later followed by a footage depicting the film's cast and crew members dancing to [[C+C Music Factory]]'s hit song "[[Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)]]."  
Epic Movie

During "comedic" situations, Golden Tickets are found by other orphans, which include Edward ([[Kal Penn]]), a disillusioned monk trainee; Susan ([[Faune Chambers]]), a displaced adopted girl; and Peter ([[Adam Campbell (actor)|Adam Campbell]]), a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] at Mutant Academy who is often teased for his chicken-like wings. All four meet up at Willy's [[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Chocolate Factory]]. Willy ([[Crispin Glover]]) reveals his plot to use them all as a special ingredient in his treats.  In an effort to hide from the maniacal Willy, Lucy finds [[The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe|a wardrobe]]. On the other side, in the middle of a wintry forest, she finds [[Mr. Tumnus]] ([[Héctor Jiménez|Hector Jimenez]]), who welcomes Lucy to Gnarnia and warns her of danger. The others follow Lucy to Gnarnia, and Edward meets the [[White Witch|White Bitch]] ([[Jennifer Coolidge]]). She convinces him to trap the other orphans in order to become the king of Gnarnia in her [[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle|White Castle]]. All four go to Tumnus' house, where they discover that they are all related to one another [[The Da Vinci Code (film)|in a copy of the famous painting ''The Last Supper'']], and that the White Bitch killed their parents. They ally themselves with Harry Beaver ([[Katt Williams]]), Tumnus' life partner, to defeat the White Bitch.  Edward sneaks off to the White Bitch's castle and refuses to tell her where the others are. She [[Exhibitionism|flashes]] him her breasts, hypnotizing him into giving up the information on the orphans, then imprisons him. The White Bitch sends Silas after the trio; Tumnus apparently sacrifices himself to ensure their safety. Afterwards, the orphans meet a graying [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] ([[Kevin McDonald]]), along with a balding [[Ron Weasley]] (George Alvarez) and a pregnant [[Hermione Granger]] ([[Crista Flanagan]]) at Hogwarts, and other characters from famous movies. They all help Lucy, Susan, and Peter train for the war against the White Bitch. Meanwhile, the White Bitch reveals her plans to [[Superman Returns|create a new continent for her followers]] via a magic crystal. Edward escapes with the assistance of [[Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest|Captain Jack Swallows]] ([[Darrell Hammond]]), only to find out it was a ruse as Jack, the Bitch's old enemy, needs intelligence out of Edward. Jack is then stabbed by the White Bitch as the magic crystal is thrown in the ocean and grows, putting the Bitch's plan in motion.  Upon finishing their training, Lucy, Susan, and Peter head to the camp of [[Aslan|Aslo]] ([[Fred Willard]]). Aslo agrees to help Edward, and he manages to kill Silas, but while breaking Edward out, Aslo is slain by the White Bitch. As the orphans have a pre-battle party with their allies, Susan gets drunk and vomits everywhere. Their army is disgusted enough that nobody shows up to help the orphans the next day. The four siblings engage the White Bitch in battle and are killed. Peter then finds [[Click (2006 film)|a magic remote]] and uses its powers to revive his siblings. Together, they kill the army, defeat the White Bitch, and stop her plan. Peter declares the White Bitch will receive a fair and just trial in the new Gnarnia, but Jack's wheel accidentally crushes her. The four are crowned the new rulers of the land. Tumnus then shows up, having survived his battle. Decades later, the four now-elderly rulers find the wardrobe again and go through it. They appear moments after they had left, young again. They meet [[Borat Sagdiyev|Borat]] ([[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]]), who congratulates them on a happy ending, but then, the four are accidentally run over by Jack's wheel.  ===Extended version=== The unrated, longer version (released in the United Kingdom as the "Rude & Crude Unseen Version") of the film features some scenes not shown in the theatrical version. In the last scene, Willy Wonka, instead of Borat, comes in and says: "I told you it was going to be an epic adventure." Willy Wonka then goes in the wardrobe and puts out a [[Do not disturb sign|"do not disturb" sign]] that refers to the girl in the wardrobe. The [[Oompa-Loompa]]s come in and start singing the Willy Wonka theme song. The four are then crushed by the wheel. Also, during the scene where Lucy is crushed under the junk that falls out of the "Narnia" closet, the girl who runs out is nude, as opposed to wearing a bikini. In the ''[[Snakes on a Plane]]'' scene, when the Samuel L. Jackson lookalike yells, he replaces "goddamn" with "motherfuckin'". In the sex scene with Mystique, Peter follows big hooters with the words silver dollar nipples.

A black monolith appears, through which he and [[List of Neon Genesis Evangelion characters#Keel Lorenz|SEELE 01]] engage in a cryptic conversation. Looking towards Earth, Kaworu says that "the third one" has not changed at all and that he looks forward to meeting Shinji.

Estômago
 The film shows in parallel two periods in the life of Raimundo Nonato ([[João Miguel (actor)|João Miguel]]): one follows his successful career as a cook, the other as a prisoner in a cell with about ten other convicts. It gradually becomes clear that these events happen after the former.  His period as a cook starts when he arrives by bus in a big city, without a place to sleep nor money for food. After eating chicken snacks in a cafetaria, he has to wash the dishes to pay for it and is eventually offered a job, receiving merely food and lodging as payment, even though the snacks he cooks are so good it attracts more customers. Nonato falls in love with Íria, a gluttonous prostitute, who offers her services in exchange for food. He also gets a better job in an Italian restaurant, where he learns more of cooking from his boss Giovanni. One day he finds Giovanni having sex with Íria, despite he having proposed to her earlier. Enraged, he steals and drinks from his boss' prized wine collection, before murdering them both and cannibalizing a slice of meat removed from Íria's buttocks.  In the prison cell there is a power hierarchy with Bujiú ([[Babu Santana]]) at the top. The food is poor, and Nonato is assigned to cook better food. The inmates are usually quite satisfied with it, and  Nonato rises in the hierarchy. However, Bujiú rejects [[Gorgonzola (cheese)|Gorgonzola]], raw meat, and [[Entomophagy#Specific cases|cooked ants]], much to Raimundo's frustration. When top-criminal Etcetera, who is highly regarded by the inmates, arrives, Bujiú decides that a great meal should be cooked to please him. The main prison kitchen is arranged for the occasion, an event which Nonato takes advantage of to poison Bujiú, ultimately leading to him becoming the leader of his cell.

Evano Oruvan
 Sridhar Vasudevan ([[R. Madhavan]]) is a middle-class family man employed in a bank. Sridhar is very idealistic, principled, and he recognizes a deep sense of belonging with the society he is part of. He gets annoyed and flustered by illegal and semi-legal activities happening around him. His wife Vatsala ([[Sangeetha Krish]]) persistently demands that he should be more 'flexible' and make more money, but Sridhar does not accede. He endures the illegal and semi-legal activities around him because he anticipates a change in the mindsets of people. He feels that over time, they will become more honest, socially aware and willing to make small personal sacrifices for the greater good of all (like him).  Vatsala is a typical middle-class housewife and a caring mother of two children, Varsha and Varun. Societal imperfections and related problems matter very little to her. She is more concerned about her reactive husband, thinking about ways to save him from the effects of his angry outbursts and to steer him away from his impractical thoughts and deeds.  At a certain point in life, Sridhar faces a case of deceit that compels him to take action. Provoked by his deep anger and guilt, Sridhar decides to retaliate for wrongs done to him, violently if required. When charged two rupees extra for a cool drink, he picks up a cricket bat and smashes the shop. From that incident onward, Sridhar progresses, taking the law in his own hands and trying to bring about instant changes wherever needed. A string of incidents occur; he thrashes the Area Counseller, the insincere hospital employees, water-supplier, and many more.  Sridhar's anger goes beyond these incidents, targeting individuals who do not follow norms created for their own benefit. The director has presented Sridhar as a representative for every common man in today's society, who, even after seeing and going through such wrong things, tolerates them to avoid getting his settled routine disturbed. Because of his behaviour and approach, Sridhar is termed as a criminal, harmful to his fellow men.  Inspector Vetri Maran ([[Seeman (director)|Seeman]]) is appointed to shoot him in an arranged 'encounter'. Vetri Maran, though not of the incorruptible kind, feels bad about the police-corruption nexus. He is a goodhearted cop, and inwardly feels justified by Sridhar's approach. He comes to a quiet agreement with the young man, personally approves his action, then arranges for the 'encounter killing'. At the end, Sridhar is shot dead by Vetri Maran.

Then he unexpectedly kisses Harris. As Lila prepares to depart with her new husband, Ann offers to take the bride away with her, but Lila refuses and leaves for her honeymoon.  Buddy admits to Ann he's had a crush on Harris since his childhood, though he also claims not to be "that way" - he denies that this would be okay as Ann assures him. He then changes the subject, confessing he has loved Ann ever since their college days, offering as proof a note she once sent him he has kept in his pocket ever since. Ann is unconvinced.  By the sea the younger guests dance drunkenly and dive into the sea from a clifftop: Buddy joins in but fails to surface, prompting a panicked search.

Meanwhile, Yuko ([[Chiaki Kuriyama]]) is a young apprentice [[hair stylist]] at a local hair salon (named after alleged child murderer [[Giles de Rais]]. One day, her irresponsible older sister, Kiyomi ([[Tsugumi (actress)|Tsugumi]]), dumps her eight-year-old daughter, Mami (Miku Sato), on Yuko and Yuko's roommate, Yuki ([[Megumi Sato (actress)|Megumi Satō]]).  Mami shows signs of abuse.  Yuko allows Mami to stay with her, telling her to stay home while she goes to work each day, concerned about the abuse she has suffered from Kiyomi.  Out on the street, Yamazaki spots Mami trying to find Yuko's hair salon and finds her hair exceedingly beautiful.  He introduces himself and helps her find Yuko's work place.  When he sees Yuko, he is also enchanted by her hair, but quickly runs off.  He returns the next day, explaining that he sells hair extensions.  The workers at the salon are impressed by the hair's quality and try them out.  That night, Kondo, one of Yuko's co-workers who tried on the extensions, is killed when the hair begins sprouting from her eyes, head, and mouth.  Yuko later discovers that Kiyomi has been tricking Mami into letting her enter Yuko's apartment so that she can raid her food and clothing.  Yuko and Yuki refuses to return Mami to her due to the abuse, and Kiyomi returns one last time while they are away, stealing more clothing, one of Yamazaki's hair extensions, and dragging Mami back to her boyfriend's home.  After punishing Mami by locking her in the closet, the extension comes to life and slaughters Kiyomi and her boyfriend.  Mami escapes the hair by jumping out of the window into a bush, injuring herself.  At the hospital, detectives have Yuko identify Kiyomi's body.  Participating in a hair dressing workshop, Yuko uses Mami as her model and attaches one of Yamazaki's hair extensions to her hair.  The workshop is interrupted by the detectives, who are there to inquire about Kondo's death, and Yuki takes Mami home.  After the detectives leave, Yuko realizes that the hair extensions are the linking factor in the various deaths and races home to Mami.  While Mami is playing, hair begins to seep into the apartment.  Yuki rushes Mami to safety, but is strangled to death by the hair and Mami faints.  Yuko enters the hair-filled apartment and tries to free Mami, but is choked unconscious by the hair.  Yamazaki arrives in time and commands the hair to spare Mami and Yuko and takes them back to his living hair-covered home. There he discovers the detectives caught in the hair, who searched his house when they discovered that he was the one responsible for the deaths. He kills them as Yuko wakes up.  Yamazaki explains that after her organs were harvested, the girl's hair continued grow, carrying on her grudge against society.  He wishes for Mami and Yuko, two living amongst and making a career around hair, to stay with him and the corpse forever.  Yuko rejects him, and to protect Mami, begins taunting Yamazaki, enraging him and causing him to reveal that he willfully allowed the hair to possess him, his tongue hairy and his blood and limbs replaced by hair.  In anger, he cuts some of Mami's hair, which begins to bleed.  While in wonder of what he has just seen, the blood and Yamazaki's smiling cause the corpse to associate him with the man who killed her and she suddenly sits up, immobilizing him and slicing him to pieces with strands of hair, killing him while Yuko and Mami escape.  Her grudge satisfied, the hair disappears and the girl's body returns to normal, finally at peace.  Having escaped, Yuko and Mami sit on the beach and Yuko asks Mami to live together with her permanently, which Mami happily accepts.

No reason is offered for his detention and no timetable is set for his release. No governments are mentioned, no radical factions named, no fingers pointed. There is nothing for him to hang onto. The man has fallen out of the world, and only questions remain. Returned without explanation to the UK many months later, he is left to pick up the pieces of a shattered life in a world he no longer recognizes.

After being suspended from school for smoking, Alyssa is brought to the Bahamas to live with Hawk ([[Adrian Dunbar]]), the father she never knew she had. Alyssa's arrival on the island comes at a decisively inconvenient time for Hawk, a dolphin researcher, whose prickly personality puts him at odds with local politicians, who feel that the local economy needs good relations with tourists. It is a difficult relationship at first between Alyssa and her father, but Tamika ([[Christine Adams (actress)|Christine Adams]]), Hawk's girlfriend, and Daniel ([[George Harris (actor)|George Harris]]), Tamika's father, smooth the way. Alyssa soon adjusts to island life, and she discovers the gift that she shares with her father for communicating with dolphins, a skill which leads her into a powerful relationship with a wild dolphin which her father, for legitimate scientific reasons, cannot condone. But when the powers-that-be threaten to close down her father's research station, it is Alyssa and her wild friend who hold the key, and they have the power to bring all parties together.

Wet-behind-the-ears new recruit Piggy ([[Kate Tsui]]) is plunged at the deep end in her first surveillance assignment working alongside her mentor, Sergeant Wong ([[Simon Yam]]).

After reviewing the jewelry store surveillance videos recordings, the force attempts to track down one of the robbers by staking out the neighborhood they think he lives in.  Fatman ([[Lam Suet]]) is identified and tracked without his knowledge through a combination of tails, surveillance footage, and data-mining, including accessing his [[Octopus card]]. The force ambush is established at the scene of the next robbery, but the elusive Hollow Man ([[Tony Leung Ka-fai]]) notices the police. As the robbers flee, some are killed by a [[Police Tactical Unit (Hong Kong)|Police Tactical Unit]], but the rest escape. Chan kills an uniformed police officer as he flees, and Piggy stops to give first aid rather than continue the pursuit.  The surveillance unit is then called to another case; a kidnapping. Piggy is staking out a phone booth where the kidnapper may make a call, when she sees Hollow Man go by. She recognises the kidnapper from Fatman's apartment building and allows the police to rescue the kidnap victim, while she pursues Hollow Man.

Wong convinces Piggy to continue to follow Hollow Man as he slowly bleeds to death.  Piggy follows Hollow Man to his hideout and calls for the Police Tactical Unit again. Meanwhile, Wong survives his injury and gets medical attention. In the raid on the hideout, Hollow Man flees down a dock and wounds himself mortally in the neck running past a hanging hook, and the other robbers are captured.  
Expired
 Claire, a mild-mannered parking attendant, lives in a small flat with her mother who is recovering from a recent stroke. In the opening sequence she patrols the [[Los Angeles]] streets and stumbles into an old flame, who introduces Claire to his wife and ill-behaved daughter. Reeling from the chance encounter, she steps out onto the street and is hit by a passing vehicle.  Returning to work three weeks later, Claire attracts the attention of another parking attendant, an extremely blunt and aggressive man named Jay whose home life consists mainly of entertaining himself using the services of a webcam porn site and phone service. Claire witnesses him fighting with her best friend, a neighbor working for a delivery service who parks on the curb to unload her consignment, but does not bring it up with either party.  She develops a crush on Jay, but in each conversation Jay takes issue with some entirely innocuous comment Claire has made and storms off in disgust. Nonetheless, he keeps coming back for more. One night as Claire prepares to join him at the annual office Christmas party, she finds her mother slumped over—dead—in a bowl of mashed potato.   In shock, she simply picks up her coat and leaves for the party. She sits alone, watching Jay dance with another woman, until finally Jay asks in brutal terms what is the matter. She takes him home to show him the problem.  Claire decides that rather than call an ambulance she prefers to have the situation dealt with by family. She calls her mother's vain and self-obsessed sister, who lives in a different part of the city. Her aunt says it is too far to come at that hour of the night, but if she wants to, Claire can come pick up a necklace belonging to her mother.   After calling an undertaker who takes the body of Claire's mother away, Jay insists on staying the night to "take care" of Claire, promising to sleep on the couch. But he goes to Claire's narrow bed and starts to remove her clothes. After a few seconds of brutal thrusting, during which he talks to her as if she were the phone sex service he uses so frequently, he rolls over and falls asleep.  From that point on, Jay and Claire maintain a tenuous sort of relationship, hung mainly on Claire's optimism and Jay's desire for sex and attention. At work, Jay is suspended for his aggressive behavior with parking offenders, which has earned him an impressive complaints record. He watches a crafts documentary on carpentry and decides to make a [[love seat]].  Jay offers to drive Claire to her aunt's house in Pasadena to pick up her mother's necklace, lying to her over his disciplining at work. He drives her to the other side of the city, with her seated on the makeshift [[love seat]] in his parking attendant's vehicle. Her aunt insists that they all go out drinking; Jay and Claire end up in a hotel room. Jay gives Claire a tiny, pink PVC bikini and tells her she should lose weight, which Claire takes in stride, as she has previously with his other insinuations and outright insults.   During her next shift, Claire is informed that she is being promoted for her exemplary behavior. To celebrate she goes to Jay's apartment but swiftly realizes that he was visited by a prostitute immediately before her arrival. She leaves in disgust.   Jay goes to her apartment to apologize. Dressed in a more fashionable and confident style, she is outspokenly skeptical about his behavior, but submits when he pulls her to the floor for another round of uncomfortable sex. When it is over, Jay expresses that he has burgeoning feelings of commitment to Claire, but she asks him to leave.   In the final scene, Claire once again walks her beat alone. Another vehicle nearly catches her at the site of her prior accident, but this time she escapes unscathed, and smiles in relief. The closing credit song was custom written, produced and performed by [[Max Sharam]] though she never received a credit.

Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer
 As [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]] prepare for their [[wedding]], a silver object enters Earth's atmosphere, creating immense craters around the world. General Hager directs Reed to track and identify its movements.  During the wedding, Reed's systems detect the phenomenon approaching [[New York City]], which suffers a blackout from the object's electromagnetic pulses. [[Human Torch|Johnny Storm]] pursues the object, discovering it to be a silver humanoid on a flying surfboard. The "[[Silver Surfer]]" drags him into the upper atmosphere, suffocates and then drops him. Johnny barely survives, successfully flying only at the last moment. Later, Sue and Johnny find they have switched powers after touching, prompting Reed to deduce that exposure to the Surfer has affected Johnny's molecular structure, allowing these transfers of their powers. Tracing the Surfer's [[Power Cosmic|cosmic energy]], Reed discovers that a series of planets the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] has visited are all destroyed.  Reed and Sue contemplate abandoning their lives as superheroes in order to have a normal life and raise a family, but are unaware Johnny is listening. With the Surfer creating craters around the globe, Reed determines that the next will appear in [[London]]. The team arrives too late to stop the crater, which drains the [[River Thames]], but they manage to prevent the [[London Eye]] from collapsing after it is damaged by the quake (although Johnny nearly thwarts their attempt when he unwillingly switches powers with Reed). Meanwhile, the Surfer's movements around the globe bring him past [[Latveria]], where the cosmic energy affects their ex-friend [[Doctor Doom|Victor Von Doom]], freeing him from two years encased in metal. A scarred Doom traces the Surfer to the [[Russell Glacier (Greenland)|Russell Glacier]] and offers to join forces. When the Surfer rebuffs him, Doom attacks. The Surfer retaliates, blasting Doom through the ice, but the cosmic energy of the Surfer's blast heals Doom's body.  Doom leverages his experience into a deal with the American military, which forces the Fantastic Four to work with Doom. Deducing that the Surfer's board is the source of his power, Reed develops a [[tachyon]] pulse generator that will separate the Surfer from it, while Doom devises a machine whose function he keeps secret. In the [[Black Forest]], the Surfer confronts Sue and reveals he is merely a servant to the destroyer of worlds, and regrets the destruction he causes. The military opens fire on the Surfer, which distracts him and allows the Fantastic Four to fire the pulse, separating the Surfer from his board. The military imprisons the Surfer in [[Siberia]], where they torture him for information. Sue uses her powers to sneak into his cell, where he informs her that his master, known by the people of his world as [[Galactus]], is a massive cloud-like cosmic entity that feeds on life-bearing planets to survive, and that his board is a homing beacon summoning Galactus to the planet. The Silver Surfer has to serve Galactus, who will otherwise destroy the Surfer's planet.  Using the device he created earlier, Doom betrays Hager and steals the board from the compound, killing most of the Army personnel there. The Fantastic Four rescue the Surfer and pursue Doom in the [[Fantasticar]], confronting him in [[Shanghai]]. During the battle, Sue is severely wounded. With the Surfer powerless, Johnny absorbs the combined powers of the entire team in order to battle the now cosmic energy-empowered Doom. Johnny succeeds in breaking Doom's control over the Surfer's board, and [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]] uses a nearby crane to knock Doom into the harbor. However, Galactus arrives and Sue appears to die in Reed's arms. The Surfer regains control of his board, restoring his power. He revives Sue and chooses to defend Earth, flying, with an extra boost from Johnny, into Galactus. The conflict results in a massive blast of energy that engulfs Galactus, and apparently kills the Surfer as well. Johnny recovers his stable molecular state after touching the Surfer's board.  Reed and Sue marry in [[Japan]], in an abbreviated ceremony. Receiving news that [[Venice]] is sinking into the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], the team heads to [[Italy]]. In a mid-credits scene, the Silver Surfer's seemingly lifeless body floats through space. His eyes then open and his board races toward him, hinting that he is still alive.

Far North (2007 film)
 The film opens up with a voiceover of a woman named Saiva telling the listener that a [[shaman]] said she was cursed at birth and would bring harm to anyone she cared for. While she and a young woman named Anja are camping in a [[subarctic]] region of [[Siberia]], in desperation, she takes one of her sled dogs and after calming it, slits its throat, foreshadowing the shaman's prophecy about her birth. She and Anja then set out to relocate their camp. On the way, they almost get caught by Soviet/Russian soldiers. Fearing the worst, Saiva ventures out with Anja into the far north to the [[arctic tundra]], passing abandoned telephone wire trees and to the area  where she believes no one would ever find them. After a long paddle north, they pitch camp on a beach, where they set up their [[yurt]].  While sleeping in the night, Saiva has a [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] to her past among the reindeer tribes, after being shunned by her own tribe. In her flashback, she encounters a man who invites her into his tribe to help with the reindeer round-up. The two fall in love with each other, and after a time he gives her a wolf claw necklace. Going back to the present, Saiva and Anja live a harsh brutal life in the tundra hunting animals for their survival. One day while hunting alone, Saiva encounters a badly wounded man nearly frozen and starved to death. After his collapse, she tries to loot him, but the man regains consciousness briefly and asks for her help. Accepting him, Saiva brings him to the yurt and cleans his wounds.  Later the man claims the name of "Loki".  The next day on a hunting trip with them, Loki asks what he can do for them in return for their kindness and Saiva asks him to bring a [[reindeer]]. After a failed seal hunt, Loki tells Saiva in their yurt that he was an escapee from soldiers that came to clear out the tundra, and that if they find him they will shoot him. He then shows them his portable [[hand-cranked radio]], one of several clues that the story takes place in the last decades of the 20th century. Later, Loki tries to keep his promise by bringing them a reindeer. But as he is about to shoot one, he is detained by a couple of Soviet soldiers. Just as they are about to put him in their boat, he fights back and kills both of them. He then comes back with their looted supplies and gives them to Saiva and Anja. Over the next few months Loki and Anja fall in love with each other. Saiva tries to warn him about her secret, but Anja interrupts her and they hang out with each other more and more. Another flashback scene shows Saiva finding all of her tribe dead, except for the man that she fell in love with and a baby. She is captured by soldiers. One of the soldiers who slaughtered her village rapes her after slitting the man's throat. She finds the baby after that in one of the yurts, and one of the soldiers tells her to cooperate with her or he will skin the baby alive. Later when she and the soldiers were crossing a glacier, she used a knife to cut the rope, causing all of the soldiers to fall into a [[Fracture (geology)|crevice]]. She then heads out alone with the baby into the northland.  Once again going back to the present, Anja and Loki spend more and more time together during the following months. One night when Saiva is out hunting, they have [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]]. Loki eventually fulfills his  promise on killing a reindeer. As their love builds up, Loki and Anje plan on leaving to go to civilization and have a family of their own. When Anja tells this to Saiva one evening, Saiva is speechless. As tension builds up Saiva's mind gets more and more worked up with depression of her daughter's leave; even when Anja asks her to come with them she is speechless. That night Loki goes out hunting. When Anja returns to the yurt, Saiva tricks Anja into combing her hair and  chokes Anja to death with her own hair,in a scene reminiscent of the opening scene. She then skins Anja's face and disguises herself with it. When Loki comes back, he has sex with Saiva, assuming that she is Anja, but he then discovers Saiva's identitity. Petrified, he flees the yurt naked into the frozen tundra. The film ends with Saiva sobbing alone in her yurt.  
Fear of Clowns 2
 The film begins two years after the events of the first film, with Detective Peters at the Doctor's office, who reveals to Peters that he has [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] (CJD), and there is no treatment; it's fatal.  Two months later, it is revealed that after being sent to jail two years ago, Doug Richardson a.k.a. "Shivers The Clown" was sent to a mental asylum, and Lynn Blodgett has quit her painting career and gone on to write a book called ''Coulrophobia'', which talks about her "[[fear of clowns]]" and the story about the stalking killer clown two years ago; she and Tucker Reid have broken up and haven't seen each other for a while.  But things go terribly wrong: An orderly named Ralph helps Shivers and two other inmates escape the asylum. Shivers takes Ralph and the inmates back to his old house, which is now occupied by a junkie, who is later strangled to death by Shivers. The next day, after hearing of Shiver's escape, Lynn calls Detective Peters and tells him that she will be home soon. Meanwhile, the junkie's friends arrive at the house, only to be killed by the inmates, Giggles The Clown and Ogre The Clown.  Meanwhile, Lynn arrives back home and meets Detective Peters at a restaurant, where he reveals that he's going to kill Doug Richardson. As Detective Peters takes Lynn home, they find out that Shivers has just killed Tucker outside an amusement park, where Tucker was constructing a new design for a [[roller coaster]]. Peters then calls two police officers to guard Lynn's house before they leave at 9:00 to secluded cabins in the woods. Before they leave, Ogre kills the police officers, while Shivers tries to kill Lynn. But during the process, Shivers kills Giggles instead.  Peters and Lynn escape through the cellar, while Shivers takes off in the van (where Ralph is handcuffed), leaving Ogre behind to mourn over Giggle's dead body, as he was Ogre's best friend. Ogre then takes off to go after Shivers for revenge. The next day, Peters and Lynn arrive at the cabins, where they are greeted by Hot Rod, Stoltz, and Rego, who are all friends of Peters. Meanwhile, Shivers leaves Ralph in the van while he goes to the bathroom, and Ralph calls an anonymous person, telling him that he needs to pay him (Ralph) more money if he (the caller) wants the job to be done. Then, Shivers leaves to go find Lynn, only to end up at the Horner's home, killing the entire family. Shivers then continues on to find the cabins.  Peters goes outside to see if the coast is clear, only to be axed in the side. Lynn takes off into the woods with Shivers on her tail, leaving the axe inside Peters. Peters, who is still alive, reloads his gun and drags himself to where Lynn and Shivers ran off to. Peters finds them, and shoots Shivers two times: once in the hand, the other in the back, and Shivers falls into a gully. Lynn goes to check to see if Peters is okay, but looks to see Shivers rise up out of the gully. Lynn takes Peter's gun and points it at Shivers, but before she can pull the trigger, Stoltz (who was only injured in the face) pops out of nowhere and shoots Shivers three times in the chest, knocking him back into the gully. It is never revealed whether Peters is dead, or he's just simply unconscious.  The police arrive, only to find out that there's no body in the gully, only that there is a trail of blood that leads a hundred feet south, where Shivers climbed out of the gully and went into the woods. Sgt. Raup (Vincent T. Brown) decides to break the news to Lynn in the morning after she gets a good night sleep. The ending leaves it ambiguous as to whether Shivers is alive, or he died after heading out into the woods.  
The Ferryman (2007 film)
  A group of tourists: Chris, a wealthy American; Tate, Chris's temperamental fiancé; Kathy, an ex-nurse haunted by recurring nightmares of a young girl who died in her care; her boyfriend Zane; Big Dave, the owner and captain of a luxurious yacht; and his wife Suze set sail on a leisure trip to Fiji.  The voyage is interrupted when they respond to a distress signal from a nearby vessel, and rescue its sole surviving crew member ("The Greek").  Unbeknownst to the group, The Greek is possessed by the malevolent spirit of a man who seeks to cheat death by using an enchanted dagger to swap souls with a succession of new hosts. The Greek attacks Zane, taking control of his body, before embarking on a murderous rampage of which Kathy, Zane (now trapped in The Greek's dying body) and Tate (who is ultimately possessed by the spirit) are the only survivors.  Kathy and Zane escape after the girl from Kathy's dream visits her and reveals the spirit's origin and how to defeat it: The spirit cannot possess money, as this would compel it to pay the fare which would allow the titular [[psychopomp|Ferryman]] to convey it into the afterlife.  Kathy tricks the possessed Tate into accepting a coin that the girl gave her. The Ferryman appears and claims the spirit, before disappearing into the darkness.  The final scenes show Kathy in Fiji, luring a man she meets at a party back to her room, so that Zane can use the dagger to transfer his soul into the man's body.

 In 2004, a Home Office survey revealed that there are 20 to 60 youngsters, aged 16 to 24, living rough in each inner city in the UK. They are responsible for vast levels of crime and in almost all cases they have come from broken homes and a history of abuse, both physical and sexual, most of the time inflicted on them by their own parents. Nikki, 18, fled a sexually abusive homelife and a succession of foster families to live on the street. There she met Vincent, 24, the product of heroin addicted parents. Together they spend their days trying to survive the perils of living rough and supporting their own drug addictions. They are wild,unwanted and in love. They are The Feral Generation.  
Fengming, a Chinese Memoir
 Caught up the fervor of the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]], she abandoned her plans to study at university and took a job at the ''[[Gansu Daily]]'' newspaper. Her husband, fellow journalist Wang Jingchao, wrote several critical essays at the height of the [[Hundred Flowers Campaign]]. With the launch of the subsequent [[Anti-Rightist Movement]], Wang was attacked for these statements, and she was condemned by association. The two were sent to separate [[labor camp]]s, where Wang eventually died.<ref name='Variety'></ref> He Fengming was released, briefly imprisoned again during the [[Cultural Revolution]],<ref name='Pauses'></ref> and finally [[Political rehabilitation|rehabilitated]]. In the early 1990s she published a memoir, ''My Life in 1957''.<ref name='CS'></ref>  
Fermat's Room
  A stranger using the alias "[[Pierre de Fermat|Fermat]]" invites several people to attend a convention of the country's best mathematicians. To accept the invitation, each must solve a math puzzle. Upon receipt of the correct solution, each receives as an alias the name of a famous mathematician or philosopher; they are forbidden to reveal their true identities to the other attendees. Each is instructed to arrive at a specific place and time, alone and without a cell phone, to work on "the greatest enigma".  At the appointed time, four individuals converge at a river bank: a serious young man using the alias [[Évariste Galois|Galois]], an older man using [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], a self-effacing young man using [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], and a stylish young woman using [[Oliva Sabuco|Oliva]]. At dusk, a car on the far side of the river flashes its headlights; they cross the river in a rowboat (named Pitagoras, or Pythagoras). In the car they find a PDA with GPS coordinates and travel instructions. These direct them to an abandoned warehouse in the countryside, where a back room is set up as an elegant parlor stocked with books and a large dining table set for five.  An elderly man enters and introduces himself as Fermat.  They socialize and discuss academia, mathematics, and puzzles. After dinner, Fermat receives a phone call about his daughter, whom he claims is in a coma at a nearby hospital. Mobile reception is poor, and Fermat is unclear about the meaning of the call. Insisting it might be dire news, he leaves hurriedly and forgets his coat.  Fermat's wallet drops out of a pocket in the confusion.  Pascal picks up the open wallet, and notices a photo of a girl.  The PDA displays a math puzzle, with a time limit of one minute. Hilbert, Oliva, and Galois work on the problem but exceed the deadline. Pascal calls it an old cliché and solves it easily. The walls contract when the deadline is exceeded.  Pascal finds a sales order for four industrial presses (which he helped invent).  The group intuits that the presses are set to compress the room each time they fail to solve a puzzle by the time limit. The door has been blocked, and there is no escape. The PDA periodically displays new puzzles. As the occupants of the room work to solve the puzzles, it is revealed that Oliva and Galois have a romantic history, and that they broke up when Galois suspected her of cheating on him when she was actually spending time on a boat party filled with illegal activities hosted by Hilbert.  They pile the furniture in the room to hold the moving walls, but the furniture is broken as the walls continue to contract.  Pascal identifies the girl in the photo as someone that he severely injured with his car.  He proposes that Fermat is trying to kill him in revenge, and that the others are [[Collateral damage|collateral victims]].  When they discover an invitation addressed to Fermat with different instructions than theirs, they realize that Fermat was not their host after all, but another pawn of the true host.  They question who their host is and the reason why they were chosen to be killed. After concluding that this was a revenge plot, they hypothesize that the person wanting revenge would want to see it happen.  As there are no visible cameras or viewpoints, the person trying to kill them must be in the room with them.   Galois, who previously gained press attention for allegedly proving [[Goldbach's conjecture]], confesses that he lied to win back Oliva; the publicized sabotage of his presentation was staged to hide his failure. This causes the group to conclude that Galois is the mastermind after, out of frustration, he breaks the PDA and states that he wants to die. Pascal, however, points out that Galois' behavior at the start of the meeting does not make any sense. He instead accuses Hilbert of being the host, due to him being the only one who could possibly buy all the equipment and his behavior early on in the meeting (and he was out of the room when Fermat received the call from the hospital). Galois backs Pascal up as he had, despite it being against the rules, traced the invitations back to the sender, whose name matched Hilbert's real name.   Hilbert confesses that he is the mastermind, that he has spent his entire professional life trying to prove Goldbach's conjecture and was insanely envious that Galois beat him to the proof; he staged this "convention" to avenge himself. Fermat and Pascal were merely there to cover his tracks. Fermat was also a diversion who will be killed when undetectable poison gas is released in his car.  Hilbert announces that he's succeeded in proving Goldbach. He hands a folder to Galois. Galois admits that Hilbert's proof is brilliant.   Meanwhile, Fermat, who has yet to die as the poison was set to release when his seat belt would be used, drives back to the convention after finding out that the call was fake to take back his house keys and wallet inside his coat. The group try to use Hilbert's cellphone to contact him, but a bend in the road causes him to lose his grasp on it before he can answer the call. His erratic driving caused by him trying to answer the call gets him pulled over by a passing police cruiser. After pleading that he his driver's license was left only a little bit further from their current location, the police agree to escort him there. A police officer,  who had gone with him inside the car, advises Fermat to wear his seat belt, causing Fermat to drive off a cliff as the poison gas is released. Frustrated by their impending doom, Galois becomes angry and strikes Hilbert, rendering him unconscious   Pascal realizes that the real Oliva, Galois, Fermat and Pascal each died at the same age as the current age of the guests using those names, but the real Hilbert died at 81, much older than the unconscious man before them.  They conclude that Hilbert had an escape plan and did not intend to die with them. A furious search begins. They find that the blackboard is hollow and escape with Hilbert's proof, leaving Hilbert to die as there is not enough time to pull him out with them.   As they return to their cars, Galois comments that he doesn't want to release Hilbert's solution under Hilbert's name, because then Hilbert "wins". He admits releasing it under his own name would be unethical but would solve his professional problems. Pascal grabs the folder and scatters the pages upon the river, remarking that the world is still the same with or without the proof.

The Final Season
 This is the true story of Kent Stock, who in 1991 takes on what he perceives as the job of a lifetime as head coach of the [[Norway High School (Iowa)|Norway High School]] Tigers baseball team, which has won 19 state titles and has a baseball tradition in Iowa tantamount to that of the [[New York Yankees]] nationally.  Stock joins the team in 1990 as assistant coach, excited to learn from the legendary Tigers coach Jim Van Scoyoc. The Tigers win the 1990 title, the twelfth under Van Scoyoc. Stock is unaware that he has been picked by the school's Principal Halberstorm to replace Van Scoyoc in order to facilitate a losing 1991 season. The principal is pushing a consolidation of Norway with the larger "Madison School District" (in real life, the [[Benton Community School District]]), but the town is opposed, centered mainly on not wanting to give up the successful baseball program. The principal only knows about Stock's experience as a girls' volleyball coach, unaware that Stock was a star player for his Division III college baseball team and is a student of the game.  Several of the Tigers' returning stars refuse to go out for Coach Stock, who must win over the rest and convince them, the skeptical townspeople and himself that he can fill their former coach's shoes, all while dealing with the reality that this will be the team's final season due to the impending merger. With the support of a young female state auditor whose findings helped push through the merger, and a gadfly baseball writer from Des Moines who is following the team, Kent learns to motivate the team his own way.  In May 1991, Norway High's baseball tradition ends on a triumphant but somber note as it wins its 20th state championship in its final season. A video clip of the actual Coach Stock thanking Van Scoyoc publicly for the opportunity opens the final scene.  
Fire Serpent
 A [[solar flare]] from the sun sends a serpentine alien composed of fire to Earth where it begins to wreak havoc throughout a small community. During its search for more fuel to consume it stumbles upon a large military oil reserve. It soon becomes clear that an old man may hold the key to destroying it in the form of a Halogen Gun which may be used as a makeshift fire extinguisher of sorts. A small group of citizens decides to use this technology to make a stand against the creature only to face additional resistance from the beast, as well as a government employer who voluntarily helps the snake because he believes it is the spirit of a god.  
Firehouse Dog
  Dog superstar Rexxx lives the high life-with adoring crowds, a loving owner and an array of best-selling blockbusters under his belt. However, when his owner, Trey (Dash Mihok) tries to convince him to perform a skydiving stunt, the plane malfunctions and Rexxx is sent tumbling from the sky, landing in a truck full of tomatoes. Whilst Trey mourns his apparent death and begins to regret not treating him like a 'real dog', Rexxx settles into an abandoned warehouse, desperately missing his owner.  Meanwhile in the [[South Harbor]] [[District Of Lincoln County]], Shane Fahey (Josh Hutcherson) is struggling with the death of his Uncle Capt. Marc Fahey & Blue (The former "Firehouse Dog") at a fire in a disused Textile Mill. Realizing he forgot to study for a test, Shane ditches school, but is quickly caught by two other firefighters, Lionel and Terrence. Arriving back at the fire station in disgrace, he is chastised by his father Connor Fahey (Bruce Greenwood), the recently promoted Captain of the station, who is having problems of his own; the station 'Dogpatch', home to Engine 55 & Rescue 26, is about to be closed due to a lack of funding, less infrastructure remaining around the station, and overall bad publicity. However, before Connor can properly address his son's problems, "Dogpatch" is called out to put out a fire in a warehouse-Shane is reluctantly dragged along. Although the fire is quickly put out, Shane notices a terrified Rexxx balancing on top of the burning building; Connor manages to rescue him, and orders Shane to put up 'Lost Dog' flyers. Due to the name on his collar, which is a prop from the filming at the time of Rexxx's accident, the station renames the dog 'Dewey', and keeps him at the station until someone comes to claim him.  Whilst city manager Zachary Hayden (Steven Culp) reminds Connor of the station's upcoming shutdown, Shane struggles to cope with Dewey's spoilt needs and strange habits. Realizing that the dog is fast and active, Shane enters him in a firefighter's competition, where they are pitted against rival fire station Greenpoint. Although Dewey initially beats Greenpoint's record score, he is distracted by their dog, who reminds him of his time in stardom. Despite losing the competition, Shane and Dewey begin to bond.  The next morning, Engine 55 is called out to a tunnel collapse. Everyone had been evacuated upon their arrival, but Capt. Fahey  spots that Greenpoint's captain, Jessie Presley, is unnacounted for and anitiates a Solo Primary Search inside. Connor rushes into the wreckage, and Shane, fearing for his father's safety, allows Dewey to run in after him. Dewey manages to alert Connor to Jessie's presence, subsequently saving her life. Following this, Engine 55 begins to gain popularity, as they realize that Dewey could become a potential firehouse dog. Due to their sudden increase in popularity, Zachary eagerly notifies them that the station is saved.  However, Shane's excitement is lost when he discovers his father has moved to his uncle's former office. Angered that his dad is trying to take his uncle's place, he roots through the files, where he discovers an unnerving number of suspected arsons, all in the general area that station 55 is responsible for. Upset that Shane felt he was being neglected, Connor makes an effort to reconcile with his son, and is shocked when Shane reveals that he feels like a bad person for being relieved when he discovered it was his uncle who died instead of his father. The next day, at a firefighter's gala, Dewey is awarded a medal for his bravery, but the moment is ruined when Dewey spots Trey in the audience, and abandons Shane for his former owner. Although Shane is heartbroken, Connor reluctantly allows an ecstatic Trey to keep the dog.  A few hours later, however, Dewey escapes Trey's hotel room to chase after Engine 55, which was recently called out to another fire at a Harbor garbage barge. The team is only too happy to allow him to climb on board. Meanwhile, Shane returns to the station to discover that the fire Engine 55 was called out to was simply a decoy, so that the suspected arsonist could burn the "Dogpatch" station to the ground. Panicking, he calls Jessie Presley's daughter, Jasmine 'JJ' Presley to work out what to do, then becoming alerted of footsteps upstairs, which turn out to be the arsonist. Ignoring JJ's warnings, he heads upstairs to confront the arsonist. To his horror, he realizes that the arsonist is in fact city manager Zach Hayden, who wanted to burn buildings in order to build a football stadium for Corbin Sellars (Matt Cooke), killing Shane's uncle in the process. After Engine 55's closure was denied, he had no choice but to burn the station down himself, but didn't realize that Shane was still in the building. As the two become trapped inside the burning building when Zachary's incendiary device ignites a gas line, Zachary quickly gives up his search for Shane, who is unconscious, and then leaves.    Meanwhile, Dewey, sensing that Shane is in danger, races back to the station as Connor follows behind, having been alerted to the fire by Jessie, who was also at the harbor fire and called by her daughter JJ. Dewey finds Zachary trying to escape, and traps him in a phone booth (which he also escapes from) before finding Shane. Connor arrives on the scene, only to find the station completely inaccessible. Hearing Dewey's barking, he eventually manages to break down the garage door and finds Shane terrified on the other side of a locked door inside the burning station. Shane manages to convince him to pass him his axe through some broken glass so he can try to break the hinges himself, despite the risks of letting the fire get fresh oxygen and flashover; Dewey then leads them out. Shane manages to tell Connor about Zachary's arson attacks before he is sent to the hospital. Furious, Connor confronts Zachary for endangering his family, and Pep gets her own payback on him before the other Dogpatch firefighters hand Zachary over to the police to be arrested.   Corbin Sellars' scam is exposed and he is arrested as well. Following the events of the fire, all of the firefighters of Engine 55 are awarded medals, including Shane and Dewey. Upon seeing how happy Dewey is with them, Trey allows Shane to keep him, adding that now that Dewey has been a true hero, he won't be content with just acting like one. Both Shane and Connor are overjoyed, with Dewey realizing his true potential as a firehouse dog. "Dogpatch" is repaired and restored from the fire damage it sustained, and Engine 55 receives a brand-new 900bhp motor so they won't be last to fires anymore. Dewey joins the engine crew as they head out on another call.

The Five of Us
 Manon ([[Jacinthe Laguë]]), Anne (Julie Deslauriers), Isa (Ingrid Falaise), Claudie (Brigitte Lafleur), and Sophie (Noemie Yelle) are all childhood friends. Ever since they were children, they would spend time at Sophie’s cottage in Montreal. The five girls, now at the age of 17, return to the cottage as they have permission from their parents to spend the weekend on their own. The girls plan to host a party during the absence of their parents. Manon and Sophie depart to pick up groceries in preparation of the party. They do not have access to a car, so they decide to hitchhike with a stranger. Manon quickly develops a romantic interest for the stranger, while Sophie remains suspicious of his behavior.  The party has begun, but Manon and Sophie have yet to return. The girls are having a blast, while Anne is worried about the safety of Manon and Sophie. Eventually, Isa takes a rowboat out with a boy in hopes to get some privacy. As the rowboat approaches land, Isa discovers Manon in the forest, stabbed and covered in blood. Sophie is missing. The boy brings Manon to safety, while Isa runs off to find Sophie.  15 years have passed since the incident. Manon is working as an administrator for a large firm. She expresses no interest in staff outings, nor does she express romantic interests towards men. She also avoids taking the elevator with any men, hence being uncomfortable in private places with them. Stéphane (Sylvain Carrier) enters the scene and invites Manon on a date, to which Manon accepts on the condition of being in a public space. Manon also refuses him from staying at her place for the night. Several days pass, and Manon begins to develop an intimate relationship with Stéphane.  Manon drives into a car wash, and recognizes the stranger that was responsible for her traumatic experience. She experiences an anxiety attack, rushes home, and locks her doors. Several flashbacks reveal that Sophie was chained to a tree and covered in blood. Manon collects and reviews the court files only to discover that the parole board granted the stranger, Richard Thibodeau (Peter Miller), [[conditional release]]. Manon then takes her medication to reduce her anxiety. Stéphane arrives unexpectedly, and discovers the court files which Manon was reviewing. He confesses his love for her, but she does not reciprocate.   Manon visits Sophie’s parents to discuss the parole board’s decision. Sophie’s mother admits that she had pardoned Thibodeau because she was exhausted, and wanted to move forward. However, Sophie’s father and Manon were in disagreement of her decision.   Manon returns home and invites Anne, who is now a mother, to her condo. Manon reveals that she had asked Sophie’s parents for permission to return to the cottage, which was granted. She makes the decision to invite all of the girls on a trip to the cottage in hopes to leave her experience in the past and move on from her trauma. At this time, Isa is a model in New York, and Claudie is a chef in Montreal. All the girls agree to accompany Manon to the cottage in hopes to confront their past.  A flashback reveals that Sophie and Isa were best friends, and that Sophie was suppose to join Isa in New York.  The girls arrive at the cottage, and explore the area in silence. Back in Montreal, Stéphane studies the case files in the library and uncovers Manon’s past. A flashback confirms that Thibodeau had raped, beaten, and stabbed Manon.  After the girls have a heated discussion on Thibodeau’s release, Manon spots Isa on a rowboat returning to the crime scene. It is revealed that Isa had found Sophie’s lifeless body, stabbed and chained to a tree. Thibodeau had forced Manon to witness him stab and rape Sophie. Manon couldn’t handle the trauma and attempted to escape, which resulted in Thibodeau murdering Sophie as a consequence for her actions. Manon faces her fear, and pursues Isa. Anne and Claudie follow along. Once they arrive at the scene, they remain relatively silent.  Another day passes by, and the girls become more comfortable and accepting of their experiences. Anne, Claudie, and Isa return to Montreal and witness the parole board’s decision on Thibodeau’s release upon [[parole]]. Manon leaves a tape for Thibodeau, expressing her thoughts and feelings towards him and her freedom of the trauma. Manon returns to Stéphane, and becomes more accepting towards her romantic and sexual relationship with him.  
Flight of Fury
 Air Force pilot John Sands (Steven Seagal) has been wrongfully imprisoned in a military detention center where his memory is to be chemically wiped out. His superiors feel threatened by the knowledge he gained from his assignments to operations that were deemed too sensitive for regular intelligence services.  A top secret Air Force Stealth Bomber known as the X-77, capable of going anywhere undetected, is stolen by corrupt Air Force pilot Ratcher (Steve Toussaint). General Tom Barnes (Angus MacInnes), Sands' former commander, hears that Sands was arrested after taking down a group of men who were robbing a rest stop. It is revealed that Sands is Ratcher's trainer, Barnes sends Sands to northern Afghanistan with fellow pilot Rick Jannick (Mark Bazeley) to recover the X-77, by promising Sands that he will be a free man if he succeeds. Barnes has Admiral Frank Pendleton (Tim Woodward), who is on an aircraft carrier in the Gulf of Arabia, keep a team of pilots on standby just in case an air attack needs to be launched on the compound where the X-77 has been hidden.  Before Sands and Jannick arrive in Afghanistan, a Navy SEAL team that was planted there to meet them is killed by a group of men led by Eliana Reed (Katie Jones). Eliana kidnaps Jannick, and she takes him to her boss, Peter Stone (Vincenzo Nicoli), the man who paid Ratcher $100 million to steal the X-77. In a village close to Stone's compound, Sands meets up with his contacts Jessica and Rojar (Alki David).  As it turns out, Stone was born from a Muslim mother and a British father. Stone had spent his childhood in the Middle East, but was educated at Oxford. Stone's mother was killed in an attack by U.S. troops during [[Gulf War|Desert Storm]], and as a result, a vengeful Stone formed the Black Sunday terrorist group. It is revealed that Eliana is Stone's second in command. She trains with a various guerrilla groups in the region, giving Stone the foundation he needs.  Now, Stone plans to use the X-77 and its pinpoint precision to drop two biological warfare bombs undetected one of them on Europe, and one of them on the United States. Stone plans to pay Ratcher another $100 million to fly the X-77 and drop the two bombs. Sands, Jessica, and Rojar, make plans to get into Stone's compound and launch an attack, but Stone has about 60 heavily armed mercenaries guarding the compound. Rojar starts a gun fight between the terrorists while Sands rescues Jannick. After a feud about the money, Ratcher shoots and kills Stone.  Sands takes on a few of the terrorists by hand as Jessica shoots and kills Eliana. Jannick catches Ratcher while Sands and Jessica leave in the X-77 but Ratcher manages to shoot him and get up in the air in a F16. After a brief dogfight, Sands manages to shoot Ratcher down and returns home.  
Flight of the Living Dead
 On a routine flight from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Paris]], a [[wikt:renegade|renegade]] group of scientists have smuggled aboard a secret container holding a fellow scientist infected with a deadly genetically engineered [[virus]] which [[zombie|reanimates the dead]]. The virus is said to be a variant of the  "[[malaria]] virus." They discovered and manufactured the virus with the intent of turning it into a [[biological weapon]].  Their goal was to produce "super soldiers" who could continue fighting in the harshest conditions, including being mortally wounded or under heavy enemy fire. The virus has to be transmitted through bodily fluids. The infected have superhuman abilities, including sprinting and leaping beyond human capabilities. The zombies also become very durable, as one survived being turned into partial mulch after being chucked into an airplane engine.  The [[Boeing 747|747 jumbo jet]] encounters massive thunderstorms, and the violent motions from turbulence releases one of the infected scientists from its cargo hold. At first, the scientist that emerged from her storage appears normal, though she has no idea where she is. Screen flashes of blood and germs indicate her succumbing to the mutated strain. The box she was in was apparantley kept at low temperatures to keep her in stasis and to quell the more powerful malaria. She spots a scientist, who lost his leg after heavy boxes landed on him, severing one leg. She pleads with him to ask where she is, only to be shot by the wounded scientist. Two of the scientists go below to ascertain if the container has been damaged by the turbulence, along with a flight crewman. They are subsequently ambushed by the lady (she would be considered Patient Zero) and a now infected scientist. The zombies then manage to break into the passenger hold, starting a zombie outbreak. The uninfected passengers must fight for survival aboard the flight. No government will allow the infected [[airliner]] to land, leaving the survivors stranded in the sky with their ravenous tormentors. Billy, his wife Anna, Burrows, Frank, Paul, and Megan, a stewardess aboard the plane, are all that are left of the uninfected. They must make their way to the cockpit and signal a fighter jet behind them that there are still living people aboard the 747 or the fighter will destroy them with a homing missile strike. After managing to get a [[MP5K]] [[machine gun]] from a dead guard, Burrows, Frank and Billy make their way from the tail of the plane to the cockpit, while the couple stay behind. Billy is bitten but manages to kill some of the undead passengers before the virus takes hold of him. When Anna comes to help Billy, she gets bitten but kills a zombie by thrusting an umbrella into its mouth. The zombies then attempt to overrun them, but Billy opens the emergency exit and most of the infected get sucked out.  Frank and Burrows make it to the cockpit where Frank kills the zombie copilot and pilot, and the two of them try to get the plane off [[autopilot]] and signal the fighter which fires at them. They are ultimately successful and waggle the plane's wings, alerting the fighter. The fighter pilot hits the abort key and the missile explodes away from the 747, but close enough to the plane to open a hole in the side. All the zombies are apparently sucked out. Frank and Burrows try to control the plane, but hit a mountain and crash land near [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].  As the survivors walk toward the city, apparently some of the zombies also survived the crash, and they lurch toward the city as well.  
Flatland (2007 film)
  In a two-[[dimensional]] world called Flatland populated by living squares, triangles, circles and other two-dimensional shapes, it is three days until the celebration of the year 3000. A Square, [[Attorney at law (United States)|attorney at law]], struggles to instruct his grandson, A Hexagon, in the art of sight recognition. The lesson is interrupted by A Square's brother B, a clerk to President Circle, warning A to stay home during a meeting at the Senate of the Great Southern Republic of Flatland.  The Senate session has been called to discuss the increasing hostilities between the government and the Chromatist movement, led by Senator Chromatistes, an irregular dodecagon. The movement seeks legalization of the right of Flatlanders to color their sides as they see fit. Traditionally taboo, laws against it had been relaxed; this emboldened the Chromatists to demand legalization. The Great Southern Republic distinguishes itself from its enemy, the Northern Kingdom, by its stances on Chromatism and Irregulars along with a democratic government. Relaxing the laws has already been perceived as weakness by the Northern Kingdom who are massing on the borders.  Against his brother's warning, A Square meets his new client, the first female charged as a Chromatist;  on his way home he is caught in the melee leaving the Senate. President Circle's soldiers killed Senator Chromatistes and his supporters, sparking a riot across the city. A Square just gets home safely, then barricades his family against the chaos for the night.  Once asleep, A Square dreams of visiting a one-dimensional world, Lineland, and attempts to convince the realm's ignorant king of a second dimension, but fails to make him see outside of his eternally straight line. A Square awakens to learn that the deadly riots originated in the Senate meeting that B Square was attending. A visit to B Square's home confirms that he is missing. A Square scours the city, now under martial law, seeking B Square. At the marketplace, he meets a merchant selling a fascinating "glow point", and buys one for A Hexagon, who has been sulking since being disciplined for coloring one of his sides purple.  The family prepares for another anxious night, only to be terrified by the sudden appearance of A Sphere, CEO of Messiah, Inc. A Sphere declares that A Square is his apostle of the Three Dimensions and privately begins to explain things to him. A Square refuses to entertain the notion of three [[dimensions]], resorting to violence with A Sphere. A Sphere decides the only way to convince A Square of the three dimensions is to show him.  Suddenly and painfully, A Square is plucked out of his dimension and into Spaceland. After the initial shock, the reality of 3 dimensions becomes clear to A Square, along with the possibility of locating his brother from his newfound vantage point. Having business himself at the Great Hall, A Sphere brings A Square to look for his brother there. On their arrival, A Sphere expounds upon three dimensions to President Circle and the Priests who anticipated this event. After rejecting A Sphere's message and attempting to kill him, the Flatland leaders execute all who have witnessed the event, except B Square, who is imprisoned for life on pain of death in exchange for his silence while his brother watches from high above Flatland.  Realizing that time in Spaceland is short, at least for A Square, A Sphere brings him to Messiah, Inc. to finish his education on the gospel of Three Dimensions. Enthralled by the complex world of Spaceland, A Square posits further about 4 dimensions and so forth to A Sphere who dismisses it as nonsense. Meanwhile, A Square's intrusion into Spaceland has become a national emergency, which prompts the Spaceland Senate to call to him to appear for a hearing, to explain this breach of protocol of bringing a Flatlander into their midst. They claim it will be viewed as an act of, and provocation for, war by their enemies, the X-Axis.  During the hearing, A Square also learns that the X-Axis considers the Great Senate as weak because they have allowed the continued existence of his own world, Flatland, which they view as an abomination. As the debate rages, an ailing A Square tries to explain his theory of multiple dimensions to an unsympathetic crowd. Air-raid sirens wail as A Square collapses from the overwhelming effects of gravity on his two-dimensional body and chaos ensues.  A Sphere manages to send his dying apostle back on his way to Flatland via a mailing tube before bombs destroy both Messiah, Inc. and A Sphere himself, but A Square's journey back is halted by A Sphere's hovercraft, who attempts to crush A Square to avenge A Sphere's death. But, an X-Axis ship crashes into and destroys the hovercraft, and A Square ends up plunging in freefall toward Flatland and through its surface into unknown regions below, where he experiences a revelation on dimensionality and infinity.  A Square finds himself in his own bed on the eve of the year 3000 and his family informs him that the government has issued orders for the arrest of anyone proclaiming the gospel of three dimensions. Undeterred, A Square hurries to see his brother in Flatland jail to discuss their new shared knowledge of the third dimension. B Square, afraid of execution, denies the experience and in a panic assaults his brother who falls temporarily into an unconscious state where he hallucinates A Sphere along with the Monarch of Pointland who curiously resembles a “glow point.” As the Monarch drones on in his monologue of “being the all in all, the one in the one,” A Sphere informs his former apostle that time is short and A Square must proclaim the gospel of the three dimensions to his fellow Flatlanders although they, like the Monarch, will probably remain trapped within their own perspectives.  Returning to himself, A Square escapes Flatland prison and outruns the guards. Arriving home, A Square informs his wife that they are going to defect to the Northern Kingdom where he might be able to spread the gospel of three dimensions to a more open minded populace. The soldiers arrive and A Square escapes with the help of Frau A Square's “war cry” that temporarily stuns them. Before he can reach the border, A Square is cornered by the soldiers whose attempt to dismantle and segment him is thwarted by the Northern Kingdom army's attack. In the fracas, things suddenly begin to disappear as though sucked down through the fabric of Flatland until only A Square remains. He too begins to disappear until there is only his eye, then a point of light, a glowing point of light, which welcomes him into another dimension.  
Flash Point (film)
 Set in pre-1997, before the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|return of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China]], the film opens with brothers Archer, Tony and Tiger discussing a drug deal with Sam, a rival gang leader. Ma Jun, a serious criminal investigations detective (who has been reprimanded for frequently inflicting injury on suspects), along with his team, raids the nightclub for investigation, and winds up fighting against his partner, Wilson, who has been planted as a mole.  The three brothers are later confronted by Sam and his gang, who are impatient over receiving the drugs from the brothers' native Vietnam, but they are kept at bay with violence and intimidation. The brothers later threaten the elder leaders of their gang, when they attempt to intervene. Tiger is later assigned to kill Sam in his car, but the plan fails when Wilson intervenes. While in hospital, Sam agrees to testify in court against the three brothers. On the night of their mother's birthday, the brothers plan to recover their drug money, but as they are doing so, Archer is arrested by Hong Kong police, while Tony and Tiger discover that Wilson is a mole and attempt to get rid of him.  While in court, Archer is forced to turn in all of his travel documents, which will prevent him from fleeing Hong Kong before his hearing. Tiger and Tony brutally murder Sam along with several other witnesses and crime figures crucial to the police investigation. They attempt again to kill Wilson, delivering a bomb which kills inspector Wong and injures Wilson's pregnant girlfriend, Judy, but fails to harm Wilson. Tony and Tiger then disguise themselves as janitors to sneak into the hospital where he is being protected by the police. Ma and Tiger both end up in the same elevator and Tiger attempts to kill Wilson with a silenced pistol once he appears, but Ma is aware of him and at the last moment engages him in a fierce struggle. After being disarmed, Tiger attempts to escape, but Ma gives chase until he corners him at an outdoor restaurant. Tiger uses a little girl as a hostage and then severely injures her by throwing her through the air onto the concrete. Ma furiously engages him in combat, during which he smashes poor Tiger's nose with a knee to the face and breaks his spine performing a [[Ura nage | German suplex]], and punches him to death in front of the crowd. Tony, having kidnapped Judy from the hospital, threatens to kill her if Wilson, now a sole witness, testifies in court. During the court hearing, Wilson refuses to testify, and the case is dismissed for lack of evidence. Wilson later attempts to rescue Judy, but is captured by Tony and his gang.  Once Archer walks free, Ma captures him and calls Tony for an exchange of hostages, leading to a confrontation in an abandoned village. Ma rescues Wilson and Judy, then singlehandedly takes on the remaining gangsters, killing most of them with a sniper rifle. Wilson returns to assist him and helps to subdue Archer. Ma corners Tony and, having exhausted his ammunition, engages him in a gruelling hand-to-hand fight, eventually strangling him to unconsciousness in order to finally arrest him.

Flatland: The Movie
  The 2-dimensional Arthur Square awakens from a dream of strange, glowing symbols. He lives with his wife, Arlene Square, and his curious granddaughter Hex, a hexagon. Hex and Arthur discuss the laws of inheritance: how each new generation of Flatlanders, beginning with triangles, gains a new side until the shapes become indistinguishable from circles. They also discuss how a citizen's shape affects their job, with triangles performing menial labor and circles ruling Flatland in the priest class. They witness a cruel incident where a Circle Priest arrests a slightly irregular octagon child, prompting Hex to yet again wonder what happened to her pentagonal parents. Arthur tells her that he will tell her someday.  The head circle ruler of Flatland, Pantocyclus, issues a new edict that bans discussion of heretical topics such as a third dimension or the ruins at Area 33H. Arthur recognizes an image of the ruins from his dream.  Arthur gives Hex a geometry lesson, showing how powers in arithmetic can be translated to geometrical dimensions. When Hex speculates on a third dimension, Arthur becomes infuriated and sends her to her room. To calm Hex, Arlene gives her her mother's box containing books and a model of the symbols at Area 33H.  That night, Arthur Square is taken to a strange landscape. He encounters the insane King of Pointland, a being of zero dimensions. Then he encounters Lineland, a universe of one dimension that is populated by an arrogant line segment King who cannot imagine a new dimension that he cannot see. Finally, Arthur is whisked back to his living room. He hears a voice booming out and sees a point grow to a circle and then back to a point. The being identifies himself as Spherius, a three-dimensional solid from Spaceland. After Spherius fails to explain the third dimension, Arthur is popped into Spaceland. They stop at Area 33H and Arthur realizes that the symbols show a progression from point to line to square to cube, and that the constantly changing shape in the center is actually a cube, halfway through the plane of Flatland and spinning along all three axes. Arthur asks Spherius to show him the fourth dimension and the fifth dimension Spherius says there couldn't possibly be a higher dimension. He tells Arthur to spread the word of the third dimension and drops Arthur back into bed. Meanwhile, at the Ministry, Pantocyclus is ordering the triangle guards and circles, including Miss Helios (Arthur's boss), to beware any employees who mention the third dimension and to guard Area 33H.  Hex leaves to explore Area 33H, but a triangle guard spots her. At the Ministry, Arthur is talking to his brother, when an alarm goes off. Over the intercom, Miss Helios orders all guards to catch an intruder at Area 33H. Arthur realizes it might be Hex and persuades Abbott (his brother) to help him steal a Ministry car.  Abbott and Arthur arrive at the ruins moments before the triangle guards. With Abbott distracting the guards, Arthur goes to the symbols and finds Hex terrified. Arthur admits to her that her parents were arrested and killed for their theories about the third dimension. With the guards closing in, Arthur pushes Hex into the cube symbol, which pops her up into the third dimension. Arthur is arrested by Miss Helios.  Arthur is hastily brought into a courtroom with Pantocyclus proceeding over his trial for heresy. Arlene arrives and asks where Hex is. In his cell, Arthur assures her that Hex escaped 'upward' into the third dimension and is safe. A nearby pentagon begins broadcasting the trial. Pantocyclus challenges Arthur to show everyone the third dimensionArthur admits that he can't but pleads to his fellow Flatlanders that reason dictates a third dimension. He challenges them to aspire to be greater than their shapes, angering the Circles immensely. In a fit of rage, Pantocyclus sentences Arthur to death, but Spherius suddenly pops Arthur out of Flatland.  Arthur thanks Spherius but feels he has failed to persuade people of the third dimension. Spherius tells Arther that he intended Hex, not Arthur, to be the prophet of the Third Dimension. Hex embraces Arthur and they fly back down to the courtroom, surprising everyone as they materialize out of nowhere. The Circles are speechless and lose control of the courtroom, evading the reporter's questions about the third dimension. Arthur, Arlene, Hex, and Abbott are reunited. The reporter asks Hex if she has also visited the fourth dimension. Spherius angrily comes down to Flatland to scoff at the idea and flies off.   The symbols at Area 33H are glowing and as the camera dips below Flatland we see that the spinning cube is actually part of a larger installation: eight cubes spinning and orbiting a 4D cube – a [[tesseract]] – which, in turn, is rotating around its fourth axis.   
Flawless (2007 film)
 A reporter enters a restaurant to interview Laura Quinn, the only woman to ever have been a manager at the London Diamond Corporation, for a puff piece about the first generation of women entering the workforce. Quinn places a box on the table, revealing a huge diamond, and says,   "I stole it." The reporter, suddenly enthralled, assumes that Quinn has been in prison for the theft all this time.    The story then flashes back to 1960, when Quinn was still employed as a manager at London Diamond Corporation. She is passed over for a promotion for the sixth time despite being intellectually superior to her male co-workers. Quinn discovers that she is getting fired from the janitor, Mr. Hobbs. He offers her a place in a plot: stealing enough diamonds to make them rich, but not enough to be noticed. Knowing she is considered old by her coworkers and has few other professional prospects, she agrees.   Quinn and Mr. Hobbs hatch a plan, exploiting a weakness in the new camera security system. However, Mr. Hobbs steals every single diamond from the vault, almost two tons worth, and holds them for a ransom of 100 million pounds. The head of the insurance syndicate from King's Row is forced to pay the ransom, leaving him financially ruined. Quinn, having never agreed to this, now finds herself trapped.   The company hires a private investigator, Mr. Finch, to keep the matter from going public. Suspicious from the start, Mr. Finch keeps a close eye on Mr. Hobbs and Miss Quinn. Quinn wants to avoid jail time by giving the diamonds back but Mr. Hobbs refuses. Having no idea where he's hidden them she conceals their scheme.   The situation escalates as the diamonds are not returned, the incident is leaked to the Press, and the president of London Diamond Corporation has a heart attack due to the stress. Feeling cornered while out for a drink with Mr. Finch, Miss Quinn runs to the bathroom and cries uncontrollably.  After losing her diamond earring down the drain, she gets an idea as to how the heist could have been pulled and where the diamonds could be. Excusing herself, she goes down into the sewer under the company and finds Mr. Hobbs guarding a passage. He pulls a gun on her, but she finds a huge diamond at her feet. Mr. Hobbs confesses that he has no interest in the diamonds or the money, and wants to ruin the head of the insurance syndicate whose deliberate delay in covering his wife's medical expenses resulted in her death many years before.   Once the deadline for the ransom has passed, resulting in the insurance head's suicide, Mr. Hobbs leaves. Miss Quinn finds the rest of diamonds and calls Mr. Finch claiming she followed a hunch. While there is sufficient proof that she was involved in the incident, Mr. Finch is unwilling to press charges against Quinn. Finch instead acts by helping the company recover the stolen property and implying to the press that the theft was just a rumor.   The story returns to the present. Quinn tells the reporter that she resigned and shortly after received a letter from a bank in Switzerland: Mr. Hobbs apologized for involving her, needing a disgruntled employee for access to the diamond vault, and as compensation gave her the ransom money. Quinn details how she spent the rest of her life donating all of the money left to her to many different organizations and people in need. She has returned to London after a long absence only to tell  the story and leave the diamond she found in the sewer, calling it the last reminder of the woman she was.

  In flashback, Niall ([[Thomas Nelstrop]]), a local news reporter, recalls visiting his mother's grave, as he smartens up in a toilet mirror.  His colleague Tammy ([[Sally Bretton]]) knocks on the toilet door to hurry him up and as they walk to the car she instructs him on the art of the '[[death knock]]': knocking on the doors of the recently bereaved to obtain quotes and pictures of the deceased for the newspaper.  Niall's poor track record has put his job on the line and Tammy has been detailed to improve his hit-rate.  When they reach the house of Mrs Wright, who has lost her son in a car accident, Niall goes in first while Tammy waits outside.  Before Niall can introduce himself and launch into his spiel that Tammy has prepared for him, Mrs Wright (April Nicholson) interrupts him – "I know who you are" – and ushers him into the house.  There she ropes him into unstacking the dishwasher as Niall tries in vain to broach the subject of the bereavement against the sound of a fire alarm which has been set off by the cigarette Mrs Wright is smoking.  Mrs Wright appears baffled by Niall's requests for pictures and instead offers him some soup telling him they will look at some pictures "in the morning", much to Niall's surprise.  She then leads him upstairs to the bedroom and encourages him to get some rest.  Trapped in the bedroom, Niall examines the dead boy's belongings and finds himself playing with his toys.  Meanwhile, Tammy waits outside taking a phone call from her boss at the newspaper, to whom she explains that Niall "is still in there, so he must be doing alright".  Whilst playing with a [[Lightsaber|light sabre]],  Niall knocks off a shelf-load of items and as he picks them up, he finds a photo of the dead boy.  Mrs Wright, alerted by the noise, appears behind him and embracing Niall, she tells him: "it's been a long day: time for bed."  Tammy knocks at the door and attempts to talk to Mrs Wright about the accident in which her son was killed, but Mrs Wright replies that her son is in his room and that there must be some mistake.   Closing the door, she is nonetheless shaken by Tammy's insistence that her son is dead and she climbs the stairs to the bedroom where she finds Niall tucked up fast asleep in her son's bed.  She kisses him on the cheek and switches out the light.

 A devastating [[flood]] strikes [[London]] when the [[Thames Barrier]] is overwhelmed by a huge surge of water. A [[storm surge]] travels between the [[United Kingdom]] and mainland [[Europe]], raising [[sea level]]s and coinciding with the [[spring tide]]. Several parts of Scotland are devastated, including [[Wick, Highland|Wick]].  The [[Met Office]]'s head forecaster, Keith Hopkins, mistakenly believes the storm will head towards [[Holland]] and is guilt-ridden by Deputy Prime Minister Campbell when he becomes annoyed by the failed forecasts. Professor Leonard Morrison proves that the approaching surge of water will break through the Thames Barrier and flood central London in the next 3 hours. Leonard had focused his life around the belief that the barrier was built in the wrong area, and turned his now apologetic son Rob into a bitter man.  [[Deputy Prime Minister]] Campbell, in charge while the prime minister is away, declares a [[state of emergency]]. He begins to evacuate over one million civilians from Central London before the water surge hits. He is assisted by Police Commissioner Patricia Nash, Major General Ashcroft and others.  The Thames barrier is raised, but the huge wave of water (now over 46 meters high) overwhelms the barrier and sweeps into the city. Rob and his ex-wife Sam, both expert engineers, jump into the Thames to escape. Leonard is saved by a military helicopter and taken to [[Whitehall]], where the authority figures desperately require his assistance in finding a way to handle this emergency.  Rob and Sam end up in the [[London Underground]] with other survivors. They are led through a ventialtion duct to higher ground by two underground maintenance workers, Bill and Zack. When the surge floods the station, the currents drown Bill. The group find themselves in the flooded [[Trafalgar Square]], where Rob and Sam are able to contact Leonard. They end up returning with him to the barrier, where Leonard believes the water flow can be reversed back out of London, as the tide has turned and the water level is starting to go down. But the military's Ashcroft disagrees and prepares to destroy the barrier with an air strike.  Hopkins, feeling even more guilty when thousands of corpses are shown on a news report, quietly disappears and is later reported by Ashcroft to be dead, an apparent suicide. Nash is at odds with Ashcroft, wanting to give the Morrisons a chance to remedy the situation, while also distraught over her own two missing daughters.  Rob, Sam and Leonard discover the controls to the Thames barrier are now underwater. One can activate them, but likely will not survive. Rob and Sam try to decide which of them should go, but Leonard leaves on the suicide mission behind their backs. He saves London by activating the barrier's controls before running out of air whilst underwater and dying in the effort.  Campbell is informed that the Thames barrier has been activated and orders the air strike to be aborted. Rob and Sam lower the Thames barrier and the water flows back out of London.

Food for the Gods
 In the protagonist role, [[Yvette Lu]] is "Sheenyana," a beautiful, mystic warrior and member of the fictional [[Kyontawa people|Kyontawa]] tribe—a post-[[Neolithic]] [[tribe]] of [[human]]s residing on a pristine forested world, presumably in the [[Alpha Centauri]] star system.<ref>During dialog, Dr. Denise Hanson, a character in the film, mentions that they have landed over four light-years from Earth.  Alpha Centauri is approximately that same distance from Earth.</ref>  In the story, the Kyontawa are the descendents of a highly advanced Asian civilization from Earth's forgotten history, which established a deep-space settlement on what is now Sheenyana's planet.  Clearly, that high-tech civilization is no more and the Kyontawa's knowledge of it is limited to their religious mythology of "Bird Gods" who seeded their people from the sky.  Their language (subtitled in the film) has similarities to Asian languages of Earth, particularly Japanese.  After a [[NASA]] expedition lands in Sheenyana’s forest, Sheenyana saves the life of American astronaut Lt. Richard O’Conner (Danny Dorosh).  Their connection is immediate and, before long, the two fall into a forbidden affair—the foundation of a cultural clash which will threaten to rip them apart.

Mother Claus advises Fred to be a better person by stating he should be more like his brother; this in turn causes Fred to resent Nick. Feeling isolated, Fred often climbs a tree to confide his problems in a bird. On one occasion, Nick cuts down the tree, saying that now Fred can bring it inside since he liked it so much. However, the birdhouse Fred's confidant lived in is smashed, causing the bird to leave; this causes a permanent rift between Fred and Nick.

Meanwhile, Clyde deliberately sabotages the mail sorting department by shredding countless children's letters, which later gives Nick a second strike. Believing that Fred is putting Nick under stress, a family meeting is called (which Fred was tied up and taken to) with Wanda present, and Fred leaves by saying that therapy is for families who want to be together, and their family does not have that problem. When Slam is placed at the top of the most naughty list, Fred understands that Slam has just had it hard and is not naughty. He then stamps every kids' description as nice.  Furious at what Fred has done wrong, Nick ends up fighting with him, in which Nick injures his back. Angry with Nick, Fred leaves the North Pole with his $50,000, but Nick gives Fred a present to take with him. Fred waits until he returns home to open the gift, which is a birdhouse, a replacement for the one on the tree, and a note from Nick which says, "I'm sorry for cutting down your tree. Love, Nick."  Fred is confused and enters a Siblings Anonymous meeting. At the end, Bill Clinton's younger half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr, makes a speech about his brother's success. Back at the North Pole, it looks like Christmas is lost. Nick is in bed and cannot make his Christmas Eve journey of delivering presents.  Willie reminds Fred that, according to a long-standing rule, only a member of the Claus family can deliver the presents and Fred qualifies. Fred begins delivering presents to children around the world and Willie joins him to assist with the flying of the sleigh and the navigation. Meanwhile, Clyde sabotages their efforts at midnight by shutting off the power, which was the only way for the North Pole to communicate to Fred and Willie, helping them navigate. While Fred and Willie attempt to finish delivering the gifts for the children, Nick talks to Clyde by realizing that when he was a boy, Clyde did not get what he wanted from Nick because he would act up due to bullying, which resulted in him growing up to be the man he is. Nick realizes, thanks to Fred, that his definition of naughty was flawed. Nick makes peace with him by giving Clyde the Superman cape he wanted as a kid but never got.   Fred stops by the foster home to visit Slam and bring him the puppy (Macaroni) he wanted. Fred faces away from Slam to hide his identity and explains to Slam that he should become a better person. As the rest of the elves anxiously wait in the tavern, Willie marches in and, with newfound confidence, he walks up to Charlene, grabs a chair to stand on, and kisses her. After Fred announces that Christmas has been saved, everyone gathers around the giant snow globe to watch the children of the world open their presents. Nick tells Fred that he is the best big brother anybody could ever ask for, and they finally make amends.  Fred returns to Wanda's house and she is initially upset to see him and tells him to leave. He refuses and states that he is moving in with her. He gives her a present. Wanda opens it to find a teddy bear holding a French flag. That night, Fred takes Wanda to France in Santa's sleigh, and they circle around the Eiffel Tower ("It's a company car. It's one of the perks." says Fred). The two continue dating, and Charlene and Willie are now happy together. By next Christmas, Slam is adopted, but Fred never stops watching out for him - even becoming the coach of his [[Little League Baseball]] team. As for Clyde, Nick hires him as an efficiency consultant and he teaches the elves how to use a [[spreadsheet]]. Nick and Mrs. Claus, as well as Nick and Fred's parents visit Fred's and Wanda's house for Christmas. It is evident that Fred and his mom have grown closer. Fred has also become a true Claus; while Nick has lost a bit of weight, Fred has gained some. The movie ends by showing the bird house hung up outside Fred's window, and a bird, who looks like the one Fred befriended, perched on it.  
Fracture (2007 film)
 Theodore "Ted" Crawford ([[Anthony Hopkins]]), a wealthy and resourceful Irish aeronautical engineer in [[Los Angeles]], confirms that his wife, Jennifer ([[Embeth Davidtz]]), is having an affair with police detective Robert Nunally ([[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]]). Confronting his wife, Crawford shoots her. Police are called, including Nunally, who enters the house cautiously, negotiating with Crawford for both to put down their guns. Crawford confesses he shot his wife. Recognizing the victim, and being subtly goaded by Crawford, Nunally becomes enraged and assaults him.  Now in jail awaiting trial, Crawford engages in a battle of wits with rising star deputy district attorney William "Willy" Beachum ([[Ryan Gosling]]), who considers the case an open-and-shut matter and agrees to go to trial immediately. Beachum is preparing to transition from criminal law to a corporate attorneyship at well-known law firm Wooton & Simms, and flirts with his future boss, Nikki Gardner ([[Rosamund Pike]]).  At the trial, Crawford acts as his own attorney, thereby matching himself, an untrained litigant, against a star prosecutor. Crawford informs the court that the arresting officer (Nunally) was having an affair with his wife, assaulted him during his arrest, and was present during his interrogation. Crawford's confession is therefore ruled inadmissible as evidence, being ''[[fruit of the poisonous tree]]''. Beachum discovers that Crawford's handgun could not have been used in the shooting because it does not match shell casings at the crime scene and in fact has never been fired. This baffles police, since CCTV surveillance was in effect during the shooting and until Crawford's arrest.  Nunally comes up with a scheme to [[Frameup|plant false evidence]] to implicate Crawford, which Beachum rejects. With no new evidence to present, Beachum has to concede the trial, and Crawford is [[Acquittal|acquitted]]. Disgraced, Nunally commits [[suicide]] outside the court.  Beachum's future with the prestigious firm is now in tatters. However, he begins to see his D.A. job as a means to fight for justice for those such as Crawford's wife. Crawford himself observes the change, commenting sarcastically that Beachum has "found God". This motivates Beachum to continue searching for evidence, almost obsessively. Realizing that Crawford's plan is to dispose of the only eyewitness to the crime, Beachum obtains a court order to keep Jennifer on [[life support]]. He arrives at the hospital, but is unable to prevent staff turning off her life support.  A mix-up of cell phones causes Beachum to realize that Nunally and Crawford both used the same type of gun, a .45 caliber [[Glock 21]]. He figures out that before the crime Crawford must have switched his and Nunally's guns in the hotel room where Jennifer and Nunally secretly met. Crawford had shot his wife with Nunally's gun, then reloaded it. The detective had arrived on the scene carrying Crawford's gun, and both had put down their weapons as a preliminary move in negotiations. When Nunally had recognized the victim, rushing over to Jennifer, Crawford had switched the guns again, retrieving his own, unused, weapon. When Crawford had reappeared brandishing his gun, Nunally had tackled and assaulted him, before Crawford's arrest. Nunally had then unwittingly holstered the murder weapon, allowing the unused gun be taken as evidence.  Beachum confronts Crawford with his deductions. With Jennifer now dead, the bullet lodged in her head can now be retrieved and matched with Nunally's gun. Crawford confesses, confident he is protected by the principle of ''[[Double Jeopardy Clause|Double Jeopardy]]''. However, Beachum drily informs him that by allowing his wife to die, Crawford can now be prosecuted for [[murder]], having previously been tried merely for [[attempted murder]]. Since he had taken Jennifer off life support, new charges can be filed against Crawford and a new trial can be set. Crawford is arrested by waiting police.  The film ends with a new trial about to begin, with Beachum prosecuting and Crawford surrounded by a team of highly paid defense attorneys from Wooton & Simms.

 A young girl who's about 10 years old lives in a farmhouse in the [[Jura mountains]] in eastern France. One day in autumn, when she rides her bicycle to school through the forest, she observes a fox hunting. Of course, the fox escapes, but the girl yearns to meet the animal again.  During the following months, the girl spends most of her free time in the forest trying to find the fox, but she doesn't meet it again until winter arrives. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks. She is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle.  The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest.  When spring arrives, the girl is looking for foxholes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves from one foxhole to another because of the girl's inquisitiveness; so the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance.  The girl finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox comes to her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through the brittle plate glass window, shattering the glass. The fox is hurt badly but survives. The girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and are not possessions.  Years later she tells the whole story to her son, as seen at the end of the film. Some versions (DVD English) replace this scene with a text graphic.

 Thelma (Cherry Pie Picache), together with her husband Dado (Dan Alvaro) and teenage sons Gerald (Alwyn Uytingco) and Yuri (Jiro Manio), are an urban poor family hired by a local foster care facility to provide temporary home and care to abandoned babies pending the latter's formal adoption. The inevitable separation is heart-rending for the foster family.  Thelma's foster child John-John (Kier Segismundo) is to be turned over to his adoptive American parents.

Freedom Writers
 In 1994, in Long Beach, California, Erin Gruwell ([[Hilary Swank]]) has been accepted to teach English for at-risk students at Woodrow Wilson High School, a once highly acclaimed school, but racial tensions have increased since the [[Los Angeles riot of 1992|Los Angeles Riots of 1992]]. Erin struggles to connect to her students and she experiences numerous fights between some students, who are in rival gangs.  One night, Eva Benitez ([[April L. Hernandez]]), her boyfriend, and a friend go to a convenience store. Sindy ([[Jaclyn Ngan]]), a Cambodian refugee, frequents the same convenience store. Grant Rice (Armand Jones), an African-American student at Woodrow Wilson, frustrated at losing an arcade game, demands a refund from the store owner. As Grant storms out of the store, Eva's boyfriend, Paco (as retaliation for losing a fight against Grant that took place earlier during a gang fight at Woodrow Wilson), attempts a drive-by shooting to kill Grant, but misses accidentally killing Sindy's boyfriend. As a witness, Eva must testify at court; she intends to guard "her own" in her testimony.  At school, Gruwell intercepts a racist drawing by one of her high school students and utilizes it to teach them about the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], most of whom have no knowledge of. She gradually begins to earn their trust and buys them composition books to record their diaries, in which they talk about their experiences of being abused, seeing their friends die, and being evicted. Determined to reform her high school students, Gruwell takes on two part-time jobs to pay for more books and spends a lot more time at school, much to the disappointment of her husband ([[Patrick Dempsey]]). Her students start to behave with respect and discover a lot more. A transformation is specifically visible in one student, Marcus ([[Jason Finn (actor)|Jason Finn]]). Gruwell invites various Jewish Holocaust survivors to talk with her class about their experiences and requires the students to attend a field trip to the [[Museum of Tolerance]]. Meanwhile, her unique training methods are scorned by her colleagues and department chair Margaret Campbell ([[Imelda Staunton]]).  The following school year comes, and Gruwell teaches her class (now sophomores) again, making it the second year that she is their teacher. On the first day of semester, Gruwell makes her class do a "Toast for Change", allowing everyone to open up about their struggles and what they wish to change about themselves. Later on, the class makes enough money to have [[Miep Gies]] to arrive to the United States and tell her experience when she helped [[Anne Frank]], her family, and the Van Pels hide from the [[Nazis]]; she then also persuades to the students that they are heroes and that they "within their own small ways, [can] turn on a small light in a dark room." These two events inspire Eva to break free of the demands of her father to always protect her own rather than tell the truth. At Grant's trial, she shocks the courtroom by revealing that Paco actually killed Sindy's boyfriend in the store; Grant is spared of being convicted and Sindy later forgives Eva. On leaving the court, Eva is attacked and threatened but ultimately spared by members of her gang and ends up going to live with her aunt in order to keep herself safe.  Meanwhile, Gruwell asks her students to write their diaries in book form. She compiles the entries and names it ''The Freedom Writers Diary''. Her husband divorces her and Margaret tells her she cannot teach her kids for their junior year. Gruwell fights this decision, eventually convincing the superintendent to permit her to teach her kids' junior and senior year, much to their elation. The film ends with a note that Gruwell successfully prepared numerous high school students to graduate high school and attend college, for many the first in their families to do so.  
Frontier(s)
 A [[Far-right politics|far-right]] candidate is elected to the [[President of France|French presidency]], sparking riots in [[Paris]]. Hoping to escape Paris but needing cash, a street gang made up of Muslim [[Arabs in France|Arab]] youths; Alex ([[Aurélien Wiik]]), Tom (David Saracino), Farid ([[Chems Dahmani]]), the pregnant Yasmine (Karina Testa), and her brother Sami ([[Adel Bencherif]]) take advantage of the chaos to pull off a robbery. Sami is shot and the group splits up: Alex and Yasmine take Sami to a hospital, and Tom and Farid take the money to a family-run inn near the border. Innkeepers Gilberte ([[Estelle Lefébure]]) and Klaudia (Amélie Daure) claim their rooms are free and seduce the two men.  At the hospital, the emergency room staff report Sami's injury to the police. Sami insists Yasmine run before the police catch her. His dying wish is that Yasmine not have an abortion. Alex and Yasmine flee, leaving the fatally wounded Sami behind. Alex and Yasmine phone their friends for directions to the inn. Tom and Farid give them directions but soon after are brutally attacked by Gilberte, Klaudia, and Goetz ([[Samuel Le Bihan]]). When Tom and Farid try to escape, Goetz runs their car off a cliff. The injured men wander into a mine shaft, where Tom is quickly recaptured. Farid must fend for himself in the mine with the family's rejected children. Unaware of the danger, Alex and Yasmine arrive at the inn and are captured by the family.  Alex and Yasmine are chained in a muddy-floored pig pen. Alex breaks Yasmine's chains and allows her to escape. When the captors discover Yasmine's escape, the family patriarch, von Geisler (Jean-Pierre Jorris), cuts Alex's [[Achilles tendons]]. Meanwhile, in the mine, Farid finds the storage area for the victims. The family realizes something is amiss in the mine, and Hans (Joël Lefrançois) chases Farid into a boiler where Farid is cooked alive. Yasmine flees from the inn but is quickly picked back up by Goetz. Back in the pig pen, von Geisler personally grants Alex's last wish, which is to be put down quickly. Initially, von Geisler wishes for Karl (Patrick Ligardes) to "wed" Yasmine to carry on the family lineage, but when von Geisler learns she is already pregnant, he entrusts her to the meek Eva ([[Maud Forget]]), who tells Yasmine that she came to the family in a very similar manner and that she is obedient because the family promised her that her parents would return for her some day. Eva also tells Yasmine of the rejected homeless children she and Hans care for in the mine.  Eventually, Eva leads Yasmine down to dinner, where the family awaits her. Von Geisler is revealed to be a former (and still practicing) [[Nazism|Nazi]] who's lived at the inn since the end of [[World War II|WWII]]. Von Geisler offers up a toast to the new blood and Yasmine quickly grabs a large knife and takes von Geisler hostage. Hans grabs a shotgun and shoots and kills von Geisler in the confusion; Karl shoots Hans dead in turn. Yasmine escapes and is chased by Karl and Goetz into the mine. Yasmine eventually makes her way into one of the body storage rooms where she fights with Goetz. After a bloody struggle, she repeatedly hits him with an axe before impaling him on a rotating [[table saw]]. Karl catches Yasmine as she tries to return to the surface, but Eva comes to the rescue, blowing off Karl's head with a shotgun. Yasmine searches for car keys to escape, but is ambushed by Gilberte and Klaudia bearing sub-machine guns. During the shootout, Yasmine hits a gas tank, blowing up the room. Gilberte survives the explosion and attempts to kill Yasmine only to have her throat torn out by her. With everyone else in the neo-Nazi family dead, Yasmine tries to persuade Eva to leave with her, but Eva stays to take care of the children in the mine. On the road, Yasmine runs into a police blockade near the border where she surrenders to the authorities.

Freelance (2007 film)
 Elliot Guilespie (Bob Kunkel) is a smalltown twentysomething with aspirations of stardom in television news as his alter-ego, Lance Windchaser.  He idolises the local TV news anchor, Rod Reel (Tim Hensely), who is intermittently shown reporting on the spree of a local [[serial killer]] known as the Rubik's Cube Killer, or "RCK".  Elliot's home life is less than ideal; he still lives with his mother and never knew his father, who was killed in a "freak hospital accident". Compounding Elliot's frustrating life is Roy-Henry Ringold (Sean Mann), who terrorized Elliot in high school, but is now a recovering [[alcoholic]] and desperately seeks his forgiveness. Roy-Henry's quest for forgiveness is conflicted with the fact that he is sleeping with Elliot's mother and feels compelled to act as a father figure to the aimless Elliot. As if that weren't enough, Elliot works for Roy-Henry's landscaping company.  Elliot does not own a car and is unwilling to ingratiate himself to Roy-Henry for transportation, so his main mode of transportation comes from Toby's Taxi Service, driven by Toby (Jackson Williamson), a [[clinical depression|depressed]] family man who vents to an unwilling Elliot about the horrors of his hen-pecked homelife.  After a disastrous attempt at handling the filming and the reporting simultaneously, Elliot enlists Toby as his cameraman. Desperate for friendship and an opportunity to escape his horrible marriage, Toby happily agrees and the two begin a whirlwind escapade of [[freelance journalism]] marked largely by failure, ridicule, and numerous injuries.  Things start to look up for Elliot when Roy-Henry is killed in a hit and run accident. Elliot is overjoyed to be free of Roy-Henry's smothering presence, but his newfound happiness is quickly shot down by his idol Rod Reel, who mercilessly ridicules Elliot's work. Elliot becomes unhinged as he realises his only shot at making the news may be to actually "make the news". Soon after his epiphany, Elliot is shown reporting suspiciously quickly on several acts of anti-Rod Reel vandalism. Further complicating things, Elliot falls in love with a prostitute (Nichole Harrison) he meets while riding along on Toby's taxi runs. Believing Elliot is interested in her services, she gives him her card. When Elliot goes to her place to see her again, he is surprised to find she has committed suicide to escape from the shame of her past misdeeds, of which, prostitution is the least troublesome. Finally snapping, Elliot decides to use her body to fake the next RCK killing and be the first to report it, thus showing up Rod Reel and proving his worth as a reporter. His plans are thwarted as Toby arrives and witnesses Elliot arranging the gruesome tableau and, believing his friend to be a killer, calls the police. The film ends with a blood soaked Elliot being dragged away into a squad car as Rod Reel ironically reports live on the scene of Elliot's capture as the "RCK Killer".

 George and Ann Farber, their son Georgie, and their dog Lucky arrive at their lake house. Their next-door neighbour, Fred, is seen with two young men, Peter and Paul. They find Fred reacting somewhat awkwardly. Fred and Paul come over to help put the boat into the lake. After they leave, George and Georgie stay outside by the lake, tending to their boat. Georgie asks his father why Fred was behaving so strangely.  While Ann is in the kitchen cooking, Peter visits to borrow some eggs. Ann gives him the eggs but Peter drops them. Feeling a little annoyed, Ann gives him another four eggs and Peter takes off. Soon afterwards she hears Lucky barking and Peter and Paul show up together. Paul asks her to try out one of the clubs outside and she begrudgingly approves. In the boat, George and Georgie hear Lucky barking hysterically when suddenly the barking stops. Peter and Paul request more eggs, as the last ones also ended up broken. Ann becomes frustrated, but when George tries to force the men to leave, Peter breaks George's leg with the golf club. The two young men then take the family hostage.  Paul guides Ann on a hunt to find the family's dog, which he has killed with George's golf club. When their neighbors, the Thompsons, visit, Ann passes the two men off as friends. They return to the house, and the Farbers are forced to participate in a number of [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] games in order to stay alive.  Paul asks if George or Ann wants to bet that they will be alive by 9:00 in the morning, and says that he and Peter are betting they will not be. Between playing their games, the two men keep up a constant [[patter]]. Paul frequently ridicules Peter's weight and lack of intelligence. He describes a number of contradicting stories of Peter's past, although no definitive explanation is ever presented as to the men's origins or motives.  During the "games", Peter and Paul put Georgie's head in a bag, nearly suffocating him until George asks Ann to follow their instruction to expose her breast to the intruders. When released from the bag, Georgie tries to escape under the help of his parents. He goes to the neighbors' empty house, where he discovers their corpses. Paul goes out searching for Georgie after subduing Ann with tape, leaving Peter to guard her and George. Ann begs him to let them go, but Peter refuses. When found, Georgie attempts to shoot Paul with a shotgun, but the gun fails to go off. Paul returns him to the living room, along with the shotgun.  The men play a new game, saying whoever gets counted out will be shot. Georgie panics and runs, which results in Peter shooting and killing him. George and Ann are grief-stricken, but they eventually resolve to survive. Ann is able to free herself and flee the house while George, with a broken leg, desperately tries to make a call on the malfunctioning phone. Ann fails to find help, only to be re-captured by Peter and Paul, who bring her back to the house. After stabbing George, they tell Ann to make a choice for her husband; a painful and prolonged death with the knife, or a quick death with the shotgun.  Ann seizes the shotgun on the table in front of her and kills Peter. An enraged Paul grabs the shotgun and starts looking for the television remote. Upon finding it, he rewinds the last occurrences back to a moment before Ann grabs the shotgun, thereby breaking the [[fourth wall]]. On the "do over", Paul snatches the shotgun away and admonishes her, saying she is not allowed to break the rules.  Peter and Paul kill George and take Ann, bound and gagged, out onto the family's boat. Ann tries to free herself, but is caught by Paul and Peter. Around eight o'clock in the morning, they nonchalantly throw her into the water to drown, thus winning their bet. They knock on the door of the Thompsons' house and request some eggs. The film ends with Paul glancing at the camera with a smirk.  
Futurama: Bender's Big Score
  Two years after Box Network executives canceled Planet Express' contract, the executives are fired and Planet Express is back "on the air." As the crew celebrates, [[Hermes Conrad|Hermes]] is [[decapitation|decapitated]], causing his wife [[List of Futurama characters#LaBarbara Conrad|LaBarbara]] to leave him. His head is placed in a jar while his body is repaired. Lars, the man who performs the procedure, flirts with [[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]], much to [[Philip J. Fry|Fry]]'s chagrin.  During a delivery to a [[nude beach]] planet, Leela discovers a [[tattoo]] of [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] on Fry's buttocks. A trio of alien scammers (Nudar, Fleb and Schlump) dupe the crew into providing their personal information and infect Bender with an obedience virus, allowing them to seize control of Planet Express. The scammers then discover that Fry's tattoo has a code that allows time travel, but only into the past. [[Nibbler (Futurama)|Nibbler]] tries to warn the scammers against using the code, but is ignored.  [[File:Benderbigscoreships.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bender destroys [[New York City|New York]] while being pursued by Swedish authorities in 2308, one of the many moments of continuity with previous episodes.]] The scammers have Bender use the code to steal valuable objects from Earth's past, storing them in a cave beneath the ship. Hermes also has Bender retrieve an earlier version of his body so he can win back his wife. Meanwhile, Leela and Lars date, further depressing Fry.  Once the scammers have history's treasures, they decide to get rid of the time code by killing Fry. Fry uses the code to escape to January 1, 2000, just after he was frozen. The scammers send Bender after him. Bender arrives before Fry, creating a duplicate of himself when he has to use the bathroom. Another Bender from "way at the end" then appears, opens Fry's cryogenic tube and puts the tattoo on his butt. When Fry arrives, the first duplicate of Bender inadvertently initiates a self-destruct sequence as a result of not going to the bathroom. Fry shoves that Bender into another tube, then escapes. The original Bender spends the next twelve years hunting Fry, finally catching up to him and seemingly killing him by blowing up his apartment.  Bender reports his success to the scammers, who then erase the time code and the virus. The crew holds a memorial for Fry, but he suddenly shows up. Fry says he created a duplicate of himself, which remained in the past while he accidentally fell into his own cryo-tube. When Fry (plus the Fry that was originally frozen) awoke 1,000 years later, the present Fry froze himself until the current year. Meanwhile, the Fry in 2000 spent the years before Bender's attack working at Panucci's Pizzeria, then at an [[aquarium]] caring for Leelu, an orphaned [[narwhal]]. He also hung out with his family and tended to his beloved dog Seymour Asses.  [[File:BendersBigScoreLeelaLars.png|thumb|right|200px|Lars and Leela getting married.]] Nibbler removes the tattoo from Fry to keep the scammers from further abusing it. Leela and Lars decide to marry, but during the wedding Hermes is again decapitated. [[List of Futurama characters#Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] says that Hermes' body would have died anyway since time paradox duplicates are doomed to die prematurely. Hearing this, Lars panics and breaks up with Leela, cancelling the wedding.  The scammers then trick [[Richard Nixon (Futurama)|Earth President Richard Nixon]] into giving Earth to them. Exiled to Neptune, the population assembles a fleet with the aid of Robot Santa, Kwanzaabot and the Hanukah Zombie. Hermes has his bureaucratic brain wired into the ship's battle computer, allowing him to destroy the scammers' fleet and win back his wife. Meanwhile, Leela uses a [[doomsday device]] that Bender had originally stolen for the scammers (then stolen back for himself) to destroy the scammers' ship.  Unable to console a heartbroken Leela, Fry arranges for her to meet with Lars at the cryogenic lab. Having survived the doomsday blast, Nudar ambushes them. Lars tricks Nudar into approaching the Bender duplicate on auto-destruct and holds him against the duplicate, who explodes, killing the three of them. The explosion singes off some of Lars' clothing, revealing the Bender tattoo.  During Lars' funeral, the Planet Express crew learn from Lars' video will that he was actually the time-paradox duplicate of Fry, who had survived Bender's attack in 2012; the fire and smoke changed his appearance and voice. The duplicate Fry froze himself to return to the future and be with Leela. However, when he learned that time travel paradoxes were doomed, he canceled the wedding to spare Leela the pain of his inevitable death. Leela forgives “Lars” and reconciles with Fry.  Bender removes Lars' tattoo and travels to 2000 to place it on Fry in the cryogenic tube so that the events that transpired "make any sense at all". Upon returning, Bender emerges with all the duplicates from his stealing sprees. Terrified of the paradoxical consequences, Nibbler urges everyone to evacuate the universe before [[Ouroboros|swallowing himself]]. The Bender duplicates explode and cause a tear in the fabric of space, leading to the events of [[Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs|the next film]].

Fujoshi Rumi
 The series is a comedic romance between two high-school [[fujoshi]] and the boys who fall in love with them; much of the humor comes from parodies of stereotypical fujoshi behavior and other [[otaku]] topics, and a large number of pop culture references.  
Fujian Blue
 ''Fujian Blue'' takes place in the southeastern coastal province of [[Fujian]] (located across the straits from [[Taiwan]]). The film follows several characters in two separate but linked tales in the aftermath of the Communist government's decision to open the province up to the outside world in the 1980s.  The first tale, entitled "The Neon Knights" follows the youth '''Amerika''' ([[Zhu Xiaoping]]) who lives in [[Fuqing]]. Amerika works for Roppongi ([[Zhuang Jiangjie]]), who operates a [[blackmail]]ing ring that targets lonely housewives who have committed adultery while their husbands are away. Unbeknownst to Amerika, Amerika's mother ([[Wang Ruiyin]]) is also involved in crime, as an agent for the [[Human trafficking|smuggler]] Czech ([[Gao Qing]]). Upset that his mother will not pay for his college education, Amerika makes her his next blackmailing target, but his plan goes awry and he is forced to seek refuge on [[Pingtan Island]].  The second tale, entitled "At Home at Sea" takes place on that same island and follows another youth in Roppongi's gang named '''Dragon''' ([[Luo Jin]]). Dragon, too, has fled to Pingtan after stabbing a man earlier. He had turned to crime in order to pay for the loans taken out to have his brother illegally smuggled out of the country. With nowhere to turn, Amerika gives Dragon some money, and he must decide whether to use it to emigrate himself, or to help his family.  
The Game Plan (film)
 In the last game of the American Football Federation regular season between the Boston Rebels and the New York Dukes, Rebels [[quarterback]] Joe Kingman ([[Dwayne Johnson]]) scores a touchdown after ignoring an open wide receiver, Travis Sanders. The next morning, an 8-year-old girl named Peyton Kelly arrives on Joe's doorstep saying that she is his biological daughter, and that his divorced wife sent her there to meet him. His agent, Stella Peck, thinks this will be bad for his image and distracts him with the upcoming playoffs.  At the opening of his own restaurant, Joe inadvertently leaves without Peyton, and is on the cover of a tabloid the next day. Stella decides Joe needs a new fatherly image. At a later press conference, the reporters make Joe miserable, until Peyton comes to his defense, saying that he is new to this and trying the best he can, and that she thinks he is the best father in the world. Peyton then says that Joe has to repay her, so she has him take her to a ballet academy run by Monique Vasquez. Monique has Joe join their ballet performance to show him that ballet takes just as much athletic ability as football. Joe and Peyton begin their relationship after Peyton calls his arrogant and selfish behavior to his attention. Joe takes Peyton and her new friends to the mall where he begins to develop romantic feelings for Monique.  The Rebels march through the playoffs via three road games: Denver in the Wild Card round, Indianapolis in the Divisional round and finally Baltimore in the Conference round. They eventually make it to the championship game held in Arizona in a rematch with the New York Dukes. Stella offers Joe a $25 million endorsement deal with Fanny's Burgers, a successful fast food restaurant run by Samuel Blake, Jr., if he wins the game and mentions the product to the press. While at lunch with Joe and Monique, Peyton accidentally reveals that her mother does not know that she is with him. She was supposed to go to a ballet school program for the month, but instead she ran away to be with Joe. Peyton then has an allergic reaction to the nuts in the dessert she was eating, and Joe rushes her to the hospital; however, the doctors tell him that the reaction is mild, and his daughter is going to be fine. Joe's former sister-in-law and Peyton's legal guardian, Karen Kelly, arrives to take her home. Joe discovers that Sara, his ex-wife and Peyton's mother, was killed in a traffic collision six months earlier, and that Peyton sneaked away on her own. After Peyton overhears Stella explaining that she would be a distraction to Joe, Karen and Peyton return home. Later, while going through Peyton's bag under her bed, Joe finds some photos and reads a letter from Sara, saying that she hid Peyton away from Joe, not wanting Peyton to be a distraction to him. As the championship game begins, Joe's mind is not fully set on the game and he is soon injured.  Joe is surprised to discover that Peyton has arrived with Karen. Understanding Joe's earlier words about how he wants to remain in Peyton's life, Karen decides to let Peyton live with Joe. Near the end of the fourth quarter, Joe passes the ball to the running back, Jamal Webber, who gains positive yardage but fails to get out of bounds. Joe hurries his team to the line with the clock running, and rushes ahead before being knocked out of bounds.  With time for one last play, Joe throws a lob pass to Sanders, who catches the pass, allowing the Rebels to win their first championship. In a post-game interview, Joe declines the Fanny's Burgers offer to be with Peyton.  
Gandhi, My Father
 ''Gandhi My Father'' paints the picture of Gandhi's intricate, complex and strained relationship with his son Harilal Gandhi. From the onset, the two had dreams in opposite directions. Harilal's ambition was to study abroad and become a barrister like his father, while Gandhi hoped that his son would join him and fight for his ideals and causes in India.  When Gandhi does not give Harilal the opportunity to study abroad, it comes as a blow to Harilal. He decides to abandon his father’s vision and leaves South Africa for India where he joins his wife Gulab ([[Bhumika Chawla]]) and children. He goes back to further his education to earn his diploma but continuously fails and ends in financial ruins. Various plans and schemes decided by him to make money fail, leaving the family in poverty. Sick of his failure, Gulab returns to her parent’s house with the children, where she eventually dies from the flu epidemic. Distraught, Harilal turns to alcohol for solace and converts to [[Islam]], only to re-convert to a different sect of [[Hinduism]] later on. With political tension heating up, the rift between Gandhi and his eldest son grows until it is beyond repair. Harilal finds it unbearable to live in the enormous shadow of his father. Gandhi is assassinated before the two can reconcile and Harilal attends his father's funeral virtually as a stranger, almost unrecognizable to those around him. A short while later, he passes away, alone and in poverty, having failed to find his own identity.  
Gabriel (2007 film)
 Since the beginning of time, [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]] have fought over [[Purgatory]] and the souls trapped inside it. Each side has sent seven warriors: [[archangel]]s (Arcs) from Heaven, [[fallen angel]]s (Fallen) from Hell. They must assume [[human]] form to enter purgatory. Hell has attained control, transforming purgatory into a dark, seedy city. The last of the seven archangels, [[Gabriel]] (Andy Whitfield), endeavors to discover what has become of his comrades and to restore the Light.  Upon Gabriel entering purgatory, four of the seven Fallen—[[Samael|Sammael]] (Dwaine Stevenson), [[Asmodai|Asmodeus]] (Michael Piccirilli), [[Balam (demon)|Balan]] (Brendan Clearkin), and [[Belial|Baliel]]—gather, and Sammael kills an insubordinate Baliel, so reducing the Fallen's number from seven to six. Meanwhile, Gabriel visits the [[Michael (archangel)|archangel Michael's]] apartment, finding it abandoned. He finds a note from Michael in the apartment, saying how hard it is to stay pure in purgatory. While walking through the city, Gabriel receives a vision about the whereabouts of his comrade [[Uriel]] (Harry Pavlidis). However, the leader of the Fallen, Sammael, senses Gabriel's presence and sends the Fallen [[Moloch|Molloch]] (Goran D. Kleut) to kill him. Gabriel fights and kills Molloch, then proceeds to the city's outskirts. He finds a dishevelled and alcoholic Uriel hiding in a rundown bus. He explains that the Archangels all assumed human form and became subject to human desires and feelings which weakened them. Cut off from their power, the Archangels were eventually worn down and fell prey to the Fallen who thrived and became stronger the longer they stayed in purgatory. He reveals to Gabriel that this is what eventually led to the downfall of the Arcs sent before him. Uriel warns Gabriel that if they die in purgatory, their own souls will die too, they completely vanish. To encourage and remind Uriel of his identity, Gabriel mortally wounds Uriel, convincing Uriel to [[healing|heal]] himself. Though surely aware of Gabriel's presence, Sammael commands the Fallen to wait before taking any action against Gabriel, even though they could defeat Gabriel; Sammael threatens the Fallen if they do anything to Gabriel. Uriel then explains to Gabriel that the Fallen can sense Archangels when they use their powers, and teaches Gabriel to conceal his bright blue angel eyes. Uriel also explains that due to the nature of the evil and darkness that controls purgatory that Gabriel will be cut off from the "source". He also reluctantly tells Gabriel what happened to some of the other five Archangels: [[Ramiel|Remiel]] was killed before Uriel arrived; the whereabouts of [[Ithuriel]] (Matt Hylton Todd), [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] (Jack Campbell), and Michael are uncertain, but Raphael is most likely hiding in the East Side of the city and it is thought that Sammael has killed Michael; and Amitiel (Samantha Noble), who now calls herself Jade, was defeated by Sammael, stripped of her wings, and forced to work as a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. Hearing this, Gabriel goes off into the city to search for Amitiel.  Gabriel travels back to the city, and finds the [[brothel]] where Amitiel works. He also encounters Asmodeus, the Fallen who runs the brothel. Gabriel rescues Amitiel and kills the Fallen Balan who tries to rape her. He then heals her of the drugs she has been taking to dull the pain of her job. As Gabriel's use of power makes his presence known in purgatory, the Fallen grow weary and impatient of waiting. Amitiel takes Gabriel to the [[soup kitchen]] where the Archangel Ithuriel hides. Initially angry at Ithuriel for abandoning his mission of seeking out and destroying the Fallen, Gabriel eventually shows him compassion and understanding. Ithuriel takes Gabriel to the abandoned tunnels beneath the soup kitchen where the gravely wounded Raphael dwells. Gabriel heals Raphael, expending much of his strength. After rebuking Gabriel, Raphael explains that Sammael draws his immense power from the other Fallen. Gabriel proposes to take out the remaining Fallen one by one, before finally facing Sammael. Raphael is unconvinced, as Sammael has already killed the stronger angel Michael.  Gabriel fights and kills the Fallen [[Angra Mainyu|Ahriman]] (Kevin Copeland), then returns to Michael's apartment where he sketches a picture of Amitiel. At the same time Gabriel begins his campaign against the Fallen, the Fallen [[Lilith]] ([[Erika Heynatz]]) kills Uriel, Asmodeus kills Ithuriel, and Sammael kills Raphael. Driven mad by anger, Gabriel's eyes turn bright brown, the colour of the Fallen. He returns to the brothel seeking revenge against Asmodeus, randomly killing anyone he finds behind a hotel room door. He eventually finds Asmodeus and discovers that he's using his nigh unconscious female sex slave, whom of which he's been consistently and forcibly giving plastic surgery to in an effort to make her facially identical to himself so as to satisfy his [[narcissism]], as a hostage. Asmodeus takes Gabriel's shock and sympathy toward the girl to his advantage, discards her and begins assaulting Gabriel. Gabriel gains the advantage in the fight, viciously scars Asmodeus thus enraging him and then kills him. Gabriel halts his own imminent fall when he heals and restores the young woman held captive by Asmodeus to return her to her original appearance and depleting the anesthetics given to her. Shocked by his near fall, Gabriel returns to Amitiel. Amitiel comforts Gabriel and they strip naked before copulating. Gabriel then travels to a nightclub and kills Lilith, injecting her with several full vials of Ahriman's drugs. Gabriel chases Sammael to the nightclub's rooftop.  Sammael refuses to fight Gabriel, instead asking him to listen to what he has to say. He explains how he despises being an angel, a being created entirely to serve others. He sees purgatory as a chance to take control of his own destiny and lets Gabriel know that it was him all along keeping Gabriel protected and alive in a city amongst all the Fallen, and asks Gabriel to join him. Refusing his offer, Gabriel unwittingly realises that "Sammael" is actually the Archangel Michael, his closest friend (who had actually killed the real Sammael and assumed his identity). The two Archangels fight, but because Gabriel has used up so much of his strength helping the other Archangels, Michael has the advantage. Michael ultimately impales Gabriel's chest with a metal pipe. Gabriel admits that during his time as a human he has felt rage and anger, but he has also experienced things that Michael hasn't. An impaled Gabriel embraces Michael, which drives the metal pipe through Michael's chest also, and tells Michael that he forgives him. Both Archangels collapse. Michael uses the last of his strength to heal Gabriel's wound, then dies. Light returns to purgatory.  Kneeling in front of Michael's dead body, Gabriel shouts up at [[God]] asking "Is It This That You Wanted?, Is It This You Wanted?". The healed Gabriel moves to the edge of the rooftop, and muses that he needs to understand why all this happened. He outstretches his arms, and lets himself fall. His final words are, "Forgive me... I hope I see you again ..." A [[post-credits scene]] shows Gabriel, (wearing different clothing, minus angel wing tattoo and with brown eyes), joining Amitiel and smiling. (The DVD version of the film does not contain the post-credit scene.)

Garfield Gets Real
 [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] (Frank Welker) lives with canine [[Odie]] (Gregg Berger) and [[Jon Arbuckle|Jon]] (Wally Wingert) in a what appears to be a suburban town inhabited by cartoon characters (known as [[Comic Strip]] World). Garfield and the gang work at [[Comic]] studios with other comic characters. The comic strip is made in Comic Strip world, and sent to "[[Muncie, Indiana|The Real World]]" where it is made in the newspaper.  Garfield is tired of the same old jokes his friends crack and is bored with life in Comic Strip World and longs to go to The Real World. The Comic Strip requires a bone for Odie, but Odie does not want to give back the bone, and looks for a place to hide it. But he accidentally makes the bone go through the screen in the studio and it is sucked into the Real World.  Eli explains to the comic characters that the screen separates Comic Strip World and The Real World, with no way back. Garfield sees his chance and goes through the screen without anyone noticing. Later on, the comic characters realize Garfield is in the real world, and Eli blocks the patch in the screen that separates the real world by taping special tape on it, so no one can gain access to the real world (Odie jumps onto the screen trying to get his bone which is on the screen but actually is in the real world, and gets sucked into the real world as well.).  Garfield tries to throw Odie back to Comic Strip World, but fails. Odie gets his bone back and he and Garfield go find some dinner. Garfield meets a cat named Shecky, and as they chat, Odie is chased by a gang of Chihuahuas who want his bone. To save Odie, Garfield grabs the bone and runs through a hole in a tree which is too small for the Chihuahua's fat owner (who was walking the gang of [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]]s) to get through.  Shecky gets dinner by annoying the people who live in a building and the people start throwing food at Shecky. After dinner, Shecky brings Garfield and Odie to their new home, an abandoned hotel called Hotel Muncie. The next day, Garfield realizes that his comic will be cancelled unless Garfield returns to the comic. Garfield finds an article in the newspaper asking people to try out and replace Garfield. Garfield and Odie head for the place where they are doing try-outs and try to impress the judges, but fail, and the judges are more impressed in Hale and Hardy, a muscular cat and equally muscular dog. The judges give Garfield one more chance: If Garfield does not make it back to the paper in 24 hours, Hale and Hardy will replace them. Garfield has an idea of building a big tunnel that can go through the screen and shares the idea with his friends back in comic strip world. Later that night, Hale and Hardy tie Garfield, Odie and Shecky up and set the hotel on fire. Billy Bear, Wally and Jon go save the three friends, but the entire hotel is on fire and all the exits are blocked. Luckily, Shecky finds a fire proof trash cart, and Jon, Wally, Odie, Garfield and Shecky jump in and Billy Bear is about to push the cart when Odie realizes his bone is missing and finds the bone lying on a chandelier and Odie jumps onto the chandelier. Garfield grabs Odie's paw on the second floor, and tries to pull him onto the cart, but Odie pulls Garfield onto the chandelier instead. Just then, the chandelier is almost going to collapse. Garfield grabs Jon's hand and the entire cart is flung into the air, and the chandelier collapses, causing the cart to fall to the ground with chandelier on it. The cart crashes out of the hotel, and the six are flung into the big tunnel (Wally built it, he calls it the "Bonitanator" because the nose of the contraption reminds him of his wife, Bonita's unusually large and point nose) and the door of the tunnel closes and the tunnel disappears and is transported back to Comic Strip World. The comic characters celebrate the return of Garfield at the end of the film.  
Gardener of Eden

Adam's life changes dramatically when he accidentally captures a [[serial rapist]] named Richard Pope (David Bortolucci) who has just attacked a local girl, Mona Hukley (Christensen). The new-found attention inspires him to become a vigilante.  
Garage (film)
 Josie (Pat Shortt) is a good-natured man with learning difficulties who lives and works at a garage in a small rural Irish village. The owner, Mr Gallagher, is a former schoolmate who is not interested in the garage and is only waiting for the right offer from developers so he can sell. For Josie, one day rolls into another with nothing but his menial job and a few pints in the local pub, even though the regulars mock him and his ways. Kind-hearted Josie's only other companion is a large horse that is tethered alone in a field. He talks to the animal and brings it food.  One day his boss hires his girlfriend's 15-year-old son, David (Conor Ryan) to help Josie. Slowly Josie connects with David as they endure the slow and menial pace of the garage. One night after work, Josie innocently shares some beers with David. They sit and watch the sunset at the rear of the garage. Josie joins David and other local teenagers down by the railway tracks and brings beer for all of them. The new social aspects to his life lifts his confidence. At the local pub, he gets the courage to dance with Carmel, the local shopkeeper. But she shows her cynicism for Josie by explicitly telling him she feels no physical attraction towards him.  The friendship between Josie and David progresses nicely until one fateful day after work. Josie shows David a pornographic film which Josie received from a trucker who frequents the petrol station. David feels uncomfortable and leaves. Josie, sensing something is wrong, follows him outside but is unable to clarify the situation.  David returns the following week but does not stay after work.  Instead, he leaves with Declan, a local boy who openly mocks and despises Josie because he is different. Nevertheless, Josie offers Declan a beer and cheerful goodbye. The next day, the local Garda come to the garage and take Josie to the police station because there has been "a complaint". It transpires that David told Declan about the previous weekend's incident and word reached David's mother that Josie had supplied her son with alcohol and shown him pornography. After an interview with a sympathetic officer, Josie explains it was just a bit of "craic" and "pure innocent". No charges are brought and he is released. But he is told to stay away from the town and especially to avoid contact with David. Josie returns to the garage. While eating dinner, he suddenly realises what has happened. Shocked, he puts his head in hands all alone in his little room at the back of the garage.  The next day Mr Gallagher comes to the garage. Although not explicitly stated, Josie is told that he or the garage are finished. Unable to sleep that night, Josie gets dressed and sits on the edge of his bed. He then goes down to the river at dawn and sits for a while on the bank. Josie then takes off his well-polished shoes and socks before neatly placing his garage cap on them. He then wades slowly into the water arms outstretched.  In the final scene, the lonely horse which was tethered in a field, has been cut free. It stops and looks directly into the camera as the screen fades to black.

The Garden of Sinners: Overlooking View
 In September 1998, a series of deaths, involving several [[High school (upper secondary)|high school]] girls, leave a baffled and devastated nation.

The Garden of Sinners: A Study in Murder – Part 1
 Mikiya first meets Shiki in a white kimono during a snowy day. Later on, at the high school freshmen ceremony, Mikiya sees Shiki in the crowd and chases after her, introducing himself to her. At night, Shiki stumbles onto a fresh corpse of someone killed in a traffic accident, the blood still flowing. Kneeling, she applies the blood on her lips as lipstick and smiles.  At school the next day, Mikiya discusses Shiki's choice of dress, a kimono, stating that it must be cold. Shiki replies that she will simply wear something over it when it gets colder, and Mikiya suggests a jacket. Shiki later on takes Mikiya's suggestion and buys her trademark red leather jacket. At night, a man stumbles as he runs in fear from an unseen attacker, who kills him brutally with a knife. The next day, Mikiya tells Shiki about the murder, saying he has an inside source as the murder is not on the news yet but Shiki is displeased that Mikiya is talking about something like that during lunch.  The police discover the fourth corpse, and the school reacts to the news by prohibiting all after school activities. Shiki is one of the few people left in the school by this time, but bumps into someone she does not know, who reprimands her by asking her if four times isn't too much, even if she is irritated. Shiki refuses to reply.  It is raining outside, and as Shiki waits at the entrance, Mikiya comes up behind her and offers her an umbrella. Startled, Shiki refuses, saying she has someone coming to pick her up. The two wait there in silence, until Shiki can no longer stand it and suddenly asks Mikiya where he was the whole time, and he replies saying that he was holding a farewell party for an upperclassman, Rio Shirazumi, that was dropping out of school because he found something to do. Mikiya invited Shiki as well, but Shiki did not think he was serious. At night, Shiki finds the fifth corpse, but simply remarks "the fifth one" unemotionally.  Shiki has a duel with her father, using real katanas, but loses. Her servant, Akitaka, remarks that Shiki is the real successor of the family, over her brother, an unusual move as the male is the successor in traditional Japanese families. This is because only Shiki inherited the special multiple personality of the Ryogi family who, in her case, is male, and Shiki wraps herself in bandages to hide her femininity. During lunch break, Mikiya's friend from the judo club, Gakuto, quizzes him about the rumor that he is going out with Shiki. He admits that he does like her, but they are only friends. Later on, Mikiya finds a letter in his desk from Shiki asking him out on a date. Shiki shows up, but talks and behaves in a boyish manner, leaving Mikiya confused. Over a meal, SHIKI, the male personality, writes out two different spellings, Shiki (式) and SHIKI (織), and explains that he is the rebellious impulse of Shiki, but lately they have been out of sync; whatever Shiki likes, SHIKI does not, and vice versa.  Mikiya has dinner with his cousin, Daisuke, who is a detective and is investigating the recent murders. He reveals that they have obtained a recent clue - Mikiya's school emblem was found at the latest murder scene. After school, SHIKI has a frank talk with Mikiya, warning him that Shiki will try to kill anything that opens up her isolation with the world. The next day, Mikiya still offers to eat lunch with Shiki, leaving her perplexed. At lunch, Mikiya notices a bandaged injury on Shiki's left arm, who admits that she got it during the last killing. Mikiya doesn't believe her, but Shiki warns him again that if he doesn't back off, she will probably end up killing him.  Mikiya once again has Daisuke over for dinner, who reveals that they found the killer's skin underneath the victim's fingernails, and that the killer probably has an injury around the elbow, the location that Shiki had bandaged. Panicking, Mikiya dashes out to Shiki's mansion in the bamboo grove, but Shiki is apparently not in. While walking around in the grove, Mikiya finds Shiki, drenched in blood in front of a fresh headless corpse spurting blood. As the blood splatters onto Shiki standing there in a trance, Shiki turns and smiles at Mikiya. Walking up to the terrified Mikiya, Shiki smiles and says "Be careful Kokuto-kun. A terrible premonition tends to attract a terrible reality."  After the cops find the crime scene, Mikiya pretends to not have seen anybody, but secretly goes back to keep watch on Shiki's house every night, and is easily spotted by Akitaka as he does not do a very good job of keeping hidden. This keeps up until Shiki loses her patience and has another talk with Mikiya, who still refuses to believe she is the killer, and she then asks him if he will be coming tonight. That night, Mikiya is still keeping watch, when Shiki in a blood red kimono shows up in the rain, and chases him while slashing wildly with her knife. Shiki chases Mikiya to the road just outside the bamboo grove, where Mikiya falls and Shiki straddles him, holding a knife to his throat. Tears streaming down her cheeks, Shiki asks Kokuto to say something, who can only reply with "I don't want to die". Shiki smiles warmly and replies that she wants to kill him. Screeching tires are heard, and the scene switches to June 1998, where Mikiya has started working for Touko, and visits the comatose Shiki in the hospital with flowers, stating that he has always believed in her.<ref name="The Anime Review"></ref>

Matriarch Georgia lives her life by a number of unbreakable rules—God comes first, and hard work comes a very close second—and she wants that whoever shares her home to do the same. Now saddled with raising the young woman, it requires each patient breath she takes to understand Rachel's fury.  Georgia arranges a job for Rachel as the office girl of Dr. Simon Ward, the local veterinarian, who also unofficially treats people. His two nephews, Sam and Ethan, are often at Georgia's house. Simon does not show interest in Rachel or other women; so, she thinks he is gay. However, Simon's sister Paula reveals that he is still mourning the death of his wife and son who were killed in a car collision three years earlier. He refuses to have sex with Rachel even when she tries to seduce him, but retains some feelings for her mother Lily, whom he has dated in the past.  Rachel performs oral sex on Harlan Wilson, who was not yet married and still a virgin because of his [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS (Mormon) religion]]. He confesses to his LDS girlfriend who is shocked. A team of LDS girls spy on Harlan to make sure he does not have sex again. After almost running them over with Harlan's truck, Rachel explains to them that what happened was over and that they can go back to having their summer fun. They agree to do so, but they tell Rachel to go home leading Rachel to threaten them by saying if they have anything to do with her and Harlan again, she will find all of their boyfriends and "fuck them stupid", and that is the point when they stop insulting her and end their spying on Harlan.  While trying to make a point to Simon about survival, Rachel bluntly says that her stepfather, Arnold, sexually molested her from the time she was 12 until she turned 14. Seeing the effect of her revelation, Rachel tries to convince him she lied. However, Simon tells Georgia about the abuse, and Georgia tells Lily who thinks Rachel is lying. Heartbroken, Lily comes to believe her daughter, and begins to drink heavily and asks Arnold for a divorce.  When Arnold arrives, Georgia tells him to leave, and refuses to let him in the house. Finally, she forces him to leave by hitting him with a baseball bat; when he still refuses to leave the property, she threatens to vandalize his new red Ferrari. Rachel sees that Lily cannot accept the truth, and lies to her about being molested.  At the motel where Arnold is staying Rachel tells him that she has a video tape of them having sex when she was 14, and Arnold seems worried. Rachel demands $10 million if he does not keep Lily happy. She admits to him that she told Lily lies because she does not want her to be upset anymore. On the way back to San Francisco, Arnold tells Lily that he is giving Rachel his Ferrari, and Lily realizes that he is guilty.  Lily starts a raging argument/attack and Arnold finally admits to having molested Rachel numerous times, using the excuse that Rachel seduced him, Lily's alcoholism drove him to it and that Rachel enjoyed it. So, Arnold drives off and leaves Lily to walk home. Georgia, Simon, Rachel and Harlan catch up with Lily in Harlan's pick-up truck, and a tearful Rachel apologizes for her behavior. Harlan tells Georgia that he is in love with Rachel and plans to marry her when he returns from his two-year mission.

Ghost Rider (film)
  Over one hundred years ago, the devil  [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephistopheles]] sent his [[bounty hunter]] of the damned, the [[Ghost Rider]], to retrieve a document known as the contract of San Venganza, a list of a thousand corrupt [[soul]]s. Seeing that the contract would give Mephistopheles the power to unleash [[hell]] on [[Earth]], the rider refuses to give him the contract.  In 1986, Mephistopheles reaches out to 17-year-old stunt motorcycle rider [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]], offering to cure his father's cancer in exchange for Blaze's soul, an offer he hastily accepts. The next morning, Blaze awakes to discover that his father's cancer is cured, but he is killed that same day in a motorcycle stunt in which he falls into the ring of fire through which he jumps. Blaze accuses Mephistopheles of causing his father's death, but Mephistopheles considers their contract to be fulfilled and promises to one day see him again.  21 years later, Blaze has become a famous stunt motorcycle rider known for surviving numerous deadly crashes. Blaze meets his lifelong sweetheart [[Roxanne Simpson]], now a news reporter, whom he abandoned after his father's death. He convinces her to attend a dinner date. Meanwhile, [[Blackheart]], the demonic son of Mephistopheles, comes to Earth, along with three fallen angels who bonded with the elements air, earth, and water. They are tasked to find the lost contract of San Venganza. In response, Mephistopheles makes Blaze the new Ghost Rider and offers to return his soul if he defeats Blackheart, though he is also told he has no choice in the matter. Blaze is driven straight to the station on his first ride, where he transforms into the Ghost Rider and kills the earth angel, Gressil. He also saves a young girl from a mugger and incapacitates him with the penance stare (a power that allows the Ghost Rider to make any evil person experience all the pains they caused on their victims as long as the victims were good and not evil). The next day, he meets a man called the [[Caretaker (comics)|caretaker]], who seems to know all about the history of the Ghost Rider. He tells him everything that happened was not a dream and that it will happen again, especially at night when he is near an evil soul.  When he arrives home, Blaze finds Simpson and reveals himself as the devil's bounty hunter. Unconvinced, she walks away in disbelief. After a brief imprisonment for the murders that Blackheart committed, Blaze kills the air angel, Abigor, and escapes from the police before returning to the caretaker, who tells him of his predecessor, [[Phantom Rider|Carter Slade]], a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] who hid the contract of San Venganza. Blaze returns home to find that Blackheart has killed his friend Mack and has taken Roxanne captive, threatening to kill her if Blaze does not deliver the contract. Blaze tries to use the penance stare on Blackheart, but it does not to work as Blackheart has no soul to burn.  Blaze returns to the caretaker, who reveals himself as Carter Slade, and obtains the contract. Slade tells Blaze that he is more powerful than his predecessors since he sold his soul for love as opposed to greed. Slade leads Blaze to San Venganza, then gives Blaze a lever-action shotgun before fading away.  After killing the water angel Wallow, Blaze gives the contract to Blackheart. He quickly transforms into Ghost Rider in an effort to subdue Blackheart, but dawn arrives and he is rendered powerless. Blackheart uses the contract to [[Legion (demon)|absorb the thousand souls into his body]]. He attempts to kill Blaze, but is distracted when Simpson uses Blaze's discarded shotgun to separate them. After Blaze tries to kill Blackheart with the shotgun, he moves in and uses his penance stare to render him catatonic, burning all the corrupt souls within Blackheart, which is what he had hoped for.  Mephistopheles appears and returns Blaze his soul, offering to take back the curse of the Ghost Rider. Determined not to make another deal, Blaze declines, saying that he will use his power against him, and against all harm that comes to the innocent. Infuriated for being robbed of the power, Mephistopheles vows to make Blaze pay, but Blaze tells Mephistopheles that he is not afraid. Mephistopheles then disappears, taking Blackheart's body with him. Later, Simpson tells Blaze that he got his second chance before sharing a final kiss with him. Blaze then rides away on his motorcycle, turning into the Ghost Rider.

A Girl Cut in Two
 The film revolves around two men who vie for a single young woman, Gabrielle Deneige.  Gabrielle, a local weather woman, is in her twenties and lives with her mother, who works in a little bookstore.  Charles Saint-Denis is a famed author who has just written a new book.  Seeming to shy away from the public eye, he lives in the countryside of Lyon with his wife. At a party after a television interview about his new novel, Charles first spies young Gabrielle, then attends a book signing in the bookshop where Gabrielle's mother works.  After a little flirting, Charles gives Gabrielle a copy of his book and an invitation for her to attend an auction with him. She agrees.  The local scion of a pharmaceutical company, Paul Gaudens, enters the store and confronts Saint-Denis, then sees Gabrielle.  Paul invites her to dinner with him.  She agrees to go.  While they are at dinner, Charles meets with friends, one of whom speaks about his daughter dating a man Charles' age, and how he handles the situation.  Charles asks him about the auction on Saturday.  The scene cuts to the exterior of the restaurant, where Gabrielle thanks Paul for the meal.  He offers to take her home, but she indicates it isn't far and that she's on her scooter. Paul tells her she's "amazing, honestly." Gabrielle puts him off, telling him that she likes him, but not to pressure her. She walks to her motorbike and drives off.  Paul shows he is unhappy at not getting what he wants.  He spots a parking ticket on his car, snatches it off, and tosses it on the ground.  The audience sees more and more that Paul is a spoiled rich kid with serious issues about getting what he wants.  The following Saturday, Gabrielle attends the auction with Charles, where he bids on a love letter, then bids on and wins an illustrated manuscript written by an erotomaniac.  He presents the document to Gabrielle, commenting that if she doesn't like to read, she can look at the pictures.  The audience will later realize this is his initial effort to let her know what his interests are.  They return to Charles' flat in the city; he pours champagne, she asks him to kiss her, and they have sex.  Afterward, Gabrielle comments that she must have seemed clumsy to him.  He responds, "I'll teach you."  She observes that she probably wasn't the first he'd brought to the flat, and he answers that she could be the last.  She admires a photo on the wall, which Charles says is of Lisbon.  She asks if he'll take her there someday, then abruptly asks him the time.  She realizes she is late for work and rushes to dress.  Gabrielle asks Charles about meeting later that night, and he tells her, "Whoa, little girl," and that she's moving too fast.  He says he's not a free man, having been married for 25 years, and is 30 years older than she is.  She indicates this doesn't bother her, they quarrel, and she throws the manuscript at him and storms out.  At the TV station, after the weathercast, her boss, Phillipe, asks her to a party with him that night to meet some people.  He has her find an appropriate dress in wardrobe.  At the party, they're sitting at a table when a young man comes up to tell his boss (Phillipe) that another employee, Emilie, is drunk.  Phillipe tells the young man to leave her alone, as he's about to fire her in five minutes.  Then Phillipe turns to tell Gabrielle something, but she excuses herself. She goes over to the bar and asks for champagne, and Paul shows up.  He leads her to the dance floor where he tells her that her boss is charming.  Gabrielle realizes that Paul arranged for her to be invited to the party, and she excuses herself and leaves, starting to walk home (because she'd come to the party in Phillipe's car).  Paul and his friend (and caretaker?) Frank follow Gabrielle out, and Paul gets increasingly insistent with her until he is actually physically restraining her with a hand on her throat.  Frank drags him away from her, but Gabrielle is shaken by Paul's boorish behavior, and the viewer grows more aware of undercurrents with this character that do not bode well for the future.  The scene cuts to Charles listening to music; he calls himself an idiot.  Then we see a shot of Gabrielle's mother tucking her safely into bed like a little girl.  At the television studio, Gabrielle's colleague suggests she's in line for a job (the one formerly held by Emilie?).  Gabrielle says she'll let the producer approach her when she is called to her dressing room by a woman who says that someone's waiting there and she thinks it's important.  In her dressing room, she is greeted by Paul and a large bouquet of flowers.  He apologizes for his behavior, saying he was drunk and asking for forgiveness, which she gives.  He intimates that he can improve her work situation for her, being friends with the boss, and she tells him to stay out of her business.  Because of her independence, he guesses, then professes his love again.  She asks him where his pride is, and he says pride doesn't matter.  She admits she likes him a little, and he expresses his joy that she loves him, and she stresses "likes."  Suddenly, another bouquet of multi-colored roses arrives—this time with a card with two words:  "Come. Charles". While Paul stands there chewing on his fingers (something he does almost constantly), Gabrielle grabs her coat and runs out.  Paul picks up the card, sees the name on it, and rips it up, furious that his rival has taken Gabrielle.  When Gabrielle arrives at Charles' flat, he apologizes and they again have sex.  Time passes, during which we see Charles "initiating" his young lover into increasingly open sexual behavior, Gabrielle telling her mother about the relationship (during which her mother observes "I always knew you'd snag a father" and Gabrielle tells her about Charles' marriage, which makes it sound like the age-old situation of a married man who wants to have his cake and eat it, too), Gabrielle working in her new job as a talk show host, and Paul lunching with his mother, sisters, and Frank.  At the restaurant, where Charles is lunching with his wife and his friend Capucine, Paul causes two small scenes, first at Charles' table, and then by haranguing his mother for her failings as a mother (chewing on his fingers the whole time) until his mother asks Frank to take him away.  After the lunch scene, Gabrielle behaves in a way that suggests she is losing some of her sexual inhibitions, and Charles asks her whether she feels humiliated.  She says that she doesn't, and he tells her he loves her more than he's ever loved anyone.  But then he indicates he's feeling restless, and takes to the sex club where his friends are.  We later learn that Charles asks Gabrielle to perform sexual acts on his friends to show how liberated she is (a nod to the remark about Marquis de Sade in the beginning of the film).  Perhaps taking this step with his lovers is Charles' way of preparing to drop them, as after that Charles then leaves the country (telling Gabrielle he'll be gone four or five days, but his wife he'll be gone a month), has his wife change the locks to his flat, and ends contact with Gabrielle.  Gabrielle is crushed by these acts and stops functioning.  With her daughter stuck in a virtual catatonic state, Gabrielle's mother has an idea (after Gabrielle's uncle remarks that in "Sleeping Beauty," the rich prince whisked away the sleeping princess).  She calls Paul and invites him over.  We next see Paul and Gabrielle in Lisbon.  But Paul feels that he cannot make her forget Charles and creates a shouting scene in a bar one afternoon, then rushes out.  Gabrielle stays and drinks, then goes to Paul's. Gabrielle tells Paul that they should be just friends.  Furious, Paul begins to shout and tells Gabrielle that he never wants to see her again. Gabrielle, drunk, goes to see Paul and tells him she will marry him.  He agrees and they are soon engaged.  Paul's mother detests Gabrielle.  Charles learns of Paul and Gabrielle's engagement on the local news.  At the gown fitting, Charles talks to Gabrielle.  Gabrielle tells Charles that she loves him and she won't marry Paul if Charles leaves his wife.  Charles won't agree, and Gabrielle marries Paul.  Gabrielle obviously does not fit into the Gaudens family.  On their honeymoon, Paul, experiencing some of the sexual expertise Gabrielle has acquired, grows more and more jealous.  He knows about her night at the sex club with Charles' friends and that Charles is impotent.  Paul, disgusted, threatens Gabrielle with a small pistol. He puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger, revealing that it is not loaded.  Later, Paul and Gabrielle attend a benefit dinner at which Paul's mother is present.  Charles is there also and while he is delivering the keynote address, Paul walks on the stage and shoots Charles for "perverting my wife."  Gabrielle is called to testify against Charles and his sexual depravity. She refuses, until the third lawyer hired by the Gaudens gets her to go talk to Paul's mother.  Here we learn that Paul may have killed his older brother in the bathroom when Paul was three years old.  Gabrielle tells the truth in court.  When she goes to visit Paul, who received only seven years in prison, he denies her.  When Gabrielle goes to see Paul's mother, she tells Gabrielle that she was played and will soon receive divorce papers from Paul.  Gabrielle will also not get any money from the Gaudens.  Gabrielle seems flippant and tells Paul's mother that she is keeping the car that Paul gave her, because she needs it.  The movie ends with Gabrielle being sawed in two and reappearing in her uncle's magic show.

The Girl Next Door (2007 film)
 In 2007, David Moran ([[William Atherton]]), a [[Wall Street]] player, witnesses a [[hit and run]] by a car. He responds to the situation and tries to resuscitate the victim. That evening, he reflects on his past to the summer of 1958, when he meets his first teenage crush Meg Loughlin ([[Blythe Auffarth]]). Meg and her disabled sister Susan (Madeline Taylor) have lost their parents in a car accident and because of this, they are sent to live with their reclusive aunt, Ruth Chandler ([[Blanche Baker]]), and her sons, Willie, Ralphie, and Donny ([[Graham Patrick Martin]], [[Austin Williams]] and Benjamin Ross Kaplan).  Living next door to the Chandlers, David is aware of the charisma Ruth has, since she freely allows her sons and their neighborhood friends to her house, where she entertains them and offers them beer and cigarettes. Meanwhile, Ruth starves Meg, accuses her of being a whore and subjects her to [[misogynistic]] lectures, whilst her children listen. One day, David visits the Chandler residence, where he sees the Chandler sons tickling Meg. Ralphie inappropriately tickles Meg's breasts, prompting her to fend him off as she runs from the room. His brothers humiliate Susan and when Ralphie brings Ruth to the situation, Ruth reprimands her for forgiving Meg's actions. Ruth beats Susan's bare buttocks as the Chandler sons restrain a horrified Meg, who came back to the room to save Susan. Ruth then takes the ring that Meg wears around her neck, which belonged to her mother.   A few days later, Meg stops a policeman, Officer Jennings ([[Kevin Chamberlin]]) and reports the ongoing [[child abuse]] at the Chandler residence. As punishment, Ruth and her sons bind Meg in the basement with her hands tied to the rafters. They play a bizarre game of "[[Confession (law)|confession]]", and when Meg has nothing to confess, she is stripped naked. They blindfold her, gag her and leave her there. That night, the boys sneak back downstairs, giving her water. They agree to loosen her bindings, but only if she lets them touch her. She refuses, but David loosens them anyway, promising to free her into the woods.   Eventually, Meg is untied but is unable to eat the food Ruth gives her since she is severely [[Dehydration|dehydrated]], to the extent of choking if she did. Ruth again beats Susan's bare buttocks for Meg's disobedience. With Ruth's approval, the neighborhood children visit the Chandler residence to tie, beat, burn and cut Meg for fun. Even sticking a switchblade into her belly button. Ruth cauterizes the wounds Meg receives with cigarettes. David tries to tell his parents but is unable to do so. Soon, the Chandler sons hear Officer Jennings arriving at their house, after having had his suspicions raised after a local boy reports a girl being beaten and used as a "plaything". Before answering the door, Ruth threatens to kill Meg and David if they make a noise in the basement. Ruth and her sons then mislead Jennings and assures him that no wrongdoing has occurred. Back in the basement, David secretly loosens her bindings and tells her that it is time for her to escape. He also leaves money in the woods for Meg to run away with it. The next day, David still sees the money there, realizing that his plan had failed.   David quickly returns to the basement. There, Meg is [[Rape|raped]] by Willie, as punishment for trying to escape. David tells Ruth to stop but is harshly ignored. Donny steps forward, wanting to rape Meg as well, but Ruth does not want him to, considering it to be [[incest]] to have sex whilst his brother's "[[Semen|scum]]" is still inside Meg. Ruth instead offers Eddie or David to take a turn with her. When David declines, Ralphie requests Ruth to [[Human branding|brand]] Meg so that she'll be known as a whore. She happily agrees as she starts carving into Meg’s belly and past her belly button the words "I FUCK, FUCK ME" with a heated bobby pin. Ruth taunts Meg about how she will never have relations with a man due to the branding. However, she fears that Meg may still have feelings, especially for David, and decides to perform a [[clitorectomy]]. David tries to flee and tell somebody but the children, under Ruth's command, tie him up. Bound on the floor, David helplessly watches Ruth [[Female genital mutilation|mutilate Meg's vagina]] with a blowtorch.       The next morning, David awakes still on the basement floor. He frees himself from his bindings and finds Susan sitting with an unconscious Meg. Susan tells David that Meg did not escape the night that he secretly untied her because she was caught trying to take Susan with her. Although David's plan was to come back for Susan after Meg escaped, Susan had told Meg that Ruth had [[Child molestation|molested]] her on a regular basis to extent of making her bleed, which made Meg want to escape, along with her sister, the house as soon as possible. Susan then tearfully insists that Meg should have just gone without her and saved herself while she could, but David tells Susan everything was going to be all right.   David is afraid that Meg won't survive much longer without help, so he tries to get everyone else's attention by lighting a fire in the basement. Ruth notices the smoke from the fire and enters the basement. As she enters, David quickly bludgeons Ruth to death with Susan's crutches. Willie attacks David and vengefully attempts to stab him as Donny mourns his mother's death. Jennings and another policeman arrest Willie and Donny (and presumably Ralphie) in time. Jennings checks Ruth's pulse and questions David but after he tells him about her crimes, he leaves Ruth for dead. After Susan is taken from the basement by the authorities, David retrieves Meg's ring from Ruth's corpse and gives it to Meg as she succumbs to her wounds.   Back in 2007, the adult David reflects on how his past still haunts him to his present day, though as Meg taught him, "It's what you do last that really counts."

II'' carries on from ''Goal!'' in which [[Santiago Muñez]], who is now a successful footballer, gets transferred from Newcastle United to Real Madrid. He has a good start for Real as he substitutes former teammate Gavin Harris, who is in a bad form, in several matches. However, life later starts to get complicated when his half-brother Enrique learns that he is related to Santiago and shows him a picture of his mother, who left his father years ago and now lives in Spain. When Enrique tells him this, Santiago drives off, after which his life goes downhill, as his fame and success begins to catch up with him, and he becomes more arrogant and selfish. When he gets his first chance to start for Real Madrid, he messes up after a bad tackle on Valencia's [[Vicente Rodríguez]], leading to him getting sent off. Soon after, he gets into an argument with his girlfriend Roz Harmison, who leaves, frustrated, to return to the United Kingdom, and he rashly fires Glen Foy as his agent when he gets him an advertising deal with a sushi restaurant just because he hates sushi. Things get worse when he gets injured. Santiago also has an affair with Jordana Garcia. Enrique drives off in Santiago's [[Lamborghini]] after he has an argument with Santiago; he crashes and badly injures himself. Santiago also beats up a photographer and gets arrested, and when he calls Glen for help, he is firmly informed that he is on his own. Soon after getting released, his girlfriend finds out about Santiago's affair and dumps him, leaving him sad and depressed. Soon after, he visits his mother, who explains why she ran away from him when Santiago was a young boy.  Real Madrid reach the final of the [[UEFA Champions League]] and they are lined up against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. Santiago learns that Harris has to get a place in the starting line-up in the final in order to ensure an extension of his contract and a place in his national squad for the upcoming [[FIFA World Cup]]. He asks the coach to let Harris start instead of him in the final. Harris gets his chance, but almost squanders it by fouling Arsenal player T.J. Harper in the first half – which leads to a penalty and Real Madrid concede the first goal. The final turns into a nightmare for Real Madrid after this. The star players can hardly build any chances and Arsenal have a firm grip on the game in the first half, creating chances and threatening Madrid with attack after attack. Only a superb performance from goalkeeper [[Iker Casillas]] prevents Real Madrid from crashing out before half time.  Contrary to speculation and despite the bad form of Harris, Santiago is brought onto the field – but not as a substitute for Harris. In the second half the two former Newcastle teammates get the chance to link up at the front to bring Madrid back to life. However the game gets worse as Arsenal go 2-0 up. Arsenal are denied an even bigger lead when Casillas superbly saves another penalty. Following this save, Real Madrid get to counter-attack with Santiago finally creating a moment of magic with Harris, who scores to make it 2-1. In the final few minutes of the game, with Madrid needing a goal to stay in the game, Santiago gets his chance and makes it 2-2. Finally, with only seconds left, [[David Beckham]] scores from a free kick to win the Champions League for Real Madrid. The film ends with the [[Real Madrid CF]] players celebrating a famous win and is " to be continued ".

The Golden Compass (film)
 The story takes place in an alternate world dominated by a powerful church called the Magisterium, and where part of the spirit resides outside a person as an [[Power animal|animal companion]] called a [[Dæmon (His Dark Materials)|dæmon]]. [[Lyra Belacqua]] ([[Dakota Blue Richards]]) is an orphan raised at [[Jordan College, Oxford|Jordan College]] in [[Oxford]], while her uncle, esteemed explorer and scholar [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Lord Asriel|Lord Asriel]] ([[Daniel Craig]]), is busy seeking the elusive [[Dust (His Dark Materials)|Dust]], a cosmic particle of which the Magisterium has forbidden even the mention. When Asriel returns from his latest expedition, Lyra and her dæmon [[Pantalaimon]] ([[Freddie Highmore]]) witness a Magisterium agent poison his wine. Lyra warns her uncle, saving his life; then she watches Asriel give a presentation regarding his findings on the North Pole, where he was able to prove the Dust's existence. The college gives Asriel a grant to fund another expedition that could lead to the discovery of the infinite worlds linked by Dust, which would severely undermine the Magisterium's hold on the world.   At dinner, Lyra meets [[Marisa Coulter|Mrs. Coulter]] ([[Nicole Kidman]]), a wealthy, powerful woman who is presented as "a friend of the college". Mrs. Coulter insists on taking Lyra on a trip north as her assistant. Before Lyra leaves, the Master of the college entrusts her with the only remaining alethiometer, a compass-like artifact that reveals the truth. The Magisterium has seized or destroyed all the others. He instructs her to keep it secret, especially from Mrs. Coulter.  Mrs. Coulter takes Lyra into her home, in a big city that resembles a [[Retrofuturism|retrofuturistic]] [[London]], and starts taking her to socialite dinners and parties. In her bedroom, Lyra gazes upon the alethiometer and notices that it continuously points to a lady, a lightning bolt and a baby. She does not know what to make of her observation, however, and says nothing of it to Mrs.&nbsp;Coulter. Despite initially projecting the image of a free-spirited woman, she reveals herself to be extremely respectful of the Magisterium and its function. One night, Lyra casually mentions Dust; this puts Mrs. Coulter on edge as she warns Lyra never to mention it again, and also insists that she stop carrying around the bag secretly containing the aleithiometer. Mrs.&nbsp;Coulter's dæmon (a [[golden monkey]]) attacks Pantalaimon, causing Lyra to give in. Lyra and Pantalaimon discover that Mrs.&nbsp;Coulter is head of the General [[Oblation]] Board, also known as the "Gobblers", who have been kidnapping local children. Lyra also learns that her best friend [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Roger Parslow|Roger]] and her [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Gyptians|Gyptian]] friend Billy have been both taken by the Gobblers.  Lyra and Pantalaimon walk in on Mrs.&nbsp;Coulter's dæmon attempting to steal the alethiometer and they escape into the streets. The Gobblers pursue her, but she is saved by Billy's mother, who takes her to the ship of the King of the Gyptians, heading north to rescue all the captured children. Lyra shows the alethiometer to a wise Gyptian elder, [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Farder Coram|Farder Coram]] ([[Tom Courtenay]]), and it is revealed that she is able to decipher the device's answers.   After consulting with the Magisterium agent, Mrs.&nbsp;Coulter sends two mechanical spy-flies after Lyra. One is batted away but the other is caught and sealed in a can by Farder Coram, who explains that the spy-fly has a sting with a sleeping poison. Meanwhile, Lord Asriel has reached [[Svalbard]], the kingdom of the Ice Bears, but he is captured by [[Samoyedic peoples|Samoyed]] tribesmen hired by Mrs.&nbsp;Coulter.  One night, Lyra is visited on the ship by a witch queen, [[Serafina Pekkala]] ([[Eva Green]]). She tells Lyra that the missing children are in an experimental station called [[Locations in His Dark Materials#Bolvangar|''Bolvangar'']]. At a northern port, Lyra is befriended by a Texan [[aeronaut]] named [[Lee Scoresby]] ([[Sam Elliott]]), who advises her to hire himself and his friend [[Characters of His Dark Materials#Iorek Byrnison|Iorek Byrnison]] ([[Ian McKellen]]), an [[Races and creatures in His Dark Materials#Armoured Bears (panserbjørne)|armoured bear]] that Lee has come to rescue. Once a prince of his people, but now exiled in shame, the giant polar bear has been tricked out of his armour by the local townspeople. Using the alethiometer, Lyra tells Iorek where to find his armour. After recovering his armour, Iorek joins the Gyptian trek northward, along with Lee.  While the group is camped for the night, Lyra rides on Iorek's back to an abandoned building the alethiometer pointed her toward. There, Lyra finds an escaped, cowering Billy separated from his dæmon named Ratter and realises that is what the Gobblers are doing to the kidnapped children, something they call "[[Dæmon (His Dark Materials)#Intercision|intercision]]". Lyra reunites Billy with his mother just as the group is attacked by Samoyeds, who capture Lyra. Iorek and Lee follow her in Lee's airship. Taken to the bear king [[List of His Dark Materials characters#Iofur Raknison|Ragnar Sturlusson]] ([[Ian McShane]]), Lyra tricks him into fighting Iorek one on one. At first, Ragnar, who had already beaten Iorek while usurping his throne, seems to have the upper hand in the fight, but Iorek eventually manages to kill his rival, becoming the new and rightful king.  Iorek carries Lyra to a thin ice bridge near Bolvangar, but only Lyra is able to cross over before the bridge breaks. Upon reaching the station, Lyra is welcomed in and taken to eat dinner with the children, where she is reunited with Roger. While sneaking around, Lyra hears Mrs.&nbsp;Coulter tell the station scientists that Asriel has escaped capture and set up a laboratory, but Magisterium soldiers are on their way to arrest and execute him for heresy. She also hears the scientists talk about their experiments to sever the bond between a child and his or her dæmon. Caught spying, Lyra and Pantalaimon are thrown in the intercision chamber, and end up unconscious. On seeing Lyra in the chamber, Mrs.&nbsp;Coulter rescues her and takes her to her quarters.  When Lyra wakes up, Mrs.&nbsp;Coulter explains to Lyra how, in her and the Magisterium's view, the intercision is needed to save the children from the corrupting influence of the Dust. She also reveals she is Lyra's mother, but was forced to give her away because at the time of her birth she was not married. Lyra correctly guesses that Asriel is her father. When Mrs. Coulter asks for the alethiometer, Lyra gives her the can containing the spy-fly instead. The fly stings Mrs.&nbsp;Coulter, knocking her and her dæmon out. Lyra runs to the room with the intercision machine and manages to destroy it, setting off a series of explosions that tear the facility apart.  Outside, the fleeing children are attacked by [[Tatars|Tartar]] mercenaries and their wolf dæmons. The battle is joined by Iorek, Lee Scoresby, the Gyptians, and a band of flying witches led by Serafina Pekkala. The Tartars are defeated and the children are rescued. Rather than returning south, Lyra, Roger, Iorek, Lee and Serafina fly further north in search of Asriel. Confirming Serafina's prophecy of an upcoming war with Lyra at the centre, Lyra is determined to fight the Magisterium and stop their plans, which include taking over all the other worlds in the universe.

Gone Baby Gone
 Boston [[Private investigator|P.I.]] Patrick Kenzie and his partner/girlfriend Angie Gennaro witness a televised plea by a woman named Helene McCready for the return of her missing daughter Amanda, who was abducted with her favorite doll "Mirabelle". Patrick and Angie are then hired by the child's aunt Beatrice to find Amanda. Using his connections in the Boston crime underground, Patrick discovers that Helene and her boyfriend "Skinny Ray" were [[Mule (smuggling)|drug mules]] for a local Haitian [[drug lord]] named Cheese and had recently stolen over $130,000 from him. After tracking down Ray and discovering he has been murdered by Cheese's men, Patrick and Angie join police [[detectives]] Remy Bressant and Nick Poole in investigating the case. Patrick meets with Cheese and tries to negotiate the return of Cheese's stolen money for Amanda, but Cheese initially denies his involvement in the girl's disappearance. Police Captain Jack Doyle later reads Patrick a telephone transcript of the drug lord calling into the station to set up an exchange for Amanda. The exchange at a nearby [[Quincy Quarries Reservation|quarry]] in [[Quincy, Massachusetts|Quincy]] is botched after a gunfight breaks out, killing Cheese and his men. It is believed that Amanda fell in the quarry and drowned in the confusion; her doll is retrieved from the water and returned to Helene. Doyle, whose own daughter was killed years before, takes responsibility for the death and goes into early retirement following public outcry over the mishap.  Two months later, a seven-year-old boy is abducted in [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]] and Patrick receives information that the boy was taken by Corwin Earle, a known [[child molester]]. After entering the suspect's house and finding evidence of the abducted boy, Patrick returns with Remy and Nick late at night to rescue him. A shootout ensues with the residents and Nick is lethally wounded. Patrick enters the house and finds the boy's dead body; he then shoots the surrendering Corwin in the back of the head in a fit of rage. Trying to alleviate Patrick's guilt, Remy confides that he once planted evidence on someone with the help of "Skinny Ray" — whom he had initially told Patrick he didn't know. After Nick's funeral, Patrick speaks to a Devin, a police officer, who tells him that Remy had known about Cheese's stolen money before Cheese knew it was missing. Patrick then questions Beatrice's husband Lionel in a bar and pieces together that Lionel and Remy had conspired to stage a fake kidnapping in order to take the drug money for themselves and to teach Helene a lesson. At that point, Remy (trying to cover for his earlier mistake) enters the bar wearing a [[latex]] mask and holding a shotgun, staging a robbery to interrupt the conversation. Patrick realizes Remy plans to kill him and Lionel to keep them quiet, but the bartender shoots Remy twice in the back. Remy flees and is pursued by Patrick to the rooftop of a nearby building, where he succumbs to his wounds.  Patrick is questioned by the police about Remy's death and learns that the police never had a phone transcript like the one that Doyle had read to him prior to the botched exchange. The police dismiss his claims of Remy's corruption as conspiracy theory and Patrick does not press the issue further. Patrick and Angie drive to Doyle's home, where Patrick finds Amanda alive and well with Doyle and his wife. Doyle was part of the kidnapping all along and helped set up the fake exchange to frame Cheese and throw Patrick off the scent. Patrick threatens to call the authorities, but Doyle attempts to convince him that Amanda is better off living with them than with her neglectful mother, and that is reason enough to not get involved.  Patrick leaves and discusses the choices with Angie, who says she will leave him if he calls the police, since she also believes Amanda is much better off with the Doyles. However, Patrick believes Amanda's mother can change and she shouldn't be denied her child, and calls the police; Doyle and Lionel are arrested, Amanda is returned to her mother amidst heavy publicity, and Patrick and Angie break up.  Patrick later visits Amanda as Helene is about to leave for a date. Helene informs Patrick that Beatrice has been forbidden to visit and is upset about Lionel's arrest. Patrick volunteers to watch Amanda, who is holding her old doll and watching television. Patrick asks Amanda about Mirabelle, only to hear Amanda inform him that her doll's name is "Annabelle" — implying that Helene did not even know the name of her daughter's favorite toy. As the film ends, Patrick stares at the television with Amanda.  
GoGo Sentai Boukenger vs. Super Sentai
 The movie starts with Time Demon Chronos meeting with High Priest Gajya on getting rid of the Boukengers while obtaining three Goodomu Engines. As they plot, a mysterious figure watches above them. Afterwards, the Boukenger, excluding Bouken Silver, were summoned to battle some Curse. After their battle, they see Gajya and Chronos, with Chronos sending the Boukengers to a different dimension. Eiji was alerted of the situation, but before he could set out to rescue the other Boukengers, a mysterious figure named Aka Red, who describes himself as the embodiment of the fighting spirit of all Red Sentai Warriors, meets him and gives him the Super Sentai Address Book, which lists information on every Super Sentai member. He opens it to find Tsubasa Ozu, a.k.a. Magi Yellow from ''[[Mahou Sentai Magiranger]]''.  Eiji tries to talk to Tsubasa during his boxing match, but ends up getting ejected from the side of the ring since he was interfering with his match. Next, Tetsu, a.k.a. Deka Break from ''[[Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger]]'', is undercover trying to negotiate with Alienizers when Eiji interrupts. Eiji tries to acknowledge Tetsu's background as Deka Break, but Tetsu beats him up and sends him out the window to maintain his cover. Elsewhere, at the Duel Bond site, Chronos shows a time device, a reverse flowing hourglass, to Gajya, which when augmented to a Goodomu Engine enable him to revive one of the Three Sorcerers, past Super Sentai villains whose magic caused the greatest harm to the Earth. Chronos would set another up at the Matrix ruins with Gajya remaining to welcome the second Sorcerer while Chronos installed the final device at the countryside. In Chronos' time prison, the Boukengers find out they were blocked of their technology and they meet up with Hikaru, a.k.a. Magi Shine, also from Mahou Sentai Magiranger.  Eiji then receives a call through his GoGo Changer from Asuka, a.k.a. Abare Black from ''[[Bakuryū Sentai Abaranger]]'', all the way from Dino Earth while taking care of his daughter. He tells Eiji that Aka Red contacted him, but the connection to Earth is weak since the power of the dimension door is weak as well. Even contacting him was hard through the GoGo Changer. He loses connection to Eiji after a few minutes. While Chronos set up his time devices, Hikaru talks to the Boukengers about Chronos and the Boukengers are introduced to Smokey, although at first mistaking him as precious. Eiji then tries to meet Nanami Nono, a.k.a. Hurricane Blue from ''[[Ninpuu Sentai Hurricaneger]]'', before her rehearsal, but is blocked by security and many fans. In a desperate attempt to catch Nanami's attention, Eiji shouts out "Hurricane Blue," which Nanami is surprised by.  Chronos was then successful in summoning Meemy, from Mahou Sentai Magiranger, who meets up with Chronos. In frustration, Eiji throws out the Super Sentai Address Book and decides to battle Meemy and Chronos on his own. After Eiji is overpowered, he was rescued by Hurricane Blue, Abare Black, Deka Break and Magi Yellow. However, the various Super Sentai warriors repeatedly get in each other's way and Meemy and Chronos were able to escape.  In the time prison, Satoru reveals that he has Zubaan with him. TsueTsue from ''[[Hyakujuu Sentai Gaoranger]]'' was then revived and welcomed by Gajya.  At SGS, Eiji receives a message from Satoru concerning Chronos. The Super Sentai warriors then promised to help Eiji rescue the rest of the Boukengers and meet Aka Red while the time prison holding the Boukengers and Hikaru is slowly disappearing. Chronos and the other villains found the last hourglass tipped over, with the final Sorcerer missing, when they were attacked by the Super Sentai warriors. As the time prison started to disintegrate, Sakura analyzed and concluded that the clock with root-like designs in the wall was the key to their escape. The Boukengers and Hikaru then utilize the Magi Lamp Buster's Smoky Shining Attack, accompanied by Zubaan, on the clock in the wall. Although this does not damage the clock at all, it causes another root-like clock in the real world to appear. Aka Red orders the other warriors to destroy the clock while he takes care of the villains, transforming into Magi Red and Gao Red respectively, and frightening both Meemy and TsueTsue in the process; for both respective villains, Magi Red and Gao Red were their worst enemies. As Aka Red fights off the villains, the others succeed in freeing the Boukengers and Magi Shine from the alternate dimension.  The Super Sentai warriors and the villains face off, with the Sentai warriors getting the upper hand until Furabiijo from Ninpuu Sentai Hurricanger interferes after "taking a walk". But with all three Sorcerers present and accounted, Chronos fuses them all into the Staff of the Three Philosophers, his intended goal from the start. With the power of the staff, Chronos enabled himself to grow to gigantic proportions with new golden armor. The Boukengers countered with Ultimate DaiBouken and SirenBuilder, but Chronos proved too powerful for both the mecha and were defeated. In a last-ditch effort, the Boukengers summoned DaiVoyager, which was almost defeated by Chronos as well. Aka Red, sensing the danger, came back into the action, becoming a vessel to power up DaiVoyager using the Spirits given by the remaining Super Sentai warriors, enabling DaiVoyager to access its Burning Legend form. Burning Legend DaiVoyager went on to defeat Chronos with the special attack, 30 Super Sentai Soul (an energy attack powered by the Super Sentai warriors of the past), and sent the released sorcerers back into the afterlife. After their victory, the Boukengers and the other Super Sentai warriors return to the SGS headquarters, and then parted ways. The Boukengers, however, would not have time to relax, as they receive another call from Mr. Voice concerning another Negative Syndicate on the move. The movie ends with Aka Red watching over the Earth in outer space, going into a deep sleep until he is needed again.

In retaliation, Anisha places a [[curse]] on Chuck, so that every single [[woman]] he sleeps with will break up with him and marry the next man who asks her out.  In the present, Chuck ([[Dane Cook]]) is a successful [[dentist]] in his thirties, and runs a dental practice in the same building as his best friend Stu's ([[Dan Fogler]]) plastic surgery business. Chuck finds himself unable to tell his girlfriend, Carol ([[Chelan Simmons]]), that he loves her, and she breaks up with him while having sex on the beach. Following the break up, Stu and Chuck decide to attend the wedding of one of Chuck’s ex-girlfriends, Katie. At Katie’s wedding, Chuck becomes enamored with Cam Wexler ([[Jessica Alba]]), a clumsy, yet attractive and friendly marine biologist. Their chemistry is apparent the moment they start talking. The wedding eventually ends, and they seemingly go their separate ways. While working at a penguin habitat, Cam accidentally slips and chips her tooth. When she visits Chuck to have it fixed, he asks her to go out with him instead of paying him. Though initially reluctant, Cam agrees. Meanwhile, Stu notices the pattern of girls getting married as soon as Chuck has sex with them. Stu eventually convinces Chuck to embrace the influx of women who have learned of his pattern and visit his practice, arguing that there's nothing better than having lots of guilt-free sex. However, after having this so-called "guilt-free sex" with numerous women, Chuck decides he wants a serious relationship with Cam. However, just before he has sex with her, Stu informs him that each of the women Chuck has slept with have got married, including Carol. Worried that the same thing will happen to Cam, Chuck begins to avoid her.  Stu convinces Chuck to test the curse by having sex with an obese woman, and see if she marries afterward. Chuck asks Stu to ask the woman out to see if this results in marriage, and when it does not, Chuck concludes that the curse is fake, and has sex with Cam. Afterward, however, Chuck discovers that the woman Stu was supposed to ask out got married to another man. Chuck calls Stu, who confesses that he only pretended to ask the woman. Chuck gets mad because of Stu's treason but Stu doesn't care about the complaints. Chuck believes Cam wants to go out with Howard Blaine ([[Steve Bacic]]), who authored a book about penguins. Still convinced that Cam will hang out with him, Chuck tries desperately to get Cam's attention and asks her to marry him. His attempts, though, cause Cam to become convinced he's [[stalking]] her and she breaks up with him. After the break-up, Chuck attempts to track down Anisha in order to break the curse. Now married with a child, Anisha reveals to Chuck that they were just kids back then, and the curse wasn't meant to be real.  Now deciding to let fate take its course, Chuck puts Cam in touch with Howard, and the two seem to connect instantly. Stu convinces Chuck to chase after Cam, who is now headed to [[Antarctica]] with Howard. After Chuck finds her, Cam reveals that Howard is already married to someone else, and that she's only leaving for a week. Chuck hands Cam a ring box containing a pebble, a reference to the penguin mating ritual in which a male penguin finds a stone and brings it to the female penguin he wants to be with (therefore, [[Marriage proposal|proposing]] to her). Meanwhile, Anisha is shown pulling a pin out of a [[Haitian Vodou|voodoo]] doll, which signifies that Chuck is freed from the curse and has finally gotten the girl of his dreams. A year later, Chuck and Cam are in Antarctica together surrounded by penguins.  Later, Stu is shown with his now wife house-sitting for Chuck and Cam who are now married as well. They search for home-made sex tapes, and find a disturbing tape where Chuck is giving oral to a plush penguin while Cam is off-screen making sex sounds, implying that they might have made the tape and left it for Stu to find as a gag.

The Great Debaters
 Based on a true story, the plot revolves around the efforts of debate coach [[Melvin B. Tolson]] ([[Denzel Washington]]) at [[Wiley College]], a Historically Black College, to place his team on equal footing with whites in the American South during the 1930s, when [[Jim Crow laws]] were common and lynch mobs were a fear for blacks. The Wiley team eventually succeeds to the point where they are able to debate [[Harvard University]]. This was their 47th annual debate team.  The movie explores the social constructs in Texas during the [[Great Depression]] including not only the day-to-day insults and slights African Americans endured, but also a [[lynching]]. Also depicted is [[James Farmer|James L. Farmer, Jr.]] ([[Denzel Whitaker]]), who, at 14 years old, was on Wiley's debate team after completing high school (and who later went on to co-found C.O.R.E., the [[Congress of Racial Equality]]). According to the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', another character depicted on the team, Samantha Booke, is based on the real individual [[Henrietta Bell Wells]], the only female member of the 1930 debate team from Wiley College who participated in the first collegiate interracial debate in the United States. Wells also happened to be an African American poet whose papers are housed at the [[Library of Congress]].  The key line of dialogue, used several times, is a famous paraphrase of [[Augustine of Hippo]]: "An unjust law is no law at all."   Another major line, repeated in slightly different versions according to context, concerns doing what you "have to do" in order that we "can do" what we "want to do." In all instances, these vital lines are spoken by the James L. Farmer Sr. and James L. Farmer, Jr. characters.

They lure the bear into the shack, and use a trigger to close the front door behind it, locking it in. They celebrate and start to leave but the bear breaks out of the shack and they both try to escape.

Tracy introduces Seaweed to Penny, and the two are smitten. Later, Seaweed and his younger sister Little Inez take Tracy, Penny and Link to a party at Maybelle's store. Edna finds Tracy there and tries taking her home, but Maybelle convinces her to stay, and tells her to take pride in herself. At the party, Maybelle informs everyone that Velma has cancelled "Negro Day", and Tracy suggests that they march for integration. Link is unwilling to jeopardise his career by marching, straining his relationship with Tracy. Edna returns to her husband Wilbur's shop, but Velma gets there first, and tries to seduce him. After accusing Wilbur of [[infidelity]], Edna forbids Tracy to be on the show. She changes her mind after she and Wilbur reconcile.  The next morning, Tracy sneaks out of the house to join the protest, which is halted by a police roadblock. The protesters engage in a brawl, while Tracy runs to the Pingletons' home, and hides in a [[fallout shelter]]. However, Penny's mother Prudence reports Tracy to the police before tying her daughter to her bed. Having been bailed out by Wilbur, Seaweed and his friends help Tracy and Penny escape. Link visits Tracy’s house to look for her, and realizes that he loves her. Seaweed and Penny also acknowledge their love during the escape.  With the pageant underway, Velma places police officers around the WYZT studio to prevent Tracy from entering. She also rigs the pageant tallies to guarantee that Amber will win. Penny arrives at the pageant with Edna, while Wilbur, Seaweed, and the Negro Day kids help Tracy infiltrate the studio. Link breaks away from Amber to dance with Tracy; later, he pulls Little Inez to the stage to dance in the pageant.  Amber's attempt to re-claim her championship crown fails. Little Inez wins the pageant after a late surge of support, successfully integrating ''The Corny Collins Show''. Velma tells Amber about her rigging scheme in front of a camera planted by Edna, resulting in her firing. ''The Corny Collins Show'' set turns into a celebration as Tracy and Link kiss.  
Hallam Foe
 Hallam Foe ([[Jamie Bell]]) is a teenage loner who lives on his father's ([[Ciarán Hinds]]) large estate near [[Peebles]]. His hobby is spying on people from his tree house. Hallam is convinced that his stepmother, Verity ([[Claire Forlani]]), is responsible for his mother's death by drowning two years earlier. Hallam's sister leaves home to attend university and it becomes clear that Verity and his father want Hallam to move on as well. Hallam initially refuses due to his suspicion of Verity, but she uses his diaries first to have sex with him and then to [[blackmail]] him into leaving. To escape his father and stepmother, Hallam travels to [[Edinburgh]].  Upon arrival in Edinburgh, Hallam sees Kate ([[Sophia Myles]]), an administrator at the [[Balmoral Hotel]], located in the city centre. Kate bears a striking resemblance to his late mother. He manages to persuade her to give him a job as a kitchen porter in the hotel. Hallam makes his home in the clock tower of the hotel because of its vantage point over Kate's home in a top flat, where he can spy on her. He also spies on Kate through a [[skylight (window)|skylight]] on her roof, clambering over the roofscape to reach his vantage point.  Hallam learns that another senior hotel employee, Alasdair ([[Jamie Sives]]), is having an [[extra-marital affair]] with Kate. Alasdair then discovers Hallam's lookout in the clock tower. Hallam attempts to blackmail Alasdair with the knowledge of his [[adultery]], but Alasdair dismisses him. Hallam retaliates by finding Alasdair's wife and child and thereby demonstrating the ability, if he wishes, to inform her of the affair, which forces Alasdair to give him back his job.  Hallam eventually works his way up to being a front-of-house porter at the hotel. On his eighteenth birthday, Kate invites Hallam to have a few [[Alcoholic beverage|drinks]] after work. Whilst [[drunk]], Hallam reveals his continuing love for his late mother. This seems to fascinate Kate, as she "likes creepy guys". A complex relationship starts to build between Hallam and Kate from this point.  Kate first invites him home with her that night, and when she attempts to seduce him, he begins to get uncomfortable and instead they sleep in the same bed. The next day, he asks her on a date and she rejects him. Later, she asks him to one of the hotel rooms and they have sex.  When Hallam is watching Kate, Alasdair confronts her and begins to act violently. Hallam comes through the skylight to save her, which results in her finding out that he had been spying. She tells Alasdair to leave. She punishes Hallam by making him stand nude and explain to her why he was spying. She feels bad for him after he tells her about his mother and she lets him stay. She puts on the dress that Hallam keeps that used to be his mother's. When Hallam sees her, he cries, and they fall asleep together.  At this time, Hallam's father and stepmother track Hallam down because of his having reported his suspicions about his mother's death to the police in Edinburgh. Hallam's father has run up significant [[debts]] and needs to [[Land development|develop]] some of the land on the estate, but Hallam is entitled to consultation under his mother's [[Will (law)|will]]. Hallam refuses to co-operate due to his suspicion of Verity.  Hallam's hatred of Verity consumes him entirely, and he tries to drown her in the loch by his father's house. However, his humanity takes over and he revives her. Only at this point does his father reveal that he had made no attempt to prevent Hallam's mother from committing suicide. This revelation allows Hallam to realise that his anger is in fact with his mother for leaving him.  This cathartic moment enables him to move on for the first time, and the film ends with him happy and content walking the streets of Edinburgh.  
Gundamma Gaari Manavadu
 The title is suggestive of a grandmother-grandson relationship.

Neelakatna reluctantly agrees to the match but later calls off the wedding after receiving a better marriage proposal for his daughter. Yedukondalu is beaten up and dumped on the railway track. Injured, he nevertheless rescues a girl ([[Nicole (actress)|Nicole]]) stuck in a car on the tracks. Together they join hands to set up a successful restaurant. Yedukondalu then distances himself from Mahalakshmi. Whether he ends up with her makes up the rest of the story.  
Half Past Dead 2
 After the [[Half Past Dead|New Alcatraz massacre]], long time inmate Twitch (Kurupt) gets himself transferred to another. He claims it's to be closer to his lady but his real motives are a bit more grandiose than that.  There he crosses paths with Burke ([[Bill Goldberg]]) a bulky prisoner who is unfriendly and doesn't want to talk about anyone. Twitch, despite being less muscular, is just as mouthy and is pretty much the same. But there is a gang war brewing between the Black and Hispanic inmates that explodes into a hostile takeover of the prison when the Blacks' gang leader is shot dead and the finger points at Burke. But the situations worsen when the real killer and leader of the Hispanics, Cortez (Robert Madrid) takes Twitch's girlfriend ([[Angell Conwell]]) and Burke's daughter ([[Alona Tal]]) hostage as well, betraying his comrades to escape. Eventually things get more complicated as Twitch's real reason for his transfer is to find the gold from the heist, organized from the fellow New Alcatraz inmate Lester McKena.  Cortez demands a helicopter out of state or otherwise the hostages are dead. Burke and Twitch eventually catch up to Cortez and after a long fight with Burke ending up wounded, Cortez is knocked out and transferred to another prison.  Twitch is given parole after his actions that could have seen him wait even longer before he actually gets out, with Burke having to serve only a few more weeks rather than years. Twitch and his girlfriend find the gold and, as a favor for Burke, set up his account with 80 million dollars along with a plan to help Burke's daughter for college, surprising Burke himself.  
Hadersfild
 The story is set in a small town in [[Serbia]]. Rasha ([[Goran Šušljik]]) is thirty-two, lives with his alcoholic father ([[Josif Tatić]]) and tries, whilst failing, to make ends meet by giving literature lessons to teenage girls and hosting a program on the local radio, presenting new books and interviewing authors.   Ivan ([[Nebojša Glogovac]]), a promising judoist in his teenage years, has since had a history of neurosis, psychotic episodes, hospitalization, being heavily medicated, involvement in various occult groups and practices, prior to having been baptized in the Orthodox Church.   Milla ([[Suzana Lukić]]) is very attractive, energetic, resourceful and very straightforward: it immediately becomes clear that apart from having a student/teacher relationship, she and Rasha are lovers.   Dule ([[Vojin Ćetković]]) is a wannabe yuppie: he works for the local representative of major confectionery brands and is doing his best to act the part of a successful businessman who is well aware of global business trends as he sees them.   The monotony of their lives is interrupted by the arrival of Igor ([[Damjan Kecojević]]), who has lived in [[Huddersfield]] since the beginning of the nineties, and this is the first time he's come to visit since.   They all get together in the evening, and what begins as a cheerful high school reunion party of close friends with a lot of catching up to do, turns into an emotional roller coaster of reminiscing, dark humor, bitterness, uncontrollable laughter, anger and grim soul searching.  
Hack!
 On a small island, a man ([[Kane Hodder]]) is chased by an unseen figure. As he stops to catch his breath, he is decapitated by his pursuer. Meanwhile, a group of teenage college students, including the social outcast Emily ([[Danica McKellar]]), Emily's love interest Johnny ([[Jay Kenneth Johnson]]), the flamboyant [[homosexual]] Ricky ([[Justin Chon]]), jock Tim ([[Travis Schuldt]]), boyish [[lesbian]] Maddy ([[Adrienne Frantz]]), stoner Q (Won-G) and girly-girl Sylvia ([[Gabrielle Richens]]), are chosen to go on a field trip to a small island. The group, along with their teacher Mr. Argento (Mike Wittlin), meet Captain J.T. Bates ([[Burt Young]]) who takes them to the island on his boat. Here, the group meet the eccentric couple Vincent King ([[Sean Kanan]]) and Mary Shelley ([[Juliet Landau]]) who they will be staying with. Mary begins to film the group on her hand-held recorder, saying that she is an aspiring director.  At night, while the group settle in and have dinner with Vincent and Mary, Mr. Argento finds he has to leave the island to retrieve some equipment. However arriving at the boat, Mr. Argento finds J.T. has been murdered. Meanwhile, the students have a bonfire on the beach. Q leaves the group only to be startled by a figure dressed up as a clown. When he tells the others the incident is ignored and everyone goes to bed, not knowing Mr. Argento has also been murdered. The following day, Sheriff Stoker ([[Tony Burton]]) arrives on the island in search of a missing hunter. He questions Vincent and Mary, but both deny ever seeing him, so the Sheriff leaves. Soon after, Tim and Sylvia sneak into the forest to have sex, but are quickly attacked by the killer who murders Tim with a [[chainsaw]].  Sylvia is chased through the forest but is eventually caught, before being locked in a cage in an underground dungeon. At dinner, Emily becomes concerned with the various group disappearances, before she realises the phone lines are down, however Vincent and Mary convince everyone there is nothing to worry about. The students again have a bonfire on the beach, while Q decides to try and search for a phone signal. He encounters the clown once again, who swiftly crushes his neck and kills him. With Q now also missing, Emily, Johnny, Ricky and Maddy enter the forest to find their fellow students. Meanwhile, Vincent and Mary are shown watching videos of various murders they have committed and filmed, revealing the couple are making a [[snuff film]].  Sheriff Stoker, having become suspicious about Vincent and Mary returns to the island, however he is quickly murdered by the couple with an axe. Ricky and Maddy search the forest, but Maddy is soon knocked unconscious by Vincent and Mary while Ricky flees. Maddy awakens sometime later tied to a tree where she encounters Willy ([[William Forsythe (actor)|William Forsythe]]) who sets her free and tells her she can escape on his boat. While chasing Ricky through the forest, Vincent and Mary stop to record some footage. Vincent bites a chunk out of Mary's neck which eventually kills her, before Ricky attacks Vincent but is ultimately shot dead himself. As Johnny and Emily search the forest, Johnny finally kisses her. Overhearing Ricky's death, Johnny leaves to investigate. Meanwhile, Maddy searches for Willy's boat, but instead finds Emily standing next to a [[water well]]. Maddy warns Emily about the murders, but Emily unexpectedly pushes Maddy down the well where she is impaled on a spike. Vincent emerges from a nearby tree, congratulating Emily for her performance and luring the students to the island. Vincent informs Emily that Mary is now dead, and it is revealed the pair were having an affair behind Mary's back. Johnny soon returns to Emily, but is knocked unconscious by Vincent.  Johnny awakens in the dungeon and finds Sylvia still trapped in the cage, which is hanging above a pool of [[piranha]] fish. Willy arrives and frees Johnny, but Vincent and Emily also arrive and shoot Willy in the chest with an arrow, presumably killing him. In the ensuing fight, Vincent is severely injured and Sylvia is plunged into the pool of piranha. Johnny is chased to the beach where he is caught by Vincent and Emily. However Willy reveals himself to have survived and fatally stabs Vincent, but Emily quickly shoots Willy in the head, killing him. Johnny continues to fight with Emily, before Sylvia also reveals herself to have survived, and she finally kills Emily. Deputy Radley ([[Lochlyn Munro]]) then arrives on the island to take Johnny and Sylvia home. In a flashback scene, Deputy Radley is shown to be involved with the snuff film, leaving it unknown if Johnny and Sylvia were saved or were murdered also.  
Hai Master
  
Hannibal Rising (film)
 In 1941, an eight-year-old Hannibal Lecter lives in Lecter Castle in [[Lithuania]]. [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s invasion of the [[Soviet Union]] turns the [[Baltic region]] into part of the bloodiest front line of [[World War II]]. Lecter, his younger sister [[Mischa Lecter|Mischa]], and their parents travel to the family's hunting lodge in the woods to elude the advancing German troops. After three years, the Nazis are finally driven out of the countries soon to be occupied by the Soviet Union. During their retreat, however, they destroy a Soviet tank that had stopped at the Lecter family's lodge looking for water. The explosion kills everyone but Lecter and Mischa. They survive in the cottage until five former Lithuanian militiamen, led by a Nazi collaborator named Vladis Grutas, storm and loot it. Finding no other food in the bitterly cold Baltic winter, the men look menacingly at Lecter and Mischa.  By 1949, Lecter Castle has been turned into a Soviet orphanage and is housing the interned orphan [[Hannibal Lecter]]. After dealing violently with a bully, Lecter escapes from the castle orphanage to [[Paris]] to live with his widowed aunt, [[Lady Murasaki (Hannibal)|Lady Murasaki]]. While in [[France]], Lecter flourishes as a student. He commits his first murder as a teenager, killing a local butcher who insults his aunt. He is suspected of the murder by Inspector Popil, a French detective who also lost his family in the war. Thanks in part to his aunt's intervention, Lecter escapes responsibility for the crime.  Eventually, Lecter becomes the youngest person ever admitted to medical school in France. He works in Paris, where he is given a job preparing cadavers. One day, Lecter witnesses a condemned war criminal receiving a [[sodium thiopental]] injection, allowing him to recall details about his war crimes. Consequently, in an attempt to recall the names of those responsible for his sister's death, Lecter injects himself with the solution. His subsequent flashback reveals to the viewers the men who had killed Mischa, had cannibalized her as well. Lecter returns to Lithuania in search of his sister's remains. He excavates the ruins of the lodge where his family died, and upon finding Mischa's remains, he gives her a proper burial. He also unearths the dog-tags of the deserters who killed his sister. One of them, Dortlich, attempts to kill him but is incapacitated by Lecter. After he buries Mischa's remains, Lecter forces Dortlich to reveal the whereabouts of the rest of his gang, then decapitates Dortlich with a horse-drawn pulley. Dortlich's blood splashes on Lecter's face, and he licks it off.  Lecter then visits Kolnas' restaurant in [[Fontainebleau]]. He finds his young daughter and notices Mischa's bracelet on her. He gives her Kolnas' dogtag. Dortlich's murder puts the rest of the group on alert and, because of the similarity to the first murder, places Lecter under renewed suspicion from Popil. Grutas, now a [[Human trafficking|sex trafficker]], dispatches a second member of the group, Zigmas Milko, to kill him. Lecter kills Milko instead, drowning him in [[formaldehyde]] inside his laboratory. Popil then tries to dissuade him from hunting the gang. During a confrontation with Lady Murasaki, she begs him not to get revenge. He refuses, claiming that he made a promise to Mischa. He then attacks Grutas in his home but Grutas is rescued by his bodyguards.  Grutas kidnaps Lady Murasaki and calls Lecter, using her as bait. Lecter recognizes the sounds of Kolnas' birds from his restaurant in the background. Lecter goes there and plays on Kolnas' emotions by threatening his children. Kolnas gives up the location of Grutas' boat, but Lecter kills him when Kolnas goes for Lecter's gun. Lecter goes to the houseboat and finds Grutas assaulting Lady Murasaki. In a final confrontation, Grutas claims that Lecter had also consumed his sister in broth fed to him by the soldiers, and he was killing them to keep this fact secret. Enraged by the revelation, Lecter eviscerates Grutas by repeatedly carving his sister's initial into his body. Lady Murasaki, finally disturbed by his behavior, flees from him even after he tells her that he loves her. The houseboat is incinerated, but Lecter, assumed to be dead, emerges from the woods. Lecter then hunts down the last member of the group, Grentz, in [[Canada]], before leaving on his way to the [[United States]].  
Happily N'Ever After
 The story begins with the idea that the [[Magician (fantasy)|Wizard]] ([[George Carlin]]) controls all of the [[fairy tales]] and maintains the balance of good and evil in Fairy Tale Land. With the help of his assistants the uptight Munk ([[Wallace Shawn]]) and the decidedly goofy Mambo ([[Andy Dick]]), the Wizard is checking to make sure that all the fairy tales under his care are "on track" to have their traditional [[happy ending]]s. As we meet him however, the Wizard is leaving for [[Scotland]] for a long-overdue vacation. He leaves the kingdom in the hands of Munk and Mambo.  Ella is a girl who is better known as [[Cinderella]] ([[Sarah Michelle Gellar]]). She lives as a servant to her step family, dreams of the Prince ([[Patrick Warburton]]) who will sweep her off her feet. Her best friend at the palace is Rick ([[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]]), the palace dishwasher. Rick takes it upon himself to deliver the invitations to the royal ball to Ella. Ella sees Rick only as a friend, but Rick secretly loves Ella, although he is too cool and proud to admit it. Rick can't really understand what Ella likes about the Prince. Rick's Three Amigos, the comic chefs (all voiced by [[Phil Proctor]], [[Rob Paulsen]] and [[Tom Kenny]]) in the palace kitchen, believe that Rick has a bad case of "Prince envy".  The Prince does everything by the book, and plans to meet his maiden at the ball.   However, things don't go as planned at the ball. Thanks to the assistants, Ella's evil stepmother, Frieda ([[Sigourney Weaver]]) gains access to the Wizard's lair during the Prince's ball. She manages to chase off Munk and Mambo and tip the scales of good and evil, causing a series of fairy tales to go wrong and have unhappy endings, including [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] getting stepped on by the [[Giant (mythology)|Giant]] ([[John DiMaggio]]) yet surviving, [[Rumpelstiltskin]] ([[Mike McShane|Michael McShane]]) winning his bet with the miller's daughter ([[Jill Talley]]) and taking her baby, and the unseen demise of [[Little Red Riding Hood]]. She summons an army of [[Troll]]s, [[Witchcraft|witches]] ([[Tress MacNeille]] and Jill Talley), three [[Big Bad Wolf|Big Bad Wolves]] ([[Jon Polito]] and Tom Kenny), the Giant ([[John DiMaggio]]), and Rumpelstiltskin to her castle. Ella finds out and escapes to the woods where she meets Munk and Mambo. The trio set out to find the prince who has goes looking for his maiden (not knowing it was actually Ella) in hopes that he will defeat Frieda and save the day.  Together, they flee to the [[Seven Dwarfs]] (all played by Tom Kenny and John DiMaggio) home. Witches and [[troll]]s led by [[The Snow Queen|The Ice Queen]] attack them. The Seven Dwarfs hold off the trolls, while they flee with the help of Rick who had stolen a flying broom. Frieda decides to go after Ella herself. She succeeds in capturing her and returns to the palace, with Rick, Munk and Mambo in pursuit. Frieda tortures Ella because if the story had run its course she would have married the prince while Frieda would never get anywhere in life. Rick, Munk, and Mambo slip into the castle and attack Frieda. During the fight, Frieda generates a pit in the floor. Mambo knocks her in, but she uses her staff to fly back up again. After a short battle, in which Rick takes a blast meant for Ella and falls into a deep sleep, Frieda creates a portal by accident. Ella knocks Frieda back and punches her into the portal. Rick awakes from the spell and he and Ella kiss, finally admitting their feelings for each other.  Ella and her true love Rick decide to choose their destinies in a world of happy endings and get married. Rumpelstiltskin has shown throughout the movie that he has come to care for the baby and the miller's daughter lets him stay in the castle as the baby's nanny. The Wizard returns from vacation where he wasn't told about what happened while he was away.  In the final scene, Frieda is shown trapped in the Arctic surrounded by [[elephant seal]]s.

Over the following year, Michael becomes fixated on [[papier-mâché]] masks and withdraws from everyone around him, even his mother. When Michael kills a nurse as Deborah is leaving from one of her visits, she is unable to handle the situation and commits suicide.  For the next fifteen years, Michael ([[Tyler Mane]]) continues making masks and not speaking to anyone. Loomis, having continued to treat Michael over the years, decides to move on and closes Michael's case. Later, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove, killing the sanitarium employees in the process. He kills a truck driver for his clothes, and makes his way back to Haddonfield. On Halloween, Michael arrives at his now-abandoned childhood home, where he recovers the kitchen knife and Halloween mask he stored under the floorboards the night he killed his sister.

Meanwhile, Annie convinces Laurie to babysit [[List of Halloween characters#Lindsey Wallace|Lindsey Wallace]] (Jenny Gregg Stewart) so that she can meet with her boyfriend Paul ([[Max Van Ville]]). Annie and Paul return to the Wallace home and have sex; Michael kills Paul and attacks Annie. Bringing Lindsey home, Laurie finds Annie on the floor, badly hurt but still alive, and calls the police. Michael attacks Laurie and chases her back to the Doyle home. Loomis and Brackett hear the 911 call over the radio and head toward the Wallace residence.

Laurie finds herself on top of an unconscious Michael. Aiming Loomis' gun at his face, she fires just as Michael awakens.  
The Hammer (2007 film)
 [[Image:Adam Carolla - The Hammer.jpg|thumb|left|On location in San Fernando Valley]]  Jerry Ferro is turning 40 years old and is not what you would call a success. He works part-time in construction as a carpenter and part-time as a [[boxing]] instructor at a fitness center near Los Angeles. He drives a beat-up pickup truck and loses both the construction job and the woman in his life.  An amateur [[Golden Gloves]] boxer long ago, Jerry is asked one day if he would be willing to spar with an up-and-coming fighter named Malice Blake. He takes a beating, but surprisingly lands a one-punch knockout. Due to his strong left hand, Jerry's boxing nickname was "The Hammer," though a [[running joke]] depicts people assuming the nickname describes Jerry's work as a carpenter.  He is noticed by Eddie Bell (played by real-life boxing coach Tom Quinn), a coach who will train boxers trying to qualify for the next [[Olympic Games]]. Bell invites him to come to the Olympic tryouts. Jerry is clearly too old and out-of-shape, so he isn't interested. But his friend and co-worker Oswaldo Sanchez gives him encouragement, as does Lindsay Pratt, an attractive lawyer who works out at the gym and has caught Jerry's eye.  Jerry comes to the tryouts. He is mocked by Bell's top light-heavyweight contender, Robert Brown, which motivates Jerry to get into shape. He goes into serious training, loses weight and needles Brown, telling him there's "a new sheriff" in town in the light-heavyweight division.  What Jerry doesn't know is that Coach Bell privately sees Jerry as no more than a sparring partner and motivator for Brown, who is a legitimate Olympic candidate but who has a weakness against hard-hitting left-handers like Jerry. By falsely boosting Jerry's hopes, Bell can avoid paying him the usual $100 per day for a hired sparring partner.  Jerry drives team members to the first stage of the Olympic qualifying eliminations in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], where because of his age and lowly status he is immediately paired against the No. 1 contender. Coach Bell has gotten all he wanted out of Jerry and is so apathetic about the outcome that he deserts Jerry's corner in the middle of the bout. Motivated by the memory that he has never finished anything he ever started, Jerry scores a shocking knockout.  He and Brown both advance to the next round of the competition, to be held in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. When Brown learns that Coach Bell has lied to Jerry about his prospects, Brown begins to sympathize with Jerry and to bond with him as unlikely friends. Unfortunately, they will need to fight each other soon, with only one able to qualify for the Olympics.  On top of that, Lindsay has a job offer that would require her to move out of state. Jerry knows he has little future in boxing, no matter what happens next, so he needs to get his priorities straight as he and Brown head toward a showdown in the ring.  In the final round of the competition, Jerry and Brown go up against each other. Lindsay decides to stay in California. At the fight, right as Jerry is about to win and KO Brown, Jerry instead hugs him and lets Brown win. The film ends with all three at a party at their house and Jerry becoming Brown's trainer.  
Hallowed Ground (film)
 After becoming stranded in a small town called Hope, Elizabeth "Liz" Chambers, ([[Jaimie Alexander]]) discovers her arrival was foretold a century earlier by the town's founding [[preacher]] Jonas Hathaway ([[Nick Chinlund]]) and that she is an integral part of his impending—and terrifying—rebirth. Forced to stay overnight in the town, Liz meets Sarah Austin ([[Hudson Leick]]), a [[reporter]] for a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] newspaper, who is in town to investigate legends of living scarecrows. The townspeople of Hope once sacrificed people by nailing them to crosses in the cornfields until a young girl alerted residents of the nearby town of Liberty. Horrified to learn of the murders going on in Hope, the townspeople of Liberty nailed the local preacher who spearheaded the sacrifices to a cross. [[Legend]] contends that one day he will be reborn.  Sarah persuades Liz to accompany her to the cornfield. At the cornfield, Sarah takes photos of a scarecrow that she and Liz construct and hang on a [[cross]], intending to use the photograph for the newspaper's front page. Sarah is later attacked and killed by the scarecrow, which comes to life. The scarecrow tries to kill Liz as well but she manages to escape in the squad car of a [[Deputy sheriff|deputy]], who is killed upon arriving at the scene.  She drives to the sheriff's office, where she tells her tale. When the deputy is unable to reach anyone by radio or phone, he leaves Liz alone while he goes to find out the problem. Liz is able to fend off the scarecrow when it arrives, stalking her. She tries to flee in her car but sees that the [[engine]] has been removed. She takes refuge with the town's preacher ([[Ethan Phillips]]), but discovers that the preacher is the leader of the townspeople, who worship the [[spirit]] of the founding preacher. The preacher intends to bring the spirit back to life by fathering a [[child]] with Liz, whom the spirit can possess. The sheriff arrives in time to stop the townspeople, but loses consciousness in a car crash. When the [[clergyman]] tries to rape Liz, she fends him off and escapes.  As she flees, she finds Sabrina ([[Chloë Grace Moretz]]), a child hiding in an underground shelter. Her [[parents]] were killed by the scarecrow, but she had escaped. Meanwhile, the townspeople set out in search of Liz. Liz hides Sabrina in a hole in the cornfield while she goes for help. She makes it to the next town only to find everyone dead.

Hansel and Gretel (2007 film)
  Eun-soo, a salesman, is driving his car along Highway 69 while talking on the phone with his pregnant girlfriend, Hae-young. They get into a fight, leading Eun-soo in a car-crash where he loses consciousness. He wakes up to find himself stranded in a dark forest. He sees light from a lantern carried by a young girl who introduces herself as Young-hee as they head for her house, in the middle of the forest called the "House of Happy Children".  Her parents, older brother Man-bok and younger sister Jung-soon are waiting on the porch when they arrive. The following day, Eun-soo finds the children following his every move; later, he makes a failed attempt to leave the house. As he tries again, he discovers that the parents are leaving, who tell him to take care of the kids.  He soon finds the mother hiding in the attic, who tells him that they are not the children's real parents. Their car broke down on Highway 69 too, and they met Jung-soon when they explored the woods. She tells him not to believe the children. As Eun-soo makes his way out again the next day, he sees Man-bok and a couple approaching the house. The man, Byun is a deacon who is seemingly amicable, unlike his wife. Eun-soo keeps looking for clues, finding that the meat they had consumed was actually the flesh of the missing 'father' while his wife had turned into a china doll. He also notices that Byun's wife had disappeared after accusing Jung-soon for stealing her ring. At night, he secretly follows Man-bok into the woods, making a trail of breadcrumbs so he wouldn't get lost. He realizes Byun's wife had turned into an oak tree.  Man-bok stops in front of a mysterious door to a room, putting down the notebook that the siblings have been working on throughout the movie. His face changes to an old man's face as he passes the door. When he leaves, Eun-soo enters the room and looks over the notebook's contents, and realizes that the children are over thirty years old. Suddenly Young-hee comes in, sleepwalking, and as they talk, Eun-soo notices her face which has become an old woman's and backs away in shock, hitting bookcases in the room and causing notes to fall off the shelves. As he reads the notes, the reason Man-bok wanted to get rid of the couple who used to be his 'parents' is revealed. The couple were in midst of a quarrel when Jung-soon accidentally stepped on shards of broken glass while playing, angering Man-bok who used his powers to almost force the husband's hand into a boiling pot of soup - this made the couple wary of their actions in fear of Man-bok taking their lives.   Eun-soo sees more of the children's drawings in the notebook, like: a woman with mutilated limbs, a woman turned into an oak tree, a woman in a dress with red crayons splattered on her face and a man (who resembles Eun-soo) laying on the grass beside the red flowers he had seen on his way out, causing him to believe that the last depiction foretells his end and he becomes determined to stop the children before they murder him.  Meanwhile, Young-hee returns to the house upon hearing Byun singing. Eun-soo heads back too, to find out that Byun is a religious cult leader trying to kill the children, and he is holding Jung-soon hostage. He manages to knock Byun out and listens to the children's side of the story from Young-hee in the form of a flashback.  The kids used to live in an orphanage called the "House of Happy Children", where the abusive caretaker raped the girls and beat the boys. Man-bok failed to save his friend Seung-ho from being beaten for spilling food, who got locked up in a dark room. The sisters once tried to escape, and Young-hee ended up going into the caretaker's room to save Jung-soon from being raped.   One Christmas Eve, they wondered if Santa Claus would give them presents, because they thought they weren't good that year. This led to Man-bok activating his powers, which he only realized the next morning when Santa ''did'' come and told the siblings that their wishes could come true just by imagining it, and he gave them a Hansel and Gretel storybook. They believed they must reenact the story to all the dreadful adults. The three of them then witnessed Seung-ho being forced into a sack, where he was beaten to death. Man-bok felt that this must stop. They sneaked up to the room unlocked by Man-bok's imagination to give candy to their friends inside only to realize everyone in the room were dead. The caretaker found them and was about to burn them in the fireplace, but Man-bok screamed, bringing the story back to the present as he screams when Byun rises to kill Eun-soo, causing a whirlwind in both timelines, which throws the caretaker into the fireplace, and at the same time, Byun is stabbed to death.  The winds stop and the children ask Eun-soo to stay with them. Eun-soo on the other hand wishes to reunite with his loved ones and offers instead to take the children outside with him. They refuse, saying adults will always be bad, against which Eun-soo argues that if they continued their doings, they would end up to be the same. Young-hee suddenly whispers, "Burn the notebook, so you can get out of here." He does so before Man-bok can stop him, and Eun-soo glances at the crying children as the book burns.  Eun-soo wakes up in the location where he first met Young-hee. He walks up to the road and sees the police, who tell him the tragic stories of Highway 69, and that they are amazed at his survival.  A year later on Christmas, Eun-soo has married Hae-young, and they have a baby boy. As he goes out to buy milk, he wonders if his encounter was real or if it was a dream. His collection of news clippings of Deacon Byun (now revealed to be a serial killer and religious cult leader) who is apparently missing suggests that it was real. He comes across the same notebook that the children used and browses it. The pages are blank until the last page, which shows three children dressed like Man-bok, Young-hee, and Jung-soon all holding hands and smiling. The children had given up and realized that they didn't need parents to be a family. Eun-soo looks out the window and outside in the snow, Man-bok, Young-hee, and Jung-soon turn around and make their way back into the woods.

The building also serves as the headquarters of the [[Order of the Phoenix (Harry Potter)|Order of the Phoenix]], a secret organisation founded by [[Albus Dumbledore]], which informs [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] that the [[Ministry of Magic]] is oblivious to [[Lord Voldemort]]'s return. At the Order's headquarters, Sirius Black, mentions that Voldemort is after an object he did not have during his previous attack.  Back at [[Hogwarts]], Harry learns that Minister of Magic [[Cornelius Fudge]] has appointed a new [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] professor: [[Dolores Umbridge]]. She and Harry immediately clash, and she punishes Harry for his "lies" by forcing him to write a message with a magic quill, scarring his hand. When Ron and Hermione notice Harry's scars they are outraged, but Harry refuses to go to Dumbledore, who has distanced himself from Harry since the summer. As Umbridge's control over the school increases, Ron and Hermione aid Harry in forming a secret group to train students in defensive spells, calling themselves "[[Dumbledore's Army]]". Umbridge recruits the [[Slytherin]] students to expose the group. Meanwhile, Harry and [[Cho Chang]] develop romantic feelings for each other.  Harry has a vision involving an attack upon [[Arthur Weasley]], from the point of view of Arthur's attacker. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs [[Severus Snape]] to give Harry [[Occlumency]] lessons to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. The connection between Harry and Voldemort leads Harry to further isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], Sirius' deranged [[Death Eater]] cousin, escapes from [[Azkaban]] along with nine other [[Death Eaters]]. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad expose Dumbledore's Army. Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress. Harry's relationship with Cho falls apart, as he believes she betrayed Dumbledore's Army to Umbridge. Harry discovers through Snape's memories why Snape hated Harry's father James, who often ridiculed him.  Harry has another vision, this one of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort. Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to Umbridge's fireplace to alert the Order via the Floo Network, since hers is the only fireplace not being monitored, but Umbridge stops them before they can do so. As Umbridge tortures Harry, Hermione tricks Umbridge into entering the Forbidden Forest in search of Dumbledore's "secret weapon". She and Harry lead her to the hiding place of [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] giant half-brother, [[Grawp]], only to be confronted by [[centaurs]] who kidnap Umbridge after she attacks and insults them. Harry, Hermione, Ron, [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]], [[Neville Longbottom|Neville]] and [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] fly to the Ministry of Magic on [[Thestral]]s in an attempt to save Sirius.  The six enter the Department of Mysteries where they uncover a [[Prophecy (Harry Potter)|bottled prophecy]], the object Voldemort was after. However, they are ambushed by Death Eaters including [[Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]. Lucius reveals that Harry only saw a dream of Sirius being tortured; it was simply a ruse to lure Harry into the Death Eaters' grasp. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, and a fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters ensues. The Death Eaters take everyone except Harry as hostages, threatening to kill them unless he surrenders the prophecy.  Harry obliges just as Sirius and [[Remus Lupin]] arrive with Order members [[Nymphadora Tonks]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] and [[Mad-Eye Moody]]. As they attack the Death Eaters, Lucius drops the prophecy, destroying it. Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius, Bellatrix kills Sirius. Voldemort appears, but Dumbledore arrives through the Floo Network moments before Voldemort can kill Harry.  A duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore ensues, destroying much of the Atrium, while Bellatrix escapes. After the two prove evenly matched, Voldemort possesses Harry to try to get Dumbledore to sacrifice Harry, but the love Harry feels for his friends and Sirius makes it impossible for Voldemort to remain in his body. Ministry officials arrive before Voldemort [[Apparition (Harry Potter)|disapparates]]; Fudge is forced to admit that Voldemort has returned and is forced out of his position as Minister in disgrace. Umbridge is removed from Hogwarts and Dumbledore returns as headmaster. Dumbledore explains that he distanced himself from Harry throughout the year hoping it would lessen the risk of Voldemort using their connection. Harry comes to terms with the prophecy; "Neither can live while the other survives."  
The Haunted School
 Twenty years ago, a fire broke out in Lap Lan Girls' School and strange incidents started occurring in the school since then. The headmaster hanged himself from a tree while a student committed suicide by jumping off the school building. A silhouette of a person, like a shadow, appeared on a wall near the staircase, and it cannot be erased. Apart from typical school rules, an unreasonable regulation that forbids students from falling in love is strongly enforced in the school, as well as a curfew which states that students are not allowed to leave their dormitories after 11 at night. Whenever a student breaks a school rule or wanders out at night, she will hear a mysterious female voice coming from the sound system, calling her to enter the school office. The student is never seen again after she passes through a supernatural portal into that seemingly non-existent "school office". Each time someone goes missing, a new shadow will appear on that strange wall.  In the present day, under the new education policy, the school accepts four boys (Ben, Charlie, Dick and Keung) as students. The boys are confined to their classroom and dormitory, as the school aims to minimise interaction between them and the girls. However, the students still defy the rules and throw a secret party in the woods, after which, love begins to blossom among the youngsters. Unknown to them, their romance has already revived the curse within their school. Dick and Sze disappear after being pulled into the "school office" by a strange force, while Charlie and Kei die in the same manner as the previous headmaster and the suicide student respectively.  The surviving students seek answers from their teacher, Miss Fong, who tells them that the strict school rules were actually set by a dean 20 years ago. The dean treated students harshly and punished offenders harshly in the school office while the headmaster never interfered in the dean's discipline system. One night, the dean was caught having an affair with the headmaster by the headmaster's wife, who locked her in the school office and burnt her to death in anger. The dean's spirit began haunting the school since then and she continued to "enforce" her rules in a spiritual way. Keung, Yat-man, Ben and Siu-fong work together to search for the exact location of the old school office and destroy it once more, as that is the only way to break the dean's evil curse.

When the search party confronted Erzebet in her castle, all members of the party were horribly killed, and Bruttenholm was left to face her alone. He tricked her into the sunlight, effectively destroying her.  In the present day, an elderly Bruttenholm, who is overcome with memories of his encounter with Erzebet, takes a particular interest in a [[publicity stunt]] case in the [[Hamptons]] on [[Long Island]]. A haunting has been reported in a mansion recently purchased by developer Oliver Trumbolt, a friend of a U.S. Senator with hands deep in the [[Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense|BPRD's]] budget, and considered a low priority. Bruttenhom insists that their most advanced team should go: [[Liz Sherman]], [[Abe Sapien]], [[Hellboy]] and junior agent Sydney Leach as well as himself (to everyone's surprise). Bruttenholm does not explain his motives at first.  Ana, a blushing bride-to-be is met on the streets by two elderly women who encourage her to go to her bridal gown fitting, where she meets Erzebet, who had already killed the shop owner and her baby. Ana innocently comments that Erzebet reminds her of her "older" sister, offending her until she notices that Erzabet has no reflection. She screams, and everything goes dark. Later, upon being told that Father Lupescu was the one who convinced Ana to go to her fitting despite the disappearances of the young girls in the village, Erzabet pays him a visit, frightening him with her dark powers and confirming that his faith is not enough to keep her power from affecting the town.  The BPRD team arrives at Trumbolt's site and sets up to investigate the haunting. Despite a few open windows, a creepy lifelike replica of Erzabet and an old, suspiciously familiar-looking groundskeeper, everything seems normal until night falls and they each encounter strange ghostly apparitions, culminating in dozens of spirits of Erzabet's former victims. Excited that he may have found a goldmine, Trumbolt ignores the professor's warnings and is attacked.  Ana goes to visit Father Lupescu who convinces her that she should not fear danger because the church is strong and the faith will keep her from harm. She hurries off to have her fitting done, running into Professor Bruttenholm as she leaves. Bruttenholm attempts to explain to Lupescu about Erzabet's true nature and her allegiance to Hecate, but he becomes offended and turns Bruttenholm away.  Using his abilities to detect metal, Leach finds a secret passageway through the house's cellar, inadvertently coming across Trumbolt's body, drained of blood. The blood has been placed in a bathtub, apparently for Erzabet's revival. Bruttenholm and Liz head for the gardens to stop Hecate and Erzabet's [[Harpy]]-Hags from summoning her back from the dead while a [[werewolf]] attacks Hellboy and Abe. Abe is knocked unconscious and taken by the harpies for experimentation while Hellboy fights the werewolf, eventually subduing it and revealing that it is Father Lupescu, the groundskeeper whom Bruttenholm had earlier identified.  Meanwhile, Liz and Bruttenholm are attacked, first by wolves, then by Erzabet's withered body, which knocks Liz out and takes Bruttenholm. Hellboy is dropped through a hole in the courtyard and meets Hecate, who is perplexed as to why he helps the mortals, and tries to lure him to the dark side. He bluntly refuses again and again, forcing Hecate to take a physical form to deal with him. After Abe escapes them, the harpies come across Hecate, but one is killed as she violently thrashes with Hellboy and the other escapes. Erzabet bathes in Trumbolt's blood and rejuvenates herself, but she begins to wither and decay again from the Holy Water which Bruttenholm had added to the bath. He breaks off a chair leg and finishes her off. Her death enrages Hecate who brutally attacks Hellboy and badly wounds him, and when he realizes her weakness is the sun, he lures her outside, forcing her back into the darkness of her own realm, defeated.  Bruttenholm is preparing for his trip to Transylvania where rumors have it that there is a vampire on the loose. As he is packing, his colleague comes in and they discuss the "right hand of doom" (Hellboy's stone hand); Bruttenholm asserts that so long as evil exists, good will rise up against it, before revealing an image of Hellboy's right hand, signifying that he will be responsible for the destruction of the world.  Hellboy wakens in his bed, admiring Bruttenholm, his adopted father, before falling back to sleep again.  
Hellphone
 The film begins with Sid Soupir admiring the girl of his dreams, Angie. His friend, Pierre (also called Tiger), encourages him to talk to her. Sid agrees but decides to impress Angie with his skateboarding moves first. At first he succeeds in getting Angie's attention, but then he crashes into a vegetable cart. Angie's two friends, Margot and Clemence, laugh while Angie pulls Sid to his feet. Sid offers to make plans with Angie as Angie's sort-of boyfriend, Virgile, and his friends watch from a distance. Angie agrees and offers to get Sid's cellphone number but Sid replies he does not have a cellphone at all. Tiger butts in, making up a lie that Sid had to cancel his cellphone plan because a crazy Russian ex-girlfriend was stalking him. Unimpressed, Angie's friends lead her away.  Back home, Sid asks his mother if he can have his birthday money in advance. She is only able to spare €30 and Sid resolves to ask money from his boss, Mr. Fritz, at the fast food restaurant where he works.  At his job, Sid asks his boss for his paycheck in advance but the boss refuses. Seeing as €30 will be the only money he is able to raise, Sid goes to a dinky shop run by Patrick Vo. After some haggling, Sid gets a cellphone, a  sleek red phone with two protruding horns at the top. The phone comes to life in his hands, which astonishes the shopkeeper who has been trying to turn it on ever since he got it. He tries to take the phone back so he can sell it for more money, but Sid runs away.  At school, Sid shows off his phone to Tiger, who is amazed by it. Meanwhile, Clemence brags to her friends about her successful audition. Sid gathers up his courage to ask Angie for her number but Clemence and Margot laugh at his new cellphone and lead Angie away.  In science class, Sid and Pierre are teased by Virgile and his friends. As the lesson continues, the Hellphone dials Margot's number and tells her to set Clemence's hair on fire with the Bunsen burner (Clemence landed the role Margot auditioned for). Hypnotized, Margot obeys. She is sent to the principal's office where she tries to explain her actions. Unimpressed, the principal lets her go without a clear punishment.  After school, Sid and Tiger visit their favorite skate shop but are disappointed to find out the ownership has changed. They leave without buying anything and the next day, at home before school, Sid practices on what to say to Angie. To his embarrassment, the phone calls Angie. Sid manages to small talk with her and when he hangs up, he is surprised to see Margot on his recently made calls list.  In math class, Margot texts Clemence her apologies but Clemence refuses to forgive her. During the teacher's lecture, Sid fills in Tiger on his phone's weird doings. Annoyed with their talking, the Mr. Mazeau, the teacher, flicks a piece of chalk at Sid's head and demands for him to answer a particularly difficult question. Sid looks at his phone helplessly and to his amazement, the phone provides the correct answer. However, the teacher believes Sid cheated with his cellphone's calculator and confiscates it, throwing it out of the classroom window.  As soon as class lets out, Sid and Tiger rescue the phone, relieved it isn't damaged. As they ponder how the phone knew the correct answer, Sid and Pierre see Angie and her friends being walked to their next class by Virgile and his entourage.  Later that night, Mr. Mazeau is working in his classroom when he receives a mysterious phone call. We then cut to Sid waking up on his birthday and the phone wishes him a happy birthday in the form of a hologram. Sid goes to pick up Pierre for school and tells him about it. Pierre get worried and insists that Sid throw away the phone but Sid refuses. Pierre takes the phone and asks it for help in getting rid of their detention. It calls the school secretary who believes that Sid and Pierre are, in fact, the principal. They take advantage and not only get rid of their detention, but install the McDonald's menu for their school lunch. With the phone, the boys go on a spree. Meanwhile, at school, the school janitor finds Mr. Mazeau on the ground, with his mouth stuffed with pieces of chalk.  At a strip club, Tiger asks to borrow the phone so he can get his divorced parents back together. Sid refuses, believing that the phone chose him for a reason. However, he relents but the phone refuses to work for Tiger, causing him to comment that the phone appears to be in love with Sid.  Becoming increasingly dependent on the phone's powers, Sid uses it to get a date with Angie, forcing Virgile's father to give him a racing car, asking Mr. Fritz for time off (killing him in the process) and obtaining a nice suit. However, when Virgile assaults Sid for the theft, the phone kills one of his friends. Following this, Sid and Angie are arrested, but the commissar, after a call, lets them go. Fearing the worst, Sid tries to get rid of the phone, by losing or destroying it, but with little success. The phone then states that Sid is its beloved master, and anyone in its path will die, Angie being the next target.  Teaming up, Angie, Sid, Tiger, Virgile and others attempt to destroy the phone together, but even Angie's mother hydraulic press only temporarily disables it. After being chased by hypnotized people and losing most friends (the phone drives them to suicide with ease), Sid, Angie and Tiger decide to freeze the phone in liquid nitrogen. A crowd of possessed students forcefully bring Tiger to listen to the call as he holds the nitrogen ready, promising him power if he kills Sid instead, but he still drops the phone inside the tank, revealing that his earplugs made him immune to the phone's call.  In the end, the three surviving protagonists throw the frozen phone overboard on a ship as Sid and Angie kiss.

Kessler then discovers that Jüst's father headed a Nazi extermination group on the Eastern Front during World War II. Jews placed in the back of a closed truck were killed with the truck's exhaust gas. A device called a 'heartbeat detector' was then applied to discover any who had survived. Tormented by this memory Jüst attempts suicide.  The action then shifts from the company's politics to [[The Holocaust]]. An analogy is drawn between the desubjectivized corporate language used in downsizing and that used in the Nazi chain of command.

Hero (2007 film)
 The film begins six years after Kuryu Kohei was transferred to Ishigaki Island (in the TV series finale).   We learn in the interim that he has since been transferred to Sapporo and then to a brief tenure in Yamaguchi Prefecture (the events of the 2006 Hero TV Special).  Kuryu Kohei returns to the same Tokyo District Prosecutors Office from the TV series and reunites with his old workmates.   The events of the film takes him to Korea, wraps up plot threads from the TV special and allows Amamiya and Kuryu to rekindle their relationship which had been in limbo since their date at the 2002 World Cup (5 years).  Kuryu prosecutes a fatal hit and run case, but runs into obstruction and interference as the chief suspect is a witness to a high profile political case.  As such, Kuryu must face an elite, powerful lawyer, played by Koshiro Matsumoto.  Proving his suspect guilty risks collapsing the national case.  However, as always, Kuryu only cares about finding the truth and justice about his case and goes to great lengths (even travelling to Korea) to find it.   While the TV episodes focused mostly on Kuryu's pre-trial investigative abilities, the film showcases Kuryu's legal skills within the courtroom, leaving Amamiya and the other co-workers to do much of the legwork.  
Help Me Eros
 The film is set in modern [[Kaohsiung]], [[Taiwan]]. The infamous opening sequence<ref name= "Variety Asia">[http://www.varietyasiaonline.com/content/view/2030/], Variety Asia Online review, 2007-09-05</ref> depicts the protagonist lying on the designer sofa in his apartment watching a cookery segment on his TV, in which a carp is swiftly scaled, gutted, cooked and served alive, its mouth still slowly opening and closing.  Jie ambles around his almost bare apartment, cooking instant noodles, tending his treasured marijuana plants in their closet nursery and explaining his problems to counsellor Chyi on the suicide hotline. A former stockbroker, recently fired, he resorts to selling off his remaining designer furniture at a nearby pawn shop to maintain his paltry existence.  Chyi, the counsellor he compulsively requests from the hotline call center, is a young but overweight woman. Jie pleads with her over the line for more satisfying contact, but she is reluctant to accede. Jie fantasises about Chyi, idealising her as beautiful girl in a revealing costume pleasuring herself to the sound of his voice and exhaling the marijuana smoke he breathes onto the telephone handset. When she leaves work for her marital home she finds her husband in a frenzy of activity, preparing her an enormous gourmet meal. She eats alone whilst he watches TV with his conspicuously attractive friend, who he informs her will be staying with them for a while. He fills the bathtub with live eels whilst she sits watching in her underwear. She attempts to maneuver her husband into sex, but he flinches away from her touch. Left alone in the bathroom, Chyi playfully pushes them around with her toes. Later in the evening, as she walks past the two of them playing pool on her way to the kitchen for a tub of ice cream, the camera pans to reveal that both men are naked from the waist down.  In the street kiosk below, the [[betel nut beauty|betel nut beauties]] sit at a counter above street level and wait for customers. The newest employee, Shin, struggles to fit in with the more established girls. Jie pays her for cigarettes with an out-of-circulation coin and earns her a reprimand. One night, as she tries to remove her scooter from the crowded rank outside the building, Jie stops to assist her. In return he asks her to drive her somewhere.  They arrive at a used-car lot, and whilst Shin waits on the scooter Jie slips into the lot and opens one of the cars using a key he has brought with him, revealing it to be yet another piece of property he has given up since losing his job. He and Shin drive around the city, taking their own photograph using a [[speed camera]], and eventually park up somewhere in the city for Jie to smoke a joint of his home-grown [[marijuana]]. He cups his hands around his and Shin's faces to allow her to breathe his exhaled smoke.  Abruptly, the couple are shown copulating in a number of extraordinarily acrobatic positions, most of which involve Jie suspending Shin completely in his arms. As they relax in bed afterwards, Jie at his laptop and Shin lying next to him, Chyi contacts Jie on MSN. Her personal image is of her and a thinner co-worker who Jie assumes must be her. Chyi is too ashamed to deny it and plays along. The next day Jie waits outside the hotline office for the woman in the photo, who he follows around the city for a while. He mentions the details of her itinerary to Chyi when he next calls in, provoking confused denials.  At the street kiosk one of the more established girls, who has formed a more personal relationship with a regular client in an expensive car, leans in on the promise of another gift and the man attempts to drive off with her. She is dragged along the road for a few feet before she finally falls back to the street and the car speeds off. The other girls take her inside to console her and Jie brings her some of his marijuana, which he then shares with all of the betel nut girls. This scene implies that his plants produce a powerful sexually intoxicating effect. Jie ends up on the roof of the apartment building in a languid threesome with two betel nut girls. Brand logos are projected across their entangled bodies from an unseen source.  The next morning Shin comes up to Jie's apartment. He had asked her to bring water, and she has brought two small bottles of mineral water. She quickly realizes that the apartment's water and power have been turned off due to his non-payment of his bills. She offers to help him pay his bills, implying a furtherance of their relationship, and he stubbornly refuses to discuss it. He becomes aggressive with her, angry that she has misunderstood his request for water – he needs industrial quantities to keep his marijuana plants alive. Shin is outraged by his attitude and pulls his plants out of the cupboard, smashing the pots underfoot and trampling them into the floor with her patent leather boots.  Shin takes a bus back to a rural area and finds work on a large plantation. Back at the apartment building, Jie appears remorseful and hangs around the kiosk, asking after her. When he begs one of the other girls to text Shin, she informs him that Shin doesn't want to speak to him. He sells the rest of his possessions, including his TV and sofa, and uses the proceeds to buy lottery tickets.  Jie calls the hotline and leaves a message for Chyi, who is eating at a roadside restaurant and watching the cooking program that demonstrated the live carp preparation in the opening sequence of the film. It is her husband and his lover presenting it, on location at an ostrich farm. They are attempting to cook an ostrich egg omelette, but when they break the egg into the pan, a dead baby ostrich is released into the hot oil. At the sight of this gruesome image, Chyi runs to the riverside to be sick. As she recovers, she receives a text from her office saying that Jie has called to say that he plans to kill himself. He has left an address and she hurries to his apartment building.  [[Image:Eros Lottery.jpg|thumb|left|Shin watches the shower of lottery tickets]]In his apartment, Jie attempts to kill himself by turning on the gas canister for his stove and lying on the floor. He awakes later, dazed but alive, to discover that the canister is empty. He opens the street-side windows and steps onto the windowsill as Chyi hurries up the stairs. Meanwhile, Shin returns and approaches the street kiosk.  Chyi bursts into the apartment to find it empty. Standing on the street below, Shin is suddenly covered in a shower of lottery tickets. Jie has apparently disappeared somewhere between the window and the street.

Highlander: The Source
 In the near future, a group of Immortals quest to locate the mysterious "Source" of immortal power. One member of the group, Zai Jie, breaks into a communications tower in [[Eastern Europe]] and contacts his associates to give them the location of the Source. The Guardian of the Source, who has supernatural speed, confronts and decapitates him. Reggie, another group member, discovers that the planets are moving from their orbits into a cosmic alignment.  Former [[Watcher (Highlander)|Immortal Watcher]] [[Joe Dawson (Highlander)|Joe Dawson]] is called by group member [[Methos]] to find their mutual friend Duncan MacLeod. Joe finds MacLeod in a fight with the Guardian, shoots Duncan, hauls him into a truck, and drives off.  They rendezvous with the others at a monastery to meet with an ancient being known as the Elder so they can locate the Source.  At the monastery, they meet Anna Teshemka, Duncan's mortal wife, who is having visions. The Elder meets them all as a group and tells of how, in ancient history, another group of Immortals sought the Source. Upon slaying the Guardian, two of the three survivors were cursed with decay, with one of them becoming the new Guardian, and the other being the Elder (the third, a woman, is later implied to have been reincarnated as Anna). The Elder tells them all to follow Anna who knows the way. She, in turn, receives a vision from the Elder. Meanwhile, the Guardian arrives and attacks Reggie and Joe Dawson on holy ground. In an effort to save Dawson, Duncan throws his katana at the Guardian, temporarily wounding him. The Guardian removes the sword from his neck and breaks it before killing Joe with the broken blade and escaping. After burying Joe, they leave to find the Source, which they have determined to be on an island off the coast of Lithuania in the Baltic Sea.  Approaching the island, the boat's captain tells them that the "maniacs", gangs of cannibals, rule the island. After fighting locals who were poised to immolate a man to death, they obtain a van and drive to a deserted house a short distance away from where they believe the Source to be. That night, the Guardian kills Reggie by slashing him to death &mdash; the Elder had warned them that the closer they get to the Source, the weaker they would become, meaning that they would lose their immortality. Duncan has replaced his broken katana with a pair of [[butterfly swords]]. The group takes Reggie's body with them until they ultimately discover that he will not revive.  After burying Reggie, they continue on their way. During their journey, Duncan and Methos conclude that the expression "there can be only one" was in fact never meant to mean that all Immortals must battle and behead each other until only one remains, and that it truly means that only one Immortal can claim the Source. They then find the road blocked, and are captured by cannibals. While the cannibals are distracted by their drunken carousing, the Guardian frees Anna and forces her to accompany him to the Source. Later, Giovanni escapes and takes a sword, hoping to be "The One." Duncan frees himself and Methos, and sets off to rescue Anna. Giovanni gets recaptured, and Duncan goes in to save him. Methos arrives to assist Duncan at the last moment, and tells him he believes Duncan is "The One" due to his incorruptible nature. He rides off on a horse to distract the cannibals, allowing Duncan to chase after Anna. Giovanni, who had run off when Duncan came to his rescue, is decapitated by the Guardian.  Duncan finds Anna in a clearing by a sandy pit illuminated by starlight. The cosmic convergence is happening directly over them. The Guardian appears and challenges Duncan. MacLeod finds that he now has the same speed and power as the Guardian, and manages to get past the foe to reach Anna. However, an energy barrier appears to bar his way. After continued fighting, the Guardian ends up buried chest deep in the dirt. Bound and defeated, the Guardian demands that MacLeod behead him. Duncan refuses, and the Guardian vanishes in a blast of light. Before he goes, the Guardian screams that he is "cursed forever." Duncan enters the Source, qualified to do so by his pure heart. In the Source, Anna reveals that she is pregnant with their child. Of the child, Duncan declares that "he is the one."  
The Hills Have Eyes 2
 A captive woman, forced to breed [[mutant]] children, gives birth to a stillborn. She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades ([[Michael Bailey Smith]]) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Later, scientists working in an area in the New Mexico desert, designated Sector 16, are attacked by the mutant Letch.  A group of National Guardsmen in training are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists, who were working for the [[United States Department of Defense]] on installing a [[surveillance]] system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film). The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter ([[Eric Edelstein]]), picks up a faint distress call, Sergeant Jeffrey “Sarge” Millstone ([[Flex Alexander]]) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon ([[Michael McMillian]]) and  Amber ([[Jessica Stroup]]).  The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another dying scientist out of the portable toilet. On her way to join the group, Amber is attacked by the mutant Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey ([[Reshad Strik]]) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and Sarge is accidentally killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his [[rappelling]] gear as the others try to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen, they are forced to try to find another way down.  The remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way down the hill is through the mining caves. After the group kills Stabber, Missy is captured and taken into the mining caves by Chameleon. Chameleon attempts to rape her, but Missy fights him off, only to be captured by Hades, who scares Chameleon away and savagely rapes Missy himself. The remaining troops attempt to rescue Missy, with the exception of Stump (Ben Crowley), who is killed by Letch while attempting to climb down the hill without ropes. After being separated from Crank ([[Jacob Vargas]]) and Delmar ([[Lee Thompson Young]]),  Napoleon and Amber cross paths with Chameleon, who they manage to kill. They later locate a non-violent mutant named Hansel (David Reynolds), while escaping Grabber (Gaspar Szabo). Grabber is killed by Crank after shooting Delmar. After reuniting with Napoleon and Amber, Delmar dies from his wounds, and Hansel leads Napoleon, Amber, and Crank to the exit. Along the way Crank is killed by a trapped crate of dynamite that he attempts to take with him, incidentally triggering an explosion.  After killing Letch, Napoleon and Amber find the captive Missy, and all three fight Hades, whom they manage to kill as well. The three leave the mines, but a text blended into the screen states that the National Guard trainees remain missing and Sector 16 is still not acknowledged to exist. As the survivors prepare to depart, they are watched by an unknown mutant using their surveillance equipment.<ref></ref>  
The Hitcher (2007 film)
 College students Jim Halsey and Grace Andrews are driving across New Mexico to meet her friends for [[spring break]]. One night in the pouring rain, they almost hit a hitchhiker who is standing in the middle of the road near his broken down car. Jim swerves and the car spins out of control to a stop. As the man approaches, Grace insists that someone else will stop to help him and they speed off.  At a gas station, Jim sees the hitchhiker climb out of a truck. Inside, he introduces himself as John Ryder and asks for a ride. Reluctantly, Jim agrees. While on the road, he becomes violent and attacks them, holding a knife to Grace's eye. He tells Jim the only way to save them both is to say "I want to die". Jim hits the brakes, causing the hitchhiker to hit his head on the windshield and kicks him repeatedly until Grace opens the passenger door and he is pushed out.  The following day while driving, a family in a station wagon passes them, with the hitchhiker in the back. Jim and Grace try to warn the family, but crash their car. The couple is forced to continue on foot and they eventually find the family's car on the side of the road; both the children and mother are already dead, with the father badly wounded and slowly dying. Driving the station wagon, the couple head towards town hoping to take the man to a hospital. After the hitchhiker attempts to run them off the road, Jim and Grace stop at a cafe, and the man dies.  Suspected of having committed the murders, Jim and Grace are arrested and brought to the police station. The hitchhiker arrives shortly after and kills everyone at the station except for Jim and Grace, who flee. Despite believing there might be a third suspect, Lieutenant Esteridge continues to pursue the couple. The hitchhiker shows up and helps Jim and Grace escape the police, single-handedly taking out all of the police cruisers and the helicopter.  Grace and Jim arrive at a motel and Jim steps out of the room to make a phone call. He is gone for several hours and Grace falls asleep watching TV, but is woken by the hitchhiker, who tries to rape her. Grace manages to fight him off and hides in the bathroom.  The hitchhiker disappears and Grace searches for Jim. The motel manager sees her with a gun, and calls the police. Grace finds Jim who is chained between a truck and a trailer. Grace runs to the truck and points the gun at the hitchhiker, demanding he stop. The police arrive soon after (still thinking Grace and Jim are the killers), and see Grace holding the hitchhiker at gunpoint, but don't realize Jim is being tortured. The police tell her to drop the gun, and the hitchhiker tells Grace not to listen to them before driving forward and splitting Jim in half, killing him. The hitchhiker and Grace are apprehended by the police.  The next morning, Esteridge tells Grace, whose innocence has been proven, that the real John Ryder is missing and they do not know the true identity of the hitchhiker. He also informs her that he will be taking her to her parents and the hitchhiker will be transported across the state in a separate van. During the journey, the hitchhiker breaks free from his restraints and kills both the guard who is watching him and the passenger, causing the van and Esteridge and Grace behind him to crash.  Esteridge is trapped in the car and Grace takes Esteridge's gun, slowly making her way to the van. Grace opens the van and the hitchhiker attacks her and locks her in the back. The hitchhiker shoots a pool of gasoline near the van, igniting it. Grace manages to get a shotgun from the front seat of the van and escapes as the van explodes. Meanwhile the hitchhiker shoots and kills Esteridge and walks away. However, Grace shoots him in the back and then in the chest.  The hitchhiker tells her "Feels good, doesn't it?" to which she replies "I don't feel anything" before she shoots him in the head.  
His Majesty Minor
 Minor (Garcia) was abandoned by his parents as a child and was raised by a pack of pigs; he speaks in porcine grunts and lives and loves much like his fellow hogs. Minor is just human enough to have his head turned by [[Clytia]] (Bernier), a beautiful girl living in the nearby village. However, if Minor's lack of social skills weren't enough to keep Clytia away, she's already been pledged to wed handsome and charming Karkos (Peris-Mencheta). When Minor runs afoul of the tribal leadership, he's removed from his home with the pigs and forced to live in an enchanted forest, where he attracts the not entirely welcome attentions of [[Pan (god)|Pan]] (Cassel), a randy half-man and half-goat willing to couple with anything that breathes. When Minor emerges from the forest able to speak with newfound eloquence, the tribal leaders name him their new potentate, and Clytia suddenly finds him a great deal more appealing, which doesn't sit well with Karkos.

Highway Star (film)
 Bong Dal-ho's ultimate dream is to become a famous [[rock music|rock]] star. To make a living in his small, rural town, Dal-ho's [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] rock band is forced to play [[trot (music)|trot]] ([[country music]] similar to [[enka]], also known as ''bbong jjak'') in tacky nightclubs. One day, Jang Joon, executive of a shabby record company, sees potential in the seemingly clueless vocalist and promises to make him a star—Dal-ho realizes too late that he's been duped into signing a contract with a label that specializes in trot music.  Jang believes that Dal-ho's talent as a trot singer is in reflecting the melodramatic sentimentality of middle-aged Koreans (the genre's target [[demographic]]), but Dal-ho persistently believes that trot music, along with the gaudy costumes and hairstyles and exaggerated stage movements associated with it, is outdated and trite.  So on his televised singing debut as a trot singer, Dal-ho wears a mask out of shame. However, the strange strategy works; his voice rocks the nation and his album sales climb the music charts. His mysterious masked face had only increased the public's curiosity about the new star, doubling his popularity.  As Jang continues to train him, Dal-ho gradually begins to see the beauty of trot, thanks to the help of his colleagues, especially Cha Seo-yeon, an attractive trot singer with a strong passion for music but little talent. Dal-ho realizes that what's important is not which genre he chooses but whether he sings with all his heart. But he also undergoes an [[identity crisis]], wondering if he would remain a star without the mask.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Hitman (2007 film)
 At a remote compound, a group of young boys are receiving tattoos of [[bar code]]s on the back of their shaved heads; men observe, direct, and coordinate the training of the boys in firearms, unarmed combat, stamina and strength. The boys are trained from an early age to be professional, international [[Contract killing|hitmen-for-hire]].  [[Interpol]] agent Mike Whittier ([[Dougray Scott]]) arrives home and is met at gunpoint by [[Agent 47]]. The two talk about 47's life as a professional hitman, working for a mysterious paramilitary group known simply as [[International Contract Agency|the Organization]].  Three months prior, 47 ([[Timothy Olyphant]]) is completing a hit on a Nigerian warlord named Bwana Ovie, force-feeding one of his prisoners with [[plastic explosive]]s. He remotely detonates the bomb, killing Ovie and three of his men. In a change of plans, 47 is told by his Organization contact, Diana Burnwood, that he is to kill his next target, [[President of Russia|Russian President]] Mikhail Belicoff ([[Ulrich Thomsen]]), publicly instead of privately. He completes his mission, but before he can leave [[Russia]], he is contacted by his employers. They tell him that there is a witness to the assassination and order him to intercept and kill her. When 47 realizes she has never seen him before, he does not shoot her, instead, he narrowly avoids an assassination attempt on himself, attempted by another Agent.  His employers reveal his location to agents of the [[Federal Security Service|FSB]], who make plans to intercept him. As he is about to be taken, Diana calls to warn him and tells him that Belicoff himself ordered the hit. After he escapes from the hotel, 47 intercepts Nika ([[Olga Kurylenko]]), Belicoff's mistress, the woman who supposedly witnessed his hit. He interrogates her about Belicoff and discovers that Belicoff had a [[body double]], who ordered the hit on the real Belicoff so that he could take his place as the president of Russia. 47 was to be killed after the hit to ensure total secrecy.  As Nika and 47 attempt to take a train further into Russia, they are intercepted by more Organization Agents. 47 kills four of them. Whittier attempts to arrest 47, and 47 wounds and knocks his partner ([[Michael Offei]]) unconscious, but is persuaded by Nika not to kill Whittier.  FSB Agent Yuri Marklov ([[Robert Knepper]]) orders Interpol to leave the country. 47 contacts [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA officer]] Carlton Smith to offer him a deal. 47 will kill Udre Belicoff, Mikhail's brother (an [[arms dealer]] and [[Human trafficking in Russia|human trafficker]]), in exchange for a favor. Agent Smith informs 47 that Udre had been planning something with a German arms dealer named Price. Intercepting him could lead 47 to Udre.  47 and Nika travel to [[Istanbul]], where 47 abducts Price in order to pose as Price at a meeting with Udre. 47 kills Udre's bodyguards and then Udre, forcing Belicoff's double to attend Udre's public funeral. 47 kidnaps Marklov and forces him to order his own agents to shoot Belicoff's double as he delivers the eulogy. Disguised as a soldier, 47 kills Belicoff's double's guards and takes him into the archbishop's chamber in the church. 47 kills him and allows himself to be taken into custody by Interpol and Whittier.  Smith delivers on his end of the deal with 47. His operatives intercept the Interpol convoy that is transporting 47 to the airport, causing enough distraction that 47 escapes. The scene then flashes forward to the conversation between Whittier and 47 in Whittier's home. 47 suggests Whittier go along with his plan, saying that he will notify the police that he has killed the fake Agent 47, implying that Whittier will not survive if he does not. He also suggests that Whittier waits until after his daughters have gone to school, so they don't have to witness it.  Nika picks up an envelope from an undisclosed sender. Inside it, there are papers and a message saying that she now owns a vineyard, a dream of hers. 47 is watching her from afar, through the scope of a sniper rifle. He then looks at the corpse of another Organization Agent laying at his feet, tells the body that he warned the Organisation not to touch her, and then walks away.  
The Home Song Stories
 The film is an [[autobiography|autobiographical]] account of Tony Ayres' life at age eight, however the names have been changed.  The story is narrated by [[Darren Yap]] as an adult Tom typing the story on a computer and reflecting on the story "which defines them, which shapes who they are."  His mother Rose Hong ([[Joan Chen]]) was a [[nightclub singer]] in [[Hong Kong]] in 1964, where she met Bill, an Australian sailor, and married him to seek a better life in Australia, taking her daughter May ([[Irene Chen]]) and son Tom ([[Joel Lok]]).  An opening montage of scenes shows Rose making several unsuccessful attempts to establish herself with Chinese partners before moving in with Bill again.  The story begins seven years after their initial migration to Australia, with the family returning to Bill's house in [[Melbourne]].  Bill's mother, Norma (Kerry Walker), who is disapproving of the family, has moved in.  When Bill leaves on a tour of duty, Rose and Norma struggle for control over the house. Soon, Rose begins to have an affair with Joe ([[Qi Yu Wu]]), the son of the local Chinese restaurateur, who is in his twenties. He moves in with Rose, who tells Norma he is her aunt's son. Rose and her children are eventually kicked out when Norma finds Joe in Rose's room.  Rose settles in with Joe after renting a place from a Chinese man.  Their relationship begins to break down, and Rose attempts suicide, however May and Joe discover an affinity for each other which develops into a friendship. Rose, believing that May is trying to take Joe away from her, beats her and curses her. May, as a result, also attempts suicide and Rose also ends up in despair. However, the mother and daughter are reconciled in forgiveness as Rose tells May the story of the difficulties and traumatic experiences in her childhood, where she was forced into a marriage and lost her first two daughters.  The relationship between Rose and Joe collapses, and the family once again returns to Bill's home, with Norma moving out.  One afternoon when Tom is walking home with his classmate they encounter Rose in the front yard, and upon overhearing a conversation between two of his classmates bagging out Rose and her clothing, Tom blocks himself from his mother completely. Rose, in the meantime, has had her dream shattered, and is contemplating returning to Hong Kong when Tom abruptly tells her his apathy.  The film culminates in the adult Tom narrating, "Of all the things I remember about my childhood, this is what I remember the most."  The eight-year-old Tom wakes up early in the morning to see the light to the backyard shed on and enters to find that Rose has hanged herself. Although she does not die initially, Bill receives a phone call later on confirming her death.  The epilogue to the film shows the adult Tom and his sister May with her family (who happen to be Ayres' real life family) returning to Bill's home.  He narrates again, recalling how he never shed a tear for his mother, but instead, wrote the story fully to understand what has shaped him.  The real Tom, [[Tony Ayres]], and his sister stayed with Bill after their mother's death. May ends up marrying the teacher who became their guardian soon after Bill's death.

Homo Erectus (film)
 Set in the [[Stone Age]], Ishbo is the younger son of Mookoo, the leader of a tribe of [[cavemen]]. Ishbo is smarter than most of his tribesmen, but awkward and nerdy, living in the shadow of his much more physically impressive brother Thudnik. He hopes to use his superior intellect to become an inventor and raise his tribe above simple sticks and stones, but due to a combination of the flimsy materials available to him and the lack of support from his tribe they always fail. Ishbo also has had a lifelong crush on his childhood friend, Fardart. Much to his dismay, immediately after he finally expresses his love to her she is "clubbed" by Thudnik (and all that follows in the tradition of caveman stereotypes), and eventually married to him. Ishbo himself has never clubbed a woman, having his heart set on Fardart his whole life.  After Fardart is betrothed to Thudnik, Ishbo begins to believe that he will never club a woman. He at first is too attached to her to consider clubbing another woman, and is further discouraged after a particularly ill-fated attempt at clubbing. Ishbo becomes quite depressed, a feeling which is escalated by his failure to prove useful on a mammoth hunt. He falls into a large pile of mammoth dung, then is eaten by the mammoth, and eventually excreted (or extracted – the scene itself appears as a series of animated cave drawings) from the mammoth when it is finally killed by the rest of the tribesmen.  During an attempt on Mookoo's life, it is revealed that their rival tribe, the Binadraks, are planning on attacking them shortly. They train for battle but are bested by their enemies, who kill Mookoo and carry off Fardart, who disguised herself as a man to take part in the fight. Thudnik orders a retreat and they return to their home cave, which they decide to abandon in favour of finding a new home. Unable to convince the rest of the tribe to stay and fight, Ishbo decides to set out to avenge his father and rescue Fardart on his own. Thudnik declares him an enemy and swears to kill him if he sees him again.  On the way he gets lost, sees a vision of his father, and stumbles upon a tribe of Amazon cavewomen, who first plan to kill him but are then impressed by his stance against clubbing of women. His reward is freedom, but only if he agrees to impregnate all the Amazons, starting with their Queen. He is at first eager to do so, however he is unable to perform the task as his heart still belongs to Fardart. Offended that he has turned down a "gift" which many men have died trying to achieve, they chase him from their lands with spears.  Eventually he reaches the cave of the Binadrak tribe and spots Fardart. Surprisingly, she does not wish to be rescued, as her captors have supplied her with fine furs, plentiful food, and an attractive bone necklace. The tribe then rises up and chases after him, whereupon they meet the Amazon tribe and eventually his own tribe, who both join in the chase. The three groups together eventually chase him off the edge of a cliff, where he delivers a thoughtful monologue to the audience before reaching the ground, and his death.  The final scene is in a modern museum, where a group of school children are being given a guided tour. The guide reaches their caveman exhibit, featuring a life-sized "model" of Ishbo, where she explains how with fossils, they have been able to reconstruct the [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] cave man and discover how he looked in his life: in her words, "short and fat". However after she leaves Ishbo addresses the audience again, for the last time.

Later that night, at the village's weekend-long [[harvest festival]], Lorna discovers that Beth has inherited a vast fortune from her mother. Stuart and Todd attend the festival, where Stuart approaches Beth and the two share a friendly conversation. Meanwhile, Lorna is invited by a local man, Roman on a boat ride. In a secluded area downstream, Roman incapacitates her before kidnapping her. Beth and Whitney leave the festival, and Axelle volunteers to wait for Lorna.  The following morning, Lorna wakes up hung upside down, naked, with her wrists chained behind her back. A woman enters the room, and lies naked in a bathtub beneath her.

The Elite Hunting representatives try to find someone else to finish off Whitney and inquire with other patrons, including an Italian man who is [[Cannibalism|eating]] Miroslav alive. Stuart is approached by the representatives, and after discovering that Todd has been killed, he accepts the offer and beheads her.    When Stuart returns Beth seduces him into untying her from the chair. Stuart attempts to rape her, but she fights him off and chains him to the chair. She demands the code to the cell door from Stuart, but still needs to be buzzed through, which inadvertently summons Sasha and the guards. Beth offers to buy her freedom with part of her inheritance, but Sasha explains that in order to leave she must also kill someone. When Stuart insults Beth, she cuts off his genitals and tosses them to one of the guard dogs, leaving him to bleed to death. Per the contract Beth is given an Elite Hunting tattoo, making her an official member.  That night, Axelle is lured from the village harvest festival into the woods by the street children, where she is surprised by Beth. After Beth beheads her with an axe the children start playing soccer with Axelle's severed head.

Hot Fuzz
 [[Constable#United Kingdom|PC]] Nicholas Angel is an over-achieving officer of the Metropolitan Police Service who gets transferred by his jealous colleagues  by 'promoting' him to [[Sergeant]] in the village of Sandford, [[Gloucestershire]]. Sandford is a crime-free idyll, a regular winner of "Village of the Year" awards, watched over by the [[Neighbourhood Watch|Neighbourhood Watch Alliance]] (NWA). But Angel is frustrated to find the local police service is lazy and complacent. His new partner is PC Danny Butterman, a fan of [[action film|action]] and [[buddy cop film]]s and son of [[Inspector]] Frank Butterman, Angel's new superior. Angel also meets Simon Skinner, the affable but strangely intense and disquieting manager of the local supermarket.  After a local performance of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Angel suspects foul play when the lead actors, solicitor Martin Blower and his mistress Eve Draper, are found dead the following morning with Skinner appearing to know more than he knew while the other officers pass it off as an accident. When sent to resolve a neighbourhood dispute caused by Arthur Webley, Angel discovers the farmer's illegal weapons and places them in the police station's evidence room along with an old [[naval mine]]. Angel and Danny later help George Merchant, a wealthy drunkard and land developer, get home from the pub. But after Angel slowly warms to Danny while watching action movies at Danny's home, they learn that following morning that Merchant died in a gas explosion that destroyed his mansion.   With his suspicions dismissed by the other officers as another accident, Angel begins to suspect that the killings are connected to a recent property deal after witnessing the gruesome death of ''Sandford Citizen'' editor Tim Messenger, who claimed to have information regarding Merchant. Angel's suspicions are confirmed when witnessing Leslie Tiller, the village florist and NWA member who was to sell her property to Merchant's business partners, being murdered by a black cloaked figure who eludes him after a chase. Angel persuades Frank of the murders while accusing Skinner of act, only for Skinner to have alibis for the murders in the store's surveillance footage. Angel later theorizes that there are multiple killers by sheer accident, with Frank dismissing the idea while advising Angel to get some rest.  When Angel returns to his hotel room, he is attacked by Michael Armstrong, one of Skinner's supermarket employees. Angel knocks him out and learns of a secret NWA meeting at Sandford Castle where they are revealed to the murderers as Angel attempts to arrest them. Angel is astonished upon learning that the NWA had murdered Blower, Draper, Merchant, and Messenger for being petty threats to Sandford's chances of winning the "Village of the Year" award, having also killed Tiller for being set on leaving Sandford. Frank reveals himself to be the mastermind behind the murders, having vowed to make Sandford the best village to honor his wife, who committed suicide when they lost the first "Village of the Year" because of travelers. Outnumbered, Angel flees while finding the bodies of the NWA's previous victims which included those Angel had arrested and the sergeant he had replaced. Angel is then stabbed by Danny, who faked Angel's death to save his life while getting him to the village limits where he convinces him to leave for his own safety.   Angel stops by at a petrol station on the way back to London, inspired in returning to Sandford after seeing a stand holding some of Danny's action films. Angel sneaks back into Sandford and arms himself with the confiscated guns before engaging in a shootout with the NWA while joined by Danny. When Frank sends the other officers to arrest them, Angel and Danny win them over before they besiege the supermarket with Skinner fleeing in a police car with Frank. After the subsequent car chase, Angel fights Skinner at a [[Miniature park|model village]] of Sandford, which ends with Skinner being impaled on the miniature village church, while Frank crashes his car as he tries to escape. Angel's former superiors beg him to return to London, as the crime rate has risen heavily in his absence, but Angel decides to remain in Sandford. The officers are filling out the paperwork concerning the arrests of the NWA when the group's last member Tom Weaver bursts into the police station and wounds Danny when he took a bullet meant for Angel. Knocked into the evidence room in the resulting struggle, Weaver accidentally activates the naval mine, killing himself and destroying the station. One year later, Angel has been promoted to Inspector and head of the Sandford police. Danny is revealed to have survived and promoted to Sergeant as Angel brought Danny flowers for his mother's tombstone before they return to duty.

Her father, Lou, loves her and tries to please her, giving her gifts such as [[Elvis Presley]] recordings. Although he battles with alcoholism, he tries his best to give Lewellen a stable home. He even tries to provide a motherly figure in Lewellen's life by dating a mysterious girlfriend, Ellen, who promised one night to rescue Lewellen from life in the rural South should the relationship falter.  We later learn that Ellen is in fact Lewellen's aunt, her mother's sister.  Lewellen is able to maintain her innocence by finding consolation in playing with her best friend Buddy, idling away her last pre-teen summer with typical outdoor rural pastimes such as swimming in the pond and exploring the woods, meeting a new friend, Grasshopper, while spending the summer with her grandparents. Lewellen is enchanted by her idol, Elvis Presley, who is making a homecoming tour in the South. Her town is one of the venue stops. Lewellen finds that singing Elvis' music is a way to channel her trauma into something constructive and creative.

Ellen leaves one day and breaks Lewellen's heart, burdening her with the responsibility to be a "mother" despite not having one herself. Her father suffers a terrible accident, and is handicapped to the point of infantile [[Mental retardation|retardation]], but the thought of Elvis coming to town gives her the resolve to carry on despite this newest of many traumatic circumstances. Buddy tells Lewellen that Wooden's Boy has an Elvis ticket and is willing to give it to her if she does her Elvis dance for him naked. When she finds out the deal, she questions doing such an act for a moment. She then agrees to do so, Wooden's Boy then unzips his trousers, she asks for her ticket, but Wooden's Boy then rapes her.

Hot Rod (film)
  Throughout his entire life, Rod Kimble has believed his father, now deceased, was a successful and respectable [[stuntman]] working for [[Evel Knievel]]. He aspires to follow in his father's footsteps and become a famous [[stuntman]] himself. Meanwhile, his stepfather Frank fails to respect Rod as a man, often going out of his way to beat him in [[sparring]] sessions and mocking his stuntman dream. Rod makes many attempts at landing jumps with his [[Tomos]] [[moped]], most of them ending unsuccessfully. After an ill-fated jump attempt at the public pool, he returns home to find out that Frank is in urgent need of a heart transplant that the family's health insurance will not cover. Angered at the thought of his stepfather dying without getting a chance to gain his respect and beat him in a fight at least once, Rod tells his childhood friends Rico, Dave, and his half-brother Kevin that he plans to do a jump over the length of fifteen school buses, and give the proceeds to his stepfather's surgery. He also adds Denise, his college-graduate neighbor on whom he has a crush, to his crew.  To promote his stunt and also raise funds, Rod, who "likes to party", works parties, corporate get-togethers, and other events, performing activities such as taping pillows to his body and having a washing machine, suspended by a crane, swing to hit him. Kevin releases a movie using his footage of Rod's stunts and sells over 200 tickets, but everyone at the movie laughs at Rod's expense as the film depicts his failed training attempts. Rod gets angry and throws the theater's projector out of a window, smashing the projectionist's car below. Rod ends up giving up all the money he has raised so far to the projectionist to cover the damages and avoid arrest. Upset, he returns home, where his mother reveals to him that his father was not the stuntman he thought he was. Humiliated, Rod quits the crew and ends his dream to beat up Frank, despite his friends' interventions. However, he takes up the jump again when Dave asks Rod to take him to the hospital due to an injury while "trippin' balls" under the influence of [[LSD|acid]] given to him by his friend Derek. When he does, Dave gives him advice that inspires Rod to apologize to Kevin. As Kevin accepts his apology, he also reveals that Rod's stunt footage has gotten popular through the Internet, and a local AM [[radio station]] hosted by Barry Pasternak offers to cover the expenses of the jump.  Rod gets the crew back together and they start setting up for the jump. On the day of the jump, his friends give him a new suit, a rock (to represent extensive pyrotechnic work done by Rico), and a motorbike. He also receives a kiss from Denise, who broke up with Jonathan, her insensitive and callous boyfriend. As Rod jumps off the ramp, the speed of his new motorbike enables him to jump over the buses, but the bike smashes through a stage and goes flying. Rod lands squarely on the ground, and has an unconscious out-of-body experience. When he awakes, Rod, with the help of Kevin and Denise, triumphantly gets up to the applause of the crowd, and sees that the donations have accumulated over $50,000, the cost of Frank's "conveniently priced" surgery. The film ends taking place six months after the events of earning $50,000 as Rod again spars with Frank, in which Rod gains the upper hand and successfully gains his stepfather's respect.

Hotel Chevalier
  In a hotel lobby, the [[concierge]] answers a phone call from a guest's room. A man ([[Jason Schwartzman]]) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow bathrobe, watching the black-and-white American war film ''[[Stalag 17]]'' and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from the concierge in broken [[French language|French]], he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room&nbsp;– pausing to play the opening bars of the song "[[Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?]]" by [[Peter Sarstedt]] on his stereo system&nbsp;– and runs a bath.   The man is again lying on the bed, now in a gray suit. Hearing a knock, he starts the song playing again before opening the door to a woman ([[Natalie Portman]]). After staring at him for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and presents the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he turns his head away and they embrace instead. He closes the door and asks how she found him; she replies that it "wasn't actually that hard". She moves around the room browsing through his possessions, brushes her teeth with his toothbrush and declines to take the bath he had run for her.   Stepping back into the bedroom, the woman turns to face the man and confronts him, asking slowly "what the fuck is going on?" He motions to her to join him on the bed and at her prompting, he reveals in the ensuing conversation that he has been living in the hotel room for "more than a month", and that he had left to escape their relationship. They lie back on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have an uncomfortable exchange about not having slept with other people and when he notices bruises on her arm after undressing her further, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly that he "will never be [her] friend", but holds her when she embraces him. "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?" starts again and the man offers to show the woman his view of Paris.   The woman is perched against an [[armoire]], the man approaches and covers her naked body with the yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out on the balcony, the man draws a toothpick from his pocket and hands it to her with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.

Devon and Candice find the monkey statue, but are told to leave it in the box by Zane. As Zane leads the group through the house, an angry Hailey picks on Samantha, while Zane attempts to get Candice to break up with Devon. As they all begin to have fun, Hailey apologises to Samantha for bullying her, telling her she is still angry at her dad for remarrying. Zane realizes that he will not be able to break up Devon and Candice, so switches plans and asks Carter to swap dates with him. Carter agrees, disappointing Hailey as she likes Carter. Zane reveals to the others his fear is sharp knives, Candice being scared of suffocating and Hailey being claustrophobic.  Zane sneaks off from the others and dress up in a miners suit. He jumps out at the group to scare them, before sending them off into the ancient Mummy section of the house. Zane stays behind to re-dress the mannequin he took the costume off. After doing so, the mannequin comes alive and stabs him to death.  While in the mummy's tomb, Hailey tells Carter her feelings about his swapping dates, causing the pair to fall out. Suddenly, a faulty prop cuts Candice's arm and the group hear the dying screams of Zane, prompting the group to want to leave. They go back to tell Zane, but find a pool of blood, and Candice realizes someone else is in the house. The group believe it to be another joke by Zane, and make Candice stay. However, Samantha soon finds Zane's body, and the group discover their phones do not work in the house. They panic and try to leave, all the while being stalked by a mysterious shadow. They go to the back-stage of the house to escape, but Candice is separated from the others. She becomes lost and winds up in the mummy's tomb, where she becomes trapped when the doors close. The rest of the group realize her absence and return to find her, guided by her screams. In the mummy's tomb, sand begins to pour out of the roof, filling up the room. The group make it to the door, but find it sealed shut. Suddenly, mummified hands emerge from the sand and pull Candice under, suffocating her. The sand clears away and the group manage to open the door to find a dead Candice. Devon mourns his girlfriend, before they decide to move on.  They make it to the front door, but the key will not work in the lock, and they discover the phone in the office missing. They find a map that shows them another exit, however it is on the other side of the house. They gather weapons, including a gun and a circular saw, before making their way through the house. They make their way to an Insane Asylum, where they find a terrified Hamadi begging for help. They try to help him, however he tells them the statue will bring their fears to life. At first they do not believe him, however Samantha reminds the others of the statue they found earlier, and that both Zane and Candice were murdered by their fear. Suddenly, the group are attacked by a scarecrow. They all flee, apart from Hamadi who is attacked by his evil dog. As they regroup after escaping, Samantha tells the others her fear is a scarecrow. Before long, a creepy grave-digger attacks the group. They escape the man, and run into another room where Samantha hears the office phone ringing. She finds the phone, but the scarecrow once again appears. Samantha, Hailey and Devon flee while Carter fights the scarecrow, but is ultimately electrocuted to death.  The remaining survivors enter a clown section, where Devon becomes separated from the others. A clown stalks him, hysterically laughing. Devon attempts to shoot the clown dead, but the girls find him and they run into a house of mirrors. As they make their way through, Hailey is attacked by the grave-keeper and dragged away from the others. She attempts to escape, but she is knocked out by the man. She awakens some time later in a coffin, the man barricading her in. While Samantha and Devon attempt to find her, they are attacked by the clown, who drags Devon off into the darkness before killing him. As Samantha finds the exit, she hears Hailey screaming for her help. Samantha decides to go back to rescue her, and manages to defeat the grave-keeper and save Hailey.  As the girls make their way to the exit, the scarecrow shows up and chases them. It catches up with them, and they manage to cut one of its arms off with the circular saw, however this breaks in the process. They run away, only for Samantha to be once more attacked. As the scarecrow is about to strangle her to death, she manages to break the statue, killing the scarecrow and allowing her and Hailey to escape The House of Fears.  As they exit the House of Fears, the statue can be seen shaking, presumably to reassemble itself.  
How to Rob a Bank
 As he tries to access an ATM to retrieve his last twenty bucks, Jason “JINX” Taylor runs into a snag – the transaction fee will overdraw him, and he cannot get his money out of the bank. Jinx fumes about this and other hidden charges which complicate his life…as we realize that he is locked in a bank vault…with the beautiful but tied-up Jessica, her apparently a hostage. But, as Jinx rails against corporations and how they stack the deck, we realize that the situation is very different from what it appears: in fact, it is Jessica, not Jinx, who is robbing the bank. She is aligned with Simon, who leads an armed team inside the branch. However, Jinx’s entry into the scenario upsets the heist, leading him and Jessica to be inadvertently locked inside the vault. In addition, Jinx has called the cops, who, led by Officer De Gepse, have surrounded the bank. Jinx makes contact with Simon by cell phone, and the situation becomes clearer, as he realizes Jessica has access to a special inside-the-vault computer and its codes…she and only she can open the vault door. Simon becomes increasingly upset when he is unable to strong-talk Jinx into getting the vault open (so the robbers can clear out the safe deposit boxes). And De Gepse is equally frustrated by the standoff, particularly when it is Jinx, not he, who seems to gain control over the situation.  As things progress, Jinx realizes that he and Jessica actually think very much alike – they both feel used – and this new kinship leads them to plot an escape. A call comes in from Nick, the true mastermind of the robbery, and Jinx and Jessica realize that Nick needs them to issue a PIN for him to access funds which have been skimmed (from fees, of course) over the course of years. With Simon increasingly unstable, Jinx is able to manipulate both him and De Gepse while also making a deal with Nick to provide a PIN (controlled by Jinx and Jessica) to go with Nick’s account information. Jinx manages to talk both cops and robbers into letting Jessica and him out, as freed hostages, and in the ensuing chaos, they slip away, to meet Nick and escape with their cut of the cash…  
The Hunting Party (2007 film)
 The film begins with a disclaimer: ''Only the most ridiculous parts of this story are true''.  After years of covering one armed conflict after another, American journalist Simon Hunt ([[Richard Gere]]) is in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in early 1994 reporting on the [[Bosnian War]]. In parallel, he has managed to romance a local [[Bosnian Muslims|Muslim]] girl who is pregnant with his child. However, in the late stages of her pregnancy, she is killed by the [[Bosnian Serbs|Bosnian Serb]] forces when they overrun her village. Upon seeing the carnage, Simon vows revenge on the Bosnian Serb political leader Dragoslav Bogdanović —known as "The Fox".  Reporting on the gruesome event later that day in a live remote link-up, Simon loses his composure at the [[News presenter|network anchor]] Franklin Harris' ([[James Brolin]]) suggestion that the Serb attack may have been a reaction to Muslim provocation attacks from inside the village. As a result of his on-air meltdown, Simon's journalistic career takes a tumble. While his professional prospects spiral downhill, those of his long-time camera man Duck ([[Terrence Howard]]) go in the opposite direction. Duck gets a cushy job at the network, while Hunt is left following war after war, as a [[freelance journalist|freelancer]], in an attempt to get back on US network television map.  In fall 2000, Duck, now a professional, travels to [[Sarajevo]] to shoot a "puff piece" of the network anchor Franklin Harris covering the fifth anniversary of the [[Dayton Agreement]], along with fresh-out-of-[[Harvard University|Harvard]] young journalist, and son of the network vice-president, Benjamin ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]). Duck runs into old buddy Simon. Once a US network star reporter, Simon is by this point, a desperate half-drunk cynic reduced to filing freelance reports for underfunded news outlets in places like [[Jamaica]] and [[Poland]].  All the while, he's looking for a story big enough to propel him back to the realm of credibility. He tells Duck that, through a source, he has located Bogdanović, who is now wanted for war crimes with a US$5 million [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on his head, and that he'd be interested in trying to score an interview with the fugitive. The Fox is assumed to be in the village of [[Čelebići (Foča)|Čelebići]] in [[Republika Srpska|Serbian entity of Bosnia]], near the border with [[Montenegro]] with various stories circulating about him, such as that he enjoys [[fox hunting]] (hence the nickname) and that the head of his security detail is a ruthless psychopath with a tattooed forehead.  Convinced by Simon, Duck comes along to shoot the interview, with Benjamin in tow. On the way, Simon confesses his plan to capture the Fox to collect the bounty — something Duck and Benjamin consider insane even to think about. Along the way, the group is mistaken for a [[CIA]] hit squad by several groups, including the [[United Nations]] police force and the Serbs themselves; at one point, at the initiative of Benjamin, they claim to be CIA agents themselves, using a threat to avoid paying a fee for a tip. Still, Boris ([[Mark Ivanir]]), the local area UN commander, puts them in touch with a woman claiming to have been romantically involved with the Fox's main bodyguard Srđan.  Simon, Duck, and Benjamin are then captured by the Fox's guards and taken to a barn to be executed where [[axe]]-wielding Srđan — who has the phrase "умро пре рођења" ('died before birth') tattooed on his forehead in Cyrillic alphabet—is preparing to kill them through torture. At the last moment, a team of CIA assassins, tipped off by Boris, storms the barn and frees the journalists, but Fox escapes. It quickly becomes evident to the journalists that, even in the international community, there are people who do not wish the Fox to be captured.  The CIA orders the journalists to board an airplane bound for the US but they run away to carry out their plan to catch the Fox. They capture him while he is hunting in the woods without his guards. The journalists then release him, with his hands securely bound, in a village called Polje filled with the surviving family members of victims of his war crimes, where he is lynched by the vengeful mob.  As the movie ends, before the closing credits, the screen goes to black and the following message is shown:  ''In theory, the official hunt for war criminals in Bosnia continues to this day...However, the two most wanted men — [[Radovan Karadžić]] and [[Ratko Mladić]], continue to elude the [[United States|U.S]], The [[United Nations]], The [[European Union]], [[NATO]], [[The Hague]] and all in the civilized world who claim to be looking for them. In the ten years that Radovan Karadžić has been on the run, he has published two books and one play Perhaps if the International Community opened a summerstock theatre...But they're probably too busy "searching" for [[Osama Bin Laden]]''.  Ratko Mladić was arrested on 26 May 2011 and Karadzic was arrested in Belgrade on 21 July 2008 and brought before Belgrade's War Crimes Court a few days later.  The film ends and is then followed by a montage of people and events seen in the movie with words such as 'really existed' flashed across the screen as various characters are shown throughout the film.  
Hwang Jin Yi (film)
 Raised as an aristocrat in 16th century [[Joseon]], an era when class status dictated one's destiny, [[Hwang Jini|Hwang Jin-yi]] discovers a shocking secret about her birth: she was born illegitimate. She therefore belongs to the lower class, and has no recourse but to give up her aristocratic status. Before embarking on the life of a [[gisaeng]], she decides to give up her virginity to a man of her own choosing, and spends her first night with Nomi, a long-time family servant, whom she is aware loves her deeply. As a gisaeng, Jin-yi becomes celebrated for her legendary beauty, wit, and talents in singing, dancing and poetry. But although she is surrounded by an entourage of noblemen showering her with gifts and admiration, she lives a solitary life of tragic isolation. Jin-yi's only solace is the game she and the local governor play on her noble clients, tricking them into exposing their hypocrisies. But when a bandit leader matching Nomi's description is spotted in the region, Jin-yi begins to question the life she endures.  
Hunting and Gathering (film)
 The film opens showing the day-to-day life of an elderly lady named Paulette. Paulette lives alone, dedicated to her animals, in particular her cats, and her garden. Her worst fear is of dying far from her home and garden. However, when she takes a fall she is sent to hospital who then advise that she recovers in a nursing-home, much to her dismay.  Meanwhile, Camille, an artist and cleaning lady, lives a lonely and anorexic life in a small attic in [[Paris]]. One day she meets the shy postcard salesman Philibert, who is in temporary custody of a grand apartment in her building. This belonged to his recently deceased aristocratic forebear, and is filled with heirlooms. Philibert has arranged his life to have as little contact with the outer world as possible. Instead he lets his lodger, Franck - who works as a low-ranked cook in a big restaurant - take care of his shopping and other such things. Philibert and Franck are complete opposites; Philibert is a gentleman, with classical interests and preoccupations, who stutters when anxious. Franck is constantly busy; brash, gruff, confrontational and confident. He works long hours at the restaurant, and habitually spends his only day off going to visit his grandmother Paulette, who raised him.  Camille reaches out to Philibert on impulse, inviting him to 'picnic' in her attic. They hit it off, but in apparent denial of her sexual potency, Camille then has her hair cropped, "manière de petit garçon". Philibert's sexual orientation at this time in the movie is also not delineated.  Camille becomes severely bedridden with the flu. Although Philibert has had only the one social contact with her, and having no reason to know how unwell she is, he feels protective towards, and worried about her. He enters her attic despite not getting any reply, finds her in a desperately weakened state, and carries her down to his apartment. When she recovers, he assumes she will stay on. This development is very unwelcome to Franck, who is permanently stressed-out by his work and destresses by drinking, playing angry punk rock, and entertaining women. The only outlet for his humanity is his care and concern towards his grandmother. Many heated arguments pass between Camille and Franck, the latter annoyed at her presence and the former finding him rude and disrepectful. This reaches a crisis when, whilst drunkenly directing an erotic dance by his latest ''nana'', he refuses to turn down the music. Camille storms out and throws his boom-box out of the window. She later rectifies the situation by buying him a replacement stereo. Franck attempts to explain his behaviour, but acknowledges he is difficult, and that he finds her presence an irritant.  The turning point comes when, determined to return to her tiny attic, Camille cannot find the key. Franck tells her that he has it in his pocket but refuses to give it back. He says it is he who should leave, asking that she stay with Philibert, who is decidedly happier and more eager to interact with others when she is around. He says he will definitely leave unless she stays.  Meanwhile, Philibert has joined a comedy club with encouragement from a woman to whom he has recently taken a very strong liking. Initially, people laugh at his stutter, however he takes classes and discovers that it disappears when he performs. Philibert later gives a show for the public, demonstrating considerable comic talent, at the start of which he proposes to his girlfriend on stage.  After a few months in respite care, Paulette is eager to return home, however she is too fragile to live alone. Camille, who has become close with the old woman, convinces Franck to let her live at Philibert's apartment, where she will quit her unsatisfactory job in order look after Paulette. Initially hesitant, Franck agrees and his grandmother moves in.  Around the same time Franck and Camille, whose relationship turned a corner after the incident with the stereo, enter a period of flirting. However, when this evolves into a sexual relationship, Camille sets the rule of not falling in love. Franck is visibly upset and withdraws emotionally from Camille, as he has already fallen in love with her.  Paulette later returns to her home for a week, with Camille resident to help out. However almost immediately she passes away, exactly as she wanted, in her beloved home. At the same time, Philibert's apartment is sold by his great-aunt and the trio break up. Camille, realising she is in love with Franck, tries to contact him, in spite of his remaining withdrawn.  After she waits for him outside his restaurant, they go out for a drink where Franck reveals he is moving to England at the end of the week. Camille suggests that he should stay in France, and buy a restaurant where they had eaten for her birthday, so he could be his own boss. Franck, sick of her tiptoeing around the central issue, asks her why she doesn't just ask him to stay (implicitly, because she loves him) to which Camille replies that she's afraid.  Later that week, Camille arrives just in time to say goodbye to Franck. Finally she is able to beg him to stay, but he replies that he has already left in his mind. Heartbroken, Camille walks out of the train station where she receives a call from Franck. He tells her he's worried that she is walking all alone, crying and lost. He pretends to be passing through customs, but in reality, unbeknownst to Camille, he has instead followed her. She denies his concerns and pretends to be OK. He shoulder-taps her and calls her bluff. The two kiss passionately, happy to be together again.  The film ends with Franck working at his restaurant, which is evidently highly popular. Franck's demeanour is entirely changed; he is no longer gruff and stressed, but personable and generous of himself. Camille, Philibert and his wife all work there as well. When Franck sees Camille admiring a baby, someone jokes about when it's her time to be a mother. In response, Franck picks Camille up and takes her out back to his office.

I Could Never Be Your Woman
  Rosie ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]), is a 40-year-old divorced mother who works as a scriptwriter and producer for a TV show ''You Go Girl''. Rosie is insecure about her age, and uses cosmetics to maintain her appearance. She has a very close relationship with her thirteen-year-old daughter, Izzie ([[Saoirse Ronan]]), which becomes even closer when she learns that she has fallen for a boy in her class named Dylan ([[Rory Copus]]).  Despite her ex-husband's urging that she start dating again, she has no man in her life. To the dismay of Rosie and David ([[David Mitchell (comedian)|David Mitchell]]), her British co-writer, her boss, Marty ([[Fred Willard]]) decides that the show may no longer cover controversial subjects, so Rosie decides to cast a new character for the show. She is taken by Adam ([[Paul Rudd]]), a bright and charming young man from one of her auditions, and decides to cast him as a new, nerdy character to fall for the character played by her arrogant and self-centered lead actress, Brianna ([[Stacey Dash]]). Adam's character is well received by test audiences, and Rosie persuades Marty to give him a chance.  As she continues to offer Izzie advice on Dylan, Rosie becomes smitten by Adam, who suggests they go out to a club together. When he comes to pick her up, Adam bonds with Izzie immediately, helping her complete a mission on a video game she was playing, in order to impress Dylan. While there, Rosie lies about her age and says that she's 36, while Adam says that he is 32. Rosie is nervous about the age difference, but when he goes onto the dance floor at the nightclub, she realizes he is as free spirited as her, and joins him. The two kiss in Adam's car, during which Rosie admits that she's actually 40, only to be startled when Adam reveals that he's actually 29.  Adam assures her that he doesn't care about their age difference at all, and the two continue their relationship. Nevertheless, Rosie's insecurity over her age begins to come out, egged on by her internal conversations with [[Mother Nature]] ([[Tracey Ullman]]), and she confesses to Adam that she is not sure that their relationship is going to work, to his confusion. Meanwhile, their relationship draws the jealousy of Rosie's secretary, Jeannie ([[Sarah Alexander]]), who begins to sabotage them by stealing Adam's gifts to Rosie, and then by stealing Adam's phone, taking a photograph of Brianna in a compromising position with it, and then putting it in Rosie's handbag, which does not succeed. Rosie continues to be nervous when she hears a recording of Adam flirting with Brianna (he had been encouraged to in order to keep her calm and the center of attention). Things become worse when Izzie has a failed double date with Dylan, and she starts to become insecure about her own appearance, something that concerns Rosie.  When Adam is first shown on television, he is an instant hit, and he starts to become famous from it. This leads to Rosie becoming even more insecure, and worrying that Adam will take advantage of his fame and start looking at younger women. Her situation worsens further when her show is unexpectedly cancelled. Shortly after, Adam is given a role in an upcoming sitcom, and she is shocked to discover a speeding ticket sent to Adam showing him in a car with Brianna. Already in a foul mood, Rosie is forced to berate Izzie when, during a chance encounter with her friend, [[Henry Winkler]], he reveals that Izzie and her friend had prank-called a number of celebrities in her phone book.  She confronts Adam with the photograph of him with Brianna, and he is shocked, having never been in a car with her before. Rosie angrily breaks up with him. Despite this, Adam makes numerous attempts to reconcile with her, including refusing to film the new sitcom he has been offered to take part in until she is named a co-producer. Meanwhile, Rosie is looking through a bloopers reel of her old show, when she realizes that it was filmed at the time that the speeding ticket claimed Adam had been driving with Brianna, and deduces that the only person who could have sent it was Jeannie. She proceeds to confront Jeannie when Marty calls her to his office to offer her a job on Adam's sitcom, and hits her in the face, reducing her to tears. She then reconciles with Adam. Later, at a school talent show, she sees Izzie has finally succeeded in winning Dylan over, and watches as the two kiss. Mother Nature reminds her that, in growing older, she is making way for a girl like Izzie to replace her.  
I Am Legend (film)
 <!-- Leave real-world perspective in place per MoS (see Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction)#Real-world perspective); Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be 400-700 words. The current version is 622 words excluding alternative ending. --> In 2009, a [[genetic engineering|genetically re-engineered]] [[measles]] [[virus]], originally created as a [[Cancer research|cure for cancer]], turns into a lethal strain which kills 90% of those it infects, mutates 9% into predatory, nocturnal and [[vampiric]] mutants, who are extremely vulnerable to sunlight, with only 1% immune. Three years after the outbreak, [[United States Army|US Army]] virologist [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Robert Neville ([[Will Smith]]) lives an isolated life in the deserted ruins of [[New York City]], unsure if any other uninfected humans are left in the world.  Neville's daily routine includes experimentation on infected rats to find a cure to the virus and venturing through [[Manhattan]] to search for food and supplies. Also awaiting for potential human survivors each day for a response to his continuous recorded radio broadcasts, which instruct any uninfected survivors to meet him at midday at the [[South Street Seaport]].  Flashbacks reveal that his wife ([[Salli Richardson]]) and daughter ([[Willow Smith]]) died in a helicopter accident during the chaotic evacuation of Manhattan, prior to the military-enforced [[quarantine]] of the island in 2009, in which Neville stays behind on the island as military personnel.  Neville's loneliness is mitigated by the companionship of his [[German Shepherd]] Samantha aka Sam (given to him by his daughter Marley as a puppy to protect him before she died in the helicopter crash), interaction with [[mannequins]] he has set up as patrons at a video store, and recordings of old television broadcasts. At night, he barricades himself and Sam inside his heavily fortified [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square Park]] home to hide from the Darkseekers. One day, while waiting for survivors, Sam follows a deer into a dark building. Neville cautiously goes in after her and finds the deer's corpse along with Sam, but the building is infested by a colony of Darkseekers. Both manage to escape unharmed and the attacking Darkseekers are killed by the sunlight.   Neville finds a promising treatment derived from his own blood, so he sets a [[Animal trapping#Snares|snare trap]] and captures a female Darkseeker from the colony building, while a male Darkseeker (termed "Alpha Male" in the script, and played by [[Dash Mihok]])<ref></ref> tries to go after them, but is blocked by the sunlight and returns to the shadows. Back in his laboratory in the basement of his house, Neville treats the female without success. The next day, he is ensnared in a trap similar to the one he used to capture the female; by the time he manages to escape, the sun is setting and he is attacked by infected dogs. Neville and Sam manage to eliminate them, but Sam is bitten in the fight. Neville injects her with a strand of his serum, but when she shows signs of infection, Neville is forced to strangle her to death. Heartbroken and driven over the edge of insanity by his dog's death, he ventures out and suicidally attacks a group of Darkseekers the next night. He kills a large number of Darkseekers but the rest overwhelm him and he is nearly killed, but is rescued by a pair of immune survivors, Anna ([[Alice Braga]]) and a young boy named Ethan ([[Charlie Tahan]]), who have traveled from [[Maryland]] after hearing one of his broadcasts. They take the injured Neville back to his home, where Anna explains that they survived the outbreak aboard a [[Red Cross]] evacuation ship from [[São Paulo]] and are making their way to a survivors' camp in [[Bethel, Vermont]]. Neville angrily argues that no such survivors' camp exists.  Neville once again attempts to administer a potential cure to the infected woman in his laboratory, but the next night, a group of Darkseekers, who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before, attacks the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute in the back of the lab. He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life, saving the cure. The next day, before dusk, Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in [[Vermont]]. They are greeted by military officers and other human survivors before Anna is shown handing the cure to military personnel.  ===Director's Cut ending===  During the lab attack, the alpha male makes a butterfly-shaped smear on the glass. Neville realizes that the alpha male is identifying the female which he was experimenting on by her butterfly tattoo and that it wants her back. Neville puts his gun down and returns the female. Neville and the alpha male stare each other down as the former apologizes to the latter. The alpha male accepts it and the Darkseekers leave. Shocked, Neville looks over the pictures of his numerous test subjects and the implications of his research methods begin to dawn on him. Neville, Anna, and Ethan then drive to the survivors' camp in Vermont with the antidote.  
I Know Who Killed Me
 The quiet suburb of New Salem is being terrorized by a serial killer who abducts and tortures young women, holding them captive for weeks before murdering them. Aubrey Fleming ([[Lindsay Lohan]]), a pianist and aspiring writer, appears to be his latest victim when she disappears during a night out with her friends. She is later seen bound and gagged on an operating table as her hands are exposed to dry ice. As the days tick by, the special FBI Task Force convened to track the killer begins to lose hope of finding him before it's too late.  Late one night, a driver discovers a young woman by the side of a deserted road, disheveled and critically injured. The girl is rushed to the hospital, where Aubrey’s distraught parents, Susan ([[Julia Ormond]]) and Daniel ([[Neal McDonough]]), wait by her side as she slips in and out of consciousness. When she is finally able to speak, she shocks everyone by claiming to be a down-on-her luck [[stripper]] named Dakota Moss, who has never heard of Aubrey Fleming. Convinced Aubrey is suffering from [[post traumatic stress disorder]], her doctors, parents, and law enforcement officials can only wait for rest and therapy to restore her memory. But after returning to her parents’ suburban home, she continues to insist she is not who they think she is, despite bearing bizarre wounds identical to those of the serial killer's previous victims, which include her hand and half of her leg cut off.  An FBI psychologist believes Dakota to be a [[Delusional disorder|delusional]] persona of Aubrey, and the agents speculate the [[persona]] is to distance and protect Aubrey from the events that happened. Examining Aubrey's [[laptop]], they discover a [[short story]] about a girl with an alter ego named Dakota. In addition, a DNA  test confirms that Dakota is Aubrey.  Unaware of this, Dakota explains away her injuries as various events that happened before she arrived in town. She begins to suspect she may be Aubrey's identical twin sister, and comes to believe her injuries are sympathetic resonance with her twin's wounds, in a stigmata-like fashion. However, Susan shows Dakota a video of her pregnancy ultrasound clearly revealing there was only one fetus in her womb. Dakota then confronts Daniel and asserts Susan's child died shortly after birth, and that Daniel took Aubrey from Virginia Sue Moss (another character from Aubrey's short story), a crack addict, leaving her with Dakota to raise alone.  Confused and terrified, Dakota starts seeing visions of a menacing figure slowly butchering his captive. One of these visions take Dakota to a nearby cemetery. After investigating the grave of Aubrey's recently murdered friend, Jennifer Toland (Stacy Lynn Gabel), Dakota finds a blue ribbon from a piano competition, with a message from Jennifer's (and Aubrey's) piano teacher, Douglas Norquist (Thomas Tofel). She is followed by Daniel, and declares "I know who killed me".  The two go, without FBI backup, to Norquist's home to confront him. Daniel heads into Norquist's house alone leaving a panicking Dakota in the car alone. Attempting to calm herself, Dakota refers to herself as Aubrey. Daniel is seemingly overpowered, and it is implied killed, by Norquist. Dakota, having entered the house, attacks Norquist in self-defense and cuts his hand off before being overpowered and tied up. Confused, Norquist asks why she has returned and exclaimed he had buried her (referencing an earlier vision Dakota had). Freeing herself, Dakota kills Norquist and heads into the nearby wood, finding where Norquist had supposedly buried Aubrey alive. Using her prosthetic hand, she smashes the front of the glass coffin that Norquist had buried Aubrey in, revealing a barely alive Aubrey. This seemingly verifying Dakota's version of events and relieved to have found her sister, Dakota lies on the ground next to her.

I Am Omega
 The film takes place in a post-apocalyptic [[Los Angeles]], which is overrun by [[zombie]]-like, [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] humans who have degenerated into a feral subspecies as the result of a genetic infection. The film does not make clear if the virus has infected the entire world, or just a small, isolated area, but it is suggested that it is global by the inability of the hero, Renchard ([[Mark Dacascos]]), to locate radio signals or contact anyone via the Internet.  Renchard has been forced to live in a daily struggle for survival against the mutants. One day, Renchard is contacted via [[webcam]] by Brianna (Jennifer Lee Wiggins), another survivor who was stranded in L.A. while trying to find Antioch, a community of survivors. She asks Renchard to help her, but Renchard, who has placed time bombs at strategic points around the city, refuses.   Two men (Geoff Meed and Ryan Lloyd) claiming to be from Antioch arrive at his home seeking his aid.  Although initially unpersuaded by their argument that Brianna carries the cure to the virus in her blood, Renchard is forced to cooperate under gunpoint. With 24 hours before the bombs are set to detonate, he leads the men into the city.  They must find and free Brianna before the mutants or the bombs can destroy them. After Renchard and Brianna flee the city and Mike (Ryan Lloyd) is killed in the sewers, Vincent (Geoff Meed) shoots Renchard and captures Brianna. He tells Renchard he did it because he liked the world the way it was and leaves him to die. After Renchard recovers his strength, he hotwires a car and chases after Vincent to save Brianna.  After finding them, Renchard kills Vincent, who was attempting to rape and kill Brianna. The bombs explode, and they both head to Antioch to make a cure. However, it is revealed that a single zombie has survived the explosion.  
I'm Not There
 ''I'm Not There'' uses a [[nonlinear narrative]], shifting between six characters in separate storylines "inspired by the music and many lives of [[Bob Dylan]]". Each character represents a different facet of Dylan's public persona: poet (Arthur Rimbaud), prophet (Jack Rollins/Father John), outlaw (Billy McCarty), fake (Woody Guthrie), "rock and roll martyr" (Jude Quinn), and "star of electricity" (Robbie Clark).  Production notes published by distributor [[The Weinstein Company]] explain that the film "dramatizes the life and music of Bob Dylan as a series of shifting personae, each performed by a different actor—poet, prophet, outlaw, fake, star of electricity, rock and roll martyr, born-again Christian—seven identities braided together, seven organs pumping through one life story."<ref name =Weinstein></ref>  ===Arthur Rimbaud=== 19 year-old [[Arthur Rimbaud]] is questioned by interrogators. His cryptic responses are interspersed throughout the film, including remarks on [[fatalism]], the nature of [[poet]]s, "seven simple rules for life in hiding", and chaos.  ===Woody Guthrie=== In 1959, an 11-year-old [[African American]] boy calling himself [[Woody Guthrie]] is [[freighthopping]] through the [[Midwestern United States]]. Carrying a guitar in a case bearing the slogan "[[this machine kills fascists]]", he plays [[blues]] music and sings about outdated topics such as [[trade union]]ism. One African American woman advises him to sing about the issues of his own time instead. Woody is attacked by [[hobo]]s and nearly drowns, but is rescued by a white couple who take him in. They are impressed with his musical talents, but Woody runs off when they receive a telephone call from a juvenile corrections center in [[Minnesota]] telling them he is an escaped fugitive. Upon learning that the real [[Woody Guthrie]] is deathly ill, Woody travels to [[New Jersey]] to visit Guthrie in the hospital.  ===Jack Rollins/Father John=== The career of [[folk music]]ian Jack Rollins is framed as a [[documentary film]], told by interviewees including folk singer Alice Fabian. Jack becomes a star of the [[Greenwich Village]] folk scene in the early 1960s, praised by fans for his [[protest song]]s. He signs to [[Columbia Records]], but in 1963, just as the [[Vietnam War]] is escalating, he stops singing protest songs and turns away from folk music, believing that neither effects real social or political change. Following the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]], Jack gets drunk at a ceremony where he is receiving an award from a civil rights organization. Remarking in his acceptance speech that he saw something of himself in Kennedy's assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], he is booed and derided by the audience. He goes into hiding, and in 1974 enters a [[bible study (Christian)|bible study]] course in [[Stockton, California]] and emerges a [[born again (Christianity)|born again Christian]], denouncing his past and becoming an ordained minister performing [[gospel music]] under the name "Father John".  ===Robbie Clark=== Robbie Clark is a 22-year-old actor who plays Jack Rollins in the 1965 [[biographical film]] ''Grain of Sand''. During filming in Greenwich Village in January 1964, he falls in love with French artist Claire, and they soon marry. ''Grain of Sand'' is a hit and Robbie becomes a star, but their relationship is strained and Claire observes Robbie flirting with other women. She is particularly offended when, during an argument in 1968 over whether the evils of the world can be changed, he opines that women can never be poets. Eventually Robbie moves out of their house, then goes to [[London]] for four months to film a [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] and has an affair with his female co-star. [[Richard Nixon]]'s January 1973 announcement of the [[Paris Peace Accords]] inspires Claire to ask for a divorce. She gains custody of their two daughters, but allows Robbie to take them on a boating trip.  ===Jude Quinn=== Jude Quinn is a popular former folk singer whose performance with a full band and [[electric guitar]]s at a [[New England]] jazz and folk festival outrages his fans, who accuse him of [[selling out]]. Travelling to London, Jude is asked by journalist Keenan Jones if he still cares about people, or thinks folk music has failed to achieve its goals of sociopolitical change. Jude is attacked by a hotel employee, hangs out with [[The Beatles]], encounters his former lover Coco Rivington, and meets poet [[Allen Ginsberg]], who suggests that Jude "sold out to God". Interviewing Jude, Keenan notes that Jude's songs are being used as recruitment tools by the [[Black Panther Party]] and opines that Jude refuses to feel deeply about anything while simultaneously being very self-conscious; Jude is offended and walks out of the interview. At a concert performing "[[Ballad of a Thin Man]]", Jude is booed and called a "[[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]" by the audience. Keenan reveals on television that, despite his claims of a rough-and-tumble vagabond past, Jude is actually Aaron Jacob Edelstein, the suburban, middle-class, educated son of a [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] department store owner.

I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry
 Chuck Levine, a womanizing bachelor, and Larry Valentine, a widower struggling to raise his two children, are two veteran [[New York City Fire Department|New York City firefighters]]. During a routine sweep of a burned building, a segment of floor collapses on Chuck, but Larry saves his life. Chuck vows to repay Larry in any way possible. Experiencing an epiphany from the incident, Larry tries to increase his life insurance policy, but he runs into difficulties naming his children as primary beneficiaries. He is told he should remarry so his new spouse can be the primary beneficiary; however, no one specifies ''whom'' he has to marry.  Inspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a [[civil union]] with him. Although Chuck declines at first, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees, entering a domestic partnership and becoming Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death. To their dismay, however, investigators arrive to inquire about their abrupt partnership, suspecting fraud. Chuck and Larry decide to enlist the help of lawyer Alex McDonough, who suggests they get married and move in together to prove they are committed; Chuck reluctantly agrees. The pair travel to [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] in [[Canada]] for a quick [[same sex marriage]] at a [[wedding chapel]] and begin living together.  At a gay benefit costume party, the partygoers are confronted by [[Homophobia|homophobic]] protesters. Chuck is provoked into punching their leader, and the incident is picked up by the local news. With their apparent homosexuality and marriage revealed, Chuck and Larry are heckled, and their fellow FDNY firefighters refuse to work with them. Their only ally is Fred G. Duncan, an angry, intimidating firefighter who [[Coming out|comes out]] to Chuck.  Chuck becomes romantically interested in Alex after the two spend time together, but finds himself unable to get close to her because she thinks he is gay. In another meeting at her apartment, Chuck and Alex are making [[charm bracelet]]s. They soon kiss, but Alex, still believing Chuck is gay and married, is shocked and immediately distances herself from Chuck. Meanwhile, city agent Clinton Fitzer arrives to investigate the couple, and the strain on both Larry and Chuck causes them to fight. Larry learns about the kiss and confronts Chuck about it, asserting that Chuck's absence is jeopardizing their ability to maintain the ruse of their relationship. During the argument, Larry reveals that he is still in love with his deceased wife, Paula, and Chuck responds that he needs to move on for the sake of his children. Later that evening, a petition circulates to have Chuck and Larry thrown out of the firehouse. Upon discovering it, a hurtful Larry confronts the crew about personal embarrassments on the job that Chuck and Larry helped them overcome. Afterwards, Chuck and Larry apologize to each other and reconcile their differences.  Eventually, numerous women publicly testify to having slept with Chuck in the recent past, and the couple is called into court to defend their marriage against charges of fraud. They are defended by Alex, and their fellow firefighters arrive in support, having realized all that Chuck and Larry have done for them over the years. Fitzer interrogates both men, and eventually demands the pair to kiss to prove that their relationship is physical. Before they do so, Chuck and Larry are interrupted by FDNY Captain Phineas J. Tucker, who reveals their marriage to be a sham and that they are both [[Heterosexuality|straight]]. He then offers to be arrested as well, since he knew about the false relationship but failed to report it. This prompts each of the other firefighters to claim a role in the wedding in a show of solidarity. Chuck, Larry, and the other firefighters are sent to jail, but they are quickly released after negotiating a deal to provide photos for an [[AIDS]] research benefit calendar, and Chuck and Larry keep their benefits.  Two months later, Duncan and Alex's brother, Kevin, are married in Niagara Falls at the same chapel as Chuck and Larry. At the wedding party, Larry moves on from the death of his wife and talks to a new woman, while Alex agrees to a dance with Chuck.

Williams]]) is working on creating a new breed of spider with several others. When a group of teen skiers arrives at the mountain, Chad ([[Noah Bastian]]) challenges Dash to a race. The two show some impressive moves as the others look on. When Dash reaches a large rocky slope, he turns back and goes down another way rather than risk a leg injury like the one that ruined his career. As Dash makes it to the bottom, he meets Dr. Sommers. While they talk for a while, Frank ([[Stephen J. Cannell]]) takes the teens inside the resort. After a brief discussion, Dr. Sommers returns to the lab, where she finds dead scientists everywhere. She finds the sole survivor cocooned in a spider web. He warns Dr. Sommers about the spiders escaping and then slowly dies. When she turns to leave, the last spider remaining at the lab, a mutated [[Latrodectus|Black Widow]], attacks her and forces her into a locked office. She finds an alarm and engages it, which alerts Professor Marks ([[David Millbern]]) and Army Captain Baker ([[Thomas Calabro]]), who are elsewhere on the mountain, to her location.  Meanwhile, back at the lodge, Dash meets up with Ranger Rick (a pun on the [[Ranger Rick|children's nature magazine]]) who asks Dash to assist him in finding two hunters who did not return to their homes. When they find the hunters' truck parked, they dismount their snowmobiles and take a look around. Dash finds a mutilated [[Elk]] and thinks it was killed by a bear. He shoots a flare to summon Rick. When Rick arrives, they find the body of one of the hunters. When they reach a huge spider web, they find the other hunter, cocooned in the web. As they turn to run, Rick is snagged by a web and is dragged to a spider that kills him as Dash watches in horror. Dash makes it back to the hunters' truck and [[Hot-wiring|hot-wires]] it to get away.  Back at the lab, Professor Marks, Captain Baker, and a squad of soldiers enter the compound and find Dr. Sommers, who tries to warn them of the danger. Inside the lab, the spider attacks and kills a soldier. Dr. Sommers steals records of the experiment and realizes Professor Marks deliberately accelerated the spiders' growth, which makes them larger, faster, and stronger; however, it also causes them great hunger and prevents the cold from killing them. Sommers was desperate to obtain sufficient amounts spider webbing for new armor ideas. She drives back to the lodge.  When Dr. Sommers meets up with Frank and Johnny, a man comes in and screams for help. Frank and Dr. Sommers watch as the spiders kill several guests, including the teens' ski coach. Frank sees the teens hiding in a shed, leads them to a bus and gets them safely inside. Chad gets the keys and drives off, crashing the bus into a snow bank and causing it to fly off of the road.  Dash returns to the hotel and helps secure it. When he and Dr. Sommers search the basement, a spider gets in and almost attacks them, but they stun it with a fire extinguisher and lock it in the basement. Back in the lobby, a spider crawls in through the chimney and kills two guests before Dash impales it with the antlers of a mounted deer head.  Meanwhile, on the crashed bus, after checking the area, Frank makes sure the kids are okay. However, one of them is unconscious and injured. They think of a way to get out as the black widow tries to get in. Eventually, Franks traps the spider and the kids escape. Frank is almost killed but is rescued thanks to the timely arrival of Captain Baker and his squad.  Back at the lodge, Dash devises a plan with Captain Baker over a radio to trap the spiders. He takes his skis and leads the spiders to a snowboard [[half-pipe]], which Baker and his men are blocking off. Johnny heads toward an avalanche cannon and waits for Dash's signal.  At the half-pipe, the spiders are captured and Dash signals Johnny, who blows the spiders up. Professor Marks, who had been opposed to killing the spiders, charges at Dash and tries to kill him. Marks falls down the side of the half-pipe to the last spider, which kills him as Baker shoots the beast.  A government agent then arrives with a group of soldiers that begin destroying all traces of the spiders. The agent demands that the survivors keep quiet about recent events and says that the "official" (that is, cover-up) explanation for what happened will be that there was a spill of hallucinogenic chemicals.

In the Name of the King
 In the previous war involving the Kingdom of Ehb, a three-year-old boy was found wandering the field of the Battle of Oxley Pass by the rancher Norick and adopted by the town of Stonebridge. While Norick could be considered his adoptive father, the child was cared for by the entire town, including the family of Basstian and Solana. His identity unknown, the boy grew up to be known as Farmer, married Solana, and was raising his first son Zeph when war suddenly struck again with a surprise attack by the Krug.  The adversary was a Magus-in-exile, Gallian, sadistic, megalomanical, and very powerful, influencing the normally primitive, almost animal-like [[Dungeon Siege#Story|Krug]] to take up arms, don armor, and fight against Ehb with a courage, intelligence, and ferocity that surprises all of the Kingdom's inhabitants. While King Konreid, Commander Tarish, and a significant proportion of Ehb's standing army surveys the damage at and seeks recruits from Stonebridge, the King's nephew Duke Fallow and Muriella allow Gallian to infiltrate the castle. Muriella's father Merick, the King's Magus is with the King at Stonebridge, and takes the liberty to investigate the matter of Farmer's true identity.  Farmer's adopted name belies his leadership and combat abilities and, in defiance of the King, he convinces Stonebridge's civilian combatants to mount a rescue mission. Gallian, via an avatar, had killed Zeph and taken Solana and other inhabitants of Stonebridge prisoner. Farmer's rescue mission goes very badly, Gallian nearly kills him because of the threat he poses (a plot device of Kings, Magi, and magical power in the movie's world.)  Farmer kills several of Gallian's avatars and escapes execution with the help of Merick, who brings him before the King to reveal his true identity as Camden Konreid, the King's son, solving a major inheritance problem: Duke Fallow is selfish and immature, poor material for royalty even if he weren't in league with Gallian.  Muriella had betrayed Ehb and her father largely by accident: she fell in love with Gallian, who proceeded to deceive and train her, stealing her power. After she realized his dark nature, she breaks off their romance, and confesses to her father Merick, who finally has an answer to another problem of his: a growing imbalance of the magical power in Gallian's favour. To offset this, the normally reclusive [[nymph]]s of [[Sedgwick Forest]], led by Elora side with Ehb against Gallian.  The King decides on a surprise attack against Gallian's advancing forces, and Duke Fallow, caught in his treachery, has only his personal guard remaining. Gallian seeks the blood of Farmer, who prevails, while Duke Fallow succeeds in mortally wounding the King, who dies after the forces of Ehb force Gallian to retreat. Farmer's brief battlefield coronation surprises everyone except Gallian, and he decides to press to the attack all the way to Gallian's keep the following day.  Farmer leads a small force consisting of Merick, Muriella, and Elora through mountains to Gallian's back door. The main force led by Tarish and escape efforts led by Norick and Basstian keep Gallian busy, even as he interrogates Solana. Gallian's magical sense for royal blood reveals to him that Solana is pregnant with Farmer's second child, and because of his preoccupation with this, she is able to join in the final battle between Gallian and Farmer's infiltration team. Elora is not able to enter, while Gallian kills Merick and defeats Muriella's magic; Solana and Farmer kill Gallian together. With his magical influence gone, Gallion's avatars vanish and the Krug immediately revert to their natural disposition, retreating from Tarish's hard-pressed forces. The royal couple, still in their peasants' clothes, are then happily reunited.  
In the Land of Women
  Carter Webb ([[Adam Brody]]) is a young, soft-core writer living in [[Los Angeles]] whose young, starlet girlfriend Sofia ([[Elena Anaya]]) breaks up with him. Carter pleads with her to stay, but she leaves.  When Carter goes to his mother's home in order to reclaim an item, he sees his mother crying in the living room. She explains that her mentally unstable mother, Phyllis ([[Olympia Dukakis]]), claims that she is dying – though her doctor cannot find anything fatal. Carter's mother tells him that she will be leaving for [[Michigan]] to take care of Phyllis. Carter offers to take his mother's place as caregiver for his grandmother, explaining that he wanted to get out of the life he was currently living and write a biographical story he has been working on for the past eleven years. Though his mother objects to this decision, he ignores her and flies to Michigan.  Outside, Carter finally arrives. He knocks on the door with a cheerful remark, and Phyllis, obviously forgetting her own grandson, slams the door on him. After a quick negotiation, she lets him inside. Phyllis reveals that she has been starving herself the past three weeks, and Carter sees that all of the food in her home has gone stale. After a few brief phone calls with his mother and his boss, Carter begins to clean up his grandmother's home.  Meanwhile, Paige ([[Makenzie Vega]]) and Lucy ([[Kristen Stewart]]) Hardwicke, who live across the street from Phyllis, are returning from school. Lucy's mother, Sarah ([[Meg Ryan]]), calls Lucy to the kitchen. She hesitantly tells Lucy that she has found a lump in her breast, a possible sign of [[breast cancer]], and is to see a doctor in the coming days. Lucy, shocked, wants to come with her mother when she receives her results, but Sarah quickly refuses.  When Carter takes out the trash, Lucy, who is smoking on her roof, watches him. He drops the trash, and Lucy begins to snicker; hearing her laughter, Carter turns toward her, and she hides in the shadow of the roof. Sarah hears the noise and comes outside with her dog, Bozo, and warmly introduces herself to Carter. They have a brief talk before Lucy's friends arrive loudly down the road and Sarah goes back inside. Lucy and Carter meet, and she asks Carter not to tell her parents that she smokes. He agrees, and takes a cigarette from her before she leaves.  The next morning, Sarah arrives at Carter's doorstep, bringing cookies and offering for him to walk with her. They walk around the neighborhood, talking about their lives. Carter eventually mentions Sofia, wondering about his love for her. Carter thinks about his relationship, and decides that it really wasn't true love. He explains that he has written love letters for Sofia, pouring out his affection in these epistles. Carter believes that the letters contain his best work.  After Sarah returns home, she sees that Carter is heartbroken and needs someone to take his mind off Sofia. She asks Lucy to ask Carter out on a date. Lucy bitterly refuses, calling it "lame" to ask someone out from across the street that she doesn't even know. Sarah's husband agrees and Sarah abruptly leaves the room, frustrated. She goes to her bathroom, filling a small cup of medicine to subdue her pain. Her husband follows her, trying to assuage the situation by insisting that Lucy will apologize and ask Carter on a date.  The next day, Carter decides to go on a run. While running, he has flashbacks of all the memorable times he had with Sofia: their meeting, their first kiss, and so on, until it finally leads to the breakup. When she utters the word "goodbye" once more, Carter runs into a tree and passes out. When he wakes up, he sees Lucy standing over him. She gives him a ride home and then asks him out. Carter tells her to ask her parents if they would allow her to take him out on a school night, as they normally would not. Lucy, confused, agrees, and goes back inside.  Shortly thereafter, Sarah invites Carter on another walk. This time, she leads him into a small patch of forest. She admits that her husband is having an affair and that she does not love him – at least not the way Carter loved Sofia. They hug and leave to run errands together. They share an awkward moment of both having something to say to the other; Carter begins with the declaration that Sarah's husband is "out of his mind". Sarah smiles, and dismisses what she has to say. Eventually, the two deepen their friendship and later, when she tells him she is sick, they kiss each other.  Carter also goes to the movies with Lucy and Paige. He finds out that Sofia has been dating [[Colin Farrell]]. Afterward, Lucy brings Carter to a football field because he was curious about the typical high school experience. There she confesses that she is sort of dating the high school quarterback Gabe, who is arrogant and cocky, but that they have not kissed yet. They also talk about Gabe's best friend Eric who seems to be the opposite of Gabe; soft and shy. She also confesses that she knows her father is having an affair, but believes her mother does not know.  She claims to be more upset with her mother than her father because her mother is cold and more interested in her image than the truth. Lucy later finds out that Gabe could not wait for Lucy and hooked up with her best friend. She convinces Carter to come to a party with her because he is older and mysterious. During the party, Gabe tries to fight Carter, but Eric steps in saying that Gabe is the one who screwed up. After the party, Carter and Lucy share a kiss which Sarah sees. She tells Carter to leave Lucy alone and to never speak to them again. Afterwards, he slips her a letter.  Lucy goes to see Carter who tells her that he is not the guy for her and that if she thought about it, she would realize that she would know who is. Sarah gets her cancer treatments and it is revealed that everything will be all right. Sarah and Lucy talk and start to heal their relationship. As Lucy drives home from the hospital, she stops to see Eric who she realizes is the guy Carter was referring to. Sarah finally reads Carter's letter which, though similar to a love letter, winds up being more of a "thank you" note.  Carter comes downstairs to find his grandmother has died but does not immediately call the hospital. Instead, he goes outside for some air and meets up with Sarah. She apologizes and they are able to end their friendship on good terms.  The story closes with Carter back in LA at the diner where Sofia broke up with him. He is writing, presumably a script, about his grandmother. He talks to the waitress and seems to be getting on with his life without Sofia.  
In the Shadow of the Moon (film)
 The film follows the manned missions to the [[Moon]] made by the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  The documentary reviews both the footage and media available to the public at the time of the missions, as well as [[NASA]] films and materials which had not been opened in over 30 years.  All of this has been sourced and [[remaster]]ed in [[high-definition video|HD]] by the stock footage company [[Footagevault]].  Augmenting the archival audio and video are contemporary interviews with some surviving [[apollo program|Apollo]] era [[astronaut]]s, including [[Alan Bean|Al Bean]], [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], [[Buzz Aldrin]], [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]], [[David Scott]], [[Charlie Duke]], [[Eugene Cernan]] and [[Harrison Schmitt]].  The former astronauts have the only speaking roles in the movie, although occasional supplementary information is presented on screen with text and archival television footage presents the words of journalists such as [[Jules Bergman]] and [[Walter Cronkite]]. The only surviving moon walker at the time not to participate was [[Neil Armstrong]], the first person to set foot on the Moon.  The documentary shares its name with a [[In the Shadow of the Moon (book)|book]] by space historians [[Colin Burgess (author)|Colin Burgess]] and [[Francis French]], and both include many original interviews with Apollo lunar astronauts. The documentary offers a view of the Apollo program that is complementary to the book and is neither a source nor a tie-in.  
In the Valley of Elah
 The film tells the story of [[military police]] veteran Hank Deerfield ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]), his wife Joan ([[Susan Sarandon]]) and their search for their son Mike ([[Jonathan Tucker]]). A soldier recently returned from [[Iraq]], Mike has suddenly gone missing.  Deerfield's investigation is aided by a police detective ([[Charlize Theron]]), who becomes personally involved in the case.  Mike's body is eventually found, dismembered and burned. Military officials initially attempt to block the police investigation; they suggest Mike's death was due to drug-related violence. His platoonmates who last saw him lie to Deerfield and the police. Deerfield tells the police that although he suspects the soldiers are lying about something, he believes they could not have killed their comrade.  It turns out that Deerfield is wrong. The soldiers had killed and dismembered Mike after a seemingly insignificant quarrel. The soldier who confesses to Deerfield and the police seems emotionally detached from his words and actions, apparently to suggest he suffers [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] from events of the war.

Before he can kill Chadhri, a group of police officers led by Phil appear and shoot him dead. Phil is reunited with Gina and Stacey, who tell him that Brian and Geraldine are dead. They also tell the police officers that John is still trapped inside, and he is then seen being attacked by spiders.  Some time later, Gina is seen back in the village. She is visited by Chadhri, whom she tells that Stacey is getting better. He tells her that while John has not been found, he and the other officers are working around the clock to find him. However, John is shown completely encased in spider webs before the film ends.  
Interview (2007 film)
 Pierre Peders (Buscemi) is a tough political correspondent infuriated by his editor's insistence he cover a tabloid-level story about the [[paparazzi]] favorite Katya (Miller). Pierre's chagrin increases given the news of a searing [[White House]] [[scandal]] that is just breaking; instead of covering the piece, Peders must visit a posh [[Manhattan]] restaurant and interview Katya, whom he instantly detests. The one-on-one is more of a disaster than either could have predicted, but by some strange twist of fate, Pierre is injured and brought back to Katya's [[loft]]. Once there, [[liquor]] is downed, [[cocaine]] is consumed, minor violence erupts, and the two begin to "dance a [[pas de deux]]" &mdash; attempting, not so subtly, to outmaneuver one another psychologically, as dark secrets and long-hidden vulnerabilities emerge.  Katya teases Peders into kissing her, which Peders passionately does, but as her cell phone rings and reality reasserts itself, Katya demands that he stop. Peders is exasperated and complains that she doesn't let him finish what she starts, unlike the male [[prostitute]] he once visited. During another of Katya's phone calls, Peders uses Katya's [[laptop]] and opens a folder containing what he believes is Katya's [[diary]]. He is able to barely conceal his surprise when Katya eyes him suspiciously, by saying he is merely [[Googling]] her, as per an earlier suggestion by her.  When Katya's attention returns to her phone call, Peders e-mails a particularly expressive and emotional diary passage to himself. Later, unable to forget what he had read, Peders betrays his snooping by asking Katya what has made her lose hope. After an emotional outburst about her loss of privacy, she admits that she has [[cancer]]. At this, Peders is immediately contrite about the way he has been treating her. He learns that no one knows about Katya's illness; she feels that saying it aloud will make it more "real".  Peders promises not to reveal the truth about her health; Katya demands that Peders reveal something about himself in return.  As Katya films the confession with a [[camcorder]], Peders admits that, as a reporter, he has made up stories and sources, and that he essentially caused his [[alcoholic]] former wife's death. (He took his time responding to her distress call to him - by the time he arrived, she was already dead.) Katya swaps out the camcorder tape when Peders is unaware, and a while later, Peders attempts to do the same.  On a clandestine phone call to his editor, Peders - against his promise to Katya - tells him that Katya has cancer.  Peders leaves Katya's loft, and as he is walking outside, she calls him on his cell phone.  Katya reveals that not only did she lie about having cancer, (the diary Peders believed was hers was actually the diary of the character she played) but she has Peders' confessional tape. She inquires whether she should send it to his editor first or the police.  Peders smugly retorts that he swapped the tape first; Katya disagrees and says he only has her rehearsal tape. The movie ends with Peders and Katya watching their tapes - Peders wearing a sullen expression. Katya sips a glass of [[wine]] while watching Peders' confessional tape, but it is unknown if she will follow through with her threat.

Months later on Christmas Eve, Sarah is making final preparations for her delivery the following day. Still reeling from her husband's death, Sarah is now moody and depressed.  That evening, a mysterious woman arrives at Sarah's door, asking to use the telephone to call for help. Sarah lies that her husband is sleeping and she does not want to be disturbed, but the woman tells her that she knows that he is dead. When the visitor persists on coming in, Sarah, a professional photographer, attempts to take her photo through a window and telephones the police.  When they arrive, the woman has already vanished. The police assure Sarah that she will be fine, but arrange to have a patrol car visit throughout the night.  Upon developing her photos, Sarah recognizes the woman in the background of an earlier photo she had taken, indicating she was stalking Sarah. Sarah telephones her employer, asking to have the photos enhanced. As she goes to bed, the woman arrives in the bedroom, awakening Sarah with scissors puncturing her pregnant belly. Sarah fights the visitor off and locks herself in the bathroom, where the woman tries to gain entry. The woman makes clear that her intentions are to take Sarah's child for herself.  Sarah's employer arrives, and not knowing what Sarah's mother looks like, takes the strange woman's word that she is the mother. Later her actual mother arrives, arousing the employer's suspicion.

The woman flees, and upon being cornered by Sarah, reveals her identity; she was the other driver in Sarah's car accident and, being pregnant at the time, had lost her child.  The two are interrupted by the revival of one of the police officers; having been shot in close proximity by the woman with his [[flexible baton round|riot gun]], he survived the attack but was disoriented and blinded. In his current state of mind, he confuses Sarah with her attacker and brutally beats her in the stomach with his club. The woman comes to Sarah's aid and kills the officer, but it is too late; Sarah has begun to give birth and the baby is stuck.  Desperate to save the child, the woman proceeds to perform the impromptu [[Caesarean section]] on Sarah with her scissors as she originally planned. With Sarah lying dead on the stairs, drenched in blood, the woman, having been successful with her delivery, sits on a rocking chair and comforts the newborn child.

Annie's closest friends are a few violent thieves, and her boyfriend, Marcus, is on parole for similar violations.  Nick tells Pete about his plans to leave for London and they say goodbye. Annie decides to rob a jewelry store across the street from where Marcus is stealing a car. Marcus reprimands her, and tries to take the jewels for himself, but Annie keeps them and pushes him to try and stop her. Believing Annie is out of control, Marcus tips off the cops. Annie is arrested and assumes that Pete is responsible because he saw her load the merchandise into her locker.  She later attempts to beat a confession out of Pete.

The Invasion (film)
 After the [[space shuttle]] ''Patriot'' crashes on Earth, a fungus-like alien lifeform is discovered on the remaining parts scattered over U.S. territory. Once people come into contact with the organism, they are controlled by it when they enter [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]. One of the first people infected is Tucker Kaufman, a [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] director investigating the crash.  Tucker's ex-wife, psychiatrist Carol Bennell, begins to feel something is amiss when people seem to have "changed". Her patient, Wendy Lenk (played by [[Veronica Cartwright]], who appeared in the 1978 film version as Nancy Bellicec), describes how her husband "is not her husband", and one of her son's friends acts detached and emotionless.   At a neighborhood [[Halloween]] party, Carol's son Oliver finds a "skin" on a partier which is initially believed to be costume makeup. Carol speculates that the skin may be an organism connected to reports of a fast-spreading flu. Carol takes the organism to her doctor friend Ben Driscoll to have it checked. Carol attends a friendly dinner meeting between Russian diplomat Yorish and Czechoslovakian diplomat Belicec (along with female companion Luddie) and discusses her [[postmodern feminism]] views over caviar and champagne. Meanwhile, Tucker uses the CDC to spread the disease further, disguising the spores as flu vaccine.  Ben and Dr. Stephen Galeano, a biologist, discover how the spore takes over the brain during REM sleep. During this investigation, Luddie calls Ben, worried about Yorish's behavior. Driscoll and Galeano also find that people who had brain-affecting illnesses, such as [[encephalitis]] or [[Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis|ADEM]], are immune to the spore because their previous illnesses prevents the spore from "latching on" to the brain matter. Carol's son, Oliver, is immune to the spore because of the ADEM he had as a young child. Carol decides to get her son, who might show a way to a cure, back from Tucker. Before she drives to Tucker's house, she joins Ben's team who is called to the house of the Belicecs, the Czech ambassador and his wife, in a case of emergency. There they witness the transformation of Yorish, the Russian ambassador and the Belicecs' friend.  When Carol arrives at Tucker's house, he and several colleagues close in on her. He explains that the changed humans, devoid of irrational emotions, are offering a better world, and asks her to join them. When Carol resists, he holds her to the ground and infects her by spurting his saliva on her. She escapes and returns to Ben at the Belicecs' house. They flee when Belicec returns with more transformed people intent on infecting anyone in the house.   Galaneo and one of his assistants head to a base outside Baltimore where they and other scientists attempt to find a cure for the alien virus. Carol and Ben separate to find Oliver, who texts his location, the apartment of Tucker's mother, to Carol.  Finally, Ben arrives, but Carol realizes that he too has become one of the infected. He successfully seduces her to give in to the new society, but also frankly states that there is no room for people like Oliver who are immune. Carol shoots Ben in the leg and flees with Oliver.  She is picked up by helicopter and flies to the center preparing the inoculations. In time, the alien virus is reversed and society reverts to its non-violent ways.

In December 1991, McCandless arrives at [[Slab City, California|Slab City]], in the [[Imperial Valley]], and encounters Jan and Rainey again. There, he also meets Tracy Tatro, a teenage girl who shows interest in McCandless, but he rejects her because she is underage. After the holidays, McCandless decides to continue heading for Alaska. One month later, camping near [[Salton City, California|Salton City]], McCandless encounters Ron Franz, a retired man who recounts the story of the loss of his family in a car accident while he was serving in the [[United States Army]]. He now occupies his time in a workshop as an amateur leather worker. Franz teaches McCandless the craft of leatherwork, resulting in the making of a belt that details McCandless' travels. After spending two months with Franz, McCandless decides to leave for Alaska, despite this upsetting Franz, who has become quite close to McCandless. On a parting note, Franz gives McCandless his old camping and travel gear, along with the offer to adopt him as his grandchild, but McCandless simply tells him that they should discuss this after he returns from Alaska.  Four months later, at the abandoned bus, life for McCandless becomes harder, and he begins to make poor decisions. As his supplies begin to run out, he realizes that nature is also harsh and uncaring.

Invisible Target
 An armoured truck carrying $100 million of cash is attacked by a criminal gang who call themselves the "Ronin Gang" with explosives as it stops at a [[traffic junction]] in front of a jewellery shop. All the security guards are shot dead except one, while responding police officers suffer serious casualties under the gunfire of the heavily armed gang members. The explosions also kill several civilians, including a lady in the shop. Six months later, the same gang reappears in Hong Kong, injuring a group of policemen, two critically, during a spot check. The dead woman in the jewellery shop is [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] detective Chan Chun's fiancée, while the injured [[Police officer|policemen]] are led by Trainee Inspector Carson Fong Yik-wai. Both officers vow revenge on the criminal gang.  Wai King-ho is a rookie cop whose older brother, Wai King-tat, also a police officer, has been missing for an extended period of time. Deeply upset by police allegations that his brother has become part of the criminal gang while undercover, he is suspended from duty due to his connection to his now wanted brother, and later confronted by both Chan and Fong who demand his brother's whereabouts. They form an alliance after Wai is rescued by Chan and Fong in a fight at a [[nightclub]]. Little Tiger, one of the gang members, is captured by Chan and is forced to lead the police to the gang's hideout. The gang appears and kills Tiger after a chase, while injuring Chan and several of his colleagues.  It turns out that the surviving security guard is Ho Wing-keung, the manager of the security company, who colluded with the gang to rob the armoured truck. He is tracked down by the gang to a [[psychiatric hospital]], where he feigned a mental breakdown to escape detection by the gang. Chan, Fong and Wai arrive at the hospital, but fail to stop his escape with the gang, which threatened his family to force him out. As the three pursue the gang, they run into an accident scene, where the gang shoots several police officers, hijacks a mini-bus with young children, and takes Wai as a hostage in the bus. Chan and Fong go after the bus with Ho in another car.  The gang members and the police officers engage in a lengthy confrontation, in which Wai's brother is revealed as an undercover cop; he is killed by gang member Ronin Tien Yeng-yee. Ho is killed by Tien Yeng-seng, Wai is left handcuffed to the bus with the children and a timed bomb, while Chan and Fong are forced to collect the stolen cash from the robbery's mastermind at a funfair at [[Tamar site|Tamar]] while chained to another timed bomb. Wai manages to free himself and rescue all the children, but discovers that the bomb is fake, suggesting that Ronin had no intention of harming the children. Chan and Fong approach a man with a luggage bag at the funfair as instructed, but the man turns out to be Chief Inspector Sam, who is leading an operation to nab the gang. Chan and Fong take Sam hostage and manage to free themselves from the bomb, while explodes harmlessly in a tent. In a secluded area, Chan and Fong explain their situation to Sam. It is then revealed that Sam is also colluding with the mastermind, and when he pulls a gun on Chan and Fong, the two throw him over a railing, killing him. Chan and Fong become suspects for the murder.  With the help of Fong's girlfriend Leung Hoi-lam from the Police Intelligence Department, Chan and Fong realise that the real mastermind is Senior Superintendent Cheung Man-yiu, who has orchestrated the armoured truck robbery, double crossed the gang, resulting in the death of three of their members, and made off with the loot, which he keeps hidden in a car in the Police Headquarters car park. The remaining four members of the criminal gang arrive at the Headquarters in a police van masquerading as police officers to get the money back, just before the arrival of Chan, Fong, and Wai. Senior Superintendent Mark Law Pui-keung begins to learn about the truth from data provided by Leung.  An extended showdown at the Police Headquarters ensues, resulting in the deaths of three criminals, multiple policemen including a [[Special Duties Unit]] squad, and Wai, who is beaten to death by Tien. Chan and Fong almost kill Tien in revenge, but at the last minute realise their duty as a police officer is to arrest, not kill. Cheung throws a bag of grenades, killing Tien in the explosion (along with the remaining money) while Chan and Fong escape with Wai's body. Cheung is later led to an ambulance by unsuspecting officers. He is subsequently shot dead by Chan and Fong when he tries to kill Law in another ambulance. Law lets Chan and Fong go, and they return to their police duties, but as a detective and a beat cop respectively. They also help take care of Wai's grandmother.  
The Irony of Fate 2
 The characters from the first film now have children who have managed to get into the same situation as their parents many years ago. However, the story is not simply a remake of the original movie. All of the adventures in the previous film were accidental, but here everything is done according to a plan thought up by Pavlik, a friend of Evgeniy Lukashin.  Pavlik's idea is to help his friend Evgeniy with his loneliness so he dispatches Lukashin's son to St. Petersburg, where he acts in the same manner as his father 30 years ago. In flat 12, he meets Nadezhda, who is actually the daughter of Nadezhda from the first film. She has a fiancé called Irakliy, a businessman. Kostantin's task is to lure Irakliy away from the flat and then wait for Nadezhda's mother to come; he then makes her call Evgeniy Lukashin. Pavlik persuades Evgeniy to go to St Petersburg.  The plot becomes a story of two fights over a woman: Konstantin vs. Irakliy and Evgeniy vs. Ippolit. In the end Lukashin overcomes the competition because Irakliy turns out to be too tedious for Nadya, and Nadezhda understands that she was never truly in love with Ippolit.

The next morning, Melissa goes about her day but as time passes, slowly becomes aware that those around her have changed since the meteorites fell. It's as if their minds are no longer their own. For example, Melissa's supervisor Samantha seduces her into a passionate [[Lesbianism|lesbian]] encounter, even though Samantha had never shown any signs of being a lesbian.  Melissa soon realizes that the townsfolk have been replaced by a race of aliens known as [[Pod People (Invasion of the Body Snatchers)|Pod People]].

Intimate Enemies (2007 film)
 The film is set in 1959 during the [[Algerian War]]. Lieutenant Terrien ([[Benoît Magimel]]), an inexperienced and naïve junior [[French Army]] officer, has volunteered for active service, rather than a safe staff post in [[Algiers]].  He is posted to [[Kabylie]], a remote and mountainous region of [[Algeria]], as a replacement for Lieutenant Constantin (Hicham Hlimi) who was killed during a ‘[[friendly fire]]’ incident commanding a [[counter-insurgency]] ambush operation – i.e. he was accidentally killed by his own side during a confused fire-fight. The war in Algeria is much more complicated than Lieutenant Terrien anticipated as he takes over command of his new platoon at the outpost "Mazel". Within hours of taking over his new command Terrien is ordered to lead a ‘locate and destroy’ mission into the ''zone interdite'' (the 'Forbidden Zone') to find a [[World War II]] French Army veteran named Slimane, now a local commander of Algerian rebels trying to win the independence of their homeland. Slimane is never seen in person during the film.  When the [[Fellagha]] (Algerian insurgents) massacre the population of a local village in retaliation for a patrol visit from Terrien’s platoon, on the assumption that the villagers may have collaborated with the French, Terrien vows to remain calm and professional despite the appalling horrors that greet him. Terrien saves a young boy from drowning in the village well and is gradually forced to see the conflict through the eyes of that child: a child who temporarily adopts the French soldiers almost as a surrogate family. Terrien’s determination to remain detached, professional and controlled despite the atrocities that occur around him, including the [[torture]], abuse and [[summary execution]] of Algerian prisoners, quickly gains him the initial contempt of Sergeant Dougnac ([[Albert Dupontel]]) his combat-hardened and cynical platoon sergeant, who has come to the conclusion that the level of violence employed by the Fellaghas can only be countered by [[Torture during the Algerian War|equally brutal measures]] applied by the French.  The blooding of the young Lieutenant and the way in which he reacts to his newfound knowledge and experience provides the dramatic arc of ''L’Ennemi intime''. Terrien’s idealistic view of French involvement in Algeria is summed up during a conversation with Captain Berthaut (Marc Barbé), an intelligence officer, when Terrien argues that as metropolitan French citizens the Algerians should enjoy the same political rights as any other French citizen and states that “You can’t fight barbarism with barbarism”.  Berthaut, identified as a former member of the [[French Resistance]] who was tortured by the [[Gestapo]], a veteran of the [[First Indochina War|French Indochina War]] and an old comrade-in-arms of Dougnac, disagrees and later in the film, states that, “At 110 volts the truth always comes out”. Berthaut is killed and mutilated during a Fellaghist ambush as he attempts to evacuate a wounded soldier out of the ‘Forbidden Zone’ by jeep. Later, French soldiers (Terrien among them) retaliate by massacring and burning an entire village. In view of such atrocities, Terrien slowly begins to change his view.  Dougnac, identified within the film as a veteran of [[French Indochina]], is a complicated character who is not averse to resorting to torture and barbarism when it comes to dealing with insurgents yet is capable, professional and increasingly privately respectful of Terrien as an officer and as a man. Their professional differences and the harsh realities of operations in the field, however, drive the two men to breaking point with Dougnac finding release through alcohol and at least one instance of self-inflicted torture. Such are the pressures on Dougnac that he finally snaps and deserts the army. Lost in an undeclared, and dirty, war, Terrien and Dougnac discover that their worst enemy is often themselves.  
It's a Free World...
 Angie (Kierston Wareing), a young woman frustrated after being fired from her thirtieth dead-end job, decides to set up a [[employment agency|recruitment agency]] of her own, running it from her kitchen with her friend and flatmate Rose (Juliet Ellis).  Angie is able to build a successful business, while also dealing with a neglected son who gets in trouble at school and parents who disapprove of her venture. She also has to keep reassuring Rose that they will become legitimate once the business is on a firm financial footing - they do not have a licence, but Angie at least insists on only hiring workers with papers, not [[Illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]].  Meanwhile, Angie becomes romantically involved with Karol (Lesław Żurek), an English-speaking Pole who is in the same predicament as those Angie recruits. She also helps Mahmoud, his wife and two young daughters, much to Rose's distress. Mahmoud has been ordered deported, but he has gone into hiding to avoid a likely jail sentence back home in Iran.  Despite Rose's misgivings, Angie becomes increasingly eager to do whatever it takes to build the business. When Angie anonymously informs the government about a camp of immigrants, that is the final straw for Rose. She quits.  Disaster strikes when one employer refuses to pay twenty of Angie's workers the £40,000 they are owed. They blame her, and some of them take drastic action. They first kidnap her son Jamie (Joe Siffleet), then tie her up. After searching her flat, they take her profits (about a quarter of what they are due) and leave, but not before warning her that they want the rest or she will never see her son again. Soon after, Jamie shows up, unaware that the "policemen" he was talking to were fake. In the final scene, Angie abandons her scruples completely; she travels to the Ukraine to knowingly recruit illegal workers, offering to obtain forged papers for them.  
İş Bank commercial featuring Atatürk
 The commercial features a dialogue between a young boy and Atatürk working in a [[rose garden]]. A thorn pricks Atatürk's finger. The boy asks how a thorn ''can'' prick Atatürk's hand. Atatürk replies with the question: "can it not prick?" The boy further asks how Atatürk's hand ''can'' bleed. Atatürk replies with the question: "can it not bleed?" Shocked, the boy inquires whether he isn't Atatürk? Atatürk replies that he is indeed Atatürk. The boy, still shocked, replies "but...". Atatürk interrupts and explains that if one is going to grow a rose, one will suffer pain, one's hand will bleed, sun will make one sweat, there will be people putting to the gardener that the roses in the garden will never die, and that there will be people confronting the gardener on how a rose is supposed to be grown. Atatürk continues by saying that the boy should be asking him just one question: "Do I want to make this place a rose garden? Do I want to grow the world's most beautiful roses in this garden?" Atatürk further adds that if the boy really wishes it to be so, "he wouldn't care about neither the thorns that prick nor the words said". Atatürk continues by saying that whoever it might be, all he would care about is the scent of the rose garden. Atatürk concludes by asking, whether the boy understood the lesson and the boy acknowledges this. The commercial concludes with the statement "We respectfully commemorate Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of our country and bank".<ref name="Haberturk"/>  
It's Breaking News
  It is believed that 'Media' is the fourth pillar of democracy. Journalism began as a mission, then a service and now merely a profession – a complete business where a struggle is not to get right news but rather to 'generate' one crammed with glamour and sensation.  The film endeavors to uncover the darker side of the famous or infamous sting operations where a news correspondent (Vidya) falls in the 'chakravyu' of the whole business and finally paves her way out to yet another 'chakravyu'. The film narrates the story of a girl who initially is acknowledged when she is one among the corrupt system and discarded and criticized when she starts rebelling. Vidya is a young, dynamic, self-motivated news correspondent, who has just come out of a journalism course and is all charged to take up confrontations of this profession. But, little did she know that it is not as effortless job as it is perceived. Vidya initially is covering the entertainment beat and is quiet contended with her piece of work. But due to certain shuffles she is forced to quit entertainment and cover crime, which she presumes as not her cup of tea. Gradually, she gets a knack of it and starts getting addicted to the thrill and ecstasy of the job. She gets a brilliant story for her channel all the way from Rajasthan along with her teammates which actually boosts the TRP ratings of the channel and also her morale. In the process, or rather, in the quest for the thrill, she even tries to fool around with the so-called ethics and codes of journalism by creating situations to get a story for her channel.  One day she receives a call, that later changes her overall approach towards this profession. It is a call from a girl, Sangeeta, from Pune, who is a victim of repeated sexual abuses by the high designators of the local Police. Vidya, with her team chalks out a plan for yet another sting and is ready to cover the event where the SP is assaulting Sangeeta. But unfortunately it is the DIG who falls prey to their sting. The whole episode of 'live rape' disconcerts Vidya and her cameraman Rafiq to an extent that they feel ashamed to be merely a spectator in this profession where they couldn't even save the victim. But this event is not less than a celebration to the news channel where this 'Breaking news' will be their USP. Vidya has promised Sangeeta that this footage will not be telecast but rather be kept for her defense in court. Unfortunately, Vidya is traumatized to see the telecast of the whole footage 'as it is' in her news channel irrespective of her caution to the editor. Bugged with the whole system, she leaves for her Uncle's place who had been insisting her to visit his small press. There she apprehends the genuine power and nuance of journalism and gets the spur to fight back the system. With her, is a close friend Bala (a crime correspondent in rival channel), Rafiq (the cameraman) and Trishna (her batch mate in journalism course) who differ in their ideologies and yet are together. This is the time when she gets emotionally attached to the whole ball game and decides to give the victim Justice. In her fight for justice she faces all the ups and downs but all in vain leaving Vidya in utter despair and gloom.  The USP of the film is in exposing reality with certain humorous incidence that occurs within the news channels. From the agitated talk shows to shoving the mike in the mouth of a kissing couple in a park and asking 'what is your take on right to privacy' is being presented in a unique style.  
The Island (2007 film)

At the start of the film, we witness the death of the old 'Kabir el Gezira' (the island's ruler), leaving the land to his son Mansour. The first half follows Mansour as he takes control of his land and must deal with a band of other drug lords who are greedy to take control of the island. The second half of the film deals with the political conflict. It follows the government's side of things (which finally decides to take action) at the same time as Mansour's side, as the two react to each other's threats and the conflict escalates

Itty Bitty Titty Committee
 Anna has been rejected by her college, her girlfriend broke up with her, and her big sister is getting married. She meets Sadie, who invites her to join Clits In Action, or C(i)A, a [[Far-left politics|radical]] [[Third-wave feminist]] group. Anna soon gets in touch with her political side.<ref name="AfterEllen.com">[http://www.afterellen.com/movies/2007/5/ittybitty Review of "Itty Bitty Titty Committee" by Danielle Riendeau] </ref> She takes part in illegal activism with the group and becomes more aggressive in her daily life.  Anna starts falling for Sadie, who has been involved for years with an older woman named Courtney. Courtney works with a more mainstream feminist organization and disagrees with the C(i)A's method of creating awareness through public art, which usually involves vandalism.  The group travels to take part in a [[gay marriage]] protest – instead of being for or against it, they argue that marriage is the wrong goal, as it is an institution rooted in sexism. Despite being warned by another member of the C(i)A, Meat, that Sadie uses people, Anna shares a night of passion with her while they stay in a hotel. At the rally the next day, the outspoken Shulamith ends up nearly coming to blows with a protester. The fight is caught by a local news crew and the group's message is misconstrued as violent and [[homophobia|homophobic]]. Meat also reveals that their website – which they considered the center of their activism – has not received hits from anyone besides themselves.  C(i)A attempts to have a meeting at Courtney's home, but personal conflicts come to a head. Anna believes Sadie is going to leave Courtney to be with her, but Sadie remains dependent on her partner. Meat and Shulamith announce that they're giving up on the group, Sadie stays behind with Courtney, and Aggie (a [[transgender]] man who's part of the C(i)A) comforts Anna, who is heartbroken over Sadie's rejection and the loss of the C(i)A. They end up partying together and having a one-night stand. In the morning, Aggie has prepared breakfast and procured a flower for Anna, who only considers him a friend. Sadie arrives to talk about what happened the night before. Anna tries to explain that her night with Aggie meant nothing. He overhears and is deeply hurt. Sadie leaves and Anna finds herself truly alone.  In an attempt to fix things, Anna formulates a master plan to get C(i)A national attention. Meat and Shulamith like her idea, but insist she must make things right with Aggie. Anna apologizes, Aggie forgives her, and the four carry out the plan, without Sadie.   Anna attends her sister's wedding, bringing joy to her family, but leaves early to execute her part of the plan – sneaking into the studio of a popular talk show with Aggie and Meat. Courtney is appearing on the show to argue about the appropriateness of a celebration over the (arbitrary) anniversary of the construction of the Washington Monument, which she feels is a distraction from real issues. When the host requests a live shot of the monument, the C(i)A feeds their footage in. With the expert help of one of Shulamith's lovers, Calvin (who was discharged from the military for being a lesbian under [[Don't Ask Don't Tell]]), and Meat's prowess with sculpture, a giant phallus has been erected atop the [[Washington Monument]] and is blown off with explosives. Back at the studio, Aggie pulls the fire alarm and the group escapes.  In the getaway car waiting for Anna, she is surprised to see Sadie, who has finally broken it off with Courtney. Sadie apologizes for her behavior, and the two agree to just be friends, but then kiss. Through text in the epilogue, it is revealed that Shulamith and Calvin volunteered to take the fall for the explosion, and received a reduced sentence because no one was hurt. Aggie started hormone therapy, started a new feminist group for men and got a girlfriend. Meat's sculpture appearing on TV launched her art career. Courtney took the talk show host, Marcy, out to dinner after fleeing the building together. Marcy subsequently left her husband to move in with Courtney. Anna and Sadie remain together, and Anna now attends college, where she has created a group focused on positive body image called the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.

And one cold winter night, Jacquou decides to kill himself by freezing to death (like his mother) in a cemetery beside a church. The unexpected hoots of an owl (in the middle of the night) alert the local priest, who with his friend, the physician come to the boys rescue. Jacquou grows up under their protection and works as an altar boy.  After Jacquou becomes an adult, he has his first confrontation with Nansac at a dance competition. Nansac shows up with his gang of servants, uninvited, and ruins the festive mood among the people. His daughter Galiote joins his father as well and it is revealed that she has a secret longing for Jacquou for having saved her life. Jacquou humiliates Nansac and defies his authority in front of townspeople. Infuriated Nansac soon has his men capture Jacquou and pushes him into the underground well to die. Nevertheless, Jacquou manages to get out, finding a room filled with firearms in the process, and plots with his friends to overthrow Nansac. When he returns home, Jacquou finds Galiote in his home, who came in to avoid the rain. Although Jacquou orders her to get out at first, he soon softens and gives her some of his dry clothes before telling her to go home. When Galiote gets out of his house she is faced with an angry mob and narrowly escapes their hands.  Jacquou attacks Nansac's castle while a group of his men goes in to secure the weapons he discovered earlier. Many of Nansac's servants are killed by hidden marksmen and the nobles find themselves cornered. Jacquou fights Nansac alone and defeats him. When people urge him to kill Nansac, Jacquou responds that he would rather see him deteriorate miserably. When the castle is lit on fire and everyone seems to have gotten out, the nobles notice that Galiote is still in her room. Jacquou returns to save her and hands her over to Nansac. At the end of the night Jacquou thanks the townspeople for helping him but tells them not to be involved any further as they will probably be executed.  Some time later Jacquou is seen at the court as he faces charge of rioting and sexually assauting Galiote, brought on by Nansac. However Galiote testifies in favor of Jacquou and swears that he never touched her. Jacquou is freed and Nansac, impoverished and homeless, tastes another defeat.  Near the end Jacquou's friends tells him that Galiote is about to leave the town in search of work. Persuaded by Lina, Jacquou goes to bid adieu. He is finally reconciled with Galiote as he hugs her.

The Jammed
 The film begins with an  interrogation in an immigration office, revealing an illegal immigrant working as a prostitute on the verge of being deported. Throughout the film it becomes apparent that one of the interrogators (Damien Richardson) has in fact had sex with the girl at an illegal brothel, negating his encouragement to her to tell the truth.  The film then back tracks three weeks as Ashley (Veronica Sywack), a bored, single insurance clerk who unwittingly becomes involved when she meets a Chinese woman, Sunee  (Amanda Ma), as a blind-date airport pick up goes wrong.  We learn that Sunee is searching for her daughter, Rubi. Through the various flash backs we meet Crystal (Emma Lung), Vanya (Saskia Burmeister) and Rubi (Sun Park) who have all been enslaved in a Melbourne brothel on premise of "working off their debt" of being brought to Australia with false papers and forced to work as prostitutes.  
The Jane Austen Book Club (film)
 The book club is the brainchild of fiftysomething six-time divorcée Bernadette ([[Kathy Baker]]), who latches onto the idea when she meets Prudie ([[Emily Blunt]]), a prim, married high school French teacher in her mid-20s, at a Jane Austen film festival. Her idea is to have six members discuss all of Austen's six novels, with each member hosting the group once a month. Also inducted into the club are Sylvia ([[Amy Brenneman]]), a fortysomething librarian who has recently separated from her philandering lawyer husband Daniel after more than two decades of marriage; Sylvia's 20-something lesbian daughter Allegra ([[Maggie Grace]]); Jocelyn ([[Maria Bello]]), a happily unmarried control freak and breeder of [[Rhodesian Ridgeback]]s who has been Sylvia's friend since childhood; and Grigg ([[Hugh Dancy]]), a science fiction fan who's roped into the group by Jocelyn with the hope he and Sylvia will prove to be a compatible match.  As the months pass, each of the members develops characteristics similar to those of Austen's characters and reacts to events in their lives in much the same way their fictional counterparts would. Bernadette is the matriarch figure who longs to see everyone find happiness. Sylvia clings to her belief in steadfast love and devotion and eventually reconciles with Daniel. Jocelyn denies her own feelings for Grigg while playing matchmaker for him and Sylvia. Prudie, encumbered with her inattentive husband Dean and a free-spirited, pot-smoking, aging hippie mother, a product of the 1960s counterculture, finds herself desperately trying not to succumb to her feelings for her seductive student Trey. Allegra, who tends to meet her lovers while engaging in death-defying activities, feels betrayed when she discovers her current partner, aspiring writer Corinne, has used Allegra's life as the basis for her short stories. Grigg is attracted to Jocelyn and mystified by her seeming lack of interest in him, marked by her failure to read the [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] novels he has hoped will catch her fancy. He also serves as the comedic foil to Jocelyn's and Prudie's very serious takes on the books.  The last meeting is held at the beach. Daniel wants to join the book club and is let in by Sylvia. Grigg brings his elder sister Cat Harris, who persuades Jocelyn to take a chance on Grigg because he loves her. Prudie initially wants to meet Trey but decides against it after putting herself in Jane Austen's shoes and instead goes home to Dean and makes him read ''[[Persuasion (novel)|Persuasion]]'', which helps them find the love they once had. Daniel leaves a letter for Sylvia at her doorstep; upon reading it, she accepts Daniel back.  Jocelyn finally reads the books Grigg gave to her and is surprised to find that she loves them and can't put them down. She drives over to Grigg's house but realises it's  still very early and dozes off in her car. When Grigg comes out of his house, he sees Jocelyn's car and knocks on her window. Jocelyn finally gives in to her feelings and they both passionately kiss.  One year later, the book club meets at Sylvia's library charity dinner. Grigg and Jocelyn are together; Sylvia and Daniel have reconciled; Prudie is pregnant; and Bernadette has remarried for the seventh time.

Jhoomar
 The story written by [[Syed Noor]] revolves around Gulaab Bibi ([[Saima Noor|Saima]]), a village belle who falls in love with a dashing army officer Shahnawaz (Momey) posted in her village along the Pakistan-India border. Shahnawaz hails from a well-off wadera family that owns, among other things, an imposing haveli complete with a two-way staircase in the entrance hall that serves as a vantage point for theatrical entries and exits by different characters throughout the film.  In Shahnawaz’s family, both his brothers Ricky Mirza and Danial Khan and a heavy-duty, bedecked sister-in-law put up serious opposition to his marriage plans to Gulaab. Instead, they have their sights set on his brother’s glamorous sister-in-law (played by actress [[Aleena (actress)|Aleena]]) as a much more suitable match for him.  Shahnawaz, however, foils their plans by bringing the newlywed Gulaab to the haveli, much to the ire of his family, before setting off for a romantic honeymoon. Trouble rears its ugly head when Gulaab is supposedly found to be unable to have children and her  brother-in-law [Danial Khan] puts pressure on Shahnawaz to marry Aleena for the sake of carrying on the lineage. Gulaab is eventually kicked out of the house after being falsely blamed of having an affair.

Joshua (2007 film)
 Brad and Abby Cairn are an affluent New York couple with two children. Their firstborn, a self-decided conservatively dressed 9-year-old, Joshua, is a [[child prodigy]] on the piano with a marked predilection for "dissonant" [[classical music|classical]] pieces. He demonstrates limitless ability, to such a degree that he thinks and acts old before his time.   Joshua gravitates toward his clueless and oblivious Uncle Ned as a close friend, but distances himself from his immediate kin, particularly following the birth of his sister, Lily. As the days pass, bizarre events transpire as the mood at the house regresses from healthy and happy to strange and disorienting. As the baby's whines drive an already strained Abby to the point of a nervous breakdown, Joshua devolves from eccentric to downright sociopathic behavior, while Brad tries to keep things together but finds he can't help his wife, do well at his demanding job, or match wits with his sociopathic son.   Joshua causes a fight between his mother (who is [[Judaism|Jewish]], but [[Irreligion|non-religious]]) and paternal grandmother (who is an [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]] and who constantly [[proselytism|proselytizes]] Joshua) when he tells his parents he wants to become a [[Christianity|Christian]]. Abby gets very angry and swears at the grandmother, telling her to leave her house immediately. Joshua later convinces his mother to join him in a game of hide-and-seek. As Abby counts to fifty, Joshua takes his sister from her crib to hide with him, causing his mother to panic and pass out while searching for them in the empty penthouse above them, before he puts his sister back into the crib to make it look as though his mother was hallucinating the entire incident.  Later, after discussing Abby's psychological problems with his brother-in-law Ned (who is sympathetic to Brad but also thinks that Abby will be fine given some time), Brad takes two weeks off from his job to look after Abby and her children, and his mother makes him feel worse by recounting all the ways he is failing as a husband and father, tying their problems to the evils of life in the big city, and demanding he quit his job and move the family to a rural area where they can be religious and happy. When he arrives home, Joshua has gone to the Brooklyn Museum with his sister and their grandmother Hazel ([[Celia Weston]]). Joshua frightens his grandmother by describing to her in detail about [[Set (deity)|Seth]], the [[Egypt]]ian God of Chaos, and his violent acts. While they are at the museum, Brad watches a video tape of Joshua scaring his sister with a light, making her cry. He arrives at the museum, just in time to see Joshua attempt to push his sister in her carriage down a large flight of stairs, but he stops when he is caught by his grandmother, whom he proceeds to push down the large staircase, killing her and disguising it as an accident. However, Brad is convinced Joshua pushed her and confides in Ned at the funeral. By this point, Abby has had a complete psychotic breakdown and been institutionalized.  That night, Brad installs a lock on his bedroom door and tells Joshua that his sister will be sleeping with him, fearing Joshua will attempt to do something to his sister. That night, Joshua builds a house of blocks in the living room and provokes his father. Brad tells him he won't be able to hurt anyone else, as he now realizes he is causing trouble. Later that week, on Ned's recommendation, Brad brings Betsy ([[Nancy Giles]]), a [[psychology|psychologist]], into the home to meet Joshua. Betsy talks to Joshua and sees his disturbing drawings and comes to the erroneous conclusion that Joshua is being [[child abuse|abused]]. Later, Brad tells him he is being sent away to a [[boarding school]], causing Joshua to run away. When Brad arrives home, he finds Joshua hiding in a cupboard, crying hysterically with a large bruise on his back.   The next morning, he and Joshua go for a walk with his sister, but Joshua has stolen her pacifier, causing her to cry. When Brad confronts him, he begins to mock him, causing Brad to strike him. After Brad realizes what he did, he tries to apologize. Joshua further taunts him, which drives Brad to beating his son in public, strengthening Joshua's case of abuse and sending Brad to jail for child abuse and assault. In addition, it is indicated that Joshua has framed his father for tampering with his mother's medications, suggesting that Brad will spend the rest of his life in prison, leaving Ned to adopt Joshua and his sister.  In the last scene of the film, Joshua is playing a piano while his uncle Ned is talking to a person on the phone about having a [[nanny]] to take care of his sister. Afterwards, Ned sits with Joshua and the two compose a song with Joshua singing an original song. The lyrics of the song are basically how Joshua's parents both will never be loved by anyone now, and it is revealed in the song that he only wanted to be with Ned and got rid of everyone else. Ned's expression is ambiguous, hinting he may have figured out what Joshua is really like, as the film ends.

They start their same vehicles and drive off at the same time and place, doing the same collision.

Kabluey
 Leslie, whose husband is in [[Iraq War|Iraq]], is in danger of losing her [[Employee benefit|benefits]] if she does not return to work.  Salman, her brother-in-law, arrives in her town to help watch over Leslie's two kids. In part this is due to Salman's having no other place to go. He seems a bit spacey and was fired from his last job at a copy shop because he enjoyed laminating so much that he laminated everything in the store that was laminatable (including the money in the till).  Leslie's eldest son, Cameron, takes an instant dislike to Salman and threatens to kill him. Her other son Lincoln follows his lead. Salman's difficulty in handling the two hyperactive children does not impress Leslie, so she asks him to leave.  Unfortunately that's not an option as Salman has no money and nowhere to go.  So, struggling for answers and a way to keep things from falling apart, Leslie finds Salman a job at her company.  They will trade off working and watching after the kids.  Leslie does not realize that the job Salman gets is as a blue-costumed corporate [[mascot]] called "Kabluey".  Salman's job as Kabluey is to hand out flyers (advertising office space) on the side of the road for her company, a faltering [[Dot-com company|dot-com]] called BluNexion. The costume has its unique challenges, being extremely hot inside and having no fingers on the hands, forcing him to grip the flyers under his arms. Standing on the side of the road also seems completely pointless - as the only people who drive by are farmers who don't need office space. Kabluey (the mascot) also interacts with passing road workers, and an insane woman (who lost all of her money investing in BluNexion in an ENRON type scandal) who constantly drives by and even tries to kill Kabluey with her car.  Despite all this, Salman finds strange confidence through his suit and alter ego - and his life begins to change.  Salman is asked to entertain at a birthday party in the suit. He manages to gain the respect of Cameron and Lincoln in the process. He later discovers Leslie is having an affair with her boss Brad but is afraid to confront the issue. When he later discovers that Brad is sleeping with another woman, he attacks Brad (wearing the costume) while Brad is in a motel room with the other woman, but not before calling Leslie to the scene.  Confronted with the reality of the situation, Leslie slaps Salman and walks away, but later breaks down in Salman's arms. She tells him that she never loved Brad and never planned on leaving her husband, that the situation had simply developed due to stress and as a way to keep money coming in. Leslie's husband returns home to a family happy to see him, and Salman disappears.

She simply does it to be with these friends during college.  Muthu who initially had a crush on Shobhana later abandons the feeling due to the respect of the friendship they have developed among their group. The movie goes on to narrate the college life with fun and colour. It shows the strength of the friendship and the backgrounds of the friends; most of them are from poor families. Muthu has an aim in his life. Being an athlete, he wants to excel in sports and get a good job through sports quota to give his poor family a new lease of life.  Shobhana, who is from a wealthy family background, feels sympathy for Muthu after she sees the conditions he and his family lives in and is really moved by his perseverance and helps him achieve his goal by encouraging him in every chance. In fact as true friend many do the same and so does Shobhana. She even advises him that there is more he has to and capable of achieving in life so he should take her encouragements as a way to improve his career and nothing else. But eventually her encouraging stance turns into some sort of special attachment with him. Slowly love develops in the minds of both but they chose to put it on the back seat for the sake of the larger friendship they share with the group. In fact the poor lovers don't even share their feelings.  Eventually they take a college trip to Andhra. On the way, they stop at a hotel but there is only non-vegetarian food being served so Muthu volunteers to run to the nearest vegetarian restaurant a few km away to bring food for Shobhana who is a vegetarian. Shobhana confessed her love for Muthu to Kayalvizhi which she accepts it wholeheartedly and says that even though she hate the concept of love between best friends, she don't want to spoil Shobhana's happiness and true love. This conversation was overheard by Adhilakshmi. The latter says this to the rest of the gang, to their surprise and delight. But fate has other plans,the hotel they were initially eating at is urgently closed because some politician or another has died. The group board the bus urgently and try to go to a collector's office or police station to keep safe while two classmates wait for Muthu to come back. On the way however, the bus is stopped by the protestors and despite pleas to allow them to pass, the protestors light the bus on fire. In a frenzy, everyone tries to evacuate the bus and Nagarani gets fits and has an attack. In a scramble to safely get off to bus, the rest of the group fail to realize that some students are still trapped. After the fire trucks finish putting out the fire, they bring out the burnt bodies of Kayal, Adhilakshmi and Shobhana, who have embraced each other in their final moments together-Kayal having stayed back to help Shobhana who's chudi had gotten caught in the bus.  The last scene flashes back to the beginning of the movie where a group of people are clearing the weeds. It has been eight years since the incident and every year the group of friends come to pay respects to their lost friends and Muthu still keeps the handkerchief of Shobhana's in the remembrance of their love.<ref name="behindwoods.com">[http://www.behindwoods.com/tamil-movie-articles/movies-07/kalloori-review.html] </ref>

Katyń (film)
 [[File:Mercedes black crow.jpg|thumb|right|A German-made [[prison bus]] used by the NKVD for transport of prisoners; the bus was reconstructed for the purpose of the film.]] The events of Katyn are relayed through the eyes of the women, the mothers, wives, and daughters of the victims executed on Stalin's orders by the [[NKVD]] in 1940.  Andrzej ([[Artur Żmijewski (actor)|Artur Zmijewski]]) is a young Polish captain in the [[8th Uhlan Regiment of Duke Jozef Poniatowski]], who keeps a detailed diary. In September 1939, he is taken prisoner by the Soviet Army, which separates the officers from the enlisted men, who are allowed to return home, while the officers are held. His wife Anna ([[Maja Ostaszewska]]) and daughter Weronika, nicknamed "Nika" (Wiktoria Gąsiewska), find him shortly before he is deported to the USSR. Presented with an opportunity to escape, he refuses on the basis of his oath of loyalty to the Polish military.  Helped by a sympathetic Soviet officer, Anna manages to return to the family's home in [[Cracow]] with her daughter. There, the [[Germans]] carry out [[Sonderaktion Krakau]], shutting down [[Jagiellonian University]] and deporting professors to concentration camps. Andrzej's father is one of the professors deported; later, his wife gets a message that he died in a camp in 1941.  In a prisoner of war camp, Andrzej is detained for a while and continues to keep a diary. He carefully records the names of all his fellow officers who are removed from the camp, and the dates on which they are taken. During the winter, Andrzej is clearly suffering in the low temperature, and his colleague Jerzy ([[Andrzej Chyra]]) lends him an extra sweater. As it happens, the sweater has Jerzy's name written on it. Finally, Andrzej's is taken from the camp, while Jerzy is left behind.  In 1943, the population of Cracow is informed by the occupying power about the Katyn massacre. Capitalizing on the Soviet crime, the Nazi propaganda publishes lists with the names of the victims exhumed in mass graves behind the advancing German troops. Andrzej's name is not on the list, giving his wife and daughter hope.  After the war, Jerzy, who has survived, has enlisted in the [[Ludowe Wojsko Polskie|Peoples’ Army of Poland]] (LWP), which is under the complete control of the pro-Soviet [[Polish United Worker's Party]]. He feels personal loyalty to his friends, loves his country, and has sympathy for those who have suffered. He visits Anna and her daughter to tell them that Andrzej is dead. Apparently, when the list of the names of the victims was compiled, Andrzej was misidentified as Jerzy on the basis of the name in the sweater that Jerzy had lent to Andrzej; it was Andrzej who was killed, not Jerzy. Despondent that he is now forced to acknowledge a lie and to serve those who killed his comrades in Katyn, Jerzy commits suicide.  Evidence of Soviet responsibility for the Katyn massacre is carefully concealed by the authorities. However, a few daring people working with the effects of the victims eventually deliver Andrzej's diary to his widow Anna. The diary clearly shows the date in 1940 when he must have been killed from the absence of entries on subsequent days. The date of the massacre is crucial for assigning responsibility: if it happened in 1940, the USSR controlled the territory, while by mid-1941 the Germans took control over it.  The film ends with a re-enactment of parts of the massacre, as several of the principal characters are executed along with other soldiers.  The film includes excerpts from German newsreels presenting the Katyn massacre as a Soviet crime, and excerpts from Soviet newsreels presenting the massacre as a German crime.  
The Key to Reserva
  The film begins with  framing device, wherein Scorsese, playing himself, describing how he discovered three and a half pages of an unproduced [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film, "The Key to Reserva".

He is noticed by one of the performers, Leonard, who signals to his accomplice Louis Bernard ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]), who is holding Roger's wife Grace hostage in the audience.  Leonard then goes to stop Roger.  The two fight and Leonard falls from the box seat, presumably to his death.  Roger uses the key to open a locked case which contains a bottle of Freixenet with top secret files hidden inside.    The film abruptly stops, as Scorsese explains that a page is missing, so he simply filmed the concluding paragraph of the script which shows Louis Bernard arrested, as Roger and his wife reunite over a glass of Freixenet.  Scorsese then discusses with the interviewer possible future projects. The camera pans back to reveal Scorsese, Thelma Schoonmaker, and the interviewer in an office in a tower block, meanwhile crows flock around the building.

King Naresuan (film)
  ===''Part I: Hongsawadee's Hostage''=== The film concerns the childhood of King Naresuan. Born in 1555, he was taken to Burma as a child hostage; there he became acquainted with sword fighting and became a threat to the Burmese empire  The film begins in 1564, during the Burmese siege of [[Phitsanulok]], the center of the languishing [[Sukhothai Kingdom|Sukhothai]] kingdom. Naresuan's father, [[Mahathammarachathirat (king of Ayutthaya)|Maha Thammarachathirat]], admits defeat and follows Burmese orders that his two sons, Naresuan (nicknamed Ong Dam  ''Black Prince'') and [[Ekathotsarot]] (the White Prince), be taken hostage and be raised in Pegu (the center of the Hanthawadi kingdom) under the watchful eyes of [[Bayinnaung]], the Burmese king, who promises to care for Naresuan like one of his own. This creates a rift between Naresuan's father and his mother, Queen [[Wisutkasat]], whose brother is the king of the neighboring [[Ayutthaya kingdom]], as Phitsanulok is now a Burmese [[vassal state]]. Ayutthaya falls soon after.  Immediately after entering the Burmese palace, Naresuan sees the palace politics and rivalries between himself and Bayinnaung's grandson, [[Mingyi Swa]]. Naresuan is sent to be educated as a novice monk, by an ethnic [[Mon people|Mon]] Buddhist monk named Khanchong, at a Buddhist monastery outside the palace. There, while wandering the Thai village outside Pegu (made up of Thais displaced by Bayinnaung's expansionist campaigns and subsequent forced relocations to Hanthawadi), he befriends Bunthing, a Thai street child who is later allowed to work as a temple boy. He also befriends Maneechan, a temple girl at the monastery. The monk Khanchong, who had also trained Bayinnaung, teaches Naresuan the skills of war and ethics.  ===''Part II: Reclaiming Sovereignty''===  [[Bayinnaung]] dies in the beginning of the film from natural causes. [[Mahathammarachathirat (king of Ayutthaya)|Thammaracha]], the governor-king of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]], believes it is important that he go and pay respect to the dead king out of fear that the new Burmese king [[Nandabayin|Nanda]] would deem it as an insult and attack Ayutthaya. Prince Naresuan, however, having been raised in [[Bago, Myanmar|Pegu]] (the kingdom of Hanthawadi) and who regards Bayinnaung as a second father, convinces Thammaracha to let him go in his place.  Upon arriving in Hanthawadi (Hongsawadi in Thai), Naresuan's childhood teacher, a Buddhist monk named Khan Chong, informs him about the dangers that king Nanda and many factions in Burma are plotting his assassination. At king Bayinnaung's funeral, all representatives from vassal kingdoms are present besides for one, the [[Lao Krang|Krang]] kingdom.  King Nanda sees it as disrespect and seizes the opportunity to wage war and siege the mountain top city.  Naresuan's Ayutthaya army is successful in taking the mountain top city and proves itself superior to the rival Burmese armies, namely of the [[Thado Dhamma Yaza II of Prome|Lord of Pyay]] and of Mingyi Swa (the eldest son of Nandabayin).  Burmese rivals felt even more threatened by the strength and wits of Naresuan's army. During the battle, Naresuan's friend, Bunthing, now a highly skilled general under Naresuan, falls for the princess of Krang, who becomes his companion.  A plot is uncovered by Naresuan's childhood friends, two [[Mon people|Mon]] rulers, that the Burmese are in fact planning the assassination of Naresuan.  Upon finding out, Naresuan executes the plotters and ceremoniously declares Ayutthaya free and sovereign from Hanthawadi. King Nanda and his Burmese are furious and begin a military campaign to capture and kill king Naresuan before his forces and liberated Siamese subjects can reach the [[Sittaung River]]. King Naresuan uses the strategy of a fighting retreat.  His forces built a wooden bridge across the river and engage the pursuing Burmese army as they follow.  Several battles took place during the crossing. However, as the Burmese forces catch up, the Siamese citizens and forces have already crossed to the other bank.  The Burmese, determined to defeat the Siamese, try to pursue Naresuan's forces by crossing the river. The king is then approached by his revered Buddhist teacher, Mon monk Khanchong.  Here, he is given a special musket, which is capable of firing across the river.  According to history, the movie portrays king Naresuan firing the musket across the Sittaung River, and with one strike, killing the general of the Burmese army. With the general dead, Burmese forces retreated back to Hanthawadi.  King Naresuan and his now independent Siamese forces head back to Ayutthaya and the king declares ; "It's not over yet, there is more work for us to do!"  ===''Part III: Naval Battle''=== In 1584 at Kraeng, King Naresuan continues the war for independence of the Kingdom of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] (Thai : อาณาจักรอยุธยา). The war began because King [[Nanda Bayin|Nandabayin]] king of the [[History of Burma|Burmese]] Kingdom(Thai : อาณาจักรพม่า)had secretly determined to fight a war by sending two armies to attack King Naresuan.  The first army is that of Lord Pathein which passes through  the [[Three Pagodas Pass]](Thai: ด่านเจดีย์สามองค์).  The second army is that of the King Noratra Mangsosri (Thai : นรธาเมงสอ) of Lanna (Chiangmai) which attacks from the north of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya.  The Lanna army halts and builds a camp at BanSraKet (Thai : บ้านสระเกศ).

Kickin' It Old Skool
  In 1986, 12-year-old Justin "Rocketshoe" Schumacher (played as a youth by [[Alexander Calvert]]) and his [[breakdancing]] group, The Funky Fresh Boyz (Darnell "Prince Def Rock" Jackson, Aki "Chilly Chill" Terasaki, and Hector "Popcorn" Jimenez) (played as youths by J.R. Messado, Hanson Ng, and Anthony Grant, respectively), are ready for the annual talent show. The somewhat shy Justin has a crush on Jennifer (played as a youth by [[Alexia Fast]]), who is giving her a [[Garbage Pail Kid]] card in exchange for her [[Smurfette]] figurine. His rival, the obnoxious rich kid Kip Unger (played as a youth by Taylor Beaumont), shows up and gives her an expensive necklace. Justin and the Funky Fresh Boyz start the show, with his parents cheering for him. In an effort to impress Jen and win the contest, Justin uses a dangerous and untested [[headspin|headspin maneuver]]. It caused him to flip off the stage and to fall into a [[coma]].  Twenty years later, Justin ([[Jamie Kennedy]]) is still in the [[hospital]] and in a coma. Dr. Frye ([[Alan Ruck]]) tells his desperate parents that at this point, there is little sign that Justin will recover, and they decide to pull the plug on him.  As his parents say goodbye and leave, however, a janitor rolls by with a radio playing the same song from the 1986 talent competition, "[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]" by [[Herbie Hancock]]. It jars his brain to function, waking him from his 20-year coma. As a result of his two-decade-long coma, Justin now finds himself suddenly 31 years old, going on 32. In addition, his parents were bankrupt from overdue life support payments. Jennifer ([[Maria Menounos]]), who has become a girls' dance instructor, is engaged to Kip ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]). Kip is now an obnoxious promoter, and is set to host a breakdance contest broadcast on national television, with a grand prize of $100,000. Justin realizes that the money could help him repay his parents for what they've spent on his medical bills. Kip is sarcastic and still despises Justin, and schemes to keep him off the show and away from Jennifer.  Justin has a difficult time adjusting to both his deteriorated physical condition and the severe [[culture shock]] he encounters after 20 years, and is nearly arrested as a child predator. He was being recognized by a mall [[security guard]], his old friend and Funky Fresh Boy, Darnell ([[Miguel A. Núñez Jr.]]). Darnell is now both a toy store employee and a failed inventor, who is frequently slapped around by his wife. He explains much of what has changed in the past 20 years to Justin, before re-introducing him to the rest of the crew. Aki ([[Bobby Lee]]) is an accountant, and has lost his old stereotypical Asian accent thanks to English classes. In addition, Aki is also trying to woo a colleague ([[Kira Clavell]]), who claims he might have a 2% chance of sleeping with her if he were a professional breakdancer. Hector (Aris Alvarado) is now a [[meter maid]], and is even more [[obesity|overweight]] than he was in school. Despite their reluctance to return to the '80s lifestyle, they agree to try to retrain their faded breakdancing skills to help Justin.  Initially, the four are terrible, but their skills improve greatly with Justin's help, as Aki studies a [[Robosapien]] toy to reclaim his mastery of the robot. Justin and Jennifer begin reminiscing about the old days. He eventually asks her on a date, which she thinks is just still a harmless crush. However, with the help of the [[Internet]] and practicing on Hector wearing a [[bra]], Justin learns how to please a woman quite well. A surprise appearance by [[David Hasselhoff]] allows the pair to go on a date in KITT from ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''. However, just as Justin has her shirt off and is making his move, Kip calls, leading Jennifer to be reminded that she is still engaged to him and runs off embarrassed.  During a rather sour birthday party celebration, Justin is confronted by the diminutive but talented Cole ([[Jesse Brown]]) of the Iced Cole Crew, a group hired by Kip to ensure that the Funky Fresh Boyz don't win the contest. Cole challenges Justin to a dance-off in the parking lot. After Cole's impressive routine, along with some various flashbacks from his years in the coma, a nervous and [[Mood disorder|depressed]] Justin [[vomiting|vomits]] on Cole and runs off. He was too disillusioned to compete on the show. The rest of the Boyz decide to have a breakdancing [[homelessness|homeless]] man stand in for him. Kip gloats to Jennifer about his psychological victory over Justin, causing her to finally break up with him. As the dance tournament progresses, the Funky Fresh Boyz and the Iced Cole Crew each progress in their individual brackets toward the finals. Jennifer finds Justin sulking in a local bar, and convinces him that she wants to be with him and to come back to compete in the show.  Justin convinces his worried parents that he will be alright, reciting the lyrics to the theme song from ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'' as an inspirational speech. Although Kip tries to prevent him from dancing, Jennifer stirs the crowd and Cole into letting him dance, and the FFB get the win when Justin is able to successfully complete the headspin maneuver from '86. Kip is outraged and has a huge [[tantrum]] leading to him challenging Justin to a last dance off. However, the FFB don't give in. Kip is fired from the network, knocked out by a man from earlier in the film for using the word [[intellectual disability|"retarded"]], and is [[urination|urinated]] on by the homeless dancer. The Funky Fresh Boyz win the prize money, and Justin [[marriage|marries]] Jen and saves his parents' house.  In the epilogue, she is currently teaching him how to use an [[iPod]], though he is having trouble finding out where he puts the [[cassette tape]] in. Darnell has invented the 98¢ store, but his wife is still rather [[abuse|abusive]] towards him. Hector finds work as a [[Jennifer Lopez]] impersonator in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]], and Aki marries his co-worker, Yun in a lavish Jewish ceremony, which has increased his chances of sleeping with her to 3%. Kip never recovered fully from being punched, and is a judge on ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''.

The Kingdom (film)
 During a softball game at an American oil company housing compound in [[Riyadh]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists set off a bomb, killing Americans and Saudis. While one team hijacks a car and shoots residents, a [[suicide bombing|suicide bomber]] wearing a fake police uniform blows himself up, killing everyone near him. Sergeant Haytham of the Saudi State Police kills the carjackers. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Legal Attaché in Saudi Arabia, Special Agent Fran Manner, calls his US colleague, Special Agent Ronald Fleury, to advise him about the attack. Manner is discussing the situation with [[Diplomatic Security Service|DSS]] Special Agent Rex Bura when an ambulance full of explosives is detonated, killing Manner, Bura, and many others.  At [[FBI Headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Fleury briefs his rapid deployment team on the attack. Although the [[U.S. Justice Department]] and the [[U.S. State Department]] hinder FBI efforts to investigate the attack, Fleury blackmails the Saudi ambassador into allowing an FBI investigative team into Saudi Arabia. Fleury gathers Special Agent Janet Mayes, a forensic examiner, FBI analyst Adam Leavitt, an intelligence analyst, and Special Agent Grant Sykes, a bomb technician, to go to Saudi Arabia. On arrival they are met by Colonel Faris al-Ghazi, the commander of the Saudi State Police Force providing security at the compound. The investigation is being run by General Al Abdulmalik of the [[Saudi Arabian National Guard|SANG]], who does not give Fleury and his team permission to investigate.  The FBI team is invited to the palace of Saudi Prince Ahmed bin Khaled for a dinner. While at the palace, Fleury persuades the Prince that Colonel al-Ghazi is a natural detective and should be allowed to lead the investigation. With this change in leadership, the Americans are allowed hands-on access to the crime scene. While searching for evidence, Sergeant Haytham and Sykes discover the second bomb was detonated in an ambulance. Fleury learns the brother of one of the dead terrorists had access to ambulances and police uniforms. Colonel al-Ghazi orders a [[SWAT]] team to raid a house, managing to kill a few heavily armed terrorists. Following the raid, the team discovers clues, including photos of the U.S. and other Western embassies in Riyadh. Soon afterward, the U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Damon Schmidt notifies Fleury and his team that they have been ordered to return to the United States.  On their way to [[King Khalid International Airport]], their convoy is attacked and incapacitated. Leavitt is dragged out of the wrecked car and kidnapped while Fleury manages to wound one attacker. Al-Ghazi commandeers a civilian vehicle to chase the fourth SUV and the other car holding Leavitt into the dangerous [[As-Suwaidi (Riyadh)|Al-Suwaidi]] neighborhood of Riyadh. As they pull up, a gunman launches [[rocket-propelled grenade]]s at them and a fierce firefight starts. Leavitt is tied up inside a complex.   While Sykes and Haytham watch the entrance to the complex, al-Ghazi, Fleury, and Mayes follow a blood trail and kill many gunmen inside. Mayes, separated from the others, finds Leavitt and his attackers, preparing an execution video of Leavitt. She kills the remaining insurgents, and al-Ghazi and the team start to leave. Fleury then realizes there is a trail of blood leading to the back of the apartment. After they enter, Mayes comforts a girl in the apartment and offers her candy. In return, the girl offers Mayes a marble, similar to those embedded in the bodies of some bombing victims. Al-Ghazi sees the grandfather, reaches out with his hand, and offers to help him stand. When the old man gives him his hand, al-Ghazi sees that the man is missing the same fingers as Abu Hamza al-Masri in the terrorist group's many videos and confirms his suspicion that the grandfather is the terrorist leader. Abu Hamza's teenage grandson walks out of the bedroom and shoots al-Ghazi in the neck, then he starts to point his gun at Mayes, prompting Fleury to kill him. Abu Hamza then pulls out an assault rifle and Haytham kills him. As Abu Hamza dies, another grandchild hugs him and Abu Hamza whispers something into his ear to calm the child down. Al-Ghazi dies in Fleury's arms.  At al-Ghazi's house, Fleury and Haytham meet his family. Fleury tells his son that al-Ghazi was his good friend, mirroring a similar scene earlier in the movie wherein he comforted Special Agent Manner's son. Fleury and his team return to the United States, where they are commended by FBI Director James Grace for their outstanding work. Leavitt asked Fleury and Mayes what he had whispered to her to calm her down. The scene cuts to Abu Hamza's daughter asking her own daughter what her grandfather whispered to her as he was dying. The granddaughter tells her mother, "Don't fear them, my child. We are going to kill them all," a similar line to what Fleury had whispered to Mayes.  
King of California
 16-year-old Miranda has been abandoned by her mother, and has dropped out of school. She is supporting herself as an employee at [[McDonald's]] while her father, Charlie, resides in a [[mental institution]].  When Charlie is released and sent back to their home, Miranda finds the relatively peaceful existence she's built for herself completely disrupted. Charlie has become obsessed with the notion that the long-lost treasure of [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer Father Juan Florismarte Torres is buried somewhere near their suburban [[California]] house in the [[Santa Clarita Valley]]. Armed with a metal detector and a stack of treasure-hunting books, Charlie soon finds reason to believe that the gold resides underneath the local [[Costco]], and encourages Miranda to get a job there so that they can plan a way to excavate after hours.  Initially skeptical, Miranda soon finds herself joining in Charlie's questionable antics in an effort to give him one last shot at accomplishing his dreams.  After becoming involved with some swingers, Miranda then helps Charlie break into the Costco. Once inside, they drill through the floor and then into a very smelly underground river. Charlie steals some scuba diving equipment, dives into the river, and then imaginably finds the gold. He leaves Miranda a tag and tells her not to lose it. When the police arrives at the Costco, Charlie is seen to carry a small but heavy chest, hiding from the police. He then jumps into the river again, where he pursues further, sees a bright light and swims towards it. Miranda's voice from the off says that his body was never found, although Charlie is seen still alive swimming in the river after that. The next day, Miranda visits Costco and finds the product the tag belongs to, a dishwasher, buys it and brings it to the beach in her old car. When Miranda opens the dishwasher, she is seen bathed in a golden glow and a slow smile spreads across her face, a strong indication that Charlie has cached the gold inside the dishwasher, although the gold is never actually shown to the viewer.  There is a theme of ambiguity/duality that runs through the movie, regarding what is real and what is imagined. The theme is underlined by the recurring line "you could look it up." but a source to look in is not given.  While Charlie's judgement is in question for the whole story, he does seem to accurately perceive the nature of Miranda's co-workers to be swingers, as well as the sexual interest by the female police officer. As Charlie is faced with poverty, the losses of his house, mind and jazz career (his last friend & band member has cancer), he focuses on one last adventure with his daughter and gives her his treasure  - his dreams - which are perhaps what she sees in the dishwasher he tells her to get.

Hassan pledges his loyalty to Amir, swearing that he would eat dirt if Amir so asked.  Amir also is a writer, and he often reads to the illiterate Hassan. Hassan particularly likes to hear the story of [[Rostam and Sohrab]] from the [[Persian literature|Persian]] epic [[Shahnameh]]. Baba disapproves of his son's bookishness, and complains to his friend and business associate Rahim Khan that the boy doesn't stand up for himself, letting Hassan fight his battles for him. Amir overhears this conversation and Rahim Khan goes to Amir's room to assure him that his father loves him. Amir says that he believes that his father resents him because Amir's mother died in childbirth. Rahim Khan also encourages Amir to keep writing.  Amir and Hassan are often bullied by an older Pashtun boy, Assef (Elham Ehsas) and Assef's two friends, who harbor ethnic [[Persecution of Hazara people|hatred against Hazaras]]. Cornered one day by the three boys, Hassan protects Amir by threatening Assef with his slingshot. The bullies flee, but Assef promises revenge.  One day Amir enters the citywide kite-fighting contest, and his father—who was a champion in his own youth—watches proudly from a balcony, accompanied by Rahim Khan, as Amir breaks his father's record of 14 "kills." Hassan sprints off to "run" the last defeated kite and he is gone for some time. Eventually, Amir finds Hassan trapped in a dead end by Assef and his two goons. Assef demands the kite as payment for letting Hassan go free, but Hassan refuses, asserting that the kite belongs to Amir. Amir watches the scene while concealed, too afraid to intervene. Assef then beats and [[rape]]s Hassan as his friends hold the boy down. Amir flees from the scene. When Hassan emerges, bleeding, Amir pretends not to know what has occurred. Over the next few weeks, Amir, wracked with guilt, avoids Hassan, who spends all his free time in bed. Ali and Baba try to find out if something happened, but Amir pleads ignorance.  One day, Amir walks to a tree underneath which Amir often read stories to Hassan, and he finds Hassan teaching himself to read. Amir accuses Hassan of cowardice, and throws pomegranates at him, daring Hassan to strike him. Hassan picks up a pomegranate and smashes it into his own face. Later, Amir asks his father if he had ever considered replacing his servants Ali and Hassan. Baba angrily rebukes Amir, declaring that Ali has worked for the family for 40 years and that Ali and Hassan will always stay with them.  Baba throws a massive party for Amir's birthday, but Amir is unable to enjoy it, watching Hassan serve the guests. Assef attends with his father, and Amir meekly accepts Assef's gift and well-wishes. Rahim Khan, who presents Amir with a blank book for his stories, senses something is wrong and assures Amir that Amir can tell him anything. The next day, Amir plants his new wristwatch, a birthday present from his father, under Hassan's pillow, and tells the Agha Sahib that Hassan stole it. When confronted by Baba, Hassan falsely confesses to stealing it. The Agha Sahib forgives him, but Ali lets the Agha Sahib know that he and Hassan can no longer work for him, and, much to Baba's distress, they pack their belongings and leave.  In June 1979, the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet Union militarily intervenes]]. Baba leaves his house in the care of Rahim Khan and flees to Pakistan with Amir. They travel by truck with other refugees and, along the way, they are stopped by a [[Soviet Army]] [[private (rank)|private]], who demands sex with a young wife and mother who is among the refugees. Baba intervenes, daring the soldier to shoot him, but the situation is diffused when the soldier's superiors appear on the scene. The husband of the young wife thanks Baba, who tells the husband that no thanks is necessary. Later, the refugees are transferred, reluctantly, into the empty belly of an oil truck in order that they might be smuggled across the border undetected. Amir is frightened by these circumstances, and Baba comforts him by having Amir recite poems.  ===Flash Forward: [[Fremont, California]], 1988=== Baba runs a [[filling station|service station]] and operates a stall at a weekly flea market. Amir earns a degree at a local community college, and Baba, though disappointed that Amir wants to be a writer rather than a physician, says that Amir can earn money by working with him.  One day at the flea market, Amir's father introduces him to General Taheri (Abdul Khadir Farookh), another Pashtun and a former officer in the Afghan army. In passing, Amir meets Taheri's daughter, Soraya, and Baba notices that Amir finds her attractive. Later, Amir gives Soraya a copy of one of his stories for her to read, but the General, who has little regard for artists, takes the story from Soraya, tosses it aside, and speaks dismissively to Amir.  Soon after, Baba is diagnosed with [[lung cancer]], and he becomes gravely ill. Baba refuses to stay at the hospital and wishes to live his last days at home. After Amir brings him home, he asks his father to ask General Taheri for his daughter's hand in marriage. Taheri agrees, but Amir's father tells him that Soraya wants to speak with him. On a chaperoned stroll, Soraya reveals that when the Taheris were living in [[Virginia]], she ran away with a [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] man and lived with him until her father came to retrieve her. Soon after, the Taheris moved to [[California]] to flee the gossip surrounding them. Amir is shocked, but still pledges his love, and they marry. Baba dies soon afterward.  ===Flash Forward, 2000=== Rahim Khan persuades Amir to visit him in Pakistan. He tells Amir that the situation is bad, but that Amir has an opportunity to "be good again." Amir cancels his book tour and goes to Peshawar. Rahim Khan, who is dying, tells Amir that after several unsuccessful stints with caretakers at Baba and Amir's home, which Rahim Khan had been looking after, he had asked Hassan to return, which Hassan did, with his wife and son. Later, Rahim Khan had to flee to Pakistan when his own health deteriorated and the [[Taliban]] took over power after the [[civil war in Afghanistan (1992–1996)|civil war]]. But Hassan and his family remained in the home. One day, the Taliban appeared at the house and demanded that Hassan vacate the premises, declaring that no Hazara could be in legitimate possession of the house. Hassan refused to surrender the house, and the Taliban executed him in the street, then also killed his wife. Hassan's son, Sohrab, was taken to an orphanage. Rahim Khan urges Amir to return to Kabul to find Sohrab and give him a letter written by Hassan, who had taught himself to read and write. Amir resists until Rahim Khan reveals that Hassan was not really Ali's biological son. Rahim Khan says that Amir's father, Agha Sahib, had had an affair with Ali's wife and was the true biological father of Hassan, as Ali was infertile.  Amir agrees to go to Kabul, accompanied by a driver, Farid ([[Saïd Taghmaoui]]), who helps him don a disguise with a fake beard and negotiate the Taliban-controlled city. Amir and Farid go to the orphanage where Sohrab was taken and learn that Sohrab was taken away by a Taliban official who occasionally takes away young girls or boys. They are told that they can meet the Taliban official at a football match. Amir and Farid attend the match, where they witness the Taliban stoning adulterers at half-time. Amir manages to get an appointment to see the Taliban official.  After arriving at the Taliban official's house, Amir is surprised to find that the assistant of the official is actually Assef (played now by Abdul Salam Yusoufzai), who recognizes Amir immediately, even with the fake beard. Assef presents Sohrab as his [[Bacchá|dance boy]]. Assef agrees to let Sohrab go, but he begins to beat Amir as "payment." In the confusion, Sohrab is able to pull out his slingshot—the same slingshot that Amir had given to Hassan when they were boys—and shoots Assef in the eye. Sohrab and an injured Amir manage to escape through a window and flee in Farid's car.  When they get back to Peshawar, they find that Rahim Khan has died, but he has left a letter for Amir. The next morning, Sohrab has disappeared. Amir desperately searches for Sohrab in the city, ending up following a boy to a [[mosque]]. When Amir returns to Rahim's apartment, he finds Sohrab waiting for him in the stairway. Sohrab reveals that Assef would rape him before morning prayers and that he'd left because he didn't want his abuser to "get him" anymore. Amir assures Sohrab that that will not happen again.  Back in San Francisco, Amir introduces Sohrab to Soraya, and the couple welcomes Sohrab into their home. Later, Amir's father-in-law General Taheri demands to know why they have taken in "that Hazara boy." Amir reveals that Sohrab is his half-brother's son and stands up to his father-in-law to demand respect for the boy. The film ends with Amir teaching Sohrab how to fly kites and volunteering to act as Sohrab's "runner." As Amir runs off to fetch the defeated kite, he repeats, to Sohrab, the words Hassan had said to Amir when they were boys: "For you, a thousand times over."  
Klopka
   ===Intro=== The film opens with Mladen Pavlović (Nebojša Glogovac), sporting bumps and bruises on his face, nervously smoking a cigarette while talking to unrevealed individual(s). Among other things, he says that he is trying to "do this one thing right, after a series of wrongs that never should have happened".  The movie occasionally returns to the scene of Mladen talking to the unseen individual(s) and discussing different details following key plot points or displaying inner torment over the unfolding story.  ===Story=== Mladen is a young professional residing in [[Belgrade]] where he works as construction engineer in a decrepit state-owned company that's undergoing the process of privatization. He drives a beat-up [[Renault 4]] and rents an apartment with his wife Marija (Nataša Ninković) who teaches English in a primary school. Together they're raising their only child—an 8-year-old boy named Nemanja (Marko Djurovic). Despite their limited means, they're still managing to make ends meet and provide for their son. They arrange and lead a fairly normal and happy family life—cheering Nemanja on at swim meets and taking him to the local playground where Mladen becomes acquainted with their blonde neighbour (Anica Dobra) who also brings her daughter to play there.  However, everything drastically changes one day when Nemanja is rushed to the hospital following a collapse at gym class in school. After undergoing emergency [[advanced life support|reanimation]], he is diagnosed with a [[heart muscle]] condition that requires immediate surgery since the next inflammation that could come at any time might be fatal. They are further informed by Dr. Lukić (Bogdan Diklić), that the procedure is only performed at a clinic in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], costs 26,000 and is not covered by domestic health insurance plans.  Faced with this shocking development and the knowledge that they have nowhere near the money that is required for the surgery, Mladen and Marija look into different ways of coming up with the funds. Mladen applies for a [[bank loan]], but gets flatly rejected due to not owning property and being employed at a bankrupt company. Marija submits an ad in the paper, asking for charitable donations for their son's surgery. When informed about it, Mladen confronts her on the issue as he is vehemently opposed to what she did. However, suspecting misplaced ego might be the source of his ire, she simply states that it's not beneath her pride to ask for a handout in this situation. Although they quickly make up, it is obvious that the situation is starting to put a lot of strain on their marriage.  Soon, the family gets a call from a man who claims to be interested in helping Nemanja after seeing the ad, but is not willing to discuss the details over the phone so the meeting with Mladen is arranged the next day at a bar in Belgrade's [[Hotel Moskva (Belgrade)|Hotel Moskva]]. At the meeting, the dapper, a well-spoken middle-aged man (played by Miki Manojlović) says he's willing to pay €30,000, explaining that that should cover Nemanja's surgery and three plane tickets to Germany. Furthermore, he says that all he wants in return is for Mladen to murder someone, seeing him as the perfect candidate to carry out the crime, because he does not have any prior record and because he is an honest, hard-working man whom no one will suspect. Counting on Mladen's dismayed initial reaction, the man tells him to think it over and says he'll contact him in two days.  Coming back home, Marija is eager to hear how the meeting went, however Mladen doesn't mention the shocking offer he received, simply dismissing the man he met with as "some nutcase". Although very much tempted, at this stage Mladen hopes that he never gets a call from him again, and in search of money even looks up an old colleague from his university days (Vojin Ćetković). The friend quickly rejects Mladen, telling him he's doesn't have the money right now.  Two days later, as he announced, the mysterious man calls from a moving car, inquiring about the decision. A torn Mladen tells him unconvincingly that it's a no-go. Sensing doubts in Mladen's voice, the man tells him to give it more thought and informs him that everything needed to carry out the murder will be in a plastic bag placed in an electrical closet underneath [[Branko's Bridge]], and tells him to pick it up at 7am the next morning. Lying in bed that night, tormented, Mladen attempts to get some input and advice from Marija by saying he's got something important to tell her while looking ready to finally clue her in on what's going on. However, following his long-winded introduction, she decisively interrupts him, thinking he's about to go into a whiny tale of what's bothering him in general. She further tells him to concentrate on Nemanja rather than on himself.  That morning, Mladen shows up at the bridge and finds the plastic bag containing a loaded hand-gun, a letter with instructions and a message that promises a cash advance will be in his building mail box the next day. The letter also gives Mladen a contact name Miloš Ilić along with a PO box number. While Mladen is reading the letter in his Renault, a white [[BMW]] is seen leaving the scene.  A day later, Mladen takes Nemanja to school who's bothered by the fact that all the kids in his class saw the ad. On the way back Mladen finds €3,000 cash in his mail slot along with the intended victim's photo ID and address. The target is Petar Ivković, the owner of Mopex Trading Company. Using the instructions he's been provided about Ivković's habits, Mladen scopes out his apartment and watches him enter his [[Toyota Land Cruiser|Toyota Land Cruiser 100 series]] SUV to go to work in the morning. Along with a well dressed man, Mladen also spots a blonde woman and a little girl running to embrace Ivković - obviously his wife and daughter. Upon having a closer look, Mladen realizes that it is the blonde woman from the playground. While the little girl is the one that Nemanja plays and goes to school with. Deeply conflicted, Mladen goes to work where he takes out his frustration on the office equipment.  Soon, Nemanja has another heart episode and is rushed to the hospital once again, but this time the doctor wants him to stay for observation, repeating that the surgery needs to be done as soon as possible. The new development puts even more strain on Mladen and Marija, as they ponder their future course of action while taking turns being with Nemanja at the hospital during the day. Both realize that something needs to be done fast. Mladen is mulling over the preparations for the murder, none of which can be discussed with her, while Marija is growing impatient with what looks to her like his lack of action and answers.  Finally, late one night while Marija is at the hospital watching over Nemanja, Mladen drinks a glass of water, prepares the hand- gun, and goes out into the night. At the same time while he is waiting in front of Ivković's apartment, Nemanja gets another attack and a horrified Marija calls the nurse for help. Meanwhile, Ivković's SUV pulls up, he exits, Mladen approaches and following a short verbal exchange fires a succession of bullets at Ivković, killing him instantly. Simultaneously, Nemanja is fighting for his life as his pulse drops, but the doctors somehow manage to stabilize his condition. After the murder, a distraught Mladen is back home where he hides the gun and compulsively washes his clothes clean of powder residue. Emotionally drained, Marija also arrives home and gets very angry to see Mladen after the rough night she endured. Perplexed and completely disconnected from each other, they're barely on speaking terms. She finally implores him to say and do something in order to start dealing with this situation, but distracted and overwrought with guilt over what he did, he just tells her to move away from him. From that night they start sleeping in separate beds.  During Petar's funeral, Mladen watches the procession from a distance and sees the man who hired him giving condolences to Petar's widow Jelena. Petar's brother (played by Vuk Kostić) gives an emotional and impassioned speech vowing to find the killers and get revenge.  Mladen next wants to collect the rest of the money agreed upon after the murder, but has troubles reaching the man that had promised it to him. He also sends a letter to the contact PO box, but finds out that it doesn't even exist. Mladen realizes he was used by the man, about whom he only knows one thing: that he knew the late Ivković. To that end, Mladen starts following Ivković's widow, hoping to get some leads. However, he only finds her collapsing on a park bench while taking her daughter out to play. Mladen takes her to the hospital, and, after coming to, she tells him that she took a little more sedatives than usual and that she didn't want to kill herself despite the fact that even the doctors don't believe her. She finds comfort in talking to someone who is not from her late husband's "business" milieu. She tells him she is aware that she's receiving phony condolences from many of her late husband's friends and is convinced the murderer came from there. She also lets on that she knows her husband to have been involved in all kinds of dodgy stuff by saying that all of them knew his one side, but adds that he was the love of her life and was wonderful to her and her two daughters. Deeply conflicted and torn, Mladen is visibly troubled with the fact that he's listening and comforting the woman whose husband he just killed. While she's thanking him for all he's done for her, his conscience can't take it anymore and he excuses himself and quickly leaves.  Mladen's descent continues. Tormented by guilt and crushed by the fact he can't collect the rest of the money, he stumbles around the city drunk and gets into a fight with some arrogant youngsters, smashing the windshield of their [[Mercedes Benz|Mercedes]] with a large rock. After getting beaten, he is taken to a police-station where he spends the night in custody. The next day, when questioned about the incident with the youngsters, he suddenly admits to killing Petar Ivković and tells the inspector (Milorad Mandić) every single detail of how it went down. The Inspector, however, claims to not believe a word of it and sends Mladen home while admonishing him for "wasting valuable police time on nonsense".  Mladen comes home where Marija has had just about enough of his mysterious and days-long disappearances, which she sees as his failure to deal with the situation properly and even abandonment of his family. She confronts him verbally for withdrawing inwards, calling him a "good-for-nothing weakling". In the middle of her rant, he can't take it any longer and slaps her across the face.  Later, Mladen gets a call from the man who hired him, who threatens that he will kill him and Nemanja if he keeps talking about his deed. After hearing a gypsy speaking on the other end of the phone, Mladen realizes where his antagonist is and rushes into his car and starts following the man's silver [[BMW]]. After following the man to his home, a massive compound on the outskirts of [[Belgrade]], Mladen realizes what needs to be done. He returns to his small apartment and takes his hand-gun, loads it and heads to the compound. Mladen creeps inside and deliberately activates the BMW's security system. When the man comes outside to see why it is chirping, Mladen appears, pointing a pistol at him and asking for his money. The man confesses that he is indebted to over 500,000 and begs of Mladen to kill him, claiming that he would rather get shot in the forehead than chopped to pieces by the thugs that he is indebted to. Mladen leaves him and sits by the swimming-pool, where he gets a call from his wife, who says that somebody put  30,000 in their bank account.  Afterwards, Mladen goes to Petar's wife and tells her that he killed her husband (this is revealed to be the scene from the beginning of the film in which he is seen speaking to an unidentified individual). He offers her the opportunity to kill him with the same gun he used to kill Petar. She declines and instructs him to leave, which Mladen does, leaving the gun behind on the table. As he leaves he sees Petar's brother approach the home with Petar's daughter, who waves to Mladen. Mladen waves back and gets in his car and stops at a red light, remaining still even once the light turns green (anticipating that Petar's widow will inform Petar's brother of the story, and that Petar's brother will make good on his vow to avenge Petar's death). Eventually a black SUV pulls up and shoots Mladen in his car (the shooter presumed to be Petar's brother). Whether Mladen is dead or just injured is left ambiguous as the film ends.

A Kitten for Hitler
 In the winter of 1941, a Jewish woman and her young son, Lenny, are watching a [[newsreel]] at a [[Brooklyn]] [[movie theater]]. A reel featuring [[Adolf Hitler]] appears on screen, sparking loud disapproval from the audience. Lenny asks his mother why no one likes Hitler, and his mother explains Hitler's atrocities. Lenny wonders aloud what [[Santa Claus]] will give him for Christmas, but his mother replies Hitler won't get anything for Christmas.  This prompts Lenny to travel alone to Germany to give Hitler a kitten for Christmas, hoping it will soften Hitler's heart and make him reconsider his actions. Upon Lenny's arrival, he presents the boxed gift to Hitler, who fears it's a bomb, and tosses it to his mistress, [[Eva Braun]]. She opens it to discover a kitten, which she gives to Hitler, who is moved to tears.

Knocked Up
 Alison Scott ([[Katherine Heigl]]) is a career-minded woman who has just been given an on-air role with [[E!]] and is living in the pool house with her sister Debbie's ([[Leslie Mann]]) family. Ben Stone ([[Seth Rogen]]) is laid-back and sardonic. He lives off funds received in compensation for an injury and sporadically works on a celebrity porn website with his roommates ([[Jay Baruchel]], [[Jonah Hill]], [[Jason Segel]] and [[Martin Starr]]), in between smoking marijuana or going off with them at theme parks such as [[Knott's Berry Farm]]. While celebrating her promotion, Alison meets Ben at a local nightclub. After a night of drinking, they end up having sex. Due to a misunderstanding, they don't use protection: Alison uses the phrase "Just do it already" to encourage Ben to put the condom on, but he misinterprets this to mean to dispense with using one. The following morning, they quickly learn over breakfast that they have little in common and go their separate ways, which leaves Ben visibly upset.  Eight weeks later, Alison experiences [[morning sickness]] during an interview with [[James Franco]] and realizes she could be pregnant. She contacts Ben for the first time since their one-night stand to tell him. Although insensitive at first, Ben says he will be there to support Alison. While he is still unsure about being a parent, his father ([[Harold Ramis]]) is excited. Alison's mother ([[Joanna Kerns]]) tries to persuade her daughter to have an abortion, but Alison decides to keep the child. Later, Alison and Ben decide to give their relationship a chance. The couple's efforts include Ben making an awkward marriage proposal with an empty ring box, promising to get her one someday. Alison thinks it's too early to think about marriage, because she is more concerned with hiding the pregnancy from her bosses, believing that they will fire her if they ever found out. After a somewhat promising beginning, tensions surface in the relationship.  Alison is increasingly worried about Ben's lack of responsibility and commitment, and has doubts about the longevity of their relationship. These thoughts are due to her sister's unhappy marriage. Debbie's husband, Pete ([[Paul Rudd]]), works as a talent scout for rock bands, but he leaves at odd hours in the night, which makes her suspect he is having an affair. Upon investigating, she learns that he is actually part of a [[fantasy baseball]] draft, and that he has been doing other activities such as going to the movies on his own, which he explains he participates in to be free from Debbie's controlling manner. This results in their separation, and when Ben expresses amusement at Pete's deception, it leads to a heated argument with Alison as they drive to her doctor. Angered, she ejects him from her car and abandons him in the middle of a busy street. He tracks her down to her appointment and they both start another argument, leading to their own breakup. Ben and Pete decide to go on a road trip to [[Las Vegas]].  Under the heavy influence of [[Psilocybe cubensis|psychedelic mushrooms]], they realize their loss and decide to take responsibility for their relationships. Simultaneously, Debbie drags a timid Alison out partying with her, but they are refused admission to a nightclub by its apologetic bouncer ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]) on account of Debbie's age and Alison's pregnancy, leading to Debbie's tearful laments about her life and her desire to have Pete back. They reconcile at their daughter's birthday party, but when Ben tries to work things out with Alison, she doesn't want to get back together. Alison's boss finds out about her pregnancy, and sees an opportunity to boost ratings with female viewers by having Alison interview pregnant celebrities. After a talk with his father, Ben decides to take responsibility and goes to great effort to change his ways, including moving out of his friends' house, getting an office job as a web designer, and creating a baby's room in his new apartment.  He also starts reading the pregnancy books that he had purchased early on. When Alison goes into labor and is unable to contact her doctor, she calls Ben, as Debbie and Pete are at [[Legoland California Resort|Legoland]]. Ben discovers that the [[gynecologist]] they had been seeing ([[Loudon Wainwright III|Loudon Wainwright]]) is out of town, at  a Bar Mitzvah, despite having assured them that he never took vacations. Ben calls him and leaves a furious voicemail, threatening murder. During labor, Alison apologizes for doubting Ben's commitment and admits that she never thought the man who got her pregnant would be the right one for her. When Debbie and Pete arrive at the hospital, Ben adamantly refuses to allow her to be at Alison's side, insisting that it's his place. Debbie is both furious and impressed that Ben took charge of the situation and begins to change her formerly negative opinion about him. The couple welcomes a baby girl (a boy in the alternate ending) and settle down happily together in a new apartment in [[Los Angeles]].

Lake Dead
 Three sisters, Brielle, Kelli, and Sam, are on a college break. They discover that their grandfather has just died  and he has left them a motel in his will. Their father, John, tries to persuade them not to go, but the sisters ignore him and head off, accompanied by their friends: Tanya, Ben, Bill, and Bill's girlfriend, Amy. Sam is the first to arrive, and while drinking wine in Room 6, two inbreds forcefully enter and attack Sam, where with a collection of duct tape, an iron bar, and an axe, they bind Sam's legs with the tape, place the iron bar beside her ankles, and use the axe head to force the bar through both her ankles. Afterwards, the three are in a boat, where the inbreds tie a badly beaten Sam's legs to a concrete block, and dump her into the water, where she is still alive as the concrete block pulls her beneath the water, where she drowns. The rest drive to the motel and meet the caretaker, an old lady who appears kind. After finding a lake on their property, the group of friends take a swim, not noticing that Sam's dead body is floating in the lake beneath them. After the swim, the friends return to their trailer, where they set up a small campsite. Bill and Tanya go out to the woods to get some firewood, and end up having sex (much to the chagrin of Amy). After encounters with large, strange-looking, unkempt men, the friends are terrified. Bill, Tanya, and Amy are butchered, while the remaining friends escape but are picked up by a mysterious, pushy cop. He tricks them into coming back to the motel where everything slowly falls into place. It is later revealed that the cop and caretaker are all a part of the evil scheme to make Brielle and Kelli a part of their devious plans. The cop and caretaker are in fact son and mother, respectively, and their family has been perpetuated by incest for generations (hence the inbred characteristics of the two aforementioned unkempt men). It becomes apparent that the girls' father had rejected the family "tradition" and escaped. Their grandmother found out about this and concocted the inheritance scheme to lure the sisters to the motel so that her son could forcibly impregnate them and continue the family line. Sam was killed, however, because she was not their real sister, but she was adopted. The sisters manage to overcome joining their family's footsteps. Ben seemingly manages to kill both of the inbred men and attempts to rescue the girls from the barn where the cop has taken Brielle to rape her (in the process the grandmother is shot in the head by Ben). When they arrive at the barn Ben is shot unexpectedly by the cop, but the girls' worried father, John, shows up at the last minute and kills his brother, stating "That's how you fuck family", and ending the gruesome tradition. John takes his daughters and the still alive Ben to a hospital. At the end of the movie, four teenagers are shown going into the motel to see if it is abandoned. One of the teenagers has strange feelings about going into the motel; it turns out that one of the inbreds has survived. The inbred man stares at the girls from behind a tree and then screams.

Lars and the Real Girl
 Lars Lindstrom lives a secluded life in a small [[Wisconsin]] town. It is gradually revealed that his mother died when he was born, causing his grief-stricken father to be a distant parent to Lars and his older brother, Gus. Gus left town as soon as he could support himself, returning only to inherit his half of the household when the father died.  The inheritance has been divided between the brothers: Lars lives in the converted garage; Gus and his pregnant wife Karin live in the house proper. Karin's attempts to invite Lars into the house for a family meal are usually unsuccessful; when he does come, conversation is difficult and he doesn't stay long. He avoids social contact, finding it difficult to interact with his family, co-workers, or members of his church. A co-worker, Margo, is interested in him, but he avoids anything more than brief encounters.  One day a large package arrives; that evening Lars tells Gus and Karin that he has a visitor whom he met via the [[Internet]], a [[wheelchair]]-mobile [[missionary]] of [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] and [[Danes|Danish]] descent named Bianca. They discover that Bianca is a lifelike doll which Lars apparently ordered from an adult website. Concerned about his mental health, they convince Lars to take Bianca for a checkup to the [[family doctor]], Dagmar, who is also a [[psychiatrist]]. Dagmar diagnoses Bianca with [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]] and advises Lars to bring her in for weekly treatments. Her aim is to have regular contact with Lars, hoping to get to the root of his behavior. She explains to Gus and Karin that his delusion is a manifestation of an underlying problem that needs to be addressed. She urges them to assist with his therapy by treating Bianca as a real person.  Lars begins to introduce Bianca as his girlfriend to the townspeople. Due to their concern for Lars, everyone treats Bianca as a real person. Lars soon finds himself interacting more with people. During this time, Margo has begun to date another co-worker, which silently bothers Lars.  Lars asks his brother when he knew he had become a man and what being a man means. Gus says when he began doing the right things for the right reasons, even when it hurts. Gus gives several examples, including their father keeping them, and taking care of them, even though he didn't know how. Gus says that he never should have left Lars alone with their father, and he apologizes for being selfish. Their conversation seems to reach Lars and his dependence on Bianca immediately seems to  shift.  When a co-worker with whom Margo has been playing [[Practical joke|pranks]] goes a bit too far, Lars comforts her. During the ensuing conversation, Margo reveals she has broken up with her boyfriend. She invites Lars to go [[bowling]], which he initially declines before reconsidering. The two spend a pleasant evening together along with some other townsfolk. Lars is quick to remind Margo he could never cheat on Bianca. Although obviously disappointed, Margo replies that the thought never crossed her mind. As they part, Lars takes his glove off to shake Margo's hand – a significant advance in his ability to interact with others; he earlier explained to the doctor that others' touch felt like "burning".  One morning soon after, Lars announces that Bianca is unresponsive, and an ambulance rushes her to the hospital. Once there, he tells his family that her [[prognosis]] is not good and that Bianca would like to be brought home. The news spreads through town, and everyone whose life has been touched by Bianca sends flowers or sits with Lars at the Lindstrom home. Gus and Karin ask Dagmar why this is happening, and she reveals that it indicates a significant shift for Lars. They suggest that Lars and Bianca join them for a visit to the lake. While the couple is hiking, Lars gives Bianca a very sad farewell kiss. As Gus and Karin make their way back from the hike, they discover despondent Lars in the lake with a 'dying' Bianca.  Bianca is given a full-fledged funeral that is well-attended by the townspeople. After Bianca is buried in the local cemetery, Lars and Margo linger at the grave site. When Margo states that she should catch up with everyone else, Lars asks her to take a walk with him instead, to which she happily agrees.

With them goes one of the little boys of the family, who was dressed as a girl in order not to be killed. Meanwhile, a handsome Turkish officer ([[Moritz Bleibtreu]]) falls in love with Aram's daughter and makes an aggressive attempt to deliver her from certain death, even as the circumstances surrounding him attest to the astounding difficulty of doing so.

The Lark (2007 film)
 The film opens with the a woman, Niamh ([[Mary Woodvine]]), dragging a body in from the cold, white out-side into what looks like a disused run-down factory who's walls are covered in strange, cryptical maps that seem to not make any sense. She is wearing a blue boiler suit and a respirator. The body "Sean" (Ian Marshall) is also dressed in a blue boiler suit and appears badly wounded (from one of the traps). Niamh calls out for "Doc" and "Friday" although nobody appears. Sean and Niamh appear to know each other but as they exchange words two children appear asking what is going on. Niamh tells them that Sean has been out-side without his respirator and is very ill. She tells the children to go back to their room and wait for her. Sean quips that he is fine and asks if they want some sweeties. The children disappear. Sean repeats that he is 'fine' over and over again then tells her he can smell bread, she agrees she can then continues to drag him through the endless corridors. Later, Niamh is frantically cleaning the trail of blood on the floor. Rory and Roison, her children, appear and ask if they can help look for respirators. Later they are in their room where Niamh tells them that Sean has left them some sweeties. After reading them a bedtime story she sings them to sleep.  Niamh starts talking to her friend Doc (Phil Jacobs), they talk about Sean and she asks him to re-set the traps. She doesn't acknowledge that he is not dressed in a boiler suit and he seems matter-of-fact about the situation, but Niamh is tense. As she goes to search for more respirators she starts imagining strange images and noises. We see an old style film recording of Niamh in normal clothes having a picnic. It abruptly cuts back to Niamh presently. A while later she hears a noise coming from the main door. Doc notes that he thought Niamh had set the traps. As Niamh turns to respond Doc has vanished. She goes to investigate. Two people are now inside the building also wearing boiler suits and carrying torches. Niamh follows them and eventually corners them in a small room demanding to know how they have been walking outside without respirators and what they are doing here. The man "Jackson" (Mark Pearce) and the woman "Siobhan" ([[Helen Rule]]) claim they are looking for Sean. Niamh stops interrogating them and asks them to follow her. They seem bewildered at Niamh's obsession with the strangely marked maps on the wall and eventually they end up in another room where Niamh informs Jackson that he will be sleeping there. He doesn't seem keen on being split up from Siobhan and Niamh asks her if they sleep together. Siobhan laughs at this and says the fact Jackson will be in the small room on his own serves as 'poetic justice'. Niamh seems puzzled at this comment but does not ask any questions. Siobhan remarks to Jackson that Niamh knows her name. She then leads Siobhan on another journey to her room where Siobhan tenderly asks Niamh how she can sleep in a place like this. Niamh rejects Siobhan's kindness and leaves her alone in the room. Later on Niamh catches Jackson and Siobhan looking for respirators, Siobhan shows Niamh some sweets she had found claiming they know they belong to Sean. Niamh takes to some of her maps and asks them to make all the maps 'right'. She tells them they either do it or go.   Niamh continues to have strange visions and dreams and when Doc appears he tells them it could be handy having Jackson and Siobhan there as they hold the 'secrets' she needs for her survival. She goes to see Jackson and Siobhan in Jackson's room armed with alcohol and food and claims it's time for a celebration. Jackson gets mad but Siobhan tries to calm him down. They end up getting drunk. Siobhan recognises a song that Niamh sings (A variant of [[A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me]]) and tells Niamh that her father taught it to her, Niamh claims she can't remember where she heard it. Siobhan goes back to her room and leaves the remaining two on their own. Niamh asks Jackson why the tense atmosphere  and after a confrontation Niamh storm out. She goes to her sleeping children and carries them away as she is now getting concerned about Siobhan and Jackson's presence. She begs Doc for help and they carry the children to the main door. Doc hands Rory back to Niamh who crumples to the floor, she cries out to Doc who simply appears to vanish. Niamh is left sobbing with her children unable to escape her 'prison'.  Angry, she goes to see Jackson desperately begging for the secrets. She asks if he's married, he replies he once was and shows her pictures of his children but she refuses to look at them and runs off. They soon begin to realise that Siobhan is missing and when they find blood in her room Niamh accuses Jackson of murdering her. He denies it and shows Niamh papers he says are the secrets that Niamh has been searching for. Niamh runs away from him and he pursues her. She realises her children are no longer there either. She tries to run from Jackson leading him around the maze of corridors and rooms. Her voice echos around the building as Jackson pursues her in desperation as he catches up with her he falls to his death through a hole in the floor Niamh had stumbled across before when she was looking for respirators.  We discover in flashbacks that Niamh was suffering depression and had drugged her children and then tried to drug herself unsuccessfully, her children dying as a result. Jackson was her husband, Siobhan was her sister and Sean was her Father. All other characters were figments of her imagination. This sudden realisation brings her back down to earth as the police break into the building, which is a dis-used mental asylum she was once a patient at. She is taken away by police, having now murdered the rest of her family.  
The Last Mimzy
 Presented as a story to a group of students by their teacher Lena that takes place in the distant future, ''The Last Mimzy'' is the story of the attempt by humans in the distant future to avert a catastrophic [[ecological disaster]] that has destroyed their world. Humanity has become "isolated and warlike," and one scientist is desperately working to save the earth and its people. [[High tech|High-tech]] devices disguised as [[toy]]s are sent back in time, where they are found by Noah (Chris O'Neil) and Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) Wilder, children living in early-21st-century [[Seattle]]. The "toys" are incomprehensible to them, except for what appears to be a [[Stuffed animal|stuffed]] [[rabbit]]. Sensing the paranormal strangeness of the devices, the children initially keep their discovery secret from their parents.  Emma becomes telepathically connected to the stuffed rabbit, and learns its name, Mimzy, and other information from it, acknowledging it as her teacher. Interaction with the devices causes the children to develop advanced knowledge, [[genius]]-level [[intelligence]] and [[psionic]] abilities. Due to her psychic connection with Mimzy, Emma's development of her abilities is much stronger than her older brother's; she is the only one to display [[empathy]], [[telepathy]], [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]], and [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]] (though Noah can also communicate with her once she has telepathically contacted him). Emma is also the only one who can use the Spinners, strange rocks that when spun, telekinetically float and produce a force-field. Noah's own psionic/physic abilities are developed through a green card and a [[seashell]]. He gains increased intelligence, knowledge, telepathy, empathic communication and control over [[arthropods]]. He can also use the card to telekinetically [[teleportation|teleport]] objects through a small [[dimensional rift]] after staring at it and observing his surroundings. At one point, Noah becomes somewhat envious of his sister's psionic prowess, but she reveals to him that even though she is the "chosen one', he is her chosen "engineer" and she cannot "build the bridge to the future" without him.  The children's astounding [[List of psychic abilities|psionic]] and [[Extrasensory perception|extrasensory]] abilities and Emma's attachment to Mimzy alert their parents, especially their mother, and Larry White, Noah's science schoolteacher, to the devices. Later, Noah accidentally fuses the card with a blue blob, turning it into a Generator that causes a [[power outage|power black-out]] over half the state of Washington, alerting the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to their activities. The family is held for questioning by Special Agent Nathaniel Broadman ([[Michael Clarke Duncan]]), and it is revealed that Mimzy is actually a highly advanced form of [[Synthetic life|artificial life]] utilizing [[nanotechnology]] created by [[Intel Corporation|Intel]]. Emma tells everyone that Mimzy has a message from humanity's distant future. She explains that [[pollution]] has corrupted humanity's [[DNA]], and many toy rabbits like Mimzy have been sent to the past, since no natural life forms can survive time travel, but none have successfully returned. Mimzy is the last one remaining, but she is now beginning to disintegrate. The reason for the other Mimzys' deaths is that the "chosen ones" before Emma had no "engineers" (like Noah) to help build the bridge across time. Emma and Noah must build the bridge by using the other toys to activate a [[Time travel|time portal]], so that they can return Mimzy to the future with uncorrupted 21st-century human DNA that the people of the future can use to correct the damage to their DNA caused by ecological problems.  Despite attempts by the unbelieving FBI to prevent them, Noah and Emma use their psionic abilities to escape so that they can activate the portal. Before leaving, Mimzy absorbs a [[Tears|tear]] from Emma, thus providing the DNA required to restore humanity's corrupted DNA. Emma is almost sucked into the future with Mimzy, but Noah grabs Emma and pulls her out of the portal just as Mimzy is sent back to its own time. Following the transport, Noah's science teacher, who was present at the event, claims that he saw "numbers", a reference to a previous dream he had with numbers in it, which turned out to be the winning lottery numbers, but missed out because he never bought a ticket—thus exciting his fiancée about this second opportunity. Back in the future setting, Mimzy is returned to the future, and humans are finally able to restore their DNA and abandon their protective suits, and more importantly, repair the "mental corruption" that stripped most of them of their feelings toward each other. The teacher ends the story time and the children levitate and fly home. The world in their time has become a beautiful place, where humanity has integrated into the reconstructed [[ecosystem]]s.  The story ends in the current time, with Emma's teacher (Julia Arkos) asking if anyone did anything exciting over the weekend break. No one volunteers, so she calls on Emma at random, who merely smiles.  
The Last Lear
 The story revolves around Harish Mishra ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]), a retired Shakespearean theatre actor who spent precisely thirty years and nine months on stage and then suddenly quit, and his first and last act as a cinema artist. He is immensely passionate about Shakespeare, believes that nothing even comparable can ever be written, knows all his plays by heart, lives in those stories, condemns modern cinema and considers theatre as a much higher artform for directors and actors to convey their message to an audience.  It is Diwali, a time when box offices are flooded with new releases and Shabnam ([[Preity Zinta]]) has to attend the premiere of her latest movie: ''The Mask''. However, she decides to visit her co-star Harish and heads to a cubbyhole of old Kolkata where Harish is bedridden in a coma. He is being taken care by Vandana ([[Shefali Shah]]) and a nurse, Ivy ([[Divya Dutta]]). Vandana treats Shabnam with spite as she blames her and the entire cast and crew for Harish's condition. But soon they are seen bonding over tea and are involved in a conversation about Harish. In flashbacks, their story and equation with Harish emerges.  The movie sees parallel narration from Goutam ([[Jisshu Sengupta]]), a journalist who recalls his encounters with the veteran actor. He had suggested Harish for the lead role to his elder brother Siddharth ([[Arjun Rampal]]) who happens to be an ambitious perfectionist director.

The Last Legion
 The film is narrated by Ambrosinus, native to Britain, who knows of a legend concerning the sword of [[Julius Caesar]], which was hidden away from evil men. It begins shortly before the coronation of [[Romulus Augustulus]] as [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] in [[anno Domini|AD]] 475.  Having travelled through much of the known world in search of Caesar's sword, Ambrosinus has then become the tutor to the young Romulus. A [[Druid]] and part of a secret brotherhood protecting the sword, he at times gives the impression he is a magician, but his "magic" is usually revealed to be simple trickery. One of the running concepts of the movie surrounds the question of whether or not Ambrosinus has any actual magical abilities or simply an illusionist. Romulus's father [[Flavius Orestes|Orestes]] rules Rome but is not Emperor himself.  On the day before the coronation, [[Odoacer]], commander of the barbarian [[Goths]] allied with Rome, demands a third of [[Italian Peninsula|Italy]] from Orestes, but is rebuffed. The same day, Romulus meets the general of the Nova Invicta Legion, Aurelianus Caius Antonius, called "[[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius]]".  The night after Romulus is crowned, Rome is attacked by the Goths. Most of Aurelius's men, pledged to protect the emperor, are killed, though Aurelius is only stunned and left for dead. Orestes and his wife are killed by Odoacer's lieutenant Wulfila, who captures Romulus.  The next day, Odoacer, now ruler of the [[Western Roman Empire|Western Empire]], plans to have Romulus killed. However, Ambrosinus convinces Odoacer to spare the boy. Instead, Romulus is exiled to [[Capri]] along with Ambrosinus, guarded by Wulfila and his men. His prison is a villa constructed more than four centuries earlier by the emperor [[Tiberius]].  With Ambrosinus's help, Romulus discovers a hidden chamber within the villa. He comes across a statue of Caesar holding the fabled sword, forged by a [[Chalybes|Chalybian]] smith after his [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|military campaigns in Britain]]. Writing near the statue's feet proclaims the sword was made for "he who is destined to rule". This is interpreted as a prophecy by various characters, and Romulus keeps the weapon.  The two are rescued from Capri by the loyal Aurelius and three surviving legionaries, Vatrenus, Batiatus, and Demetrius, accompanied by a female agent of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]] – an [[Indian people|Indian]] warrior named Mira. They take Romulus to a seaport where the Eastern Roman Empire's emissary (whom Mira works for) and the [[Roman Senate|senator]] Nestor have promised safe passage to [[Constantinople]]. However, they barely escape after they learn the Senate and the Eastern Empire have betrayed them and sided with Odoacer.  Ambrosinus persuades Romulus to seek refuge in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], where the [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth Legion]] (called the Dragon Legion) may remain loyal, being far from the events. They are followed by Wulfila and his men; the Goth covets Caesar's sword after learning the prophecy. Crossing the [[Alps]] and the [[English Channel]], the party travels to [[Hadrian's Wall]] and initially find no evidence of the legion until a farmer approaches and reveals he was its commanding general. With the collapse of Roman support of Britain, the legion had decided to disband and settle as farmers. Most of the men in the legion had married and had families. They also did not want to antagonise the powerful warlord [[Vortigern|Vortgyn]]. During their stay in the small [[Celts|Celtic]] village, Romulus meets and befriends a young girl named [[Igraine]]. Aurelius and Mira practice swordfighting and become close to each other. Ambrosinus told Romulus of a scar on his chest, similar to the design on the sword hilt, which he received from Vortgyn after he refused to tell him where the sword of Caesar was.  Vortgyn also desires the sword of Caesar as he aspires to rule the whole of Britain. It is revealed that Vortgyn and Ambrosinus are old enemies. After meeting with the Goths, Vortgyn decides to either capture or kill Romulus as a gesture to Odoacer. After confronting Igraine outside of the village, he convinces her to tell everyone in the village to surrender Romulus and has several of his men kill the blacksmith's wife and sons. When a tearful Igraine tells the villagers of what has happened, Aurelius confesses that Romulus is the emperor of Rome. The blacksmith then demands revenge on his wife's and sons' deaths, and Aurelius and his men decide to lead an army to Hadrian's Wall to face Vortgyn's armies in one final battle.  Before leaving the village, Romulus receives from Igraine a suit of Roman armour which belonged to her brother, which he has since outgrown. Aurelius, wielding Caesar's sword, leads his men and a small number of Celtic warriors against Vortgyn's forces at Hadrian's Wall. Mira, Batiatus, Demetrius, Romulus, and the archers pelt the infantry with arrows, while Aurelius, Vatrenus, and several Celtic soldiers struggled to hold the charging enemy at the open gate. Despite their casualties, Vortgyn's soldiers began to slowly overwhelm the small force on the wall. The battle appears hopeless until the rest of the Ninth Legion, having taken up their old Roman arms and uniforms, appear on the nearby ridgeline, and turn the tide of battle. The two warring sides cease their hostilities upon sighting Ambrosinus holding aloft Vortgyn's golden mask, after confronting and burning him alive at a tree-sanctuary of his secret brotherhood close to the battlefield.  After having fought and severely injured Aurelius, Wulfila is confronted by Romulus who is armed with Caesar's sword. Romulus stabs Wulfila in the chest, saying "that's for my mother", pauses, and further impales him, saying "that's for my father". He tells Aurelius that he fought like a dragon, whereupon Aurelius replies that Romulus fought like the son of a dragon.  Repulsed by the deaths in the battle, Romulus heaves away his sword which remarkably pierces a large rock and becomes lodged there. Many years later, Ambrosinus, now known by his Druid name, [[Merlin]], takes a young boy to the battlefield to describe the now legendary events. Merlin, who has visibly aged little since the battle, says that Aurelius married Mira and the two raised Romulus as their own son. He became a wise ruler, took the girl Igraine as his wife, and adopted the name "[[Uther Pendragon|Pendragon]]". The boy, Arthur, recognises Romulus as his father and Igraine as his mother.  In a final scene, the sword of Julius Caesar is shown embedded in the stone, with moss growing on the blade, covering the original inscription, leaving only the [[Latin]] letters which, when read as a single word, read [[Excalibur]].

Life is all merry and mirth till she espies Lee & co, attempting an assassination of sorts on a minister. The bid fails, but Chellama is shocked and so are we. Why would this bunch want to take a crack at the murky world of politics and cricket?  Well, the answer unspools back into a college where Lee and his team are raring to go as footballers and cricketers. They have a committed mentor in Butthiran ([[Prakash Raj]]). Though a coach, he is a friend, philosopher and guide kind of omnibus figure for the youngsters. Just when the boys are making the right progress, problem erupts in the form of Rangabashyam ([[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]]). He is a scumbag, but also the college principal, and he wants his son to be in this all-conquering team.  The coach, with Chappellesque firmness, says no to this and wants to pick his team on merit. But the principal kicks out the team with its coach out of the college itself. So they gravitate towards another college and again start doing well as a team. And when they win a big and prestigious tournament, Rangabashyam throws up a major spanner in the works.  He scuttles the rise of Lee and co. The stifling is so bad that one member commits suicide and the team slowly disintegrates, while on the other hand, Rangabashyam rises up in the big bad world of politics. He ends up as a minister. The rest of the movie deals with the conflicts between the two.

The Life Before Her Eyes

While awaiting the final days of high school in the lush springtime, Diana tests her limits with sex and drugs as her more conservative friend Maureen ([[Eva Amurri]]) watches with concern. Then the two teens are involved in a [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]]-like shooting incident at their school and are forced to make an impossible choice.  The film mostly focuses on Diana’s adulthood ([[Uma Thurman]]). She leads an apparently normal life as an art history university professor. She has a daughter, Emma (Gabrielle Brennan), and she’s married to the professor who once gave a speech in her school about the power of visualization, how one can shape one’s own future in this way.  However, Diana continues to feel guilty about something that doesn’t let her sleep.  One day she gets a call from Emma’s school, where the nuns running the school complain about Emma's behavior.  At an ice cream parlor, Diana asks Emma not to hide any more as she is always doing; Emma responds to her mother's reproaches with the claim that Diana hates her. They leave the parlor abruptly and as they’re about to get into the car, Diana sees her husband with another woman. She hesitates about confronting him and instead remains in the middle of the street where she is hit by a pickup truck. On her way to the hospital she imagines that blood is escaping from her body.  In reality, she hasn’t been hurt by the accident.  Instead, Diana is remembering the complications she had following an abortion in her high school days.  The day of the 15th anniversary of the shooting, a memorial is held at the school. Diana drives in front of the school several times until she finally decides to stop and bring in some flowers. As she enters the school she’s asked whether she’s one of the survivors. She smiles and walks inside, first leaving flowers on some desks and then moving on to the rest rooms where one of the shootings took place. At that moment she gets a call from Emma’s school informing her that her daughter is missing and that a pink piece of clothing has been found in the woods. She drives there and walks through the woods, shouting out her daughter's name. Emma appears before Diana’s eyes for a moment but then vanishes almost as soon as she has appeared.  It is revealed what occurred fifteen years earlier in the washroom where Diana left the flowers.  She and Maureen had been forced to decide who would survive when confronted by the shooter, Michael Patrick ([[John Magaro]]).  Though Maureen had offered herself first, the shooter questioned why Diana should not die.  In response, Diana agreed to be killed and was shot by Michael, who then killed himself.  At that moment, Diana dreamed the adult life she thought she would have if she let Maureen die and Emma was the child she would have had if she had not gone through the abortion.    At the anniversary, Diana is asked once again if she is a survivor.  She replies "No" with a smile, with a sense of relief that she did the right thing by dying and having her friend live her life.  
Lions for Lambs
 Two students at a West Coast university, Arian and Ernest, at the urging of their idealistic professor, Dr. Malley, attempt to do something important with their lives. They make the bold decision to enlist in the army to fight in Afghanistan after graduating from college.  Dr. Malley also attempts to reach talented and privileged, but disaffected, student Todd Hayes, who is not at all like Arian and Ernest. He is naturally bright, comes from a privileged background, but has apparently slipped into apathy upon being disillusioned at the present state of affairs. Now, he devotes most of his time to extra-curricular activities like his role as president of his [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]]. Malley tests him by offering a choice between a respectable grade of 'B' in the class with no additional work required or a final opportunity to re-engage with the material of the class and "do something." Before Todd makes his choice, he must listen to Dr. Malley's story of his former students Arian and Ernest and why they are in Afghanistan.  Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., a charismatic Republican presidential hopeful, [[United States Senate|Senator]] Jasper Irving, has invited liberal TV journalist Janine Roth to his office to announce a new war strategy in Afghanistan: the use of small units to seize strategic positions in the mountains before the [[Taliban]] can occupy them. The senator hopes that Roth's positive coverage will help convince the public that the plan is sound.  Roth has her doubts and fears she is being asked to become an instrument of government propaganda. She informs her commercially-minded boss of her plans to call out the senator's new strategy for what she feels is a ploy, but is shot down. Ultimately, Irving's version of the story is run without the critical interaction. Whether Roth gave in and toed the company line or quit her job is not clear.  In Afghanistan, a helicopter carrying Arian and Ernest is hit by Taliban insurgents. Ernest falls out, and Arian jumps after him. Ernest's leg is badly wounded, and he suffers a [[compound fracture]], rendering him immobile as the Taliban arrive. After a drawn-out gunfight, the U.S. soldiers run out of ammunition.

The Life of Reilly
 The film begins with Reilly recounting his childhood and his parents in New York City and [[Connecticut]]. We meet his family—an institutionalized father, a racist, baseball bat-wielding mother, and a lobotomized aunt, amongst others. "[[Eugene O’Neill]] would never get near this family," Reilly declares.     Prior to being put into an institution, Reilly’s father, a [[Paramount Pictures]] poster artist and illustrator, was offered the chance to go into business with another illustrator with the intention of making their first animated film in color together. The catch was simply that the senior Mr. Reilly would have to move himself and his family to California. Perhaps a defining moment in young Reilly’s life, his father asked his mother her thoughts and she unceremoniously rejected the possibility. The other illustrator went west without the senior Mr. Reilly as a partner. That other illustrator was named [[Walt Disney]].     After this missed opportunity, Reilly's father began drinking heavily and eventually had a nervous breakdown. Upon being institutionalized, the family was forced to move out of the Bronx up to Connecticut to live with Mrs. Reilly’s family.     When Reilly turned eighteen, he moved to New York City. "If you wanted to be an actor in those days," he explains, "You did something that’s really unheard of today… you studied."  Young and hungry (literally), Reilly managed to find an acting class at New School. Its rather liberal open door policy allowed aspiring actors admission even if they didn’t have the money to pay.     Reilly’s class was taught by a young, award-winning, soon-to-be-legendary actress, [[Uta Hagen]]. In the class were such future stars and notables as [[Steve McQueen]], [[Jerry Stiller]], [[Anne Meara]], [[Hal Holbrook]], [[Jason Robards]], [[Geraldine Page]] and [[Gene Hackman]]. It was a group of future [[Academy Award]], Tony Award and [[Emmy Award]] winners, and, as Charles explains, "We wanted to go on the stage, none of us had any money, and this entire list… couldn’t act for shit."     It was about this time when a friend of Reilly's arranged a meeting with a powerful [[NBC]] executive. Reilly went in and was told, "They don’t let queers on television." In retrospect, Reilly describes it as, "A short meeting." Despite the apparent prejudice against him, his talent and tenacity landed him on Broadway, winning his first Tony Award for his role in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'', as well as leading roles in the original Broadway casts of ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' and ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]''  Reilly went on to become a fixture in television appearing in numerous episodes of ''[[Car 54, Where Are You?]]'', ''[[The Ghost & Mrs. Muir (TV series)|The Ghost & Mrs. Muir]]'', and starring in ''[[Lidsville]]''. He also made hundreds of guest appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', second in number of appearances only to Bob Hope, and had a more recent [[Jose Chung's From Outer Space|memorable guest spot]] on ''[[The X-Files]]''. Over the years, he developed a habit of looking through the week’s ''[[TV Guide]]'' to see how many times he would be on TV that week. Coming in at over a hundred separate appearances, he reflected on the NBC executive who told him he would not be allowed on television—but now Reilly wondered, "Who do I have to fuck to get off?!"     Success came to Reilly’s professional life, and he has used all the knowledge and expertise he has gained through a lifetime spent acting to teach. His longtime friend [[Burt Reynolds]] gave him a theater in which to teach the craft of acting, and it has fulfilled Reilly ever since. As we leave him in what he calls "The twilight of an extraordinary life", we see a portrait of an artist, a victim of prejudice who rose above it, a trailblazing comedic personality, an entertainer, a son, a teacher, and a man laid bare for all to see.

Live Free or Die Hard
 The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] responds to a brief computer outage at its Cyber-Security Division by tracking down top [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hackers]] who had been on a watch list, finding several of them have been killed. The FBI asks [[New York City Police Department]] detective [[John McClane]] to bring in Matthew "Matt" Farrell, one of the many targeted hackers who had been put on the watch list. McClane arrives just in time to save Farrell from assassins working for Mai Linh, who works for her boss and love interest, Thomas Gabriel.  En route to [[Washington, D.C.]], with McClane, Farrell reveals that he had been contacted by Mai, under the guise that she was working for corporate security, and that she had paid him a large sum of money to write an [[algorithm]] that could crack a specific security system for [[White hat (computer security)|white hat]] purposes. Meanwhile, Gabriel orders his own crew of hackers to take control of the transportation grids and stock market, while nationally broadcasting a message threatening the United States. Farrell recognizes this as the start of a [[Cyberwarfare|"fire sale"]], an attack designed to target the nation's [[infrastructure]] that is reliant on computerized systems. McClane and Farrell are driven to the FBI headquarters, but Mai poses as a dispatcher and reroutes the convoy into the path of an assault helicopter. McClane manages to fend off the attackers and destroy the helicopter.  Gabriel initiates a second broadcast by showing a simulated explosion of the [[United States Capitol|U.S. Capitol]] building, causing a public panic. Farrell guesses that his next target is likely the power grid, and the two drive to a utility superstation in [[West Virginia]]. They find a team led by Mai taking over the station. McClane manages to kill all of them, including Mai. He obtains video footage of Gabriel which he relays to the FBI. Enraged over Mai's death, Gabriel seizes control of the natural gas distribution system and redirects all of the gas into the station. McClane and Farrell escape before the station explodes, leaving much of the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada without power.  Farrell takes McClane to fellow hacker Frederick "Warlock" Kaludis. Running several generators to keep his computer systems online, Warlock identifies the piece of code Farrell wrote as a means to access data at a master [[Social Security Administration]] building at [[Woodlawn, Baltimore County, Maryland|Woodlawn, Maryland]]. They realize the building is actually a [[National Security Agency|NSA]] facility intended to backup the nation's entire personal and financial records in the event of a cyber attack, designed by Gabriel himself when he worked for the NSA. Warlock tells McClane and Matt that Gabriel is an extremely talented programmer and top security expert for the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]]. Gabriel tried to alert the political and military leadership to critical weaknesses that made America's network infrastructure vulnerable to [[cyberwarfare]], but his unorthodox methods led to his dismissal. Warlock runs a [[traceroute]] and manages to identify Gabriel's location, but Gabriel detects the intrusion.  Gabriel taps into their connection and reveals that he has located McClane's estranged daughter, Lucy, and intends to kidnap her. McClane and Farrell race to the Woodlawn facility, where Farrell discovers that Gabriel's men are downloading all the information. He manages to encrypt the data just in time before he is captured. Gabriel kidnaps Farrell and takes him as well as Lucy, who had been kidnapped earlier, with him as his team flees from Woodlawn. McClane pursues Gabriel, hijacking his [[Semi-trailer truck|semi]] and enlisting Warlock to trace Gabriel's vehicle. Gabriel accesses the communication system of a [[F-35B|F-35B Lightning II]] and, impersonating the pilot's commanding officer, orders the pilot to attack the truck McClane is driving. McClane barely escapes, then makes his way to a nearby warehouse where Warlock has tracked Gabriel. There, Gabriel is installing the remaining files and holding Lucy and Farrell. Although McClane kills most of Gabriel's remaining henchmen, Emerson shoots him in the right shoulder.  While Gabriel holds McClane at gunpoint from behind, Gabriel taunts McClane, telling him his tombstone will read "always at the wrong place at the wrong time." McClane utters "How about yippie-ki-yay, motherfucker," before moving the barrel of the gun towards Gabriel's torso and pulling the trigger; the bullet shoots through McClane's shoulder and hits Gabriel in the chest, killing him. Emerson attempts to shoot McClane before Farrell grabs a handgun and opens fire, fatally shooting Emerson. An FBI [[FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams|tactical response team]] arrives and secures the scene. Afterwards, McClane tries to discourage the romantic feelings developing between Farrell and Lucy.

During the show, after the [[Cylinder (firearms)|cylinder]] is randomly turned, the six will fire the gun one by one pointed at their head, without intermediate extra turning of the cylinder, until one is killed. At first the idea is to give each of the six contestants $1,000,000, but while there are more applicants at the auditions than expected, they are suicidal people. This is not desired, the contestants should want to live; therefore the prize is raised to $5,000,000 each for the surviving contestants, while the family of the killed contestant does not get any prize.  As the TV executive struggles to overcome the challenges by the [[Federal Communications Commission]], her network, and the show's advertisers, a documentary filmmaker ([[David Krumholtz]]) films every detail of her glamorous, high-powered life.

 Raúl Fuentes, a brooding police officer prone to violence and alcohol, is placed on unpaid leave after he has beaten Moncho Tristán, the son of a local drug trafficker. Mazuera, a snitch from a drug mafia ring, tells Raúl that members of the drug clan are looking for him to kill him. Mazuera strikes a deal with Raúl. He would give him some documents that prove the involvement of the Tristán family in drug trafficking and prostitution if Raúl agrees to reveal the story only after Mazuera has left the country. Raúl decides to leave the incident on hold and travels from [[Pontevedra]] to [[Alicante]] where his family lives.  Raúl's visit, the first in two years, takes his family by surprise. His father, José, is not thrilled to see him. Their relationship has become tense due to the fact that Olga, José’s young wife, was originally Raúl's girlfriend. With the exception of his twin brother, Valentin, Raúl does not care about anybody. Valentín, who is mentally disabled, is the opposite of his brother: sweet, soft and well liked by everyone. When Raúl finds out that his brother is working in a nightclub and has fallen in love with one of the prostitutes, he gets very upset and goes in search of Valentín at the bordello, called Lolita's Club.  In Lolita's Club, Raúl confronts Milena, the prostitute that is his brother's love interest. The beautiful Milena is an immigrant from [[Colombia]], who has left behind her daughter under the care of her mother and works to provide them with a better life, sending them money frequently. Although only twenty five years old, Milena is the oldest and the most popular of the girls at the club. The other girls are mostly under-age, like Nancy, who is from Cuba, and Jasmina, who is from Ecuador. A hard nocturnal life of prostitution and drugs has taken its toll on Milena. She is goodhearted and really cares about Valentín. Valentín works at Lolita's Club doing the errands for the girls and is liked and protected by all.  Raíl threatens Milena if she does not break off her close attachment to his naive brother. Valentín, traumatized by the relationship that his brother had with Olga, is afraid that Raúl might get involved with Milena. Indeed, a sexual tension begins to arise between Raúl and Milena. Things are further complicated with the links that the policeman and the prostitute have with the mafia. Raúl hatches a plan to have sex with Milena and have his brother catch them in the act. The scheme unfolds accordingly, with Valentin storming out of the club after he catches his brother engaged in sexual activity with Milena. While outside the club, Valentin imagines he is storming off in Raúl's car, even though he cannot drive. Two hit men sent by the mafia have previously discovered the location of Raúl's whereabouts, and mistakenly shoot and kill Valentín while he is still sitting behind the wheel of his brother's car.   After Valentin's funeral, Raúl is a broken man with no one to turn to for understanding. Even Olga is now indifferent towards his pain. He has joyless sex with Maria, a female coworker, who comes to inform him of the killing of Mazuera by members of the mafia ring. Raúl confronts Tristán but he is not looking for revenge. Instead, he demands Milena's passport and freedom from the net of prostitution. Back at Lolita's club, Raúl offers Milena her passport and freedom and declares his love for her. She rejects him and only retains her documents. She wants to keep making money. Raúl reminds her of Valentín's tragic end. Of the two brothers it was Valentín who she liked and loved. Later, Raúl enters Milena's room at the club just as Valentín used to do, taking over his brother's personality.

The Living Wake
  The film follows the journey of K. Roth Binew, a self-proclaimed genius. After discovering that he has contracted a rare and unnamed terminal disease, he enlists his eccentric [[rickshaw]]-riding best and only friend Mills Joaquin ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]) to accompany him on his last day to live. Throughout the film, he attempts to find the meaning of life in "a brief, but powerful monologue" that his eccentric father had promised to tell him, but abandoned K. Roth before he could.  K. Roth's final day begins with a confrontation with his neighbor and rival, Reginald, whom he invites to his living [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]]. With his friend Mills, he attempts to make his funeral arrangements, visits a "liquorsmith", and makes a goat sacrifice in order to appease [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]]. Believing that love is the meaning of life, K. Roth has a picnic with his former nanny, Marla, whom he describes as his true love. This fails, and after a brief romp with a prostitute ([[Colombe Jacobsen]]), whom he also invites to his wake, K. Roth and Mills journey to the public library, where he tries to donate his entire works. When his books are deemed to be unfit for reading, K. Roth visits a [[psychic]] in another attempt to find the meaning of life.  With his wake and death looming, K. Roth falls into a depression. He is revived when he chances upon a church, the members of which encourage him to reconnect with his family. His brother, Karl, and mother ([[Jill Larson]]) are reluctant to reconcile with him, and do not believe that he is dying. Karl states that K is neither a writer or an inventor except in his own ego and is a delusional man, he calls the family doctor. After having a last drink at a bar, K. Roth and Mills prepare for the wake.  The wake begins, with the entire film's cast in attendance. The wake is made up of dancing by K. Roth, a song performed by Mills called "If I Was Real", and a one-woman play performed by K. Roth called "Remembrance of Dawn". K. Roth's wake is interrupted by the arrival of his mother, Karl, and the family doctor, Dr. Schoenberg. They plead with him to stop the wake, describing it as another of his "episodes". K. Roth refuses, and the wake continues with K. Roth tying up loose ends, including revenge on his neighbor, Reginald, and the giving away of his possessions. Mills recites a poem about K. Roth.  The wake is again interrupted by the arrival of the ghost of Lampert Binew ([[Jim Gaffigan]]), K. Roth's father. Though only K. Roth can see him, K. Roth proceeds to confront him in front of the audience about his abandonment. Lampert explains to him that he never abandoned him, and had simply died without leaving any trace. He tells K. Roth that there is no "equation for life", and therefore no monologue, and that the meaning of life was merely to live to your full potential. With his time drawing near, K. Roth has a moment of self-awareness, stating that his life was meaningless, and that he was a "stupid, drunk, scared, dying man". With encouragement from his father, K. Roth concludes his wake with a song and dance. With the last words of the song, K. Roth's disease takes effect, and he collapses into an upright coffin. He is proclaimed dead. The members of the wake pay their final respects. A mourning Mills takes K. Roth's body to a pond, where he [[Norse funeral|sets it ablaze]] as the film draws to a close.  
The Lookout (2007 film)
 While driving his car with the lights off, high school sports star Chris Pratt crashes into a [[Combine harvester|combine]] stalled on the road. Two occupants of the car are killed while Chris and his girlfriend Kelly survive.  However, the crash leaves Chris with lasting mental impairments, including [[anterograde amnesia]], along with some anger management issues.  Four years later, he's in classes to learn new skills, including the simple sequencing of daily tasks to compensate for his inability to remember, and keeps notes to himself in a small notebook. Challenged by a tough case manager to build a life despite his injuries, he is emotionally supported by his roommate, a blind man named Lewis, but receives only financial support from his wealthy family. Chris works nights, cleaning a small-town bank.  Aside from Lewis his only friend is Ted, a seemingly clumsy Sheriff's Deputy who checks in on Chris regularly. Chris repeatedly tries to convince the bank's manager, Mr Tuttle, to allow him to apply for a teller job, to no avail. Chris soon comes under the scrutiny of a gang planning to rob the bank. Their leader, Gary, who knew Chris from high school and resented his wealth and popularity as a hockey star before his accident, befriends him and uses a young woman, Luvlee Lemons, to seduce him. Taunted by the gang about the limitations of his life since the accident, Chris initially goes along with the scheme. His frustrations trickle down into confrontations with his friends, Lewis and Ted.  When the gang arrives the night of the robbery, Chris tells them he has changed his mind.  But they tell him it's too late and force him to empty the vault at gunpoint.  His friend Ted, the deputy, stumbles into the robbery while delivering doughnuts to Chris, and triggers a shootout. The deputy and two of the gang members, Marty and Cork, are killed. Meanwhile Chris escapes in the getaway car, and when he realizes he's got the money they stole, he returns compulsively to the site of his accident, where he buries the money roadside. Gary is seriously wounded and gets away with the other bank robber, Bone. When Chris returns to his apartment he sees the lights on and realizes something is wrong, and when he calls discovers Gary and Bone have taken Lewis hostage to get the money back.  Chris, using his new sequencing skills, hatches a plan to stay alive and save his friend. But the robbers catch him napping at the place they arranged to meet, and they force him to take them to the site of the buried cash.  While Chris digs in the snow to retrieve the money, Gary's condition is rapidly deteriorating. Chris gives one of two bags to Bone, who is preparing to execute Lewis, but Chris uses the shotgun he stashed in the other bag to shoot and kill Bone before he can react. Gary collapses and dies. Chris returns the money and turns himself in, but the investigation by the [[FBI]] concludes that he was not responsible due to his medical state - and because the robbers failed to disconnect the video surveillance in the bank, allowing the FBI to see the gang forcing Chris to act at gunpoint.  In the aftermath, Chris and Lewis reconcile, and open a restaurant together with a loan from the bank. Chris hopes Kelly will forgive him for the loss of her leg in the accident, and that one day he will find the courage to talk to her again.

Soon, it is discovered that Liu Pingguo is pregnant, though neither An Kun nor Lin Dong can be certain of who is the father. Lin Dong, however, sees in Pingguo an opportunity to make things right with his barren wife as well as to settle things with Pingguo and her husband once and for all. Soon, the two husbands have concocted a scheme wherein An Kun initially receives ¥20,000 for his mental suffering. If the child has Lin Dong's blood type, he will go home with the massage-parlor owner and An Kun will receive ¥100,000.  If however, the baby is An Kun's, no money is exchanged, but Pingguo and An Kun keep the baby. Moreover, if Lin Dong again sleeps with Pingguo, half of his assets will go to Wang Mei in a divorce proceeding. During these negotiations, Pingguo remains conspicuously silent.  As the baby is carried to term, Lin Dong becomes more and more attached to the idea that he will at last be a father. When the baby is born however, An Kun discovers that it is indeed his child. Unable to turn down the money, he manages to convince Lin Dong that it is his son, allowing him to collect the ¥120,000. Although, seeing how happy Lin Dong is with the baby, An Kun grows increasingly jealous, at last resorting to a clumsy and ultimately doomed kidnapping. After being released (presumably by Wang Mei, who has decided to divorce her husband), An Kun attempts to "repurchase" his child, to which Lin Dong promptly refuses. Pingguo, who had moved into Lin Dong's home after the birth as a nursemaid, at last has had enough. Quietly, she gathers the money that An Kun had returned, and taking her child, walks out the door. The film then ends as the two men, Lin Dong and An Kun, attempt to search for her, only to have their car break down on a busy Beijing highway...

Julie tells Jeanne and later her mother about Alice and the [[threesome]]. In the night, after Ismaël, Julie and Alice leave a bar where they were eating, Julie starts complaining about Ismaël's relationship with Alice; Ismaël responds that her jealousy is ironic considering she also has a sexual relationship with Alice, but that she is truly the only one he loves. Alice tells them that she is only there to bring them together. They go to a concert where Alice befriends a guy named Gwendal. Julie starts feeling bad, so she and Ismaël decide to leave. Outside, Julie collapses and suddenly dies.  === The Absence. ===  Going to work, Ismaël runs into Jeanne on her way to his and Julie's apartment. At work, he confronts Alice about his constant breakdowns since Julie's death and she comforts him. Since Jeanne is staying in Ismaël’s apartment, he doesn't want to spend the night there, so Alice takes him to Gwendal’s apartment.  Ismaël spends the entire night awake; in the morning he meets Erwann, Gwendal’s younger brother who also lives there, and who before leaving for school offers Ismaël his room so he can finally get some sleep. Erwann returns and wakes Ismaël up, who borrows some clean clothes from Erwann and leaves for work. Later that night, he discovers Erwann has been following him.

Meanwhile, Alice receives a phone call from Julie’s mother and the two of them meet at a restaurant, where Julie’s mother asks her to take care of Ismaël. Jasmine, Julie’s other sister, comes to tell her mother that her father is upset that she is still out so late at night, so she leaves. Alice and Jasmine briefly discuss their grief.  Ismaël and Erwann sleep together that night. Jeanne lets herself into Ismaël's apartment, discovers Erwann there, and leaves. He follows her into the street where they walk and she explains that she is trying to understand his process of grief, and admits his disinterest in children and threesome arrangement with Julie and Alice can finally be explained by his homosexuality. He neither confirms nor denies this, and the two part unreconciled and upset.  Erwann goes to Ismaël's office only to find Alice. He confirms that he and Ismaël are in the midst of a fling he hopes will develop further. Meanwhile, Ismaël, upset, visits Julie's grave and battles with his guilt over both not visiting sooner and his many sexual exploits since her death as a means of coping. Alice eventually finds him drunk at a bar and takes him to Erwann's, who invites him to stay. Ismaël explains that he will continue their affair as long as Erwann is comfortable not hearing that Ismaël loves him, and Erwann says Ismaël can stay as long as he is okay hearing he is loved. On the roof, Ismaël tells Erwann to "love him less but love him for a long time" and they kiss as Alice looks on from below.

After a good night at the [[Bellagio (hotel and casino)|Bellagio]] hotel's poker room, Huck goes to a party and meets aspiring singer Billie Offer ([[Drew Barrymore]]), who has just arrived in town. Billie's older sister Suzanne ([[Debra Messing]]) warns her that Huck is "hustle 10, commitment zero." Back at the Bellagio, Huck is doing well at the tables before L.C. returns to town from the South of France. Huck greets his father coldly. The two play [[Glossary of poker terms#H|heads-up]].  [[Loan shark]] Roy Durucher ([[Charles Martin Smith]]) tells Huck that he plays poker as well as anybody, except for his reputation as a "blaster" (not patient enough) who always goes for broke. Roy proposes to [[Poker staking#staking|stake]] Huck in the $10,000 main-event with a 60% (Roy) — 40% (Huck) split of any winnings, but Huck refuses. After failing to borrow money from his friend Jack ([[Robert Downey Jr.]]), Huck goes to Suzanne's place hoping for a loan. Instead he runs into Billie, who gets a call confirming that she has landed a job singing at a club.  Huck proposes a celebration and at [[Binion's Horseshoe]] he shows her how to play poker. L.C. arrives and shows Huck a wedding ring of Huck's late mother's that Huck had pawned and that L.C. has redeemed. Huck loses his winnings. Over dinner, he explains to Billie that his father stole from his mother before leaving her. Huck says his father taught him how to play on the kitchen table with "pennies, nickels, and dimes." They make love after dinner. As Billie sleeps, Huck steals money from Billie's purse.  Huck plays in a "super satellite" for his entry to the main event. He appears to have the seat won, but a misdeal costs him. Roy agrees to stake Huck and even gives him an extra $1200 so that he can repay Billie. He apologizes to her, saying he feels they have a chance at something special. They later run into L.C., who wins all of Huck's stake money for the World Series in a quick poker game.  Billie holds the stopwatch in a golfing marathon that Huck must complete in 3 hours to win a bet. She declines to cheat for him when he finishes two seconds too late. Huck gets a black eye when Roy's thugs toss him into his empty pool. They warn him to return the $11,200 stake that he owes to Roy or get a seat in the World Series within 48 hours. When Huck goes to Suzanne's apartment looking for Billie, he learns Billie has gone home to Bakersfield. Huck sells the wedding ring to his father for $500, and makes the 10 grand playing poker in one night to buy a seat in the World Series. Huck travels to Bakersfield to tell Billie that he meant what he said when he felt they had a chance at something special.  Back in Vegas, having found the entry money, Huck enters the World Series. He and his father both advance to the final table of nine. Billie looks on from the audience as Huck and L.C. have a showdown. Huck deliberately folds a winning hand, going out in third place.  A few minutes later, L.C. gets ''[[Glossary of poker terms#river|rivered]]'' and goes out in second place, losing the title to Jason Keyes (Evan Jones) who had "won his entry in an online satellite" (a nod to [[Chris Moneymaker]], who did win the [[2003 World Series of Poker#Main Event|2003 Main Event]] after a similar entry to the tournament).  After the tournament, L.C. offers his son a one-on-one rematch, playing only for pennies, nickels, and dimes. Their relationship is restored, as is Huck's and Billie's in the final scene.

Lust, Caution
 '''''Hong Kong 1938'''''  During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], a shy, inexperienced university student, Wong Chia Chi, travels from Shanghai to Hong Kong and attends her first year at [[Lingnan University (Hong Kong)|Lingnan University]]. A male student, Kuang Yu Min, invites her to join his patriotic drama club, and soon she becomes a lead actress, inspiring both her audience and her colleagues. Inspired by the troupe's patriotic plays, Kuang persuades the group to make a more concrete contribution to the war against Japan. He devises a plan to assassinate Mr. Yee, a [[special agent]] and recruiter of the puppet government of [[Wang Jingwei]] set up by the Japanese occupation in China. The beautiful Chia Chi is chosen to take on the undercover role of "Mrs. Mai", the elegant wife of a trading company owner. She manages to insert herself into the social circle of Mrs. Yee.  Chia Chi catches the eye of Mr. Yee and tries to lure him to a location where he can be assassinated. Chia Chi is still a virgin, and she reluctantly consents to sleeping with another student involved in the plot, in order to practice her role as a married woman if she were to sleep with Yee. Kuang, who has feelings for Chia Chi, is upset by this, but agrees to the arrangement. Attracted to Chia Chi, Yee nearly falls for the trap but withdraws at the last minute. Soon after, Mr. and Mrs. Yee suddenly move back to Shanghai, leaving the students with no further chance to complete their assassination plan. While they are preparing to disband, an armed subordinate of Yee turns up unannounced and tells them that he is aware of their plans. After a violent struggle, the university students kill the subordinate and then go into hiding.  '''''Shanghai 1942''''' [[File:Zheng Pingru 02.jpg|thumb|upright|Chinese spy [[Zheng Pingru]], generally believed to be the inspiration for the film]]  Three years later in Japanese-occupied Shanghai, Chia Chi again encounters Kuang, who is now an undercover agent of the [[KMT]] secret service the [[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics|''Juntong'']], which is seeking to overthrow the Japanese occupation forces and their [[Wang Jingwei regime|puppet government]]. He enlists her into a renewed assassination plan to kill Yee. By this time, Yee has become the head of the secret police department under the puppet government and is responsible for capturing and executing Chinese resistance agents who are working for the KMT. Chia Chi is trained to use weapons and other spy tools.  She eventually becomes Yee's mistress, and during their first encounter, Yee has very rough sex with her. Over the next few weeks, however, their sexual relationship becomes very passionate and deeply emotional, which causes conflicting feelings in Chia Chi, who is still involved in the assassination plot.  When Chia Chi reports to her KMT superior officer, she exhorts him to carry out the assassination soon so that she will not have to continue her sexual liaisons with Yee, but she is told that the assassination needs to be delayed for strategic reasons. Chia Chi describes the inhuman emotional conflict she is in, sexually and emotionally bound to a man whom she is plotting to assassinate. When Yee sends Chia Chi to a jewelry store with a sealed envelope, she discovers that he has arranged for a large and extremely rare six-carat pink diamond for her, to be mounted in a ring. This provides the Chinese resistance with a chance to get at Yee when he is not accompanied by his bodyguards.  Soon after, Chia Chi invites Yee to accompany her to collect the diamond ring. While entering the jewelry shop, she notices that her friends are not outside (suggesting her friends may have already been caught). When she puts on the ring and sees Yee's obvious love for her, she is overcome by emotion and quietly urges him to leave. Understanding her meaning, Yee immediately flees the shop and escapes the assassination attempt. By the end of the day, most of the resistance group are captured. Yee's deputy was aware of the resistance cell, but did not inform Yee because he hoped to use the opportunity to catch their leader. Emotionally in turmoil, Yee signs their death warrants and the resistance group members, including Chia Chi, are led out to a quarry and executed. As all the members of the resistance group are forced to their knees while the executioners take out their pistols, a sad Kuang, who always loved Chia Chi, gazes at her. Her friends die thinking they had somehow implicated Chia Chi, while she knows that her friends are going to die because of her warning to Yee. Meanwhile, Yee sits on Chia Chi's empty bed in the family guest room while his wife asks him what is going on, since his secretary and two men had taken Chia Chi's belongings and some papers from his office. Yee tells her to keep quiet and to continue playing downstairs, to avoid letting anyone know that something is amiss.  If anyone asks, he says, Chia Chi has returned to Hong Kong.

Ho turns to Bun—who now lives in seclusion with his imaginary wife, May Cheung ([[Kelly Lin]])—for assistance in the case.  Bun discovers that rather than being one man, Chi-Wai is a seven-spirit collective—with each spirit perhaps representing an aspect of the [[seven deadly sins]] and with the head spirit, or brain, being a business-like woman. Bun suspects that Chi-Wai's gun was stolen by the pursued suspect—an [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]] named Naresh Sherma.

Magicians (2007 film)
 Harry Kane and Karl Allen are best friends who work together in a successful and popular magic [[double act]], with Harry's wife Carol working as their assistant. After one show, however, Harry discovers Karl and Carol backstage in a magic box having sex (during an agreement between Harry and the theatre owner about letting the act go on for 4 more weeks and letting them do an act on a cruise ship). During the next show, Carol is locked into a [[guillotine]] as part of a climatic trick, only for the blade to decapitate her; it is not immediately clear whether Harry, despite his protestations of innocence, has murdered her or whether she was the victim of a freak accident. Four years later, the act has broken up and the two friends – now bitter rivals – have gone their separate ways; Harry, having given up professional magic, is working in a [[Wilkinson (shop)|Wilkinson]] hardware store, only to be fired after a customer complains when he creates an illusion of him cutting his arm severely with a knife blade during a sales pitch, whilst Karl is attempting to reinvent himself as a [[Derren Brown]]-esque magician called the Mindmonger, with limited success. During an unsuccessful impromptu-pitch at a television corporation, the only person he manages to impress is Dani, the tea girl, who Karl immediately gets a crush on much to the jealousy of his incompetent agent Otto, who nurses an unsubtle homosexual crush on him.   After numerous failed attempts at raising money, Harry sees a poster for the "Magic shield" competition held in [[Jersey]], with a prize of £20,000, and decides to enter. Trying to find a new assistant, Harry is forced to recruit the only applicant, Linda, an old work friend whose only entertainment skill is a poor dancing routine. Harry swallows his pride and contacts Karl, who agrees to enter the competition with him; although their reputation in the magic community is still strong enough to get them into the tournament without an audition, the tensions between them ultimately prove too strong and they decide to go solo from that point on. As Harry and Linda rehearse their magic act, they begin to grow closer, but whilst Linda is open about her interest in Harry, he is too uptight and insecure to fully express his reciprocation. Much to his discomfort, Linda discovers the guillotine amongst his magic props and convinces him to use it as the centrepiece of the finale. Karl, meanwhile, is delighted to learn that Dani has come down from London to see him perform, but is slightly alarmed to discover that she believes him to be a genuine psychic. He nevertheless goes along with her belief, particularly as the interest in the competition has seen him approached by a television producer who wants to make him the centrepiece of a psychic show. Karl agrees to make his act for the finale a [[Mediumship|medium]] display, but begins to suffer a crisis of conscience. Karl tries a trick where he is buried in sand for a day.   Upon learning that Harry has not told Linda of what happened to his wife, Karl informs her. Harry panics when he discovers that her hotel room is vacant, believing she has returned to London. He conquers his fear of flying to immediately fly back to London, only to discover as soon as he gets there that she has merely switched rooms and forgotten to inform him. Managing to return to Jersey in time to compete by telling Linda to make one of the judges delay the act, both Harry and Karl make it through to the final; Linda claims that she is okay with hearing about what happened to Carol, but tensions between both begin to grow as she struggles to trust him. The night of the finale, Harry is heartbroken to learn that Linda has apparently slept with another magician, the sleazy and unethical Tony White; although Linda confirms it, she is lying in an attempt to force Harry to open up about his feelings, which he is still unable to do. Karl, meanwhile, finally prepares to consummate his relationship with Dani, but admits that he is not a true psychic after she thinks he is contacting her dead father, and betrayed, she shuns him.   That night, Karl and Harry have a confrontation backstage, in which Karl accuses Harry of murdering Carol; Harry angrily rejects the accusation and challenges that Karl merely finds it easier to believe that rather than accept the guilt of betraying his best friend. On stage, Karl begins to pioneer his psychic act, but the stooge he has hired in the crowd which he had chosen with a fake random ball toss, accidentally trips and concusses himself on the stage. Upon hearing the sad story of another selected audience member, he decides that he cannot perpetuate the fraud, admitting to the audience that he is not able to contact the dead. As a result, Dani forgives him. Harry, as 'The Black Widower', starts his guillotine act, but at the moment of truth Linda's nerve fails her and she flees the stage. Although Harry’s act would appear to be ruined when he asks if anybody else wants to try, Karl steps forward and announces that he will face the guillotine instead. Karl allows himself to be locked in the guillotine, explaining that Carol was frequently unfaithful and forced Karl to have sex with her. Harry appears to decapitate Karl – although it is merely an illusion, and Karl appears unharmed, the trick having worked perfectly. Harry wins the competition, and in his acceptance speech both forgives Karl and admits that he loves Linda, who joins him on stage and the two kiss. Their friendship mended, Karl and Harry embark on a reunion tour, incorporating Dani and Linda into the act as their assistants.

The Man from London
 The film concerns a middle-aged railway [[pointsman]], Maloin ([[Miroslav Krobot]]), who lives in a decrepit apartment in a port town with his highly-strung wife Camélia ([[Tilda Swinton]]) and his daughter Henriette ([[Erika Bók]]). One night while in his viewing tower at the port's rail terminus, Maloin witnesses a fight on the dockside. One of the shady combatants is knocked into the water along with the briefcase he carries; when the other flees the dark quayside, Maloin makes a clandestine descent from the tower and retrieves the briefcase, which he finds full of sodden English banknotes. Maloin conceals the money and tells no-one of what he has seen. The next morning, he visits a tavern where he plays chess with the barkeep ([[Gyula Pauer]]). On his way home, he stops by the butcher's where his daughter works, and finds to his indignation that they have her washing the floor. Later, from the window of his apartment, he notices Brown ([[János Derzsi]]) watching him from below. At dinner, Maloin is increasingly irascible, addressing Henriette brusquely and arguing with Camélia. Meanwhile, Brown searches the water at the dock's edge without success before noticing the watchtower overlooking the quayside, and Maloin within.  Later at the tavern, a police inspector from London named Morrison ([[István Lénárt]]) discusses with Brown the matter of the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.  Maloin calls to the butcher's and drags Henriette from the store against her will and over the protestations of the butcher's wife ([[Kati Lázár]]). He brings her to the tavern for a drink, where he overhears the barkeep telling another patron the story of Brown's meeting with the inspector, revealing that Morrison had called the local police when Brown absconded. Though Henriette refuses her drink, Maloin buys her an expensive mink [[stole (shawl)|stole]]. They return home to the consternation of Camélia, who cannot comprehend why Maloin has ruined Henriette's chances of a job and spent what little savings the family had on the extravagant stole. During Maloin's shift the next night he is visited by Morrison, who questions him as to the previous night's events as the body of the drowned man is retrieved from the quayside below.  The next day at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife ([[Agi Szirtes]]), and tells her that Brown is under suspicion for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with a small portion of the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.

The Man from Earth
 Professor John Oldman is packing his belongings onto his truck, preparing to move to a new home. His colleagues show up to give him an impromptu farewell party: Harry, a biologist; Edith, an [[art history]] professor and devout [[Christian]]; Dan ([[Tony Todd]]), an [[anthropologist]]; Sandy, a [[historian]] who is in love with John; Dr. Will Gruber, a psychiatrist; Art, an archaeologist; and his student Linda.  As John's colleagues press him to explain the reason for his departure, he slowly, and somewhat reluctantly, reveals that he is a prehistoric [[caveman]] who has lived for more than 14 millennia, and that he relocates every ten years to keep others from realizing that [[immortality|he does not age]]. He begins his tale under the guise of a possible science-fiction story, but eventually stops speaking in hypotheticals and begins answering questions from a first-person perspective. His colleagues refuse to believe his story. John continues his tale, relating how he was a [[Sumer]]ian for 2000 years, a [[Babylonia]]n, and eventually went east to become a disciple of [[Gautama Buddha]]. He claims to have been given a chance to sail with [[Christopher Columbus]] (admitting that at the time he [[Myth of the flat Earth|still believed the earth was flat]]) and to have befriended [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] (one of whose original paintings he apparently owns, a gift from the artist himself).  In the course of the conversation, each of John's colleagues questions his story based on knowledge from his or her own academic specialty. Harry, the [[biologist]], struggles with how biology could allow for the possibility of a human being living for so long. Art, the [[archaeologist]], questions John about events in [[prehistory]]. He exclaims that John's answers, though correct, could have come from any textbook. Will, the [[psychiatrist]], questions if John feels guilt for outliving everyone he has ever known and loved, and threatens John with a gun (which is later revealed to have been unloaded) before temporarily leaving.  John then learns from the group that Will's wife had died the previous day after a long illness.  The discussion turns to the topic of religion. John mentions that he is not a follower of a particular religion; though he does not necessarily believe in an omnipotent God, he does not discount the possibility of such a being's existence. Pressed by the group, John reluctantly reveals that in trying to take Buddha's teachings to the west, into the [[eastern Roman Empire]], he became the inspiration for the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|Jesus story]]. After this revelation, emotions in the room run high. Edith begins crying. Will demands that John end his tale and give the group a sense of closure by admitting it was all a hoax, and threatens to have John involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluation should he refuse to do so. John appears to ruminate over his response before finally "confessing" to everyone that his story was a prank.  John's friends leave the party with various reactions: Edith is relieved; Harry indicates an open mind; Art never wants to see John again; Will still believes John is mad and still wants him committed; Sandy, Dan, and Linda clearly believe John. After everyone else but Will and Sandy have left, Will overhears John and Sandy's conversation, which suggests the story was true after all. John mentions some of the [[pseudonym]]s he has used over the years, and Will realizes one was his father's name. He asks John questions that only his father could answer and, when John does answer correctly, Will is shocked before having emotional breakdown, suffers a heart attack and dies in their arms. After the body has been taken away, Sandy realizes this is the first time John has seen one of his grown children die. John wordlessly gets in his truck and starts to drive to an unknown destination. Then he stops and waits for Sandy, who walks over to the truck.

Manorama Six Feet Under
  The film opens with a narrative about a nondescript town called Lakhot in Rajasthan, India. The narrator is Satyaveer Singh Randhawa ([[Abhay Deol]]), a down-on-his-luck public works engineer. He compares Lakhot – dry, desolate and despondent – to the general downturn in his own life. As he returns to his irritable and nagging wife Nimmi and their young son, we learn that Satyaveer has just been implicated in a small bribery scandal at work. Nimmi ([[Gul Panag]]) broods over how she wishes she had married a richer fellow. Satyaveer, an aspiring writer whose only novel Manorama sank without a trace, laments about how he had once wished to be famous but is now resigned to a banal and unremarkable existence.  They have an unusual visitor that night. A well dressed, affluent woman presents herself as Mrs. P. P. Rathore, the wife of the Irrigation Minister (and former Maharaja, presumably prior to Independence) P. P. Rathore ([[Kulbhushan Kharbanda]]). She says she is a big fan of Satyaveer's novel. Captivated by the ingenuity of the detective Raghu, the principal character of the novel, she hopes to secure Satyaveer's assistance in applying the same ingenuity to procure photographic evidence of her husband's affair. She pays him an advance and leaves. Satyaveer accepts the job in spite of Nimmi's reproach. He stealthily stakes out Rathore's manor. He spots another woman visiting Rathore. Rathore rebukes the woman and turns her away. Satyaveer snaps a few pictures of this exchange and hands over the roll to Mrs. Rathore. He also confides in his brother-in-law and best friend, the loutish but generally well-meaning local cop Brij Mohan ([[Vinay Pathak]]). Brij finds this all very fishy and advises Satyaveer to take Nimmi on a short vacation. Strange events happen to Satyaveer. He finds out that the woman who hired him is not Mrs. Rathore; the real Mrs. Rathore is an invalid. Late one evening, as Satyaveer returns home after drinks with Brij, he spots the same woman running for her life from people who are out to kill her. She earnestly urges him to remember her real name, Manorama ([[Sarika]]), and that she is 32 years old. The next day's papers report that Manorama committed suicide in connection with her protests against a canal being built through Lakhot. The canal project is sponsored by Rathore.  He decides to investigate further. He finds out that Manorama was connected with a local children's home and lived with a roommate, Sheetal ([[Raima Sen]]). The roommate is confused and scared. She refuses to talk with Satyaveer. Satyaveer is later set upon by thugs; they turn out to be the same men who chased Manorama on the night of her death, and they want to find out what she told him that night. Satyaveer tells them what was told to him after getting his two fingers broken and his motorbike is stolen. Satyaveer later uncovers that Manorama's death was an accident; she was hit by a truck as she fled her pursuers.  Sheetal calls him. She is still scared but somehow warms to him and asks if she can stay with him for a few days. Seeing as Nimmi has returned to Rohtak (her parent's house) for Diwali, Satyaveer agrees. Sheetal moves in for a little while. Around this time, Satyaveer attends a rally function with Rathore in attendance. He follows Rathore and discovers that Rathore receives regular medication from a doctor for an unknown ailment. He also spots the woman who visited him on the night Satyaveer took the photos.  He follows the woman and makes contact with her. She lives with the doctor Anil Potdar. She turns out to be Sameera Rathore, the illegitimate daughter of Rathore. She was trying to get Rathore to accept her as a daughter. Satyaveer begins piecing the parts together. However, when Satyaveer visits the doctor, he finds that the doctor and Sameera have both been brutally murdered. There he and Sheetal discuss what to do next and they almost kiss but his wife calls him and he takes her call immediately remembering his marriage.He runs to the children's home where he discovers that Sheetal has been dead for quite some time!  Arriving home, he finds that the woman masquerading as Sheetal is neither surprised nor scared. She blames him for the act she had to up (as Sheetal), and she directs him to meet Rathore. Rathore demands the photos. Satyaveer turns over the photos he had taken. Not surprisingly, Rathore is not the least bit interested in photos of him having an argument with his biological daughter. It turns out that Neetu (the girl pretending to be Sheetal) is a concubine for Rathore. Rathore now openly threatens him and asks that he hand over those photos. Satyaveer returns home. He scans one of the photos he had taken and suddenly finds a clue in it. This clue leads him to what Manorama had said to him on the night she died. The clue was that Manorama from his book died at page 32. He uses the clues to land up in the room of a small hotel in town, where he discovers a shocking set of photos in a packet cached behind the light switchboard.  Satyaveer returns to confront Rathore. He presents the shocking evidence he has found. Rathore was a [[pedophile]] (a person who is sexually attracted to children). The children's home was his steady supply of (orphaned) children. The real Sheetal and Manorama, who worked at the orphanage, had realized his wicked activities. They were about to blow his cover and hence he had them silenced. Rathore calmly informs Satyaveer that Satyaveer, smart though he may be, is still a small-town man that may easily be dispensed with. He then has Neetu harass him sexually which makes Satyaveer come out of disgust and he sees the goons dismantaling his scooter. Satyaveer then comes back and reveals another fact. The doctor, Anil Potdar and Manorama were siblings. Also, though the doctor knew that Rathore had lung cancer, he kept concealing the fact from him and kept giving him placebos merely to suppress the symptoms of cancer. The doctor and Manorama merely wanted to keep him alive long enough for him to accept Sameera as his daughter and heir. Then, on Rathore's eventual death, the estate would come to Sameera and thus also to the doctor and Manorama. It was now too late since cancer had reached an advanced stage and Rathore had precious little time left to live. Hearing this Rathore's wife laughs with great relief. She commits suicide in the morning.  The film ends as Satyaveer quietly walks out. He remarks that the only thing that is certain in an unknown world is a known God.

Martian Child
 David Gordon, a popular [[science fiction]] author, widowed two years prior as they were trying to adopt a child, is finally matched with a young boy, Dennis.  Initially hesitant to adopt alone, he is drawn to Dennis because he sees aspects of himself and his own awkward childhood in the boy.   Dennis suffers from the delusion that he is from [[Mars]]. He protects himself from the sun's harmful rays, wears weights to counter earth's weak gravity, eats only [[Lucky Charms]], and hangs upside down to facilitate his circulation. He refers often to his mission to understand earth and its people, taking pictures, stealing things to catalog, and spending time consulting an ambiguous toy-like device with flashing lights that produces seemingly unintelligible words.   Once David decides to adopt Dennis, he spends time getting to know the boy, patiently coaxing him out of the large cardboard box he hides in, which becomes a metaphor for coaxing him out of his shyness and into new situations. We wonder if Dennis sees something of a kindred spirit in David that draws him out. Soon, David is cleared to take Dennis home and they meet David's dog, "Somewhere." In Dennis's bedroom is a projector of the solar system that he pronounces inaccurate. With the help of David's friend Harlee and sister Liz, David tries to help Dennis overcome his delusion by both indulging it and encouraging him to act like everyone else. Dennis attends school but is quickly expelled for repeatedly stealing items for his collection. David tells Liz, though it's not clear if he's being genuine or sarcastic, that perhaps Dennis is from Mars.    Meanwhile, David's literary agent, Jeff, encourages David to finish writing his sequel book, already commissioned, which is due soon. David struggles to make time for writing but is regularly pulled into dealing with Dennis's issues. Finally, David hunkers down to write when a flash from Dennis's [[Polaroid camera]] catches him off-guard and he accidentally breaks some glass. David snatches Dennis up and carries him across the room. Dennis, upset by David's abrupt action, fears he is going to be sent away. David explains that he was just worried he'd get cut by the glass and that he loves Dennis more than his stuff. Assuring him that he will never send him away, he encourages Dennis to break more things. They move to the kitchen and break dishes and then spray ketchup and dish detergent at each other. Lefkowitz, the decision-maker from Social Services, appears in the window and discovers the mayhem. He rebukes David and sets up a review of the case.    David encourages Dennis to be from Mars only at home; he has to be from Earth everywhere else. Dennis passes his interview by saying he was pretending and continues in David's care. Later, David, now Dennis's adopted father, tries to insist that Dennis acknowledge being from Earth, to which Dennis responds with hurt and anger. David leaves Dennis with Liz to attend the reveal of his new book, which is supposed to be the sequel to his first book. David confesses to Tina, the publisher, that he has not written a sequel, but rather a new book titled, Martian Child, about Dennis. In her fury, Tina makes a scene at the party, but takes the manuscript as David leaves to be with Dennis.   Meanwhile, Dennis has walked away from Liz's house, together with his suitcase of earthly artifacts. When David arrives and finds the police at Liz's house and learns the boy is gone, he remembers the place Dennis had identified as where he was found. David asks Harlee to drive him to the location, where they spot Dennis high up on the outside ledge of the museum's domed roof. David climbs up to where Dennis is as the police and Liz arrive. Dennis identifies a bright searchlight in a nearby cloud as someone coming to take him home, but David tries to assure him that it's just a helicopter. David pledges his love for Dennis and assures him that he will never ever leave him. Eventually Dennis gives in to trusting David and the two embrace.   David's voiceover tells about the parallel of children who come into our world, struggling to understand it, being like little aliens. As we zoom in on Tina reading the manuscript aboard an airplane, we realize these are words from the book. Tina is crying.   
The Masked Gang: Iraq
 In this sequel, the clumsiest comedy heroes of Turkish Cinema are convinced firmly that the rights of Turkey upon the oil supplies of the north Iraq are being ignored. Without further ado, they decide to end this unfairness. The idiotic group succeeds in bringing an Iraqi oil plant under American guard into its control. Guided by their leader Bahattin (Peker Acikalin), the gang members Bubbly Tezcan (Safak Sezer), Private Kamil (Cengiz Kucukayvaz),  Clumsy Zeki (Melih Ekener) and Redneck Recep (Atilla Sarihan), manage to take the American soldiers as their hostages, and redirect the pipelines to Turkey. The good mannered gang, however, has difficulties in understanding, why this “clearly legal action” not only captures the attention of the local authorities, but also brings about a strong international crisis between Turkey and the USA.  And the fact that Tezcan falls in love with the American lieutenant Angel, makes the situation by far more complicated.  
Marmorera (film)
 Simon Cavegn's grandmother, mother and father were born in [[Marmorera]]. Cavegn and his wife ''Paula'' spend their honeymoon at the place of his family's origin. Taking some selfies, the newlyweds notice that a fisherman disappears on the ''[[Lai da Marmorera]]'', the reservoir of the Marmorera dam. At the same time, a young woman is lying in the fisherman's boat. Cavegn believes that he has rescued the mysterious woman, but when emergency services arrive, the young woman seems to be dead. During the transfer to the hospital in Savognin, the red-haired woman "awakes", and some mysterious events occur in the following days. The confused young woman without identity and language is taken to the ''[[Burghölzli]]'' psychiatric clinic in Zürich where she soon becomes a puzzling figure of much concern for psychiatrists of the ''Burghölzli'' sanatorium in Zürich-[[Weinegg]]. Simon Cavegn becomes her psychiatrist in charge, calls the unknown woman ''Julia'', and starts to discover the dark secret of Marmorera.  Cavegn was born and raised in Zürich. His parents died in a car accident. Soon Cavegn suspects that this patient will be much more than another medical problem to solve. Is Julia perhaps dangerous, or is she merely an interesting example of an extraordinary mind? Or is Julia actually a curse from a bygone era, which the residents of Marmorera have carefully tried to hide? Cavegn seems to be the only one to whom Julia spoke; she tells him a kind of visions that are related to the future deaths of people from Marmorera. However, on the videos that were taken in the course of the therapy, there is no sound, and even Julia is physically not able to speak. For Simon's wife Paula, Julia is soon a dangerous rival, although the unusual patient is always quiet and modest – as long as she is allowed to use a bathtub whenever she wants.  In the meantime, at the Marmorera village that was re-erected at the road to the [[Julier Pass]] in 1954, bizarre deaths accumulate, and Simon finds increasingly clear connections between these "accidents", his patient and the flooded mountain village at the base of the dam. Cavegn tries to talk about his observations with the chief psychiatrist, with his wife and with his friend, and he also contacts Motta, the attorney in charge who is investigating the increasing number of casualties. In Marmorera, myth and reality meet, and the remaining few inhabitants are convinced that the rumors about a curse are not just fairy tales. The inscription "Resistance" at the facade of a house in the new Marmorera village remembers that not all residents had agreed to sell their village and their country to the Zürich electricity company before the dam was built. Cavegn tries to prevent further casualties. Even the city of Zürich could be threatened by the curse of Marmorea because it draws its power supply from the power plant at the Marmorera reservoir. Cavegn fails in his endeavour.

Mattie Fresno and the Holoflux Universe
   
Meet Bill
 Bill ([[Aaron Eckhart]]) is an overweight, middle-aged man who dissatisfies himself and works at his father-in-law, Mr. Jacoby's ([[Holmes Osborne]]) bank, where he has a meaningless, made-up job, and his in-laws don't take him seriously, especially his brother-in-law ([[Todd Louiso]]). He also struggles with his weight and has body image issues, which he makes worse by keeping candy around his home and office. Jacoby is a pillar in the community and is considering a mayoral run.  Bill and his wife Jess ([[Elizabeth Banks]]) live in a house provided by her father and lead a comfortable lifestyle. Bill tries to purchase a doughnut franchise with the Whitmans ([[Jason Sudeikis]] and [[Kristen Wiig]]), a friendly married couple who own the franchise business. Bill's interest in purchasing a franchise is an attempt to wean himself and his wife off Jacoby's finances. At a public donation ceremony sponsored by his in-laws, Bill first meets "the Kid" ([[Logan Lerman]]), a spunky and easygoing teenager, who is running from the school principal for possession of marijuana. Bill protects the Kid by pretending he did not see anyone and there is no one hiding in the bathroom. In the hallway, after the principal suggests a school mentoring program, he sees his wife talking with Chip Johnson ([[Timothy Olyphant]]), the local, pompous newscaster. Bill begins to get mildly suspicious, and also begins to "mentor" the Kid. Before a hunting trip with his in-laws and the students they are all mentoring, he places a hidden camera in his and Jess' bedroom, and learns that his wife is having an affair with Chip. In a rage, he shows her the camera, the two argue causing Jess to seek Chip and tell him about the tape, where Bill ends up beating him up on live TV and is arrested. After the sex tape has been taken in by the police and viewed, they later find that it circulates the bank and local community, furthering Bill and Jess' embarrassment, particularly concerning Jess'  offensive comments to Chip about Bill, their sex life and his penis size. Jess fears the video could ruin her father's mayoral bid and tries to conceal the news of her affair and the video from him.  Bill's brother ([[Craig Bierko]]) bails him out of jail, and Bill stays at the home of his brother and his husband ([[Reed Diamond]]). He gets into a fight about the sex tape with his wife, and the two of them go to Chip's house. Chips makes rude comments to Jess, and Bill then beats up Chip again and it's once again broadcast by the local TV station, which labels Bill as Chip's "deranged fan." Random people frequently yell "Apologize!" at Bill throughout the film, a reference to him punching Chip while yelling "Apologize!" on the air. Bill moves in with Sargeant ([[Craig Bierko]]), his successful older brother. Sargeant's boyfriend Paul ([[Reed Diamond]]) encourages Bill to take up swimming, a former pastime of Bill's. He starts doing so and it helps clear his mind. He continues mentoring the Kid, who sees the best in Bill, and the Kid devises a plan to win back Bill's wife. Introducing the lingerie salesgirl Lucy ([[Jessica Alba]]), he makes it appear as if Lucy and Bill are romantically involved to make Jess jealous. Meanwhile, Bill is still trying to get the doughnut franchise, but Jess is required to meet with the owners as co-partner, and so Bill and the Kid have Lucy act as Bill's wife.  Bill slowly begins to get a hand on his life again, cutting his addiction to sweets, losing weight, swimming daily, mentoring the Kid, and trying to win back Jess. At a family dinner, Bill volunteers to buy the fireworks for the 'club picnic' where his father-in-law intends to announce that he is running for Mayor.  After a fun-filled day, Bill invites the Kid, Lucy, and her friend back to the tent he has set up in his brother's back yard, where he gets very high and has meaningless sex with Lucy's friend. Bill attends the picnic at the golf course. At the picnic, Bill gets too close to his wife and Chip, breaking Chip's restraining order. Chip then promptly has security throw him out of the picnic, which the Whitmans witness. Bill tells the Kid to meet him at the back entrance, and while driving his car to the back of the golf course, he gets into a car accident, causing the fireworks to explode early. The Kid comes to his rescue on a golfing cart, takes Bill to the hospital, where Jess shows up, and tells her husband that she's aware of his attempt to purchase the franchise. They end up discussing their marriage, where Bill reveals his unhappiness and his dislike of their dependence on her father's money and concludes "our lives suck." After making vague decisions, Bill goes home and stares into a mirror. Seeing what his life has become, he cuts his hair (which he despises throughout the film) and changes his wardrobe. He later visits Jacoby at his office and hands in his resignation, pointing out that he doesn't fit in or belong in the company. His father-in-law understands and accepts his resignation. Jacoby commends Bill for attacking Chip, as he explains that he would have done the same if he were in that situation. Despite his daughter's attempt to conceal the news, Jacoby knew about her affair.  Bill meets the Whitmans and is surprised to see Jess, who is clearing up the misunderstanding. Jess convinces the Whitmans to let the couple buy the franchise. During a private conversation, Bill confesses that he was going to call off the deal. He has a change of heart and lets the purchase go through, allowing Jess to keep the business. They reconcile their differences and agree to go their separate ways, putting their house up for sale.  Bill goes to the Kid's school to bid him farewell, as he is excited to start a new, unknown chapter in his life. He says goodbye with the promise to keep in touch, and tells the Kid to look in his locker. The locker explodes with fireworks, much to the Kid's delight.

Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner.  Wilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur asks Lewis to fix the time machine, but Lewis has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis does not stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinson family except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip.

Lewis also finds out that the Bowler Hat Guy is a grown-up version of Lewis' roommate, Michael "Goob" Yagoobian. Because he was kept awake by Lewis' work on the scanner, Goob fell asleep during an important [[Little League]] game and failed to make an important catch that cost the game.

Back at the fair, Lewis asks for one more chance to demonstrate his scanner, which this time succeeds.

Michael Clayton (film)
 Michael Clayton is a "[[Cleaner (crime)|fixer]]" for a prestigious New York City [[law firm]], using his connections and knowledge of legal loopholes for clients' benefit. Although he is paid well enough, he is divorced, addicted to gambling, and faced with a large debt when his restaurant fails. After leaving a clandestine poker game to deal with Greer, a client involved in a hit-and-run incident, Michael drives back, stopping at a field, where some horses are standing on a hill. When he climbs the hill to gaze at them, his car explodes and burns.  The narrative moves back to four days earlier. Michael is $75,000 in debt from a restaurant investment he entered with his brother Timmy, which collapsed when Timmy used the restaurant's funds to fuel his drug habits. Michael, having gone to a loan shark to raise the money, refuses to give up on his brother and is held responsible for the debt and given one week to come up with the money. Meanwhile, one of the firm's leading attorneys, Arthur Edens, has a [[manic episode]] in the middle of a deposition in Milwaukee involving a multibillion-dollar, six-year-long class action lawsuit against client U-North, an agricultural products conglomerate. Michael arrives in Milwaukee and bails Arthur out of jail after finding out he is no longer taking his medication, but Arthur escapes from their hotel room in the middle of the night.  Karen Crowder, U-North's [[general counsel]], discovers that Arthur had come into possession of a confidential U-North document detailing the company's decision to manufacture a weed killer it knew to be carcinogenic. Karen brings this to the attention of U-North's CEO Don Jeffries, who puts her in contact with two hit men secretly on retainer. She contracts them to follow Arthur and bug his apartment and phone. When they report that Arthur is building a case to expose his own client, Karen approves of their taking drastic measures. The men murder Arthur in such a way as to make it look like an accidental drug overdose or suicide.  Michael, saddened by Arthur's death, becomes suspicious upon learning that U-North was planning a settlement just a few days before, and that Arthur had booked a flight to New York for one of the plaintiffs, named Anna. She tells him that no one knew of her conversations with Arthur, not even her attorney, yet Michael's firm somehow knew of Arthur's conversations with the U-North plaintiffs. With the help of his other brother Gene, a police detective, Michael gets access to Arthur's sealed apartment and, finding a bottle of champagne and two glasses in the refrigerator, suspects Arthur arranged to meet Anna. There is also a copy of ''Realm and Conquest'', a fantasy novel which Michael's son Henry had recommended to both Michael and Arthur, with several pages evidently highlighted and annotated by Arthur, among which is a receipt from a photocopy shop being used as a bookmark.  Michael is caught in the apartment and arrested for trespassing, but Gene bails him out. Using the receipt, Michael discovers that Arthur had ordered 3,000 copies of the confidential U-North document. Michael takes one copy of the document with him. The hit men, who are now following him, also obtain a copy, which they provide to Karen. Michael is about to show his boss, Marty Bach, the document in his possession. Before he can do so, he is offered a renewed employment contract as well as the $80,000 he had requested to cover his debt. As a condition, Marty's associate, Barry Grissom, operating on the assumption that Michael may be shaking down the firm based upon what he has found out about U-North's activities, imposes a confidentiality agreement on Michael to prevent him from divulging any information that might damage U-North's case. This reveals to Michael that Marty and Barry already know about U-North's cover-up.  One of the hit men rigs Michael's car with a bomb, but is forced to leave the job unfinished when Michael suddenly abandons his high-stakes poker game after receiving a phone call summoning him to meet the hit-and-run client in a remote part of [[Westchester County]]. He is followed by the hit men, who have trouble tracking him, but eventually get close enough to detonate the radio-controlled bomb. However, Michael had already left the car to approach three horses standing motionless on a hilltop. The tableau resembles an illustration in the book he had found in Arthur's apartment. When the bomb explodes, the horses bolt. Michael runs to the burning car, throws some of his personal effects into it, and escapes into the woods.  Later, at a U-North board meeting at the New York Hilton Midtown hotel, Karen proposes that the board approve a new settlement in the class action lawsuit against the company. She leaves the room to let the board of directors deliberate. She is shocked when Michael confronts her in the foyer, since she believed him to be dead. He informs her that he has possession of the U-North memo, and knows about her role in Arthur's murder and the subsequent attempt on his own life. He goads Karen into offering him $10 million for his silence. Karen reluctantly agrees, whereupon Michael reveals that she is about to get busted. Angered with Michael's presence, Jeffries calls out for security guards, but police arrive and arrest him and Karen instead. Michael hands the cellphone to Gene, then leaves the building, and hails a cab. He tells the driver, "Gimme 50 dollars' worth, just drive", as the film ends.

The Mist (film)
  Following a violent thunderstorm, David Drayton leaves his wife Stephanie at home while he ventures into town with his eight-year-old son Billy and their neighbor, Brent Norton, to buy supplies for repairs. Arriving at a grocery store, they and the other patrons notice unusual police and military activity. Three soldiers enter the store and an [[Military Police Corps (United States)|MP]] warns them to depart. Moments later, a panicked and injured man, Dan Miller, runs into the store screaming that there's "something in the mist!". Soon after, a thick mist envelops the store, accompanied by earthquake-like tremors, setting off the town's [[fire]] [[Siren (alarm)|siren]].  A deeply pious woman, Mrs. Carmody, believes that this is the beginning of [[Armageddon]]. A shaken woman ([[Melissa McBride]]), against objections from the others, leaves the store to go home to her children. While investigating the store's generator, [[bagger|bag-boy]] Norm volunteers to go outside, but is attacked by the tentacles of an unseen monster and dragged into the mist. At first, everyone is skeptical of the tale, but store manager Bud Brown and a local biker are convinced when they see a severed tentacle in the generator room. Realizing the store front is plate glass, the people trapped in the store block the windows with dog food bags, tape and freezers.  Refusing to listen to David, Norton heads outside with a small group to seek help, with the biker following suit with rope tied around his waist. However, Norton's group are attacked and presumably killed by an unseen creature and the survivors are only able to pull back the severed lower half of the biker. That night, enormous flying insects with scorpion-like tails tipped with venomous stingers land on and attach themselves to the windows. Moments later, [[pterodactyl]]-like animals preying on said insects ram their beaks into the glass, eventually breaking through the windows and allowing the creatures to enter the supermarket. They begin to attack the terrified people inside and kill Sally, a cashier, and another man, Tom, while one man, Joe, is severely burned and later dies. One of the insects lands on Mrs. Carmody, but doesn't sting her because she keeps still during her prayer. As a result, she starts preaching even more and quickly gains followers among the distraught survivors.  In order to retrieve medical supplies and look for more survivors, David, Dan, Private Jessup, Joe's brother Bobby, elderly-yet-tough schoolteacher Irene, mechanic Jim, assistant manager Ollie Weeks and patron Mike Hatlen venture out to the neighboring pharmacy, which unbeknownst to them has been transformed into a nest of spider-like creatures that shoot corrosive webbing and have massacred the pharmacy patrons. Among the mass of bodies is the MP, who quickly dies when he falls from his webs and spiders burst out of his back. The group is attacked and Mike and Bobby are killed by the spiders, forcing them to retreat. Following this, most of the people side with Mrs. Carmody. That night, two of the soldiers, Donaldson and Morales, commit suicide shortly afterwards, and, after some pressing from David, Jessup reveals that the local military base was filled with rumors about the Arrowhead Project, the government's attempt to look into [[Multiverse|other dimensions]], and that the scientists responsible for the experiment may have inadvertently opened a doorway into a dimension containing the creatures that are now invading the town. An angry mob then ensues, led by Mrs. Carmody, who orders her followers to blame him. As a result, he is stabbed and ejected from the store as a human sacrifice, quickly falling prey to a large [[praying mantis]]-like creature.  The following morning, David and his group, consisting of Billy, schoolteacher Amanda, Ollie, Irene, Dan, patron Ambrose, mechanic Myron, and Bud, secretly gather supplies to flee, but Mrs. Carmody stops them, having now turned the entire store against them. After stealing the supplies, she demands that Billy and Amanda be the next sacrifice, only for Ollie to shoot and kill her with Amanda's gun as chaos erupts. Returning to their senses, Mrs. Carmody's traumatized followers realize all that they have done because of her and, when Ollie threatens to begin shooting them, stand down and allow David's group to leave. As the group makes their way to David's car, Ollie is torn in half by the praying mantis-like creature, Myron and Ambrose are attacked and killed by the giant spiders, and Bud runs back to the market and is allowed to reenter. Only David, Billy, Dan, Amanda, and Irene make it to the car and leave as the remaining survivors in the store watch them drive off, their eventual fates ambiguous.  Driving through the mist, David finds his home destroyed and Stephanie dead, seemingly another victim of the giant spiders. Devastated, he drives the group south, passing destroyed vehicles and seeing a gigantic six-legged, tentacled beast. When they run out of gas hours later, the group decides there is no point in going on and David shoots the others (with their consent, except for his son who is not old enough to understand) rather than have them endure horrifying deaths, but is left with no bullet to use on himself. He leaves the car and waits to be killed, but the mist suddenly recedes, revealing that the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] has arrived, managed to close the portal, and are in the process of exterminating the creatures and restoring order. David also sees that they have rescued survivors, among them the woman who left the store at the phenomenon's onset, completely unscathed and having rescued her two children. David realizes that his group was only moments away from being rescued and that their deaths were premature and in vain, and drops to his knees screaming.

At school, the principal asks what his ambition is in life, and, Tom replies he wants to be Eddie Tudor. The principal then advises him to join the acting classes (which Pop doesn't allow him to do). He has lived with Pop since his parents died, a couple of years earlier. From a young age, his ambition has been to become an actor, partly inspired by the stories of fame and appeal of acting conveyed to him by his neighbour and best friend, Miles ([[Vincent Spano]]) who is a former actor and who also happens to be the father of Eddie Tudor (revealed at the end of the film). Miles has known Tom since he was a little kid, when Miles moved to the area, after quitting showbiz and he often tells Tom about the times when he was a star, although not revealing much as to how he lost his fame. Now 14, the same age as Eddie Tudor whom he looks exactly like, he wishes that he really is Eddie and gets frustrated with his Pop's persistent pushing for Tom to forget about the acting, and telling him to do 'real work', like helping him with his business, when Tom is not at school. He says he only pushes Tom because he cares about him. Miles, however, supports Tom with his acting ambition, but warns him that it is a tough business to get into and survive in.  Meanwhile, Eddie Tudor is frustrated with his life and being told what to do all the time. He doesn’t seem so interested in acting and can’t understand why his single mom ([[Dedee Pfeiffer]]) pushes him so hard to stick at it. He longs for some freedom and to be able to be a normal kid. Not appreciating what he has, he constantly goofs off on set and unknown to him, he is about to be dropped from the production that they have recently started filming in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], where Tom lives. When Tom hears about the production, he visits the lot where it is taking place, in the hope of meeting his idol, Eddie Tudor, and getting into the acting business. During a break from shooting, Tom (who sneaked onto the set and hid under a trailer) meets Eddie for the first time. Eddie, pleased to see another kid on set to hang out with, invites him into his trailer and the two talk and play Eddie's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. Tom is thrilled to meet Eddie and see inside his trailer and be on a film set, also to play the Xbox, since Tom doesn’t have one at his Pop's house. Eddie says that his mom doesn’t care how much he plays the Xbox in his spare time, because she is so busy. Tom tells Eddie how lucky he is, in comparison to him, but he's a friend of the former actor, Milles. Eddie doesn’t seem impressed by this, though, having never heard of Milles or other actors that Tom speaks about. Tom notices that Eddie doesn’t seem to appear that interested in acting, choosing to concentrate mainly on his Xbox that he's playing. Tom then spots Eddie's suit which he wears on screen in the 'Spy Teen' films and asks Eddie if he can try it on. Eddie, still engrossed in the game, replies "Sure, whatever". Eddie takes notice however, when he sees Tom in his suit and hairstyle, and realises that he & Tom are identical in appearance. He then puts on Tom's clothes and changes his appearance, and they are stunned to see how much they look alike. The Assistant Director of the film Eddie's shooting then comes into the trailer and, realising that he now has a chance for a bit of freedom away from filming, Eddie (who now looks exactly like Tom) says "Well, Eddie, it was great to meet you, but I best get going", leaving a startled Tom in his place, who will now have to act just like Eddie.  The real Eddie meets Pop, who picked him up from the sidewalk that he was walking along. Thinking that he is Tom, Pop drives him home in his pick-up, lecturing him about why he should have come straight home from school. Eddie sees Tom's home and his bedroom, which has posters of Spy Teen and 'Miami Squad', which Milles starred in, on the wall. The next day he and Pop go to work (Pop runs a landscaping business and Tom sometimes helps him) where Eddie tells him that he's not Tom and explains what happened, realising that he's not having much fun or freedom planting trees with Pop, and a frustrated Pop starts thinking that 'Tom' has gone mad. Meanwhile, the real Tom realises that fame isn’t everything it's portrayed to be as he has to cope with being ordered about by Eddie Tudor's mother and his agent and packing loads of filming and appearances into his day. At first, he faints with the shock of so quickly becoming Eddie and acting in a big movie, as he had for so long dreamed about. He is then accused of faking the faint by Eddie's agent and given a row by her and Eddie's mom for creating a fuss when they relocate to [[Miami]], who dismiss his behavior as Eddie's usual playing-up and don’t listen to him when he tries to explain that he is just a normal kid who switched places with Eddie for a laugh, and that they are leaving Eddie behind in Palm Beach, as well as Tom's own life. He asks if they can go back, but is refused, so Tom adjusts to his sudden new life as Eddie and enjoys it and acts well as Eddie and the character that Eddie must play, but he misses Pop and Miles. Tom Canty proves to be a 'better Eddie than Eddie', according to Elizabeth ([[Kay Panabaker]]), the cute co-star of Eddie Tudor in the production they are shooting together. She gets along with Tom much better than Eddie, which is why she realises that the boy she is now working with can't be Eddie and demands to know who he is. Tom explains all to Elizabeth and the two become close as they keep up the pretense in front of everyone around them, including Eddie's mom and Jerry (his agent), whilst they figure out what to do. Elizabeth suggests that Tom phone home, so he does, explaining all and knowing that he will be in trouble if his pop believes him.  As the days pass by, both Tom and Eddie try to tell people that they are not who everyone thinks they are. All Tom can now do is hope that his Pop comes to pick him up, whilst Eddie, upon realising that the production has moved to Miami, decides to get to the film set himself. He hotwires his boat (which was left in Palm Beach) after Miles takes the key from him and throws it into the water to stop who he thinks is Tom from running away from home. After he doesn’t get very far in the boat, Eddie has to be bailed out by Milles from the police station, and driven home to Pop who starts on Miles for interfering. Miles says he just cares about Tom and doesn’t want to see him going off the rails, but warns Pop that's what will happen if he keeps pushing him. Whilst they are arguing, Eddie jumps into Milles' car and drives off in it. Pop and Milles follow him in Pop's truck, losing track of him when he stops at a roadside service station to buy a veggie burger meal. At the film set in Miami, Milles and Pop bluff their way in by saying that they are extras. They also ask if there has been a kid pretending to be Eddie Tudor trying to sneak in yet, to which the security guard replies, "No sir, not yet". Later, Eddie arrives and the guard says to him, "You must be pretending to be Eddie Tudor" and lets him in. Once on the set, he spots Tom and confronts him, yelling "You're dead, punk!" and they have a brawl with Eddie ranting "You took my identity!", Tom responds with "It wasn’t my fault-They switched location!". Eventually, all calms down and everyone finds out who is who and what has happened. Eddie tells his mom that he now realises that she only pushes him because she cares, to which she says "That's right", and she also reunites with Miles, whom she used to date before Eddie was born, while he was still in the business-before he went off on his own, which he tells her was because he didn’t like the person he had become, not because he disliked her or acting. She understands and reveals to him that Eddie is his son.(Earlier in the movie when Miles thinks he is speaking with Tom he says "I'm not your Dad, but I care about you a lot......I’ve known you since you were a little kid and I've always thought you were cute, Tom".)(it is never revealed to Eddie that Miles is his father).  The movie ends with Eddie and Miles getting to know each other for real, as father and son, and, Miles and Eddie's mom hinting to each other about getting back together. All remain friends with Tom and he is taken on by Jerry to have his own acting career, starting with a production of Mark Twain's Prince and the Pauper with Eddie. "We were going to use twins, but I think Tom and Eddie would be great" said Jerry. "They sure fooled all of us". Pop asks Tom if that is definitely what he would like to do and after hearing the excited reply finally gives his approval and blessing to Tom. Milles tells Eddie that he is a lot younger than he was when he first started acting and says that the most important thing he learned was to be gracious and treat people with respect. He asks if Eddie can do that, to which he replies, "I will now!" and he does, just insulting Elizabeth jokingly at the filming of Prince and the Pauper, which she does back. They film with Tom, whilst Milles is now trying his hand at directing, with Eddie's mom producing and Jerry ([[Sally Kellerman]]) and Pop looking on. The end credits then begin, whilst the final shot shows of Eddie and Tom chilling together and with Miles barbecuing in a garden and everyone looks happy as Milles plays football with Tom, and his lookalike that he's known for much less time but who is really his son, Eddie, proud that the boys are following in his footsteps as actors and knows that they will not make the mistakes that he did after everything that they learned in their fun adventure: A Modern Twain Story: The Prince and the Pauper.

Molière (2007 film)
 The film begins in 1658, when the French actor and playwright returns to [[Paris]] with his theatrical troupe to perform in the theatre [[Philippe I, Duke of Orléans|the king's brother]] has given him. Most of the film is in the form of a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] to 1645.  Following an unsuccessful run as a tragic actor, Molière is released from [[debtor's prison]] by Monsieur Jourdain, a wealthy commoner with social pretensions, who agrees to pay the young actor's debts if Molière teaches him to act.   Jourdain, a married man with two daughters, hopes to use this talent to ingratiate himself with Célimène, a recently widowed aristocrat with whom he has become obsessed. He hopes to perform a short play he has written for the occasion. Molière, however, has been presented to the family and staff of Monsieur Jourdain as Tartuffe, a priest who is to serve as tutor for the Jourdains' younger daughter. As the story progresses Molière proceeds to fall in love with Jourdain's neglected wife, Elmire.  Sub-plots involve the love life of the Jourdains' older daughter, and the intrigues of the penniless and cynical aristocrat Dorante at the expense of the gullible Jourdain.    The story is mostly fictional and many scenes follow actual scenes and text in Molière's plays including ''[[Tartuffe]]'', ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'', ''[[The Imaginary Invalid]]'', and ''[[Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme]]'', whose principal character is also named Jourdain. It is implied that these "actual" events in his life inspired the plays of his maturity.  
Mongol (film)
 In 1192, [[Genghis Khan|Temüjin]], a prisoner in the [[Western Xia|Tangut kingdom]], recounts his story through a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s.  Embarking on an expedition 20 years earlier (1172), nine-year-old Temüjin is accompanied by his father [[Yesugei|Yesügei]] to select a girl as his future wife. He meets and chooses [[Börte]], against his father's wishes. On their way home, Yesügei is poisoned by an enemy tribe; on his dying breath, he tells his son that he is now [[Khan (title)|Khan]]. However, Targutai, Yesügei's lieutenant, proclaims himself as Khan and is about to kill his young rival. Prevented from doing so by [[Hoelun|the boy's mother]], Targutai lets him go and vows to kill him as soon as he becomes an adult.  After falling through a frozen lake, Temüjin is rescued by [[Jamukha]]. The two quickly become friends and take an oath as [[blood brother]]s. Targutai later captures him, but he escapes under the cover of night and roams the countryside.  Years later (1186), Temüjin is once again apprehended by Targutai. He escapes a second time, finding Börte and presenting her to his family. Later that night, they are attacked by the [[Merkit|Merkit tribe]]. While being chased on horseback, Temüjin is shot with an arrow but survives. Börte, however, is kidnapped and taken to the Merkit camp.<ref name="film">[[Sergei Bodrov]]. (2007). ''Mongol'' [Motion picture]. Russia: [[Picturehouse (company)|Picturehouse Entertainment]].</ref>  Temüjin goes to Jamukha—who is now his tribe's Khan—and seeks his help in rescuing his wife. Jamukha agrees, and after a year, they launch an attack on the Merkits and are successful. One night, while celebrating their victory, Temüjin demonstrates his generosity by allowing his troops to take an equal share of the [[Looting|plunder]]. Two of Jamukha's men see this as a stark contrast to their Khan's behavior and desert him the next morning by following their new master. Jamukha chases him down and demands that he give his men back, to which he refused. This act, aggravated by the inadvertent killing of his biological brother by one of Temüjin's men, leaves Jamukha (with Targutai as an ally) no choice but to declare war on him. Outnumbered, Temüjin's army is quickly defeated. Sparing his blood brother, Jamukha decides to sell him into slavery.<ref name="film"/>  Temüjin is sold to a Tangut nobleman despite the dire warning given to him by a [[Buddhist]] monk acting as his adviser, who senses the great potential the warrior carries and his future role in subjugating the Tangut state. While he is imprisoned, the monk pleads with him to spare his monastery when he will destroy the kingdom sometime in the future. In exchange for delivering a bone fragment to Börte indicating that he is still alive, Temüjin agrees. The monk succeeds in delivering the bone and the message at the cost of his life. Börte infiltrates the Tangut border town disguised as a merchant's [[concubinage|concubine]] and the two escape.  Temüjin pledges to unify all of the Mongol tribes and imposes three basic laws for them to abide to: never kill women and children, always honor your promises and repay your debts, and ''never'' betray your Khan. Subsequently (1196), he gathers an army and engages Jamukha, who has an even larger force. During the battle, a thunderstorm arises on the steppe, terrifying Jamukha's troops and causing their unconditional surrender. Temüjin allows Jamukha to live and brings the latter's army under his banner. Targutai is killed by his own soldiers and his body is presented to the Khan as a way of appeasing him, but they are executed for disobeying the law.  A postscript indicates that by 1206, Temüjin was designated the Khan of all the [[Mongols]]—''[[Genghis Khan]] of the Great Steppe''. He would later go on to invade and conquer the Tangut kingdom by 1227, fulfilling the monk's prophecy, but spared the monastery, honoring his debt to the monk.<ref name="film"/>

That proposal would bring many new jobs and much revenue for the tribe's people, but the council is concerned with the many negative aspects of the proposal. J.J. had proposed a plan that offers more highly skilled jobs and training for the tribe's people, and takes advantage of gaming profits without the negative aspects.  Billy tells Ryder that Reno runs the town, and that everyone's afraid of him, and Reno had J.J. murdered. Nancy tells Sheriff Acoma something has to be done about Reno.

Reno has his men kill the Mexican men, and then Reno tells Murphy to find Billy and kill him. Later, Lance says that Reno's ways of doing things attract too much attention. Lance had told Reno that if he got J.J. out of the way, then Lance would get approval to build the casino. Reno plans to kill Nancy and her family in order to make sure no one is in the way.  Ryder is teaching some of the Bible to some kids that White Deer regularly teaches, and Junior yells for Nancy to come down to the old camp ground near their home.

After Maniken kidnaps her father, Maggie becomes determined to help Mosaic to fight Maniken.<ref group="Movie references">[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1170587-stan_lee_presents_mosaic/ Stan Lee Presents: Mosaic - Movie Reviews, Trailers, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes]</ref>  They go from New York City, to the catacombs of Rome, to a large radio dish at the magnetic North Pole, trying to stop Maniken as he plans to sacrifice Maggie's father to use the Chameliel stones in a ceremony that will transfer to Maniken the powers of his wife from her body and rule Earth like a god.

Upon returning home, she plans to continue acting and agrees to her father's request to continue her studies, but at the same time, she vows to search for the remaining Chameliel stones and use their power for good, and honor Mosaic and the rest of the Chameliel by becoming the new Mosaic.  
Moordwijven
 Three millionaire best friends, Kitty, Estelle and Nicolette, spend their days having [[botox]] injections, [[liposuction]] and other plastic surgery – all to keep up their looks for their husbands. After witnessing the murder of their favorite plastic surgeon by his wife, the three ponder the idea of similarly killing their husbands should they sleep with someone else. Of the three, Kitty is virtually certain that her husband is cheating on her, having seen him call 'Pamela' from his cell phone. To 'prove' her suspicions, her friend Estelle hands her a booklet, a "Top 50" checklist of strange behavior to see if he's indeed cheating on her.  After filling up nearly the whole list with suspicious behavior, the three drive to [[De Wallen|Amsterdam's Red Light District]] to find a serial killer to do the job. After a misunderstanding with a different man, Kitty comes into contact with a deformed man who isn't afraid to use a gun. Kitty asks that the murderer makes sure her husband's death looks like an accident. The man demands not only €10,000, but also a first edition press of the [[Cliff Richard]] song [[Summer Holiday (song)|Summer Holiday]] – something Kitty's husband has in his possession. When Kitty goes to find the record, though, she finds out it's been given as a gift to a friend who is blind and in a wheelchair. Kitty sneaks in after a party thrown for guests and manages to get the record – though not before the blind man attempts to stab the 'intruder' with a sword, and accidentally electrocute himself on his [[jukebox]].  With the record now given to the killer, Kitty goes back to have her eyelids done and advises her friends to have alibis in case of police questioning. Kitty, needing someone to pick her up, calls Nicolette's husband. However, he picks her up in Kitty's husband's [[Maybach]] – exactly the car the killer was going to run off the road to make an 'accident'. During a chase through the woods, Nicolette's husband admits to having an affair. The car is run off the road, and while Kitty survives, Nicolette's husband is critically injured. After a visit to the hospital, the affair is proven when the mistress shows up at his bedside. Nicolette and the mistress fight, which indirectly causes Nicolette's husband to die from his injuries.  After the funeral, Kitty's husband decides to use a plane to sprinkle the dead man's ashes over the 18th hole of their golf course. The killer, posing as a mechanic, rigs the plane to leak hydraulic oil during the flight. Estelle's husband, having met the mistress at the bedside of Nicolette's husband, is seen in his office with the mistress. The two, completely naked, wave at Kitty's husband as he flies by – but the plane actually slams into the building, killing them. Kitty's husband, meanwhile, managed to jump out of the plane at the last second, sustaining only a broken arm. Now depressed at not having been able to perform a 'simple' killing, the killer is ready to quit, but Kitty meets him and encourages him to continue.   A few days later, Kitty's husband is set to present an award at a Dutch Music awards show. Before the awards show, Kitty is introduced to 'Pamela' – the woman she suspected was sleeping with her husband, but who is actually a [[Belgian]] businesswoman he was doing business with. Kitty frantically tries to call off the planned killing – which will happen with a bomb planted in the appropriate awards envelope – not knowing that there actually IS a Pamela her husband has been sleeping with. The murderer, chased by security guards around the parking lot, steals a truck and tries to make his escape. Kitty runs on stage and throws the bomb away just in time. However, the killer winds up driving the truck through a back wall, running over not only Kitty's husband, but Pamela as well, who had run up to him just before. Now happy that her husband was killed for an actual adultery, she kisses the killer. A few seconds later, he vanishes before the police can apprehend him. One year later, the three widows are seen enjoying life on the boat of their late husbands – along with the killer, who has had plastic surgery done to make him look more handsome.

Morgan Ahmed Morgan
  The film is in the form of a satirical comedy. It is a mix of Arab societal problems such as the issue of education, the problems of young university students, the elections, and simple trading. The central character, Morgan Ahmed Morgan (Adel Imam), a successful businessman, has very good relations with many important figures, but suffers from a lack of knowledge due to his incomplete education, which is the only thing that cannot be hidden or purchased with his fortune and influence. His children convince him that he needs to study, and after a period of rejecting their offers, he agrees and joins the same university they attend, beginning a new phase of his life. He deals with the university with the logic of a businessman who is keen on making financial gains and contracting deals.  When Morgan enters the university, he does not become an isolated student but instead participates in a lot of activities, and initiates investment projects with the university administration as a professional businessman. His influence grows throughout all of the different student sectors; for example, he becomes the president of the drama club and the captain of the football team and maintains close contact with all the students, regardless of whether they belong to liberal or radical extremist groups.       The film deals with the issue of nomination for the parliamentary elections, as Morgan seeks to run for parliament in order to obtain immunity to protect his business excesses and interests.

Morgan comes to his senses and reconciles with his children, deciding to finish his studies. After receiving his degree, he proposes to Professor Jeyhan Murad, a long running unrequited love interest since he joined the university, but who only sees him as a life partner when he earns his degree. Everybody has a price.

The Mother of Tears
 The film begins with members of the Catholic Church digging up the body of a 19th-century church official, whose casket has a box-shaped urn chained to it. Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum ([[Moran Atias]]), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black magic witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly.  The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome where Sarah Mandy ([[Asia Argento]]), an American studying art restoration, works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce, a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator, Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save her boss (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum's familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name "Mater Lachrymarum". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building.  Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city. Sarah continues her own research only to be summoned by Michael to his apartment. The witches have kidnapped his young son and won't return the boy to him unless he stops his investigation. Sarah begs him to call the police (who are tailing Sarah, ever since the murder at the museum) but Michael refuses to and instead opts to visit a local priest who is a trained exorcist. This goes badly for Michael; the two witches see him and he is soon captured and murdered, along with his son, whose body is cannibalized by the rapidly expanding coven. However, before he is killed, Michael calls Sarah and begs for her to come and help him. As she makes her way through a crowded train station, Sarah is spotted by a gang of witches who, like so many other witches, have arrived in Rome in order to pledge their loyalty to Mater Lachrymarum. Pursued by the witches and the police, the disembodied voice from before instructs Sarah on how to magically make herself invisible. She uses this to avoid the police detective, though she is forced to kill a witch, Katerina, who catches and corners her on the train.  At the priest's home, Sarah meets Marta, a fellow white witch and friend of Sarah's deceased mother. Realizing that Sarah's mother is the voice guiding her, Marta reveals details to Sarah about her parents. Her mother was a powerful white witch who dared to challenge and severely wound Mater Suspiriorum, the eldest and wisest of the Three Mothers. In response to this, Suspiriorum caused the fatal car crash that killed Sarah's parents. Though Mater Suspiriorum and her sister Mater Tenebrarum are now dead, their sibling Mater Lachrymarum has emerged from the shadows to bring about the second age of magic, with the fall of Rome as her coming out party. They talk to the priest, only for him to be killed before he can give the two a copy of a book that would explain Mater Lachrymarum's backstory to them by a patient of his. Escaping back to the city, Sarah goes to her own home but finds Mater Lachrymarum's goons waiting for her. She heads to Marta's house, but once again Mater Lachrymarum's minions strike and Marta and her lesbian lover are murdered. Fleeing, Sarah spots Michael, who takes her back to his apartment. Unfortunately, Sarah soon realizes that Michael is dead and that Mater Lachrymarum is animating his body in an attempt to kill her. As she burns her lover's still-animate body, the ghost of her mother intervenes one final time to grab Michael and banish him (and possibly herself) to Hell.  Sarah locates a powerful alchemist, who Marta mentioned as her only hope to learn how to fight Mater Lachrymarum. After being briefly paralyzed by the alchemist (so that he could perform a test on her to see if she was a white witch or an evil witch), the alchemist gives Sarah the only help he has in locating Mater Lachrymarum's dwelling. Sarah is given a copy of "The Three Mothers" to read, and from this (and from following a group of witches) Sarah finds Mater Lachrymarum's lair; a now run-down and disrepaired mansion. At this point, she is joined by one of the police detectives hunting her and the two go into the catacombs to find Mater Lachrymarum. However, the two become separated, and the detective is tortured alongside the alchemist and his assistant, who dies after his arm is chopped off by one of Mater Lachrymarum's minions. Sarah is caught and brought before Mater Lachrymarum, who offers Sarah up to her cannibal followers. Sarah, having healed the detective's wounds, uses a spear to pull the cloak off Mater Lachrymarum and tosses it into a nearby fire. This causes the mansion to collapse as a pillar falls and impales Mater Lachrymarum. With the Mother's followers crushed as the cave collapses, Sarah and the detective laugh in horror and shock as they reach the surface, as they realize that the threat of the Three Mothers has been defeated once and for all.  
Moving McAllister
 With only four days until the [[bar exam]], an utterly unprepared law intern, Rick Robinson (Ben Gourley), is given a rare opportunity to score points with his boss, Maxwell McAllister ([[Rutger Hauer]]) and without thinking, commits to a favor he cannot afford. Rick soon finds himself stuck in a grueling cross country road trip driving a rundown [[U-Haul]] truck carrying all his boss's worldly possessions. To make matters worse, he is left in charge of Mr. McAllister's bratty Hollywood-bound niece Michelle ([[Mila Kunis]]) and her out-of-control pet pig.  The trip from [[Miami]] to [[Los Angeles]] meets several snags. The truck breaks down on a backwoods road in the deep South, and Rick's clothes are burned by the hillbilly family providing them refuge for the night. Later, another breakdown results in Rick being knocked unconscious. He is rescued by a peculiar hitchhiker called Orlie ([[Jon Heder]]), who finds a motel room for him and Michelle. Orlie asks to accompany Rick and Michelle, and is accepted, as Rick believes he owes him a favor for his rescue. Michelle takes a shine to Orlie, and they proceed to have fun at Rick's expense.  After Orlie forces Rick into an unusual encounter in a fast food restaurant lavatory, Rick decides to leave him behind. He and Michelle grow closer to one another, following a stop at a [[Texas]] beach. Rick permits Michelle to drive, despite the insurance liability, due to fatigue. He wakes to find Michelle has taken them to [[Wichita, Kansas]] and Rick's home. Consequently, Rick is forced into a painful confrontation with his mentally ill father, an experience for which Michelle apologizes. They grow even closer as Michelle relates her life growing up.  The pair travel to [[Colorado]], where the truck runs out of gas. A semi in which Orlie is traveling as a passenger comes to their aid. Following a stop in a small town, the truck (and Michelle's pig) is stolen by men working for local crime boss "The Lady" ([[Billy Drago]]). The Lady forces Rick and Orlie to fight in a cage match before he returns the truck, impressed by the show they put on. Crossing into [[Utah]], Orlie spots a landscape that matches a drawing in his notebook. He believes that he has switched bodies as some past moment when he was near death, and believes that the person now occupying his body will arrive here. A switch can then take place. Orlie leaves Rick and Michelle, telling them to keep going.  As the window for Rick to safely arrive back in Miami for the bar exam narrows, he rejects Michelle's assertions that there is something special between them. Rick drives straight to Los Angeles, arriving in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] where Mr. McAllister is waiting for them at his beachside property. He states that Rick has arrived late, but does not appear overtly concerned. Realizing he must hurry to fly back to Miami, Rick rushes to the taxi McAllister has arranged for him, leaving Michelle asleep in the truck.  At the airport security checkpoint, Rick realizes he is making a terrible mistake as he observes the [[Instant film|Polaroid]] photos Michelle has snapped throughout their trip. Knowing he is meant to be with Michelle, he scrambles out of the airport and returns to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]]. Finding Mr. McAllister, Rick confesses his feelings for Michelle. McAllister, having heard similar sentiments from Michelle regarding Rick, thanks him for returning and asks him to take care of her. McAllister adds that his law firm will be opening a Los Angeles branch. The movie ends as Rick reunites with Michelle on the beach, and a man approaches Orlie back in Utah.

Moving Midway
 Godfrey Cheshire is an American film critic who had helped found Raleigh's ''Spectator Magazine'' and written for various publications such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and more. In early 2004, he learns that his cousin Charlie wants to move the buildings of Midway Plantation. The documentary features interviews with many of the family members, who worry that moving the buildings would destroy Midway. Cheshire learns about the African-American branch of Midway, and reaches out to a NYU professor, Dr. Robert Hinton, who shows him a new perspective on the Midway.  The film features excerpts from ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', ''[[The Littlest Rebel]]'', ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]'', ''[[Song of the South]]'', ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin (1927 film)|Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', and ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', among others. Blues songs were performed by [[Algia Mae Hinton]].  
Mr. Bean's Holiday
  [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) drives to a church [[fete|fête]] where he wins the first prize in a [[raffle]] – a holiday involving a train journey to [[Cannes]], a [[Handycam]] video camera, and [[Euro#Use as reserve currency|€200 spending money]].  Following a misunderstanding involving a [[taxicab|taxi]] at Paris railway station [[Gare du Nord]], Bean is forced to make his way unorthodoxly towards the [[Gare de Lyon]] from [[La Defense]] to board his next train towards Cannes. However, a [[vending machine]] prevents him from boarding, and he misses his train. Whilst waiting for the next, he samples French [[seafood]] cuisine at the restaurant [[Le Train Bleu (restaurant)|Le Train Bleu]], mistakenly eating a [[langoustine]] whole and pouring the [[oysters]] he took a dislike to into a woman's handbag.  Back on the platform, Bean asks a man, Emil Duchevsky ([[Karel Roden]]), a Russian movie director, to use his camcorder to film him boarding the train, but spends so much time retaking the shot that the train starts to leave. Although Bean manages to get onto the train, the doors close before Emil can get on. Emil's son, Stepan ([[Maxim Baldry|Max Baldry]]) is therefore left on board without his father.  Bean attempts without success to befriend the boy. At the next station, the train leaves without him when he disembarks to get his camcorder back from Stepan who had somehow got hold of his camcorder and disembarked earlier. The train Emil has boarded does not stop at the station, and he instead holds up a sign showing a mobile number, but the last two digits are covered by his fingers. Attempts at calling the number prove fruitless. Bean and Stepan board the next train but get kicked off as Bean had left his wallet and ticket on the telephone box at the previous station.  Attempts at busking, including lip syncing to [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]'s "[[O mio babbino caro]]", prove  successful, and Bean buys the pair food and bus tickets to Cannes. Bean manages to lose his ticket that attaches itself to a chicken's leg, and after a failed attempt to instead [[hitchhiking|hitchhike]] his way there on an elderly man's [[VéloSoleX]], he is forced to continue the journey on foot. Bean soon falls asleep, exhausted from walking and wakes up on what appears to be a quaint French village attacked by [[Wehrmacht]] backed by a [[StuG III]], but is actually a film set for a yogurt [[Television advertisement|commercial]]. Bean ends up as an extra in the commercial, directed by Carson Clay ([[Willem Dafoe]]). When Bean's camera battery dies, he recharges it, but accidentally ends up destroying the set in an explosion.  Bean then tries to hitchhike again and is picked up by a yellow [[Mini]] identical to his, driven by actress Sabine ([[Emma de Caunes]]), who offers him a lift to Cannes. She is an aspiring actress on her way to the 59th [[Cannes Film Festival]], where the film in which she makes her debut as an extra will be presented. When they stop at a service station, Bean finds Stepan dancing in a cafe with a band. Sabine agrees to take him with them, assuming that Stepan is Bean's son, while Stepan thinks Sabine is Bean's fiancée. Bean uses Sabine's [[mobile phone]] to try to call Emil again (with no luck) and, when Sabine falls asleep at the wheel, Mr Bean ends up driving through the night.  The next morning, they reach Cannes. When Sabine goes into a petrol station to change for the premiere, she sees Bean's photo on the television; he is suspected of kidnapping Stepan while Sabine is Bean's accomplice. However, since the premiere in Cannes is scheduled to start in one hour, she decides not to go to the police to clear the misunderstandings. Therefore, to get into the premiere, Stepan and Bean disguise themselves as Sabine's daughter and mother, respectively, and manage to evade the police.  After sneaking into the premiere, Sabine and Bean are disappointed to see that her scene has been cut from the film. Bean plugs his video camera into the projector, projecting his video diary. The bizarre tale it tells fits director Carson Clay's narration well, and the director, Sabine, and Bean receive standing ovations as Stepan is finally reunited with his father.  After the screening, Bean leaves the building by the back door, finally making his way onto Cannes beach.  A montage follows of Bean playing by the water's edge, while Sabine is interviewed, Carson Clay attempts to mimic Bean's unorthodox filming methods, and Stepan relaxes with his family.  The film ends with the entire cast and background crowd miming a musical finale "[[La Mer (song)|La Mer]]", as heard from a small girl named Lily (Lily Atkinson)'s [[MP3]] player during the raffle at which Bean won the trip. After the credits, Bean writes "FIN" in the sand with his foot. He films it until the sea washes the words away, and the camera's battery dies again.  
Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium
  Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman), an amateur [[pianist]], is an employee at "Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium", a magical and sentient [[toy shop]] run by the eccentric 243-year-old Mr. Edward Magorium (Dustin Hoffman). Besides Molly and Mr. Magorium, store bookbuilder Bellini ([[Ted Ludzik]]), a [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]], is also employed. Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills) is a boy who comes to the store daily and functions as an employee despite his young age. One day, the store develops a large grey patch on one of its walls, which rumbles periodically.  In response to Molly telling Mr. Magorium that she feels stuck, he gives her the Congreve Cube, a big block of wood, and tells her it will guide her to a new life and adventure if she has faith in it. Molly wants to become a composer and concert pianist, but has not been able to write any music since graduating. At home, she works on a concerto with little progress.  Mr. Magorium suddenly announces that he intends to "leave" and is giving the shop to Molly to provide her with the means to move forward and become "unstuck" in life.  In preparation for his departure, Mr. Magorium hires an [[accountant]], Henry Weston ([[Jason Bateman]]), to organize the shop's paperwork and determine his legacy to Molly. Henry does not believe that the toy store is magical, arguing with Molly over its properties and debating the actuality of Magorium's records from the past 200 years, most of which are entirely lost.  When Molly expresses her doubts and becoming upset about her ability to run the store, the Emporium 'throws a tantrum', assaulting everyone inside with the toys until Magorium calms it down. Molly finally realizes that Mr. Magorium is leaving not to retire but instead he is going to die. Desperate to stop this, Molly rushes him to a hospital where he is discharged the next day because nothing is physically wrong with him.  After leaving the hospital, Mr. Magorium asks Molly how she is doing with the Congreve Cube and asks what would happen if she believed in it. Molly does not understand but attempts to prevent Mr. Magorium's departure by showing him the joys of life, but he knows it is time for his story to end. Utilizing the stage notes of Shakespeare's [[King Lear]] to make the point about the importance of death, Magorium states the last lines of one of the most important pieces of dramatic literature are simply "he dies" before his death. Molly, Eric, all the children and their parents have a funeral for him.  Believing herself to be unworthy and incapable of owning a magical store, Molly puts it up for sale. The store grieves and loses all its magic, becoming varying shades of gray and black. Eric tries to reason with Molly over her decision to sell the store when he sees her at a hotel playing background music.  Henry meets Molly at the store to draw up the sale papers, where he sees the Congreve Cube and asks her about it. When Molly confesses her complete faith in the store and the Congreve Cube's magical ability, the block suddenly springs to life, and proceeds to fly around the store. After witnessing this, Henry faints with shock. When he later awakes and questions Molly about it, she tells him that it must have been a dream as she went home the previous night, leaving him to finalize the paperwork for the sale.  Henry is not deterred as he knows Molly made the cube fly and though she does not believe she can do magical and wonderful things, he believes in her. Henry realizes Molly is the Congreve Cube, a block of wood that can be anything if she can somehow believe in herself. Henry's wholehearted belief in Molly ignites a tiny spark in her and she believes. The store responds to her belief and continues to respond as her confidence builds until the entire store magnificently transforms. The magic and color return as Molly's long-awaited symphony comes into existence.  
Mr. Brooks
 Earl Brooks ([[Kevin Costner]]) is a wealthy, successful businessman recently honored by the [[Portland, Oregon]], [[Chamber of Commerce]] as "Man of the Year". However, Brooks lives a secret life as a [[serial killer]], known as the "Thumbprint Killer". Brooks has abstained from murder for the past two years by attending [[12-step program|twelve-step meetings]] for addicts, to try and cope with his "killing addiction". He feels the compulsion to kill rising again, however, as his [[id, ego and superego|id]], Marshall ([[William Hurt]]), becomes more insistent. Brooks gives in to his addiction and kills a young couple while they are having sex in their house and, as part of his [[psychopathology]], leaves each of the victims' bloody thumbprints on a lampshade. Brooks follows his meticulous [[modus operandi]], including fastidious preparation, cleaning up the crime scene, even locking the doors before departing, and burning the clothes he was wearing during the killings. Marshall then realizes that the couple's curtains were open, facing an apartment building.  Brooks' daughter Jane ([[Danielle Panabaker]]) unexpectedly arrives home, having dropped out of college in [[Palo Alto, California]]. She visits Brooks at work and mentions that she would like to get a job with his company. The same day, a man calling himself "Mister Smith" ([[Dane Cook]]) turns up at Brooks' work and [[blackmail]]s him with photographs of Brooks at the most recent murder. Smith demands that Brooks take him along on a murder, to which Brooks reluctantly agrees.  Brooks' wife, Emma ([[Marg Helgenberger]]), reveals that Jane dropped out of college because she is [[pregnant]]. The Brooks are then visited by detectives from Palo Alto who want to interview Jane about a murder committed in her former dorm building. Marshall and Brooks realize that Jane committed the murder and consider letting her go to jail to "save her" from becoming like them. Eventually, however, Brooks uses an alternate identity, flies to Palo Alto, and commits a similar murder to make it appear as if a serial killer is loose, thereby exonerating Jane.  Brooks researches the background of the police officer chasing the Thumbprint Killer, Detective Tracy Atwood ([[Demi Moore]]), and discovers she's in the middle of an agonizing divorce from Jesse Vialo ([[Jason Lewis (actor)|Jason Lewis]]). Brooks decides that Vialo and his lawyer, Sheila ([[Reiko Aylesworth]]), will be Smith's first "victims". At the scene of the Vialo murder, Smith [[urination|wets his pants]] in a fit of panic, leaving his [[DNA]] for the police to discover later.  While driving away from the scene, Smith pulls a gun on Brooks, which Brooks and Marshall had predicted would happen. Brooks explains to Smith that he knows he can't stop killing, and so plans to commit suicide to spare his family the shame of his being caught. Brooks takes Smith to a cemetery he owns, and explains that they will find an open grave. Smith will shoot Brooks and then cover him with just enough dirt to mask the body. The next day, a casket will be lowered into the grave and covered, and Brooks' body will never be discovered.  Smith attempts to shoot Brooks, but Brooks reveals that, at some point prior, he had broken into Smith's apartment and bent the [[firing pin]] on Smith's pistol, rendering it inoperable on the off-chance that Brooks would change his mind. Brooks' brush with death makes him realize he wants to live to see his grandchild, and he turns on his would-be murderer, slitting Smith's throat with a shovel and hiding his body in the open grave. With Smith's urine providing the only DNA evidence of the Thumbprint Killer at a murder scene, Brooks will remain undetected. Smith is named as the Thumbprint Killer and Brooks returns to his normal life.  Knowing he is in the clear, Brooks calls Detective Atwood, whom he has come to admire, to ask her why she is a police officer. She replies that her wealthy father had wanted a boy, and she wanted to succeed in spite of him. Atwood is unable to trace the call before Brooks hangs up, but she is puzzled as she realises Smith was not the voice on the line and that they may have fingered the wrong guy. That night, Brooks has a nightmare in which Jane murders him, suggesting that he fears Jane will become like him.

Mr Dana Rina
  
El Muerto (film)
 Centuries ago, the [[Aztec empire]] of Mexico was conquered by the Spanish [[conquistadors]]. Horrified by their religious practices, the Spaniards set out to convert the native population to [[Catholicism]], effectively declaring war upon the [[Aztec religion]]. According to an ancient prophecy, the Aztecs and their religion will return to dominance in a time known as the [[Five Suns|Sixth Sun]].  While attempting to illegally cross the [[United States-Mexico border]], young orphan boy Juan Diego is singled out by a fellow traveler, a strange old man known only as "Old Indian" claiming to know the way. The old man leads the boy to an old Aztec shrine dedicated to the god of death, [[Mictlantecuhtli (comics)|Mictlantecuhtli]]. Explaining that they must give thanks to [[Tezcatlipoca (Los Comex)|Tezcatlipoca]], the god of sacrifice, Old Indian proceeds to carve a symbol of the god in to Diego's hand. Declaring the boy's blood to be pure, the Old Indian dies in the throes of invocations of [[Nahuatl]], abandoning the boy in the desert.  Ten years later, 21-year-old Diego has made a home for himself in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]]. He shares an apartment with his best friend Zak and is in love with Maria, niece of Padre Somera of the local mission which dates back to the [[Hernán Cortés|Cortés]] era. However, Diego and Maria's relationship is strained both by his haunting encounter with Old Indian and the devout Padre's disapproval of the young man's sympathy towards Aztec beliefs and mythology. Anticipating a local [[Dia de los Muertos]] festival, Diego begins to feel the call of something powerful. He dresses as an [[undead]] [[Mariachi]], clad in black with the traditional markings to give himself a skeletal appearance.  En route to the celebration, the forces of the Aztec [[underworld]] cause Diego's car to crash, ending his life. Diego awakens in the Aztec afterlife of [[Mictlan]] where the god of death sacrifices him to Tezcatlipoca in a ritual where his heart is torn from his chest with the aid of an [[obsidian]] blade. He is then sent back to the land of the living exactly one year after his death. Diego, selected long ago by the Old Indian, is the sacrificial priest in service to Tezcatlipoca. In order to fulfill the prophecy of the Sixth Sun, Tezcatlipoca requires three human sacrifices, each symbolizing the Catholic Church that wiped out the old gods over five hundred years ago. And Maria, being the direct descendant of the Somera family is at risk. Armed with the power to take life or restore it, Diego must struggle against the very gods who created him in order to save the woman he loves.  
Mr. Woodcock
 John Farley ([[Seann William Scott]]) is a successful self-help author who returns to his hometown in [[Nebraska]] to receive an award. Farley arrives at home and learns that his widowed mother Beverly ([[Susan Sarandon]]) is dating his former Physical Education teacher Jasper Woodcock ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]). Farley disapproves of the relationship because he remembers Woodcock as an abusive bully.  Woodcock and Beverly become engaged and the majority of the film centers on Farley's attempts to convince his mother to break off the relationship. Farley becomes increasingly obsessed with beating Woodcock at various competitions and with proving that Woodcock is not a suitable mate for Beverly. Farley's antics are so childish and extreme that his new love interest Tracy ([[Melissa Sagemiller]]), a former classmate, refuses to see him again.  Farley is set to receive his award at the same ceremony where Woodcock will be presented with an award for "Educator of the Year." Woodcock receives his award first and is praised by numerous members of the community for being a great teacher and influence on children. Farley is unconvinced and devotes his entire acceptance speech to explaining why Woodcock is the "biggest asshole on the planet." Woodcock and various crowd members refute Farley's points, and Woodcock then challenges Farley to a fight. Beverly witnesses the confrontation and dumps Woodcock.  The next day, Farley has a heart-to-heart conversation with his mother, who tells him that he is selfish and has always sabotaged her relationships with men after his father's death. Farley realizes she is correct and attempts to apologize to Woodcock. The two have a final exorcising fight, which leads to Woodcock suffering a concussion. Farley and Beverly visit Woodcock in the hospital and all three seemingly make peace. Farley declares that the key to life is not "getting past your past" but instead learning to embrace your past. He opines that Woodcock's vicious treatment in gym class helped him become the man he is today.  The film ends with several short scenes cut into the final credits. These scenes reveal that Woodcock and Beverly got married, Farley was reunited with Tracy, and Farley wrote a second book entitled ''Backbone: The Definite Guide to Self Confidence.''  
Mukhsin

Music and Lyrics
 Alex Fletcher ([[Hugh Grant]]) is a washed-up former pop star who is attempting to revive his dwindling career by hitching his name to the rising star of Cora Corman ([[Haley Bennett]]), a young megastar who has asked him to write a song titled "Way Back Into Love." Alex is reluctant to compose again after two decades, but his caring but professional manager tells him that his career is doomed if he doesn't. During an unsuccessful attempt to compose the song in collaboration with a "very hip, very edgy" lyricist, Alex discovers that the woman who is temporarily watering his plants, Sophie Fisher ([[Drew Barrymore]]), has a gift for writing lyrics. Sophie, a former creative writing student reeling from a disastrous romance with her former English professor Sloan Cates ([[Campbell Scott]]) who "forgot" to mention he had a fiancée, initially refuses. Alex cajoles her into helping him by using a few quickly-chosen phrases she has given him as the basis for a song. Over the next few days, they grow closer while writing the words and music together, much to the delight of Sophie's older sister Rhonda ([[Kristen Johnston]]), a huge fan of Alex.  Barely meeting the deadline Cora has set for the song's delivery, Alex and Sophie are thrilled when she accepts it; however, at a celebratory dinner with Alex's manager Chris ([[Brad Garrett]]) Sophie is mortified to encounter Sloan. She confronts him but finds herself tongue-tied in his presence, and Alex's own attempts to defend her result in a scuffle. Nursing their wounds back at Alex's apartment, Alex and Sophie fall into an unplanned romantic encounter.  Sophie is later horrified when she finds Cora plans to record a sexy interpretation of "Way Back into Love," complete with an Indian vibe which she feels clashes with the romantic spirit of the song. She is determined to convince Cora to abandon the arrangement, but Alex vetoes her efforts for fear he will lose Cora's goodwill. In the ensuing argument, he admits Cora's version is awful but contends accepting it as the cost of doing business. Upset by Alex's willingness to demean his talent and extremely hurt by his argument that Sloan Cates was right about her personality, Sophie leaves him.  Sophie, intending to start a new life in Florida, reluctantly attends the opening of Cora's new tour at [[Madison Square Garden]], at which Alex and Cora will debut "Way Back Into Love". Upon hearing that Alex is singing a new song "written by Alex Fletcher", Sophie is upset to believe that Alex is stealing credit for her work; however, the song Alex sings is called "Don't Write Me Off", his plea for Sophie to give him another chance. Touched, Sophie finds Alex backstage, and he confesses he convinced Cora to drop the risqué version of "Way Back into Love" in an attempt to win Sophie back. He and Cora perform the tune as he and Sophie intended it to be sung, leading to the two of them kissing.  The end of the movie (an homage to [[VH1]]'s ''[[Pop-Up Video]]'') reveals that the song becomes a hit for Cora and Alex, the film version of Sloan's novel flops with critics and moviegoers (ruining his career), PoP! reunites for their induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] after which their lead singer Colin Thompson (who left the band with some of Alex's songs to start a solo career) winds up having his hip replaced after years of dancing, and Alex and Sophie go on to become successful partners, both in songwriting and romance.

Muni enters Ganesh's body and Ganesh starts behaving in a rude manner; his family couldn't understand why his behavior is weird, so they seek the help of a priest Andaiyer ([[Nassar]]). Andaiyar asks the ghost about his whereabouts. The ghost says he is Muniyaandi ([[Rajkiran]]) and starts saying his flashback. Muniyaandi was a kind-hearted poor man living in the slums with his daughter and other people. Muni's friend is the MLA Marakka Dhandapani ([[Dhandapani]]), who uses Muni to make him win in elections and promises that he would give lands to the poor villagers. Dhandapani wins the election, but he cheats Muni. Muni fights with Dhandapaani, but Dhandapani kills both him and his daughter. Dhandapani lies to poor people saying that Muni and his daughter had fled with the money he had given Muni for the welfare of the village residents. Ganesh accepts Muni, and he enters his body. Ganesh enters Dhandapani's household and terrorizes him and his assistants. Dhandapani comes to know that Muni's spirit resides in Ganesh's body, so he gets a shaman Mastan Bai ([[Rahul Dev]]) to save his life. The shaman bargains with Muni, who agrees to let Dhandapani go if he repents and helps the poor villagers. In the climax, at Ayyanaar temple, Dhandapani confesses to the people that he had actually killed Muni and his daughter. Dhandapani then leaves money with the villagers. Muni talks with the people and eats the feast prepared by them. The shaman instructs Muni to leave Ganesh's body and he does. However, Dhandapani had lied and was planning to get back all his money from the villagers. Ganesh, upon hearing this, kills Dhandapani while pretending to be still possessed by Muni. Mastan Bai sees through this act of Ganesh, but instead does nothing as the shaman sees the injustice done by Dhandapani.

Murder Party
 Christopher, a lonely and plain man, finds an invitation to a [[Halloween]] costume party entitled "Murder Party", on the street. Constructing a knight costume out of cardboard, he makes his way to [[Brooklyn]] to attend the party, only to discover it is actually a trap set by a group of deranged art students. The art students, in costume, include Paul (a gothic vampire), Macon (a werewolf), Sky (a [[zombie]] cheerleader), Lexi ([[Daryl Hannah]]'s [[replicant]] character from ''[[Blade Runner]]''), and Bill (a Baseball Fury from [[The Warriors (film)|''The Warriors'']]).  They intend to commit a murder as a piece of artwork to impress Alexander, their wealthy and sinister patron, in the hopes that they will receive a large arts grant from Alexander. Christopher has brought along a loaf of pumpkin raisin bread, which Sky starts to eat. She then reveals that she is allergic to non-organic raisins, and didn't know about them. The group asks if she'll be OK, and she agrees explaining she's only a little dizzy and needs to sit down, however she falls over and hits her head on some old machinery and dies. The group hides the body, as they are embarrassed and don't want their patron to see it when he arrives. After dumping the body in a deep freezer, Macon blames Christopher for Sky's death and attempts to murder him before Alexander arrives by pouring a jar of acid on him. The acid has no effect as it is only a jar of Acetic Acid (vinegar).  The patron finally arrives to the Murder Party with a friend Zycho (who is unknown to the group), and his dog Hellhammer. Alexander is also dressed as a gothic vampire, but his costume is considerably cheaper than Paul's. Out of jealousy, Alexander forces Paul to completely remove his vampire costume while Zycho holds him at gunpoint. Alexander reveals that Zycho is his drug dealer and he was only joking with Paul, telling him the gun wasn't real. Each member of the Murder Party then gives their input on how they will commit the murder. Drugs and alcohol fuel the group as they decide to wait for the witching hour, at which time they will all stab Christopher in unison. While Macon leaves to pick up some pizza, Alexander has sex with Lexi and then later with Paul. Macon arrives back to see the two having sex and this makes Macon visibly upset. Macon begins binge drinking hard alcohol in response and ends up covering himself in alcohol in the process. Paul, a photography artist, begins taking pictures of Christopher and is frustrated that no one will assist him.  Zycho, visibly bored with the party, asks Alexander if they could leave and Alexander whispers something in his ear in response. Alexander then suggests that the group play a game of ultimate truth or dare. They will all take a shot of [[Sodium Pentothal]] (truth serum) and divulge their most inner secrets. All eventually take a shot from the same needle, except for Alexander, who injects his shot into a slice of pizza. Each reveals mostly trivial truths about their lives and attempt to force Alexander to confirm that he indeed does have grant money to give. During this time, Bill who has mostly kept to himself playing a [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] and shown little visible interest in the proceedings, asks the group what they say about him behind his back. They tell him they make fun of him and plan on throwing him out of the group, but only because his work is so much better than theirs. This angers Bill and he goes back to playing his PSP. Macon confesses his long time love for Lexi and recounts a story of when they were in high school and ate a popsicle together on a water tower. Macon shows he kept the leftover popsicle stick as a token but is rebuffed by Lexi. Alexander sends Zycho out to get him some Crank. Macon is now extremely inebriated and goes outside to smoke a cigarette. Still covered in alcohol, Macon is engulfed in flames as he lights the cigarette, and only Christopher notices.  Frustrated with not having anyone to assist in his photographs, Paul calls his professional assistant to aid him. The group is not happy as the assistant is not aware of the murder party. An argument breaks out and Paul injects Alexander with a dose of Sodium Pentothal. The groups asks him about the grant again and discover Alexander is actually a fraud. He is a fry cook who plans on killing the group, stealing their art, and selling it as he assumes it will be worth more. Lexi discovers Macon on fire and she and the assistant extinguish him. Zycho returns with a bag of crank and Alexander immediately tells Zycho to kill everyone. Paul is shot in the head but doesn't realize and seems to only be annoyed that someone interrupted his shot. The assistant is also shot in the head and Zycho attacks Lexi. Macon, badly burned but still alive, gets his chainsaw and uses it to attack Zycho, killing him and passing out shortly afterward. Lexi immediately begins to untie Christopher, but Bill, who has now completely snapped, decides everyone has to die and kills Lexi with an axe. In the excitement Hellhammer eats the bag of crank and then attacks Alexander. Bill finishes off the wounded Alexander with a baseball bat and begins hunting down the last survivor, Christopher, who has now escaped. Macon awakes and pursues Bill with an electric chainsaw to take revenge for Lexi. The chase leads them to an Arts student party. Chris attempts to hide in a performance art exhibit and Bill is approached by the organizer and asked if has seen Alexander as a grant was promised to him. Bill is further enraged and vows to murder the whole scene. He enters the art exhibit and murders all the artists before cornering Christopher. Macon, who has arrived at the party and has found an outlet to plug in the chainsaw, falls off the roof while plugging it in. The plugged in chainsaw is conveniently left hanging in front of a window where Christopher is trapped. Christopher uses the chainsaw to kill Bill in self-defense. In the only moment of exultation seen from Chris, he finally slams a pumpkin onto Bill's destroyed head and screams that he only wanted to party. He exits the room, borrowing a security guard's phone to dial emergency services, explicitly pointing out that the scene is real - not art. He then leaves the exhibit as party-goers assume the murder scene is an art piece.  Christopher disposes of his anti-anxiety medication and arrives home, where his cat, Sir Lancelot, finally gives him his chair back. Christopher sits down and turns on his television, still wearing his blood soaked knight costume.

Devastated, she stays in his cafe the entire night, eating a blueberry pie he made, and also telling stories about each other. Jeremy, having an eidetic memory, explains to her the bowl of keys he is keeping, knowing the story of every person who left the key in his cafe and keeping it in the bowl in case someone comes back for them. Elizabeth leaves her key of her apartment and leaves Jeremy's cafe.  Elizabeth, now calling herself Lizzie, eventually drifts to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], where she takes two jobs, waitress by day and barmaid by night, in order to earn enough money to finance the purchase of a car. She regularly sends postcards to Jeremy, taking a liking to him, without revealing where she lives or works and, although he tries to locate her by calling all the restaurants in the area, he fails to find her. Later on, he decides to send out postcards to any restaurants she may be to try to find her.  One of Lizzie's regulars at both jobs is local police officer Arnie Copeland ([[David Strathairn]]), an alcoholic who cannot accept the fact his wife Sue Lynne ([[Rachel Weisz]]) has left him and is flaunting her freedom by openly socializing with a younger man named Randy ([[Benjamin Kanes]]). He confesses to Lizzie his many attempts at achieving sobriety have ended in failure, taking many [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meetings but failing. One night off duty in the bar where Lizzie works, he drunkenly threatens Sue Lynne with his gun if she leaves. Later on, Arnie drives drunk and dies after crashing into a pole.  Lizzie comforts Sue Lynne at the crash site, before leaving town, and is given the money towards Arnie's tab at the bar, revealing to Lizzie that she made a mistake and that she misses him. The place where he died is also the place where they met, suggesting that he may have committed suicide.  Heading west, Elizabeth – now calling herself Beth – gets another waitress job at a [[casino]] in a small town in [[Nevada]]. Here she meets Leslie ([[Natalie Portman]]), an inveterate [[poker]] player who has lost all her money. Beth agrees to lend her $2200 she has in exchange for a third of her winnings or her car, a [[Jaguar XK]], if she loses.

While en route Leslie receives a call from a Vegas hospital, where her father has been admitted and is dying. She believes the call is simply a ruse to lure her home, but upon arrival in Vegas she discovers her father died the previous night. Leslie announces she wants to keep the car, which she had stolen from her father, who had sent her the title and registration despite their estrangement. She confesses she really won the card game and gives Beth her promised share of the winnings, which she uses to finally purchase the car she always wanted.  Elizabeth returns to [[Manhattan]] and, discovering her ex-boyfriend has vacated his apartment and moved on with his life, returns to the cafe, where Jeremy has had a stool at the counter reserved for her ever since she left. As she eats a slice of blueberry pie, Elizabeth realizes her feelings for him are reciprocated. She passes out on the counter after spending the night, and Jeremy kisses her while she is asleep, and she returns the kiss as the film ends.  
My Brother Is an Only Child
  Accio ([[Elio Germano]]) and Manrico ([[Riccardo Scamarcio]]) are working class brothers who live in Italy in the 1960s. While his brother becomes drawn into left-wing politics, Accio, the hotheaded younger brother, is taken under the wing of a market trader and while under his influence, joins the [[Fascist]] party. Accio ("Bully") is a nickname he is proud of because it makes him seem tough.  Manrico and their sister Violetta are alarmed to hear their brother listening to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s speeches in his room. Manrico often physically torments his brother, including stuffing his head in the barrel under the drain pipe of their house.  Accio once runs away from home because his mother voted for the Houses Party.  Their house is falling apart and she thinks the Houses Party will help them rebuild it.  As Accio and Manrico get older they start demonstrating as members of the Fascist party and the Communist movement respectively.  (There are scenes of a [[occupation of factories|factory occupation]], and the occupation of the Rome conservatoire, where the sister is studying the cello.) The film is relatively even handed in its treatment of politics. If the young fascists seem absurd with their chanting of 'Duce! Duce!', and their actions constantly tending to violence, the communists are hardly less so: Schiller's words in the final movement of Beethoven's choral symphony are replaced by a hymn in praise of [[Mao Zedong]], [[Vladimir Lenin]] and [[Joseph Stalin]]; a meeting of activists consists of a room full of bearded men all shouting at once and only agreeing when the time comes to shout a slogan.  Francesca, Manrico's girlfriend, becomes Accio's friend.  Accio secretly likes her and thinks that she should not stay with Manrico because "he can't be depended on".  The viewer is in little doubt that Accio is also attracted to Francesca himself. At the same time, he has himself become sexually involved with the wife of his fascist friend, the market trader, who has been imprisoned for his violent political activities. She buys him a car through an installment plan.  Eventually Accio ends up leaving the Fascist party and tearing up his membership card when party members burn his brother's car. He also breaks up with his older lover, telling her that he cares for someone else, but not replying when asked if he is loved in return.  But while Accio largely pulls out of political activism, his brother is drawn deeper into revolutionary violence. After disappearing for two years, he calls home. Accio travels to meet him and telephones Francesca, who twice quickly hangs up on him. When they meet in a cafe, Manrico sees Francesca arriving unexpectedly, but also the police who have perhaps been tailing her or tapping her telephone. He  flees but dies in an exchange of (handgun) fire with the pursuing police.  Accio then breaks into the corrupt and inefficient housing office to seize the waiting keys and the records of the homeless. He distributes keys and a party of homeless families take possession in the middle of the same night. The film ends with Accio living with his family, including his brother's small son.

Bruce returns to his caravan to find that everyone, including his own dog, hates him a lot. He has a [[restraining order]] placed upon him by his ex-wife, Cheryl ([[Ellen Sandweiss]]), and finds that his "surprise birthday present" from Mills was just a singing prostitute named Kasey (Janelle Farber). Bruce is then called by Jeff, who informs him that he's going to take on Guan Di alone in spite of Bruce's retreat.  Kasey takes Bruce back to Gold Lick, where he is treated with contempt and tries to reconcile with Kelly. To rescue Jeff, they both drive to the old cemetery, in which they set up dynamite at the mausoleum and try to lure Guan Di inside with one of Jeff's cardboard cut-outs of Bruce, which Guan Di doesn't fall for. After kissing Kelly, Bruce decides to sacrifice himself (with bean curd playing a significant role in luring Guan Di) and the dynamite is blown up. He emerges from the debris alive, and hangs the medallion back onto the mausoleum wall to ease the spirit. Guan Di then also comes back to life, and at the very last minute, it turns out the whole scenario ''was'' a movie. Bruce argues with Ted Raimi about the cliched ending and turns it into a happy ending, which involves Bruce and Kelly married, living in a nice house with their son, Jeff, who is accepted into [[Harvard University]]. After the movie ends, Bruce asks "What could be a better ending than that?", after which Guan Di appears and attacks Bruce.

My Little Pony: A Very Pony Place
 Unlike the previous three specials, ''A Very Pony Place'' features three different stories, each of them focusing on the new characters exclusively released in the special. These were: Lily Lightly, Storybelle, Star Flight, Heart Bright and lastly, Puzzlemint.  ===Come Back, Lily Lightly=== The first story, ''Come Back, Lily Lightly'' focuses on the main heroine Lily Lightly. The story begins when Lily Lightly announces the event called the Night of the Thousand Lights. Part of the event is the Rainbow Lights party, in which each unicorn pony in Unicornia decorates the place with lights. After nighttime falls and the whole place is decorated with lights, Cheerilee gave Lily Lightly the title "Princess of All that Twinkles and Glows", but her horn starts to glow and then runs off, leaving some of the ponies confused. Meanwhile, Pinkie Pie and Minty were going to Unicornia by balloon. Minty said she left the map at home and she doesn't need it. Back at Unicornia, Lily Lightly got embarrassed as everyone saw her horn glowing and runs away from Unicornia. Back at Pinkie Pie and Minty, both ponies were now getting lost through a sea of clouds while Minty said they need to see the bright lights of Unicornia to get there. Back on the ground, Brights Brightly and Rarity goes to search for Lily Lightly at the outskirts of Unicornia.  ===Two for the Sky=== The second story, ''Two for the Sky'' focuses on Storybelle and her story about Star Flight and Heart Bright. Pinkie Pie, Minty and Sunny Daze all went to Storybelle's house to listen to one of her stories. Storybelle herself picked her favorite story, Two for the Sky, a story about two ponies who were so close that they were almost twins. As she explained the story, both of them play together, eat sundaes together and wished that they can gain wings so they can fly to the sky. Both of them did several attempts to fly, but ended not lifting up in the ground, until they asked the Breezies in Breezy Blossom on how they can fly. However, the Breezies answered that they can actually fly, but not knowing why or how. As both ponies returned to Ponyville to get some sleep, they both wished and wanted to dream they wanted to fly. As they woke up, they both gain wings and both flew to the sky, not expecting that flying is not easy as it looks.  ===Positively Pink=== The third and final story, ''Positively Pink'' focuses on Pinkie Pie, Minty and Puzzlemint. Minty looked at the Birthday Book and found out it's Pinkie Pie's birthday. Everyone hold up a meeting at Sweetberry's Sweet Shoppe and decided they plan a surprise party for Pinkie Pie by making everything pink. As Pinkie Pie enters the shop, everyone kept her mouths shut about the party and left the place. Feeling confused, Pinkie Pie asked Sweetberry what's going on, only answering that she needs to consult Puzzlemint to "Solve some kind of puzzle". As everyone in Ponyville prepares for her surprise party, Puzzlemint halts everyone on the preparations and goes on to distract Pinkie Pie so the preparations can continue.  
My Kuya's Wedding
 A younger sister ([[Maja Salvador]]) tries to ruin her brother's wedding for she knows that he will leave her alone after he marries his fiancee. She tries to concoct a scene by following her brother's pamamanhikan in the province, revealing further details about the woman's family.  
Naan Avanillai (2007 film)
  The film opens with a scene of people giving police complaints of the same fraud. Police broadcast the picture of the suspect on TV. Elsewhere, Annamalai ([[Jeevan (Tamil actor)|Cheenu]]) is arrested by the police in a hospital after being injured in a bus accident, under the charges of cheating and marrying four women with false identities. The four victims also confirm after seeing Annamalai that he was the one who cheated them.  Annamalai is produced in the court where the judge (Lakshmi) offers him a free lawyer owing to his inability to pay for one, but he prefers to argue his own case. Proceedings start as Rekha (Malavika) is produced as the first witness. She explains how she came into contact with a rich man from London called Vignesh and how he charmed her. A friend of Vignesh called Napoleon informs Rekha that Vignesh's parents want him to come to London in two days to make him marry a rich young woman. Rekha suggests that they both marry next day without much formality, so as to prevent marriage with the London girl. After  marrying  her, Vignesh cheats Rekha's brother Tyagu, a construction company owner, of Rs.25 lakhs intended as bribe for a government minister by acting as a middle-man between Tyagu and the minister in obtaining licence for a construction tender. He also decamps with Rekha's jewels worth Rs.40 lakhs next day after the marriage. However, Vignesh had postponed marriage registration and formal [[Indian wedding card|invitation]] printing owing to his apparent urgency to go to London. He also wanted the photographer to take the wedding photos in his personal digital camera saying he will send the prints from London.  Annamalai argues that since there was no proof of a marriage between Vignesh and Rekha in terms of photos or registration, she cannot accuse him of cheating her; he states that he is not Vignesh. He, in turn, accuses Rekha's brother of trying to bribe the minister of Rs.25 lakhs. The fingerprints analyzed on the suitcases were found not to match with Annamalai's prints.  The next victim is Ammu Kutty (Jyothirmayi) from Cochin. She meets Madhavan Menon who helps lift up her picnic car when it was stuck in a hole. Then regular meetings passed and both started to love each other. When Ammu Kutty's family decide to marry her to a man in her relations, Ammu Kutty and Madhavan elope with her jewels. Napoleon then calls Ammu Kutty and says Madhavan has to pay Rs.10 lakhs deposit regarding a tea estate business; today is the last date. Ammu Kutty also learns from Napoleon that Madhavan is the son of the sister of Kerala's chief minister. Madhavan says he doesn't have that much money. Ammu then gives him all her jewels for this. Madhavan hesitates but later takes it and goes to pay the deposit. But he doesn't return. Someone informs her family of her location and they come and  drag Ammu Kutty to her house.  Annamalai then cross questions Ammu Kutty. He says it's her fault to have chosen a husband without even knowing properly who he was. When he asks for her [[Mangalsutra|Thali]], she says she threw it away in anger. Annamalai states that the Thali should not be disrespected like this and hence she is lying. He repeats that he is not the criminal.  Meanwhile, Anjali, the daughter of the judge who was watching the case from the beginning recalls how the criminal cheated her. Anjali met Zakir Hussain at an art gallery and they started to love each other. Anjali wanted to buy one of his paintings. Zakir agreed to bring the covered Rs.1 lakh painting to her house. Zakir entices Anjali by proposing to her and leaving for Hyderabad on work. When Anjali opens the painting, it is revealed to be a blank sheet. Anjali then goes to the art gallery where she meets the real Zakir Hussain who says that there was a man whose name was also Zakir Hussain who was a fan of his art. After this incident, Anjali develops an affinity toward Annamalai, still believing him to be the man who cheated her cleverly.  The police then perform a narco analysis and lie detector test on Annamalai without success. A man called David Fernandez comes to the police and claims that the accused is his brother Josef Fernandez and not Annamalai. When he says this in the court, Annamalai refutes the claim saying he is a Hindu. He adds that it has become clear that it was Josef Fernandez who took wrong examples of role models and who has cheated the victims. The police perform a DNA test with the blood of Annamalai and David to see if they are really brothers and the test ends in failure. Annamalai states that his mother's name is Annapoorni and they were living at the village called Vataparai which the police verify.  Rani (Keerthi Chawla) and her mother Chandra Bai appear as the next victims of fraud. Chandra Bai, who is a staunch devotee of Lord Krishna had done a public prayer for a revered saint, Harihara Das, to come to her ashram. A few days later, Harihara Das arrives at the ashram and states that Rani is the incarnation of Radha. They are also made to believe that Harihara Das is the incarnation of Lord Krishna, who has come to marry Rani, who is Radha's incarnation. Chandra Bai receives a phone call from Napoleon asking the Harihara Das to visit his place. Short of time, Rani and Harihara Das marry. Then Harihara Das fools everyone into thinking that he disappeared and went to heaven, while escaping with the jewels of the ashram.  Annamalai says that this is just plain foolishness and fanaticism on the part of Chandra Bai and Rani and says the court cannot accept witnesses who are fools. He again states he is not the one who cheated them as Harihara Das.  The last victim is identified as Monika (Namitha) who is the managing director of Videocon. Unlike the other witnesses, she says she loved Annamalai who introduced himself to her with the name Shyam Prasad. Shyam had impressed her truly with his compassion, love and faithfulness. She asks the court to acquit him of all charges as she knows that Shyam is not such a person. Annamalai feels flattered by Monika's points but still states that he is not Shyam Prasad.  During a police raid, Ammu Kutty's jewels were recovered. When the owner was questioned, he said someone called Napoleon sold them to him; the owner gives the police the phone number. Using this, they captures Napoleon.  In the court, Napoleon reveals his real name as Thambidurai (Mayilsamy). He says he was a friend of the accused but never knew what was going on. He said that he was given some dialogues to speak and some numbers to contact and he did what he was asked. He also said that the accused also asked him to deposit Rs.20 lakhs to Anbu old age home.  The police investigate at the old age home and finds that Annamalai is not the real son of Annapoorni but adopted. They also learn that it was this place that the money of Rs.20 lakhs quoted by Napoleon was found. The  police conclude that Annamalai is Josef Fernandez and, hence, the culprit. However, before the police could bring the proof against Annamalai, the judge, assuming all witnesses have appeared, prepares to give the judgment.  The court starts its final day of hearing, assuming there were no other witnesses to produce. Annamalai says that he is innocent of all charges and the real culprit, who looks exactly like him, is free. He also accuses the victims of being greedy and consenting to an apparently advantageous marriage without proper thinking.  The judge delivers the final judgment on the case saying that, based on the evidences submitted, it can only be suspected that Annamalai is the culprit. But there is no clear proof against him and, hence, she judge acquits him on the benefit of doubt before the police can arrive and prove him guilty. She also denounces the hasty decisions taken by the women and Rekha's brother who had offered bribe to a government official, which had brought them into such a situation.  Outside the court, Annamalai is stabbed by another woman who claims to have been cheated by him. He asks forgiveness from Jesus and collapses, revealing he is Josef Fernandez. He is rescued by an ambulance.  The last scene is Annamalai (Josef Fernandez)  in a foreign country, enticing yet another woman into marrying him.

Naalu Pennungal
  ''Naalu Pennungal'' is the story of four women from [[Kuttanad]] in [[Alappuzha]] district in [[Kerala]]. The stories are set in the years between the 1940s to the 1960s.  '''The Prostitute'''  The first story profiled is the story of a [[street prostitute]] Kunjipennu ([[Padmapriya]]) and Pappukutty (Sreejith Ravi) who decide to start a life as husband and wife. They have bound themselves in matrimony that does not have any legal sanction. When the law catches up with them, they do not have anything that can be an evidence of their commitment towards each other.

'''The Virgin'''  Kumari ([[Geethu Mohandas]])- literally, a virgin girl- is a farm worker who shouldered the responsibility of running her household at a very early age. Her father ([[M. R. Gopakumar]]), having realized her advancing age, accepts a suitable marriage proposal for her. After the wedding, her husband, Narayanan ([[Nandhu]]), behaves strangely, as he evades any kind of contact with her including verbal conversation and sexual activity. The husband's mysterious behaviour is accentuated by his glut. After a few days, the couple make the customary visit to Kumari's house. Narayanan, leaves Kumari in her house after the visit and never returns to take her back. As days pass, rumours spread that she has been abandoned by him because of her infidelity.

He is said to have made good in Tamil Nadu and speaks Malayalam with a heavy Tamil accent even when he is back in Kerala. Through their conversations we realize that they both had an amorous encounter in their childhood, from which Chinnu Amma escaped narrowly due to her fear of getting pregnant out of wed-lock. Nara Pillai assumes that she is vulnerable and attempts to talk her into bed, promising her a healthy off spring.Chinnu Amma's mind vacillates, but in the end of the movie she boldly declines the offer.  '''The Spinster'''  The last one, is about an upper middleclass girl ([[Nandita Das]]). She has a quiet life in a family composed of her widowed mother ([[K. P. A. C. Lalitha]]), an elder brother and two sisters. The story begins with a marriage proposal for her, which fails as the groom ([[Ravi Vallathol]]) prefers her younger sister ([[Kavya Madhavan]]). She silently witnesses the marriage. As years pass on, her elder brother ([[Ashokan (actor)|Ashokan]]) also gets married. As she walks towards middle age, her youngest sister ([[Remya Nambeesan]]) also gets married. Once the mother passes away, she is forced to move in with her younger sister's family. Things seem to go well initially, with her getting close to her nieces. Her sister's husband apologizes to her, for being the reason for her failed marriage proposal. But, soon problems surface as her sister gets jealous of her and starts imagining a non-existing affair with her husband and her. She goes back home alone, refusing to live with either her brother or the youngest sister. She finally has broken the shackles of others controlling her life and has decided to live on her own.  
My Winnipeg
 Although ostensibly a documentary, ''My Winnipeg'' contains a series of fictional episodes and an overall story trajectory concerning the author-narrator-character "Guy Maddin" and his desire to produce the film as a way to finally leave/escape the city of Winnipeg. "Guy Maddin" is played by Darcy Fehr but voiced by Maddin himself (in narration): Fehr appears groggily trying to rouse himself from sleep aboard a jostling train as Maddin wonders aloud "What if?" What if he were able to actually rouse from the sleepy life he lives in Winnipeg and escape? Maddin decides that the only possible escape would be to "film my way out," thus motivating the creation of the "docu-fantasia" already underway.  Maddin then describes Winnipeg in general terms, introducing it to the viewer, noting primarily its location at the junction of the [[Red River of the North|Red]] and [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] rivers, a place known as "[[The  Forks, Winnipeg|the Forks]]". Maddin equates this Y-like junction to a woman's groin and associates it with his mother. Maddin also notes the apocryphal aboriginal myth of a secret "Forks beneath the Forks," an underground river system below the aboveground river system—the superimposition of these two sets of rivers has imbued the site and Winnipeg itself with magical/magnetic/sexual energy. Maddin also notes that Winnipeg is the geographical centre of North America, and thus these secret rivers are "the Heart of the Heart" of the continent and of Canada. Maddin regales the viewer with one of the film's many suspect historical "facts" about Winnipeg: "the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] used to sponsor an annual treasure hunt [that] required our citizens to wander our city in a day-long combing of the streets and neighbourhoods. First prize was a one-way ticket on the next train out of town." No winners in a hundred years could bring themselves to leave the city after coming to know the city so closely over the course of the treasure hunt. Maddin then posits an alternative explanation for Winnipeggers never leaving Winnipeg: sleepiness. He notes that Winnipeg is the sleepwalking capital of the world, with ten times the normal rate of sleepwalking, and that everyone in Winnipeg carries around the keys to their former homes in case they return while asleep. Winnipeg by-laws require that sleepwalkers be allowed to sleep in their old homes by the new tenants.   Maddin rents his own childhood home at 800 Ellice Avenue for a month, hiring actors to play his family (including [[Ann Savage (actress)|Ann Savage]] as his mother) in order to recreate scenes from his childhood memories, excluding his father and himself. The "family" gathers to watch the television show ''LedgeMan'', a fictional drama in which "the same oversensitive man takes something said the wrong way, climbs out on a window ledge, and threatens to jump." His mother, in the next window, convinces him to live. Maddin's mother is noted as the star of the show. The film recounts the conditions of the 1919 [[Winnipeg General Strike]], a real-world event with international significance, before returning to the family re-enactments, including Mother's suspicion of Janet Maddin, who hit a deer on the highway but is accused of covering up a sexual encounter. Maddin announces that this, like "everything that happens in [Winnipeg] is a euphemism." The film then recounts the city's history of [[Spiritualism]], including a visit by Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] in 1923. The film next examines Winnipeg architectural landmarks, including the [[Eaton's#The Winnipeg store|Eaton's building]] and the [[Winnipeg Arena]], both of which are demolished (while the arena is being destroyed, Maddin becomes the last person to urinate in its washroom). Maddin imagines the arena's salvation by the "Black Tuesdays," a fictional team of hockey heroes "in their 70s, 80s, 90s and beyond," then re-enacts a family scene where Mother is harassed to cook a meal.   The film recounts a racetrack fire that drove horses to perish in the Red River—the horse heads reappear, ghostly, each winter, frozen in the ice. Further Winnipeg landmarks, including the [[Golden Boy (Manitoba)|Golden Boy]] statue atop the [[Manitoba Legislative Building|provincial legislative building]], the Paddle Wheel restaurant, the [[Hudson's Bay (retailer)|Hudson's Bay department store]], and the [[Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame]], make appearances in distorted versions of themselves, as does the Sherbrook Pool. The film then recalls [[If Day]] (an actual historical event when a faked Nazi invasion of the city was mounted during World War II to promote the sale of war bonds), and a buffalo stampede set off by the mating of two gay bison. Time is now running out for Guy Maddin, who fears he will never leave Winnipeg, since the family re-enactments have failed to free him fully. To accomplish this feat of leaving, Maddin imagines a pinup girl for the 1919 strike's newsletter ''The Citizen'': dreaming up this "Citizen Girl" allows Maddin to leave Winnipeg in her capable hands, guilt-free. The final family re-enactment then involves Maddin's brother Cameron, who in real life committed suicide, rationalizing this death calmly in a discussion with Maddin's "Mother."

My Tutor Friend 2
    
Nadiya Kollappetta Rathri
 Internationally famous Indian shooter Nadiya ([[Kavya Madhavan]]) catches Sauparnika Express, a train on its inaugural run between Chennai and Mangalore. She is murdered en route but is not the only victim on the train. A famous dancer, Thulasi and a television reporter, Shreya Mariya, are also killed. When investigators fail to solve the mystery, the case is turned over to Sharafuddeen Taramasi ([[Suresh Gopi]]), IPS, an encounter specialist from the Railway Anti-Criminal Task Force (RATs)  RATs discovers that 3 murders are not inter-connected rather it was sheer coincidence that it happened all in one same night. Thulasi, the dancer was murdered by the coach attendant on orders of his boss, the division manager Vijayabhanu (Suresh Krishna). Vijaybhanu was the husband of Thulsi's sister and felt madly in love with her. He approached her numerous times but was rejected by Thulsi. She threatened to disclose the approaches of Vijayabhanu to the world, which provoked  him to kill her, before she reached  home.  Shreya, the reporter was behind Alexander Chempadan IPS, who was a Police officer indulged in smuggling. Shreya was following Alexander who boarded the train, to make a string operation about the goods he carry on board. However Alexender overhears Shreya's mobile conversations, which makes him suspicious and discovers her identity card from her bag. He arranged a professional killer to kill her, when the train reached near [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]], who threw her from the moving train, which kills her.  However the most complicated was the  murder attempt of Nadiya. She appeared to be brutally raped with teeth marks on her body and nerve to her brains being cut. When the police reached her coupe, they thought she was dead, but the doctors on the next coupe confirmed that she had not died, which made them  transfer her  to a hospital. Sharadudden goes behind Nadiya and finds that she along with her identical twin sister Nadira were orphans, and their father was Zakriya Methar. a goon and arms dealer, whom he had killed in an encounter while he was posted in the 'Q' Branch of Tamil Nadu Police. They were raised by eminent dancer Subhadra at her academy. Nadira grew up as a professional dancer, while Nadiya became an acclaimed shooter, holding a grudge against Sharaufuddeen for killing her father before her eyes. Their step mother Subhadra died, leaving all her properties to the twin sisters which was now managed by Aadi Lakshmi (Urmila Unni), their manager. Nadira's marriage was fixed with international acclaimed musician Zia Musafir, son of Subhadra's discipline and loyalist Ustad Ghulam Musafir. Ustad was not happy with the investigation, especially its chief officer Sharafudden due to several reasons.  While doctors ruled that chances of Nadiya recovering from her coma state is very less, Ustad even argues Nadira to sign consent paper for mercy killing, which she refuses. While at home, someone tried to attack Nadira from behind, who ran away when she bit hard on his hand while trying to entangle her. While investigation continues, they discovered that Nadiya had called the Academy's phone number hours before her death. They also found that  the train made a technical stop at [[Coimbatore]] nearly 2 hours which was announced on board. The investigators wondered why Nadiya didn't choose to travel to her academy at [[Palakkad]] which is just 40 mins from Coimbatore station, rather than waiting for train to reach Palakkad after 2 hours. Connecting pieces, they realized, someone had used Academy's official car and entered into Coimbatore car park area. Sharafudden concluded that Aadi Lakshmi's brother killed Nadiya, which Nadira opposes while talking to her privately. Sharafudeen comforted with Nadira that, if not Aadi Lakshmi's brother, it should be Zia Musharaf who might done this, by taking a break from his world tour, as he had information that Zia was not in Bahamas on the day Nadiya was killed and was in India as per Emigration records. Nadira said, it was not right and affirmed Zia would never do that, as she spoke to him on that night calling his Bahamas number.  Sharafudden decides to take all the suspects to Chennai to conduct a scientific Narco-analysis test along with Nadhiya who is in a state of coma, by taking the same train- Sauparika Express.  While in the train, Nadira was standing close  to door, Sharafudden comes there for a private chat... During the chat, Sharafudeen provokes Nadira and she turns angry, proving herself that she was not Nadira, rather Nadiya herself who gets a nosebleed when she is stressed.  The truth was Nadiya- the shooter was deep in love with Zia, though he had affection only towards her identical sister Nadira- the dancer. Ustad fixes the marriage , without consent of Nadiya and she was provoked to anger when Nadira was boasting about Zia's love to her during a mobile conversation with Nadiya. She gets angry and decides  to kill Nadira, by asking her to pick her up at Coimbatore. When Nadira came, Nadiya assaults her and cuts her nerves to let her bleed to death. To appear as a rape, Nadiya used her teeth to make teeth-bites on her body and changed her dress to Nadira's. She swapped her identity as Nadira, making the real Nadira collapse into a coma state.  Soon after her confession to Sharafudden, she jumped out of the moving train and hitting on to the railway signal, killing herself, which makes the real night when Nadiya was killed.  Zia (Prithviraj) returns and takes Nadira who is in coma state to the US for advance treatment, hoping she will recover.

Nancy escapes with the will but gets into a car crash. Her father arrives and demands to know what is going on. After explaining her sleuthing, Biedermeyer offers them a ride home so he can finalize the legacy to Jane.  Nancy concludes that Biedermeyer was Dehlia Draycott's supposed love who stands to lose money if the will goes to Jane. However, when he questions Nancy about the will, she manages to jump out of the car. She is caught by Biedermeyer who threatens her; when Nancy asks him why he killed Dehlia, he replies that Dehlia went crazy after she put Jane up for adoption, and wanted to leave to be with her caretaker Leshing, Jane's father. Nancy escapes but is once again cornered. Leshing arrives and knocks the henchmen unconscious as Nancy reveals that she secretly recorded Biedermeyer's confession. While the police arrive to arrest Biedermeyer, Nancy reveals to Leshing that Jane is his daughter. The will is restored to Jane, who is able to get her daughter back and convert the Draycott mansion into a home for single mothers.  Back at River Heights, Nancy visits Ned as he repairs her car and they share a kiss. At the end of the movie, Mr Drew comes out to tell Nancy that she has a long-distance phone call for a new mystery in Scotland. She's just as cheerful as ever as she runs back into the house to learn of the new case.  
Namastey London
 [[Indian people|Indian-born]] Manmohan Malhotra ([[Rishi Kapoor]]) re-located to London, England, established himself, returned to [[India]], got married to Bebo ([[Nina Wadia]]), and after four years got a [[Travel visa|visa]] for her so that she could live with him. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to Jasmeet ([[Katrina Kaif]]). Manmohan was always embarrassed by Bebo as she was fat and could not speak [[English language|English]]. As a result, he always left her out of important occasions, while he socialised. Bebo did not want Jasmeet to end up like her, so she got her educated in an English school, encouraged to mingle with British friends, and Jasmeet was transformed into Jazz – a beautiful young woman, Western in looks, talk, habits, and heart.  Her father had set her to meet a young lad, Bobby Bedi ([[Ritesh Deshmukh]]), though the date turns out to be a disaster and Bobby rejects her. Manmohan thinks that it is impossible to get him an Indian son-in-law, although his friend, Parvez Khan ([[Javed Sheikh]]), is in a similar situation with his son, Imran ([[Upen Patel]]), who has a blonde girlfriend, Susan ([[Tiffany Mulheron]]). Manmohan takes his family for a tour in India and forces Jasmeet to marry Arjun Singh ([[Akshay Kumar]]) who does not know how to [[speech|speak]] [[English language|English]].  On their return to London, Jasmeet announces that she is getting married to Charlie Brown ([[Clive Standen]]), who is well educated and has good friends and connections, even with Prince Charles. She refuses to recognise her marriage with Arjun as there is no proof of the wedding. When Jasmeet is introduced to the friends of the Brown family, she is subjected to condescension from them (references to snake charmers, Indian rope tricks, tandoori chicken and so on) as well as a quote from Winston Churchill: 'When we leave India, the country will be in the hands of goons'. Arjun then tells the gentleman about the achievements of India which includes about the derivation of English words from Sanskrit like 'Father', 'Brother', 'Trignometry' and 'Geometry'. During this period, Jazz becomes close with Arjun who still supports her. Charlie Brown then has a rugby match against the Indians and Arjun, which the English lose and Brown is verbally racist to the Indians. Imran is then asked by Susan's parents to leave Islam, become a Christian, change his name to Emmanuel or Ian, as well as provide written proof that his family is not associated with terrorists. The film ends on a happy note when Imran decides not to be a Christian and Susan is accepted by Imran's family; Jazz realises her love for Arjun, runs away from her wedding to Charlie Brown, and goes with Arjun back to India where they are seen riding Arjun's motorcycle. While they are on the motorcycle Arjun reveals that all along he knew how to speak English. They all live happily ever after.  
The Naked Brothers Band: The Movie
 The film begins with an introduction to the documentary from the boys. Nat and Alex Wolff, aged nine and six respectively, are members of the fictional band The Silver Boulders, which also consists of Thomas, David, Josh, and their manager Cooper. The band found success after a music executive ([[John B. Williams (musician)|John B. Williams]]) signed them to his label, Who's the Man Records. The band performs their new song "Motormouth" at a concert in the [[Hammerstein Ballroom]]. After the show, the band members describe how their group started and a clip from their music video "Crazy Car" is shown.  The bandmates get along well until Thomas composes the song "Boys Rule, Girls Drool", which Nat dislikes. Nat writes a song called "Rosalina" that is about Josh's elder half-sister. Thomas and Josh ridicule Nat because the song shows his feelings for her. Moreover, Josh composes another song that Nat also dislikes, titled "I'm the God of Rock and Roll", set to the tune of "[[Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star]]". The band has a food fight in a restaurant, prompting Thomas, David, and Josh to leave and form a new group, The Gold Boulders, managed by the scornful Mort Needleman (Jonathan Pillot).  After watching media reports of the band's split on television, Nat and Alex go into a state of depression. Alex begins to binge on [[lemon-lime]] soda and falls asleep, while he lies curled in the midst of aluminum cans. Nat simultaneously writes a song by the piano titled "If There Was a Place to Hide" as the band's fans gather outside his apartment, pleading for them to reunite. Despite the absence of the formers, Alex persuades a reluctant Nat to revive the band, and subsequently, they change the band's title to its original, The Naked Brothers Band. Through a line-up of auditions, Nat, Alex, and Cooper select Rosalina as their cellist and Cole Hawkins — a member of the original Naked Brothers Band — as the guitarist.  The newly established band embark on a tour to [[Chicago]], though Nat discovers that The Gold Boulders is their opening act. The Gold Boulders start the show with "Boys Rule, Girls Drool" and are immediately booed off the stage. After their performance, The Naked Brothers Band perform "Hardcore Wrestlers (with Inner Feelings)" and "Rosalina", which are greeted with a loud applause from the audience. After the concert, Nat hosts a party for the band in his apartment. In the midst of the party, David, Thomas, and Josh arrive at his front door, asking to join the reconstructed band. Forgivingly, a surprised Nat welcomes them to join the celebration. The film concludes with the outfit performing "Crazy Car" on the roof of the Wolffs' apartment while fireworks detonate in the background.

Naked Fear
 The story begins with a naked woman in the middle of nowhere, obviously under duress. She falls after being shot. A man walks up behind her and executes her with a pistol.   The story then shifts to Diana Kelper, a young and beautiful dancer starting a new job at a [[nightclub]]. She's lured to a small town in [[New Mexico]] with promises by club owner Jack to pay her well for performing on [[Stage (theatre)|stage]] at his club with later prospects of working in Las Vegas. Fred, Jack's agent, pays for her airfare, puts her up in a [[motel]], takes her driver's license, charges her back for his expenses with [[interest]], and threatens her references should she flee. Unable to make enough money dancing, she falls deeper into [[debt]] until she is forced into [[prostitution]]. Soliciting her first "client" Colin Mandle, she gets in his [[jeep]] but at the last minute she changes her mind, only for Mandle to choke her unconscious.  Diana wakes up naked in a field. She spots an airplane nearby and walks towards it.  As she gets closer, she sees Mandle stowing his hunting gear, so she hides behind a tree trunk. Hearing her approach, he tells her that he's giving her a fifteen-minute start. He fires a [[Quarrel (projectile)|bolt]] near her as a warning and she turns and runs into the wilderness.  The [[boomtown]] population is highly [[Transient laborer|transient]] and it's not unusual for people to go missing. However, Dwight Terry, a recently hired sheriff deputy—who had been forced to leave a previous police job due to arresting too prominent a person—is concerned about the disappearance of Diana (and other women from the club), and begins to question Jack. Jack denies any involvement, saying he has enough trouble getting girls to perform at his club.  Dwight begins to question the club owner's business, but is warned off by Sheriff Tom Benike. He realizes that he's on his own in solving the case. His wife is similarly unsupportive, fearing he might lose his job over "some slut." He breaks into Mandle's home, whom he suspects of being responsible for the disappearances. He is stopped by Benike, who had been alerted to a possible break-in by a neighbor.  Diana is spotted by Mandle multiple times but she manages to lose him over and over. He even shoots a [[rattlesnake]] before it can strike her, denying her the "easy way out". She climbs up a cliff. Mandle sees her and begins to climb up after her. As he reaches the top, she appears holding a large rock over her head, which she throws down on Mandle, causing him to fall.  She stumbles upon a man and his two sons who are out hiking. Diana collapses, unable to speak. The father takes her to their tent, where she falls asleep. He sees her wounds and realizes that something happened to her. After praying with his sons and leaving them in charge of the camp, he leaves to seek help.  Meanwhile, Mandle has regained consciousness and resumes his hunt, following Diana to the camp. After unsuccessfully attempting to persuade the boys to allow him to take Diana with him (ostensibly to fly her to the hospital in his plane), Mandle kills them both. Diana takes Mandle's gun and tries to shoot him, only to discover it's uncocked. He advances on her, but Diana stabs him in the leg, bites his ear off and runs off again, finding the father's corpse along the way.  Diana finds a road and is hit by two young men driving a van. Following a brief skirmish, she manages to run down and finally kill Mandle with the van. After driving back into town, she is taken to a hospital, but the experience has traumatized her so much that she is left much like a dangerous animal, wary of human kindness. Dwight brings her flowers and is told that she's chewed through her restraints and escaped.    Ten months later, posing as a prostitute, Diana lures a man and kills him, stepping out of his car and walking away.  A news report attributes the resulting dozens of killings of sex offenders to a [[Vigilante]] dubbed "The Southwest Slayer."  
National Treasure: Book of Secrets
 On [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|April 15, 1865]], five days after the end of the [[American Civil War]], [[John Wilkes Booth]] and [[Michael O'Laughlen]] enter a tavern in [[Washington, D.C.]], and approach Thomas Gates to decode a message in Booth's diary. Thomas recognizes the message as using the [[Playfair cipher]] and begins to translate it. While he does so, Booth leaves for [[Ford's Theatre]] to assassinate President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Thomas solves the puzzle and realizes the men are members of the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] and are [[Copperhead (politics)|Confederate sympathizers]]. A fight breaks out, and Thomas rips several pages from the diary and throws them in the fireplace. Thomas is shot, and the gunman retrieves only a page fragment.  Approximately 142 years later, Thomas's great-great grandson Ben Gates delivers a lecture on the story at a Civilian Heroes conference. Black market antiquities dealer, Mitch Wilkinson, shows one of the 18 missing pages of John Wilkes Booth's diary, with Thomas Gates' name written on it, convincing everyone that Thomas was not only a conspirator, but also the grand architect of the Lincoln assassination. Ben sets out to prove the innocence of Thomas.  Using [[spectral imaging]], Ben, his estranged girlfriend Abigail Chase, and friend Riley Poole discover a cipher pointing to [[Édouard René de Laboulaye|Édouard Laboulaye]], hidden on the back of the diary page. Ben and Riley travel to [[Paris]], where they find a clue engraved on the torch of the [[Île aux Cygnes#Statue of Liberty replica|scale model of the Statue of Liberty]], referring to the two [[Resolute desk|''Resolute'' desk]]s. One of the desks is used by the [[President of the United States|President]] at the [[Oval Office]] in Washington, while the other is used by the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] of  [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] in [[Buckingham Palace]] in [[London]].  Ben and Riley then head to London to infiltrate the Palace and Abigail shows up, unannounced. From the Queen's desk, he obtains an ancient wooden plank. Meanwhile, Wilkinson has broken into Patrick Gates' house and [[Phone cloning|cloned]] Patrick's cell phone to track Ben's whereabouts. Wilkinson eventually obtains the wooden plank, but not before Ben manages to photograph the symbols carved into the plank.  At Ben's insistence, Patrick reluctantly asks his ex-wife and Ben's mother, Dr. Emily Appleton, for help in translating the symbols. She does so, but points out that some of the glyphs are partial, leading Ben to conclude that another plank must be hidden in the other ''Resolute'' desk at the White House.  Ben and Abigail coax Abigail's new love interest, Connor, a [[White House Office of the Curator|curator for the White House]], into letting them into the office to see the desk. Ben discovers that the second plank is missing, but he does find a stamp bearing the seal of the ''"President's Secret Book"''. Riley tells Ben that the ''Book of Secrets'' contains documents collected "for Presidents,by Presidents and for Presidents' eyes only", covering such controversial subjects as the [[JFK assassination]], [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]], and [[Area 51]].  Ben crashes the President's birthday party at [[Mount Vernon]] to convince the President to follow him into a secret tunnel under the House, where he confronts him about the book. The President warns Ben that his actions will be interpreted as an attempt to kidnap the President and Ben is now wanted for committing a federal offense. Ben convinces the President to reveal the location of the book, which is at the [[Library of Congress]].  In the book, Ben finds a picture of the missing plank from the desk and an entry by [[Calvin Coolidge|President Coolidge]], who found the plank in 1924, had it destroyed, and commissioned [[Gutzon Borglum]] to carve [[Mount Rushmore]] to erase the map's landmarks in order to protect the treasure. However, FBI Agent Sadusky tracks Ben to the Library and the three narrowly escape capture.  Ben, Riley, Abigail, and Patrick then head to Mount Rushmore, where they meet Mitch, who has kidnapped Ben's mother, Emily. Mitch helps them find the entrance of a cave, containing the legendary Native American city of gold, [[Quivira|Cíbola]]. Once inside, they encounter several traps and everyone gets separated.  Eventually, they find the city of solid gold underneath Mount Rushmore and it begins flooding with water. In order to get out alive, one person has to stay behind to hold open the door to the tunnel. After a struggle and Ben's attempt to sacrifice himself, Mitch ends up staying behind and asking Ben to give him the credit for finding the treasure.  Ben clears his family's name with the discovery and is cleared of all charges when the President, in an attempt to protect Ben, tells everyone that Ben saved his life. Ben also ensures Mitch receives joint credit for the find. At the end, the President mentions the favor he asked of Ben when he gave him the location of the Book, implying that a third movie would be forthcoming. A lady that'd read Riley's book wants it to be autographed. Riley gets his [[Ferrari]] back from the President who owes him a favor. Ben and Abigail reconcile and get back together.  
The Nanny Diaries (film)
 21-year-old Annie Braddock ([[Scarlett Johansson]]), has just graduated from [[Montclair State University]]. She has no idea what or who she wants to be. One day, while sitting in the park, Annie sees a young boy about to be hit by a vehicle. Annie saves him and meets the boy's mother, who we meet as Mrs. X ([[Laura Linney]]). When she introduces herself as "Annie", Mrs. X mistakes her words for "Nanny" and hires her to look after Grayer ([[Nicholas Art]]), the boy she saved (Mrs. X also continues to call her "Nanny" instead of "Annie" throughout the film). Annie lies to her mother about taking a job at a bank and, in reality, moves in with the X's to be the nanny for Grayer.  Life with the incredibly privileged X's is not what she thought it would be, and her life is complicated further when she falls for "Harvard Hottie" ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]), who lives in the building. Interspersed with her life as the X's nanny are her interactions with "Harvard Hottie" as well as her longtime friend Lynette ([[Alicia Keys]]). She also continues to keep her mother in the dark about her real job, giving her regular but false progress reports about her job. Further complications arise when her Mom decides to visit her, forcing Annie to pretend Lynette and her roommate are a couple and that their apartment is Annie's apartment. Her mother finds out the truth when Annie desperately calls her for help during a scary moment when Grayer becomes severely ill.  After a rough start, Annie eventually bonds with Grayer, whom she addresses by his preferred code name, "Grover", and discovers that he is actually a sweet and loving child who is neglected by both his parents, which explains his uncontrollable behavior. Parallel to this, Annie begins to also notice that Grayer is not the only one being neglected: Mrs. X is as well, with Mr. X ([[Paul Giamatti]]) constantly being cruel to her and committing subtly obvious adultery. Mrs. X makes numerous attempts to make her husband love her, including lying to him about being pregnant with their second child. Annie soon realizes that Mrs. X's own cruel treatment of her is due to Mrs. X's growing frustrations from her dysfunctional marriage.  Things take a turn for the worse during a family trip with the X's to the Hamptons. She overhears Mrs. X telling a friend during a party that she has installed a 'nanny cam' at their home in the city and plans to fire Annie after viewing footage showing Annie lovingly tending to Grayer (with Mrs. X grossly exaggerating her findings from the 'nanny cam'). The next morning, Mr. X sexually assaults Annie and just as Mrs. X enters the kitchen she unreasonably fires Annie and sends her back to the city with her final payment ... of just $40 (along with a puppy Mr. X had given Grayer when they arrived in the Hamptons but foisted off on her as she was leaving). Flying into a rage, she looks for and finds the 'nanny cam' in the X's house and records her feelings toward the X's. Mrs. X brings the tape to the school meeting for the Upper East Side mothers. Thinking that the tape will show Annie feeding Grayer peanut butter and jelly, she requests the coordinator to play it for everyone to see. All other parents in the room hear as Annie reveals the real relationship between the X's, in the process making Mrs. X come to terms with her own reality and false happiness.  Annie continues to date "Harvard Hottie", whose real name is revealed to be Hayden. She is temporarily living with Lynette and her roommate, and pursuing her growing interest in anthropology, much of which she learned through her time as the X's nanny.  A few months later, Hayden hands her a letter from Mrs. X. Written in the letter is an apology and news about how Mrs. X left Mr. X (and that her second pregnancy was a false one that Mrs. X invented to keep Mr. X interested in her), is raising Grayer alone and making stronger attempts to bond with him (and successfully doing so), and Grayer's overall improvement. She expresses her gratitude to Annie for waking her up and changing her life. Also in the letter, Mrs. X addresses Annie for the first time by her real name (instead of Nanny), and signs the letter with her own first name, Alexandra (instead of Mrs. X).  
Naruto Shippuden the Movie
 The film opens with a prediction that [[Naruto Uzumaki]] dies battling a monster who kills him. A funeral is held for Naruto at his home village, where others attend. [[Tsunade (Naruto)|Tsunade]] looks out at the window and ponders if everything is just decided by fate.  The film's scene returns to a few days previous, where a man named Yomi attacks a shrine to retrieve the spirit of Mōryō, a demon attempting to conquer the world and create his "Thousand Year Kingdom". Since he is lacking a body, Yomi offers his as a temporary substitute until they can retrieve Mōryō's original one. The only threat to Mōryō's plan is a priestess named Shion, who has the ability to seal his spirit away once more; she can also foresee a person's death. He raises a stone army from their slumber to attack the rest of the world while his four subordinates go to eliminate Shion. They are given special chakra creatures to enhance their strength.  To deal with the threat, the Land of Fire sends out many advance teams to stall the stone army. Naruto, [[Sakura Haruno]], [[Rock Lee]] and [[Neji Hyuga]] are sent to guard Shion, and deliver her to the shrine where Mōryō's body is kept. They fend off Shion's four would-be assassins, and afterwards Shion prophesies Naruto's upcoming death. Shion's total acceptance of "fate", as well as her selfish attitude, provokes Naruto into antagonizing her. As they head for the shrine, they are again ambushed by the assassins and Shion is seemingly killed. It turns out to be a ruse: the dead "Shion" is actually her servant, Taruho, acting as a decoy by the use of the Shadow Mirror Body Transfer Jutsu. After Neji tells Naruto to escort Shion to the temple alone, Shion explains that her predictions work by using others' lives to protect her own. Naruto insists that he will survive and likewise will keep Shion safe.  Together, Sakura, Lee and Neji defeat the assassins, and at the mountain temple where Mōryō's body is kept, Naruto and Shion find the stone army waiting. Naruto holds the army back, while Shion heads inside to begin the sealing ritual, where Yomi tricks Shion into beginning the technique with him inside the barrier, allowing Mōryō's spirit to reunite with his body. After [[Kakashi Hatake]], [[List of Naruto characters#Might Guy|Might Guy]], [[Shikamaru Nara]] and [[List of Naruto characters#Temari|Temari]] destroy the stone army, Naruto comes to rescue Shion. About to see her prediction of his death come true, Shion uses her bell's power to change Naruto's fate. She is able to tap into her true powers, intending to kill herself and Mōryō to save Naruto (for whom she has developed feelings for). Naruto stops her seconds before her death, and creates a giant  by combining Shion's chakra with his. Naruto drives the Rasengan into Mōryō and obliterates it.  In the final scene, Naruto asks Shion what she intends to do now. She replies that Mōryō was a demon created by the dark thoughts of mankind, and that there is bound to be another Mōryō someday. Because of this, she says that she must continue the line of priestesses that will suppress demons like Mōryō. Shion then asks Naruto if he will help her (a [[double entendre]] asking if he will be the father of her child), much to the shock of Sakura, Kakashi and Lee. Naruto, clueless as usual, agrees without realizing the second meaning of her question.  
Nanking (2007 film)

Nasrani (film)
 The story begins on the eve of the wedding of David John Kottarathil (Mammooty) and Sara Eapen (Vimala Raman). The two were childhood sweethearts, both hailing from rich planter families in the small but affluent town of Kottayam, Kerala. While both families are celebrating in their own homes, Sara's father Eapen (Riza Bava) is visibly disturbed. He has just received a phone call from Alice, his mistress, who is demanding public acknowledgement of their relationship. She wants to attend the wedding of David and Sara, as a means to achieve this. Eapen, who is a rich planter, is at risk of losing his good name in society, despite having generously provided for Aice and their daughter thus far. He offers to pay for her silence with a bigger bungalow and his estates in a far-away town of Chikmaglur. He requests John Kottarathil (Captain Raju), his best friend - whose son is set to marry Sara the next day - to accompany him while talking to his mistress. John requests the help of M C Paul (Vijayaraghavan), a rising politician and Eapen's brother-in-law to aid in the negotiation. The trio meet the mistress to discuss terms, but in a fit of rage, a drunk Eapen ends up shooting her. Eapen also tries to kill his illegitimate daughter, the nine year old Annie (Baby Niranjana/Mukta) but John stops him. In the struggle that follows, Eapen is also shot. John looks at Paul for assistance, but is met with a helpless silence.  Ten years later, John is retelling this story to the jailor Rajeevan (Bheeman Reghu), who points out that John's defense in court was half-hearted and that he seems uninterested in parole despite possibly being eligible for it. John confirms this, saying he feels guilty for Eapen's death, although it was a genuine accident while saving Annie. Further, he reveals that Paul had requested that his presence at the scene of crime be kept a secret, lest it should affect his image and political prospects.   The marriage of David and Sara never happened, primarily because Sara's mother is against her marrying David, whose father John was responsible for Eapen's death. She even believes John supported Eapen's affair with Alice. Meanwhile, David and Sara are still in love and observe their "anniversary" in a romantic manner, supported by his driver and right hand man Suku (Kalabhavan Mani).

He now aims to launch his son Dr.Benny Paul (Arun), who is a prominent youth leader. He has his eye on the Assembly seat in Kaduthuruthy constituency in Kottayam, which was vacated by incumbent Ummachan (Jagathy Sreekumar) following allegations of corruption. Despite his popularity, Benny is facing a potential scandal related to the recent suicide of Archana, a student of the Kottayam Medical College. He publicly denies any relationship with her, but this is contested by Annie - Eapen's illegitimate daughter who is now under David and Sara's care. Annie was Archana's best friend and knew of her affair with Benny.   Benny is found dead in his home the next day, and Annie is believed to have killed him. She confides in David, stating that despite intending to kill Benny for denying his relationship with Archana, she arrived at his home only to find him dead already from a stab wound. David realizes that the Police-Politician nexus has already decided to frame Annie for the crime and also comes to know of evidence fabricated for the purpose. He uses his influence and resources to keep her away from the reach of the law until he can clear her name by finding the real culprit. He loses some of his closest friends in the process.  The rest of the action-thriller is about his quest to prove Annie's innocence and exposing the false idols in socio-politics in the town of Kottayam and the state itself.

Sophie is encouraged by Andrew's family to pray for a baby, but when she asks Andrew how to pray, he says God can't make her become pregnant. While waiting for an appointment at the clinic, Sophie witnesses an Asian man, Jihah Kim ([[Ha Jung-woo]]), arrive to make a donation. She listens outside the door during his doctor's interview, and hears that Jihah is an illegal [[Alien (law)|alien]] and they cannot accept his sperm. When he storms out of the room, Sophie follows him to a dry cleaners in [[Chinatown]], but doesn't have the courage to talk to him.  Following a party one night, Sophie awakens to find Andrew has attempted [[suicide]]. While he recovers in hospital, Sophie goes back to the laundromat. She follows Jihah to his building and waits outside his apartment. When he returns home, Sophie propositions him for sex; she offers Jihah $300 per session, and if they are successful in getting pregnant, an additional $30,000 in cash. He agrees, and the two have sex. After Sophie accidentally falls asleep after one of their sessions, they begin to bond.  While working at the dry cleaners one day, Jihah notices Sophie outside and encounters Andrew who comes in to pick up his jacket. Before their next meeting, a dismissive Jihah takes Sophie out to eat, and says that he saw her husband. They argue after he notes his physical similarities to Andrew; Sophie retorts that all he's good for is his penis. He follows her out into the street, where she breaks down and tells Jihah of Andrew's suicidal tendencies because he is [[Sterility (physiology)|sterile]]. Jihah takes Sophie to a spot in the park where he prays.  For the first time, Sophie and Jihah become intimate during one of their sessions. When she arrives home, she tells Andrew that Dr. Hanson has new procedures they could attempt, but he says they should give up trying. Sophie then tells him that, before they were married, he got her pregnant but she had an [[abortion]]. Andrew walks away. The next morning, the two go to church, and Sophie faints. Meanwhile, Jihah is seen buying flowers and browsing for jewelry. Back at his apartment, Sophie arrives and tells him she's pregnant, paying him the $30,000. Jihah offers his congratulations and the two part bittersweetly.  As Sophie and Andrew celebrate her pregnancy, Jihah goes through the laundromat's receipts to find their address. The next day, Andrew and Sophie host a party, and Jihah shows up. Andrew goes to greet him, and Jihah says he must have the wrong address; he sneaks away to watch from a distance. As the group begin a prayer, Sophie fantasizes about Jihah.  Days later, Sophie visits Jihah at his apartment and the two become intimate once again. She and Andrew then find out that the baby is a boy. Later that day, Sophie's cab is late when she attempts to go to Jihah's, so she catches the train instead. Meanwhile, Andrew arrives home early and answers the door to the delayed taxi driver. Andrew drives to Jihah's address and overhears Sophie with him from outside the door. Jihah gives Sophie a key to his apartment. While Sophie is there one day, police show up and detain Jihah for his illegal residence in the United States.  When Sophie returns home, Andrew informs her that he knows about her affair. He asks that she abort the child so that he can forgive her, to which she adamantly refuses. Jihah is told by authorities that he will be deported the next morning; while being held, he requests to make a phone call. Sophie goes to Jihah's spot in the park to pray. She then goes to Jihah's apartment, where she answers a ringing cellphone. A few years later, a visibly pregnant Sophie is seen on the beach with her son. While he plays in the water, Sophie watches and knits for the new baby.

Next (2007 film)
 Cris Johnson ([[Nicolas Cage]]) can [[precognition|see into his future]]. He can only see two minutes ahead, with the exception of a vision he once had of a woman walking into a diner. Knowing no details other than the time, he goes to the diner twice each day at 8:09 to await her arrival. He works as a small-time [[magic (illusion)|magician]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], where he supplements his income with gambling, using his powers to win against the house.  Cris draws the attention of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Callie Ferris ([[Julianne Moore]]), who has figured out his ability and wants to stop Russian terrorists from detonating a [[nuclear weapon]]. Before she can approach Cris, his gambling draws the attention of [[casino security]]. He stops an imminent robbery, yet is chased by security agents. Using his ability to forecast the actions of his pursuers, he eludes them and the [[Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department|Las Vegas police]]. Ferris tracks Cris to his home, but he escapes after foreseeing her arrival. Later that night, the casino's security chief is approached by two of the terrorists, is interrogated about Johnson and is then killed.  The following morning, Cris is at the diner again when he sees Liz Cooper ([[Jessica Biel]]), the woman from his vision. It turns out that not only can Cris see the future, but he can also see how his actions can affect that future. After envisioning different approaches—all of which fall flat—he intervenes when Liz's ex-boyfriend arrives. Knowing that she is heading for [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], Cris charms her into giving him a ride. Ferris follows, while the terrorists decide to kill him. A washed-out road forces Cris and Liz to spend the night in a motel. With the weapon tracked to Los Angeles, Ferris convinces her superiors to let her bring Cris in. The terrorists follow in the hope that the agents will lead them to Cris.  Ferris confronts Liz near the hotel. Claiming Cris is a dangerous [[psychopathy|sociopath]], Ferris asks Liz to drug Cris so that they can bring him in peacefully. Instead, Liz warns Cris, who tells her his secret. When she asks why he will not help the FBI stop the terrorists, he explains his limitations, noting the exception for events involving her. Asking for Liz to wait for him, he tries to escape from the FBI agents but is captured after saving Ferris from logs tumbling down the side of a mountain. Unable to kill Cris, the terrorists kidnap Liz instead.  In custody, Cris is strapped to a chair with his eyes held open and forced to watch television until he has a vision that can help the FBI. They expect him to see a report about the detonation of the bomb, but instead he envisions a broadcast from several hours in the future in which Liz is killed by a small bomb while strapped to a wheelchair and gagged with duct tape as bait for him. Cris escapes from captivity and races to the parking garage where she will be killed. Pursuing him to the garage, Ferris promises to help save her as long as Cris will help stop the bomb; she also sets up a plan to draw out the terrorists.  Using his ability, Cris helps the FBI track the terrorists to the port where they are based. When they arrive, Cris is able to walk right up to the terrorist leader and avoid being hit, by seeing where the bullets will go and dodging them. After killing the terrorists and saving Liz, they find that the bomb has already been moved.

As he stares at the screen he realizes that he has made a mistake and that he was too late: the bomb detonates out at sea and completely destroys the port, as well as the rest of the city.  The timeline reverts to Cris and Liz in bed at the hotel in Arizona, before Liz goes outside to be confronted by Ferris. Because of Liz's involvement in events, Cris has been able to envision everything that could happen leading to the nuclear explosion. "Every time you look into the future, it changes."  Cris calls Ferris and offers to help prevent the nuclear disaster, then asks Liz to wait for him.

Nick, however, wants to work under Kate. The atmosphere in the kitchen is somewhat chaotic as Kate feels increasingly threatened by Nick as time goes on due to his style of running her kitchen. Nick loves to listen to opera while he cooks and he loves to make the staff laugh. And Kate finds herself strangely attracted to Nick, whose uplifting personality has not only affected her staff but Zoe as well, who has been coming to work with Kate.  With all that is happening in Kate's life, the last thing she would want is to fall in love with this man, as she has pushed away all others prior. Nevertheless, there is some kind of chemistry between the two of them that only flourishes with their passion for cooking. Yet life hits her hard when Paula decides to offer Nick the job of head chef and Kate's relationship with Nick turns a sour note due to Kate's pride. Nick also develops a special bond with Zoe.   In the end, Kate allows herself to become vulnerable and tear down the walls she has built throughout her life so that she and Nick could start fresh. The movie concludes with Zoe, Nick, and Kate having opened their own bistro.  
No Sleep til Shanghai
 Riding the notoriety of winning the weekly Freestyle Friday rap battle on BET’s ''[[106 and Park]]'' for seven consecutive weeks, Jin shattered seemingly insurmountable boundaries and stereotypes by becoming the first Asian American rapper to sign a recording deal with a major label when he signed with [[Virgin Records]] ([[Ruff Ryders]]). The film follows Jin and his crew as they tour Asia to promote Jin’s debut album, ''[[The Rest is History]]''. Along the way, we are treated to a fascinating glimpse into the life of a rapper, as well as the rapidly growing hip hop communities in Asian cities such as [[Hong Kong]], [[Shanghai]], [[Taipei]], and [[Tokyo]].  The film gained wide acclaim and some shock from screening audiences at the Atlanta Film Festival as they reacted to the startling visage of Jamaican-American promoter [[Andrew Ballen]] speaking fluent Chinese on the Shanghai leg of the tour.  
Noah's Ark (2007 film)
 In the opening scene, animals and humans are seen acting out the [[seven deadly sins]]: pride (the [[peacock]]), envy (the [[snake]]), sloth (the [[sloth]]), lust (the [[hedgehog]]), gluttony (the [[toad]]), wrath (the [[mandrill]]), and greed (the [[human]]). This results in their mutual doom, as they are killed or captured and taken to market where the remains of the killed animals are sold and the survivors are enslaved. [[God]] surveys the market, witnessing the assorted evils, and declares to his sidekick Angel that he will impose [[Last Judgment|Judgment Day]] upon the sinful world. A chance encounter with the gentle and devoted Noah, who purchases the freedom of the enslaved man despite his own poverty, convinces him to give humanity one last chance.  God appears as a heavenly light to [[Noah]] and tells him to build an ark, upon which he will board his family and two of every animal, to survive the world-enveloping flood He will send. Noah then informs his family. Already unhappy with Noah's leadership, they assume he has lost his mind, particularly when he fashions a model of the ark out of mashed potatoes  and begins cutting down his father's forest for lumber to build it.  Noah sells his home to the greedy merchants Farfan and Esther for a flock of pigeons to deliver messages to all the animals of the world. However, the birds immediately abandon their task and head for a jungle strip club to celebrate their freedom. Only one pigeon, Pepe, remains on mission, but is attacked by the animals he encounters. Pepe is rescued by a kind lioness named Kairel, secretary to the aging King Sabu and Queen Oriana. Kairel delivers Noah's message to Sabu, who calls an emergency meeting of the animal world. Sabu's spoiled libertine son Xiro has gotten a mangled portion of one of Noah's messages and mistakes the announcement of apocalyptic doom as an invitation to a party cruise. Xiro throws a tantrum after Kairel disqualifies all of Xiro's potential cruise-mates for lack of intelligence, and the tiger Dagnino sees an opportunity to seize the crown of the post-flood world's animal kingdom.  As Noah single-handedly completes the ark (an impressive but not Biblically accurate craft with a [[Ship's wheel|helm]], thousands of luxury cabins, and other features more suited to a modern cruise liner), the animals arrive en masse. Kairel has been sent along to organize and supervise the trip, but the procession grinds to a halt when the herbivores demand assurance that the carnivores won't devour them once they're aboard. Xiro fails to make a decision, allowing Dagnino to gain the animals' respect by declaring that he will personally punish any act of violence on the voyage. As the rain begins to fall, the animals stampede onto the ark. Xiro's selected companion Bruma pauses to taunt the doomed Kairel, only to be smashed through the gangplanks by a toppling hippopotamus. Xiro impulsively grabs Kairel and brings her aboard the ark in Bruma's place.  Inspecting Noah's cottage, Farfan and Esther notice the ark in the distance. Their ridicule turns to panic as the water rises around them, and they barely manage to scramble onto the ark unnoticed. Inside, Kairel attempts to maintain some semblance of order and convince Xiro to take his duties seriously, but Xiro flees to a hastily assembled club. There he becomes infatuated with the seductive panther Panthy, as she dances while performing ''I Want to Live'', a carnivore-themed parody of ''[[I Will Survive]].'' However, Panthy is part of Dagnino's small cabal of carnivores who intend to discredit and overthrow Xiro, then establish a new order in which all prey species are bred and fattened in captivity until they are consumed.  Kairel finally gets Xiro to face the truth of their situation, and Xiro makes a sincere effort at governance. He grows closer to Kairel, but finds bureaucracy stifling and is still infatuated with Panthy to Kairel's jealous dismay. Trapped below decks with the animals, Farfan and Esther disguise themselves as a fictional animal species ("grasswhoppers") to avoid being discovered as humans. The disguises backfire when the pair's misadventures leave them under a pile of animal dung which is hauled to the top deck for disposal. Believing a pair of dangerous wild animals have escaped the hold, Noah's sons and daughters attempt to catch or kill them. In the chaos, Farfan, Esther and Noah plunge back into the depths of the ark. Noah's eldest son Japeth volunteers to rescue him, but quickly retreats upon hearing frightening noises below (which turn out to be the hippopotamus suffering intestinal distress). Noah's faithful pigeon Pepe volunteers to fly down to Noah, but instead plummets helplessly because of his injuries. Noah's sons fight over the helm and break it. Ashamed and desperate, Noah's family prays for God's help.  Farfan and Esther knock Noah unconscious and abandon him. Feeling cocky with Noah out of the way, Farfan begins bullying the smaller animals before inadvertently striking Dagnino. The two humans escape uninjured, but Dagnino tears off the lower half of Farfan's 'hide,' which he needs for his scheme. Panthy lures Xiro to her cabin, where Dagnino's minions use the torn disguise and tomato juice to frame Xiro for the 'murder' of the grasswhoppers. Dagnino assumes control and has Xiro locked up in a storeroom, but Xiro's herbivore friends quickly unravel the deceit and convince Kairel of the truth.  Noah regains consciousness and tends to Pepe before sending him out a porthole to find land. Xiro has been imprisoned directly below and overhears Noah's words of encouragement, mistaking them for a personal message from 'the voice of his lineage.' When his friends free him, Xiro races to confront Dagnino, who has captured the other herbivores. (Xiro's group challenges Dagnino with the Maori ritual known as a [[haka]].) The battle between Dagnino and Xiro ends when the ark, having drifted into the Arctic, runs into an ice floe. The sudden stop pitches Dagnino and his minions through a wall, in which their heads are stuck fast.  The animals begin to panic again, threatening to flee onto the ice until Xiro finally asserts his authority with a mighty roar. Xiro delivers a speech that rallies the animals behind him (even many of Dagnino's gang, to Dagnino's chagrin). On the upper deck, Noah has made his way back up to his family, who are likewise now rallied behind him. Noah and his sons begin repairing the helm. God relents and allows Angel to shut off the rain. Xiro realizes the [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] for the ship's torches will melt the ice, and puts the animals to work spreading barrels of it across the floe. Xiro lights the pitch, breaking up the floe and freeing the ark. Farfan and Esther, believing the ark has run aground, break out and fall onto the floe just as the ark departs. They are last seen fleeing the hungry polar bears who have elected to remain behind in their natural habitat.  Pepe returns to the ark with an olive leaf, but is once again (accidentally) clobbered before he can reach his goal. Xiro and Kairel reconcile their different ways as the animals (including a caged Panthy, and Dagnino's gang still stuck in the section of wall) celebrate with a party on the open deck. God enjoys the festivities from above, but admonishes Angel for leaving the rainbow switched on.  During the end credits, God and Angel bicker over the contents of God's work-in-progress book.  
Nocturna (film)
 In the aging orphanage, the days pass very uneventfully, but the nights are something quite different; at least for Tim they are. The light reflected from the stars is the only cure for his fear of the dark.  The other kids get mad at Tim after he refuses to retrieve a ball that fell into the basement, due to the darkness. One night, the other kids steal the doorknob to the doors to the window that he has been keeping, forcing Tim to travel to the rooftop to see his favorite star. Once there, he manages to spot it, when suddenly it disappears. Unfortunately, it's not going to be the last one.  Tim also discovers a peculiar character that goes by the name of the Cat Shepherd together with his faithful cat Tobermory, the latter to become Tim's personal guardian. The Shepherd is in charge of making children sleep peacefully, but Tim is not about to go to bed. He needs his [[star]] more than anything in the world, and will do what it takes to see it shine in the night sky once again.  Tim convinces the Shepherd to take him to see Moka, the guardian of the night within the Night World and pleads for him to return the stars to the night sky. Moka pays scarce attention to the boy's pleas, so Tim asks the Cat Shepherd to take him to the Lighthouse of the Stars, where he thinks he may find the answer to the strange [[phenomena]]. Tim, the Shepherd, and Tobermory race against the clock through the streets of Nocturna, a world in which hundreds of the most diverse creatures work to create the night as we all know it. Little by little our friends will discover something strange is happening. An ominous threat, known as "The Darkness", is putting the night and the [[inhabitants]] of Nocturna in danger. In the end, it turns out that The Darkness was created through Tim's fear of the dark. After tricking the Darkness into approaching him, Tim manages to overcome his fear, defeat The Darkness, and save Nocturna. The next day, Tim surprises his friends by retrieving the ball from the basement. Impressed, they decide to play with him again.  
Normal Adolescent Behavior
 Wendy, Billie, and Ann are seniors at an alternative private school; they spend all their time with fellow students Jonah, Price, and Robert. The six have been friends since elementary school and their friendship has become a six-person polyamorous relationship. They swap sex partners each week; their loyalty is to the group, not to one person.   After school orientation, Wendy meets Sean, a new senior who moved from Chicago; he finds out about her "inner geek", and she quickly recognizes a kindred spirit. Soon their friendship becomes romantic, and Wendy is torn between her genuine affection and desire for Sean, and her commitment and belief in the group.   Wendy starts to test the boundaries of her vow to her friends, and Billie realizes that she is going to have to fight to keep her best friend; which should not be a problem, since each of the teens has collected a box full of mementos from their sexual experience.   If Wendy tries to leave, Billie can destroy her reputation and relationship in a heartbeat. While Wendy is trying to decide between Sean and her friends, Wendy's younger brother Nathan meets Sean's mother, Helen, who is waiting a long three weeks to start a new job. Nathan develops a huge crush on her, and he uses his considerable cooking skills to try and woo her.  Then Wendy spends another Saturday night with the group, and she is unable to "cheat" on Sean; her hesitation is all that Billie needs to accuse her best friend. After the girls fight, Wendy takes out her frustration on a random couple who keep making out in front of her house. Ryan, hearing that Wendy is out of the group, tries to be friends, but Wendy is conflicted.   Sean and Wendy try to be a "normal" couple, but the group quickly tests the relationship: Billie puts the box of memorabilia in Sean's locker. Wendy claims she is not scared; she knows that Sean loves her. Maybe so, but when he sees the photos that document a lifetime of sexual experimentation, he is fed up and offers an ultimatum: Wendy can burn the box, leave the group, and be a normal girl, or they can break up. Wendy has gone from one ultimatum to another.   When Wendy sees Billie being hassled for being alone by other students, she wants to comfort her friend. Billie invites Wendy back to the group but she tests her—pushing Wendy to publicly ridicule Ryan, a girl who left the group last year along with her boyfriend, Aaron. Billie believes that seeing a really dark side of Wendy will keep Sean away for good, and somehow restore their group.  Wendy takes it a step further though, outing everyone's secrets; not just in front of Sean but in front of the student body. Each of the six has some skeletons in their closet, and having them all exposed is going to leave everyone isolated from their pseudofamily of six, and also ostracised within the school. The future (which Billie was planning out 10 years at the beginning of the movie) is a lot less certain - and Wendy is going to be the first one out of the gate in finding something new.  
Norbit
   Norbit Albert Rice ([[Eddie Murphy]]) and Kate Thomas ([[Thandie Newton]]) are best friends as children at an orphanage, which doubles as a Chinese restaurant owned by their father figure Hangten Wong (Murphy), but are separated when Kate gets adopted by an unnamed family. 5 years later, while being bullied by twins at a playground, Norbit is saved by a tough, [[overweight]] girl named Rasputia Latimore (Murphy), who scares him into being her boyfriend and in turn protects him from the bullies. She protects Norbit from the other children and intimidates them into letting Norbit play with them. Years later, as adults, Rasputia's bullying nature gets worse as she grows up to be a grumpy, arrogant, vindictive, and mean-spirited woman.  She eventually pressures Norbit into marrying her and bullies, insults and controls him to make sure that she keeps him all to herself. Norbit is also belittled by Rasputia's older brothers Big Black Jack ([[Terry Crews]]), Blue ([[Lester Speight|Lester 'Rasta' Speight]]), and Earl ([[Clifton Powell]]), working as a bookkeeper at their local building company. The Latimore brothers also run a "[[Extortion racket|security business]]" and instill fear in everyone in the town except Mr. Wong, who is the only person in the community that doesn't put up with their antics and refuses to sell his business to them.  When Norbit discovers that Rasputia is cheating on him with her dance instructor Buster Perkin ([[Marlon Wayans]]), she carelessly brushes it off like nothing happened. Norbit yells at Rasputia and she becomes angered and chases him a couple of blocks. He escapes her and throws away his wedding ring due to her deception. Norbit vents his anger over Rasputia's infidelity at a [[puppet show]] for the children at the orphanage. Unexpectedly, during the show, Norbit sees Kate for the first time since childhood. Stunned by her return, his affection for her reignites while he learns she is buying Mr. Wong's orphanage, but he is disappointed to find out the following Tuesday that she is now engaged to Deion Hughes ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]).  With help from his two ex-pimp friends Pope Sweet Jesus ([[Eddie Griffin]]) and Lord Have Mercy ([[Katt Williams]]) and the other townspeople, Norbit manages to meet up with Kate without Rasputia's knowledge. Revealed to be a crooked businessman and gold digger, Deion helps the Latimore brothers in their plan to turn the orphanage into a [[strip club]] called Nipplopolis to get a cut in the profit. The Latimore brothers dupe Norbit into getting Kate to sign papers to renew the restaurant's liquor license and put it in the Latimores' name. Norbit's meeting with Kate leads to him helping her rehearse her wedding, where a kiss between the two of them makes her reconsider getting married. When Norbit returns home, he learns that Rasputia witnessed the whole thing (as she drove past and fainted). She threatens to kill Kate if she ever sees Norbit with her again.  Kate confronts Norbit after finding out about the deal and sees him in the window of the basement, where he has been locked away by a villainous Rasputia. Norbit reluctantly insults Kate, deliberately driving her away so that Rasputia will not follow through with her previous threat to kill Kate. Satisfied with Norbit hurting Kate's feelings, Rasputia adds that Norbit played Kate and has been setting her up since the first day she came back to town. Heartbroken, Kate runs away and Rasputia relishes in her sadness, laughing and mocking her. Fed up with the stress he is under, Norbit decides to leave town for good, but first tries to warn Kate about Deion, but she ignores him.  After that, the Latimores reveal their evil plan to Norbit and lock him up in the basement again and Blue is chosen by Rasputia to stay and keep watch. After the other Latimores leave to go to the wedding, Norbit escapes from the basement and past Blue's guard and races to the church on his bicycle. Though the Latimores try to stop him, Norbit reaches the church and informs Kate of Deion's gold digging schemes. Unfortunately, his proof of Deion's divorce settlements were destroyed in the process due to him falling into a pond trying to escape the clutches of the Latimores. However, Deion's ex-wives and children show up in person, with each of them revealing conflicting tales about him as Norbit had arranged to provide further proof of Deion's wrongdoings.  Confronted by them, Deion declares defeat and runs off, effectively ending the marriage. Furious that their plans are permanently ruined, the Latimore brothers try to attack Norbit before finding the townspeople standing up against them. In a blind rage, Rasputia fights her way through the crowd with a spade and prepares to attack Norbit, but she runs away after being [[harpooned]] in the rear by Mr. Wong. Big Black Jack, Blue, and Earl are then chased out of town by Norbit's friends. After Kate avows her love for Norbit with a passionate kiss, the two reconcile and Norbit officially divorces Rasputia, using her affair with Buster and her [[attempted murder]] of him as grounds for it.  Norbit and Kate buy the orphanage and get married under the same tree where they once played as children. Meanwhile, Rasputia and her brothers, who are now fugitives, move to [[Mexico]] and open up their strip club there called El Nipplopolis, where Rasputia becomes their most popular and lucrative stripper, never to be seen or heard from again.  
Noise (2007 Australian film)
 The film is set up amongst the landscape of two potentially related murders: that of an engaged woman in Sunshine, and that of seven passengers on a train in Melbourne's inner west. From there, the film deals primarily with the experiences of Lavinia Smart, a young woman who boarded the train shortly after the murders, and police Constable Graham McGahan, who is afflicted with increasingly severe [[tinnitus]]. When he requests light duty on account of his tinnitus, Constable McGahan is assigned the night shift of a police information van in the inner-western Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, where he encounters the traumatized members of the local community, including Lucky Phil, a mentally handicapped man, and Dean Stouritis, the fiance of the slain woman.  At the same time, the film explores the fear Lavinia experiences after the horrific events she witnessed.  Although she escapes with her life, the police are unsatisfied with her statements and accuse her of holding back information.  Lavinia is further traumatized when she realizes that the killer has stolen a portrait that can be used to identify her.  The police try to reassure her of her safety, but a man she identified in a police lineup easily tracks her down and tries to intimidate her.  After Lavinia angrily confronts him and explains her situation, he apologizes and gives her a ride back to her house.  After McGahan blows off the concerns of Craig Finlay, a profane racist, Finlay ambushes McGahan and opens fire on the van with a shotgun.  Finlay also kills a passing motorist while hunting McGahan, who escapes through a window.  The crashed car's horn cancels out McGahan's tinnitus, and he hears Finlay approaching him.  McGahan kills Finlay, though he is shot and wounded.  After he rescues a baby from the car, McGahan collapses, though the film leaves his ultimate fate unresolved.

Noise (2007 American film)
 David Owen, a New York lawyer, is constantly plagued by noise, particularly [[car alarm]]s, but also [[burglar alarm]]s and [[backup beeper]]s. Despite putting up with the noise for years, including the formative years of his daughter, he finally breaks into a car to shut off its alarm, and is arrested by police. Owen and his family try living in the countryside for a weekend, but it only replaces one set of noise problems with another. Despite attempting to legally deal with the constant barrage of noise, he makes no progress, and continues to resort to vandalism, resulting in higher and higher court penalties and straining his relationship with his wife, who finally asks him to leave.  While living on his own, Owen continues to destroy alarms, and progressively damages cars based on the number of violations. During this, he meets and begins a relationship with Ekaterina, a Russian student. She confronts him with the fact that he is "The Rectifier", a vigilante personality, complete with monikered stickers, that Owen has adopted. After falling in with him, Ekaterina convinces Owen to start a ballot initiative. While initially slow, the measure garners explosive popularity. Despite this, it is shut down by Mayor Schneer, who disdains the Rectifier and believes supporting the measure would encourage vigilantism.  After being shut down through a loophole that prevents the ballot measure from appearing, Owen outfits a car with numerous alarms and much louder horns. He then parks in front of city hall and sets off his alarms, citing the various laws that so frustrated Owen initially when city hall security demands he turn them off. After enraging a nearby tenant, Judge Kornreich, his vehicle is attacked and the judge is mistakenly arrested as The Rectifier. Kornreich sues Owen for pain and suffering damages, and Owen goes to court. During his cross-examination of Kornreich, Owen intentionally alludes that his actions could be considered [[assault]] and [[Battery (crime)|battery]], establishing a legal [[precedent]]. Owen is found guilty, though Kornreich obviously intends to be lenient on him. Having won a legal victory, Owen reunites with his wife. Walking out of the courthouse, an activist approaches Owen about blowing up a billboard TV that has been causing accidents and is an eyesore of the cityscape. A dual ending is provided, one in which Owen flees with the activist, and one where he politely declines to accompany her and gets into a cab with his wife.  
Noodle (film)
 When the Chinese woman working in Israel for Miri Kalderon, an Israeli flight attendant, is suddenly deported for overstaying her work visa, her lack of Hebrew-language skills makes it impossible for her to convince the Israeli authorities that she has a young child with her.  Miri, twice-widowed because of the ongoing Arab-Israeli conflicts, has been going through the motions of living, somehow detached from a real connection to life itself. Her decision to help reunite the child—nicknamed "Noodle"—with his mother, now back in Beijing, ends up helping her, not just the boy and his mother, in ways Miri herself could not have expected.  
The Number 23
 Walter Sparrow is an [[animal control officer]] married to Agatha; they have a son, Robin. At a bookstore, Agatha begins looking at a book titled ''The Number 23'' written by Topsy Kretts. She later gives Walter the book as a birthday present. Walter starts reading the book, noticing odd similarities between himself and the main character, a detective who refers to himself as "[[Fingerling (character)|Fingerling]]." Mirroring the detective, Walter becomes obsessed with the [[23 enigma]], the idea that all incidents and events are directly connected to the number 23, or to some number connected to 23. When he tries to warn Agatha about the number, she tells him he is crazy.  Walter's obsession leads him to believe that the book has secret insights into his own life. When he reads that Fingerling murders his girlfriend, Walter begins having dreams about murdering Agatha. Agatha refers him to her friend, Isaac French, who suggests Walter find the book's author if he wants answers. Walter's search leads him to discover the murder of Laura Tollins. Now believing the book to be a veiled confession, Walter searches for her killer.  Evidence found at a psychiatric hospital reveals Walter in fact is Topsy Kretts, having written the book as a way to rid himself of the guilt he felt over murdering Tollins. He was never suspected of the crime, and a man named Kyle Flinch was convicted and imprisoned instead. Walter had dated Tollins 13 years earlier, but she left him for Flinch. Walter stabbed Tollins to death in a jealous rage and left the scene of the crime, moments before Flinch arrived and touched the knife, implicating himself in the murder. Wracked with guilt, Walter decided to kill himself and began writing a suicide note, but found that he could not stop writing; the note ultimately became the book. He survived his suicide attempt, but the resulting head trauma left him with amnesia.  Fearing he will hurt his family, he leaves home and moves to the same hotel in which he had attempted suicide. Agatha finds Walter at the hotel and assures him that he is no longer the person he was when he wrote the book. He insists that he is a killer and tells Agatha to leave before he kills her, too. He leaves the hotel and runs into the street, where he nearly allows himself to be run over by a bus. Walter steps out of the way at the last minute when he realizes his son is watching. Walter turns himself in to the police and awaits sentencing, having been told that the judge will likely go easy on him. A funeral procession takes place in front of Tollins' grave, where it is implied her body has finally been laid to rest, as Flinch observes, a free man.  
Numb (2007 film)

Dr. Townsend ([[Bob Gunton]]) diagnoses his condition as [[depersonalization disorder]] and prescribes various medications including [[Clonazepam]], and when nothing seems to help Hudson consults Dr. Richmond ([[Brian George]]), who also sees drugs, albeit [[valproate semisodium|divalproex sodium]] and others rather than Clonazepam, as the solution.  Hudson meets Sara ([[Lynn Collins]]), a beautiful young woman who finds him attractive and appealing and decides to introduce him to as many positive and compelling experiences as possible. Also trying to help him is yet another psychiatrist, Dr. Blaine ([[Mary Steenburgen]]), who initially resists his advances but ultimately has an affair with him before revealing she has serious issues of her own that require professional attention.

Ocean's Thirteen
 Reuben Tishkoff is coerced by thugs employed by Willy Bank, his erstwhile business partner, into signing over his stake in ownership rights of the new hotel-casino they were building on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Reuben suffers a heart attack and becomes bedridden. [[Danny Ocean (character)|Danny Ocean]] offers Bank a chance to set things right, given his long history in [[Las Vegas]] and the fact that he "shook hands with [[Frank Sinatra|Sinatra]]," but Bank refuses, and completes construction of "The Bank", renamed since breaking his deal with Reuben. To avenge Reuben, Ocean gathers his partners-in-crime and plans to ruin Bank on the opening night of the hotel. They develop a two-fold plan to occur on the casino's opening night. One is to prevent The Bank from winning the prestigious [[AAA Five Diamond Award|Five Diamond Award]], which four of Bank's previous hotels had won. Saul Bloom is designated to stand in as the anonymous Diamond reviewer, while the real reviewer will be treated horribly during his stay by Ocean and his associates.  The second part of the plan is to rig the casino's slot machines, forcing them to payout more than $500&nbsp;million in winnings; by law, Bank would be required to cede control of the casino to the gambling board. While they can implement various rigging mechanisms into the casino, Ocean and his crew know that they would be easily stopped by the Greco Player Tracker, a state-of-the-art computer system that continuously monitors the gamblers' biometric responses and predicts when cheating is happening. Instead, they plan to use a [[Cavity magnetron|magnetron]], disguised as a new cell phone as a gift to Bank, to disrupt the Greco. They also obtain the drilling machine used to bore the [[Channel Tunnel]] to simulate an earthquake under the casino, assuring that Bank implements safety protocols to evacuate the casino in case of another earthquake. Their plan on opening night is to have Bank inadvertently disrupt Greco, initiate their rigged machines and dealers on their payroll, and then simulate the earthquake to force the evacuation and have players leave with their winnings.  As opening night draws near, the drill breaks down. Ocean is forced to turn to Terry Benedict, whom Ocean had slighted before, for funds to buy a replacement. Benedict, who also seeks retribution against Bank, offers the funds for a portion of his share of the take, but demands that Ocean also steal the four sets of diamonds Bank had bought for his wife after winning each of the previous Diamond awards. These are valued over $250 million and secured in a case at the top of The Bank. Ocean has Linus Caldwell get romantically close to Bank's assistant, Abigail Sponder, to gain access to the case. Secretly, Benedict contracts master thief François "The Night Fox" Toulour to intercept the diamonds after Ocean steals them.  Ocean institutes the final part of the plan on opening night, by having FBI agents on his pay arrive at the hotel and publicly arrest Livingston Dell on suspicions of rigging the card shuffling machines, allowing them to be replaced with actual rigged ones under Bank's nose. Another FBI agent arrests Linus after he switches the diamonds with fakes. The agent takes Linus away but reveals himself to be his father, Robert Caldwell, also in on Ocean's plan. They try to evacuate from the roof but are intercepted by Toulour who takes the diamonds. However, Ocean had anticipated this, and Linus and his father escape in a helicopter piloted by Basher, tearing the case from the roof and taking the real diamonds with them.  The remainder of Ocean's plan goes as expected, and as they trigger the earthquake, the players evacuate with millions of dollars of winnings. Ocean approaches a devastated Bank and tells him they did everything for Reuben. Ocean also reminds Bank that he cannot go to the police due to Bank's past illegal activities, and that all of Bank's associates favor Ocean over him. With their share of the winnings, Ocean's crew buy property on the Strip for Reuben to build his own casino. Because of his treachery, Ocean donates Benedict's $72 million portion of the take to charity in Benedict's name, forcing him to admit his philanthropy on broadcast television. As Ocean, Rusty, and Linus prepare to head off at the airport, Rusty triggers one of the rigged machines there to allow the real Diamond reviewer to win $11 million as a way to compensate him for how they had treated him.

Om and his friend Pappu take on numerous small acting roles as extras, and one night, a drunk Om describes his fantasy of one day winning a [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor]]. At the shooting of a film, Om rescues Shanti after a fire grows out of control, and they become friends. Om tries to romance her.  Om overhears a conversation between Shanti and film producer Mukesh Mehra. The pair have recently married in secret, and Shanti reveals that she is pregnant with his child. Mukesh seems overjoyed and asks Shanti to meet him at the set of their upcoming film ''Om Shanti Om''. Mukesh promises to cancel the film, reveal their marriage to the public, and have a grand wedding on the set. However, revealing his true colours, he tells Shanti that their relationship and child will ruin his career and sets the backdrop on fire.  Om attempts to rescue Shanti, but is attacked by Mukesh's guards. After the guards leave, he again attempts to rescue Shanti, but he is thrown from the building by the explosion. A disorientated Om is hit by a car owned by Rajesh Kapoor, an actor taking his pregnant wife, Lovely, to the hospital. At the hospital, Om remembers his moments with Shanti as he dies, while Lovely gives birth to a son, also named Om. The soul of Om Prakash reincarnates into the newborn Om Kapoor.  Years later, Om Kapoor (nicknamed OK) becomes a famous actor and lives the luxurious life dreamt of by Om Prakash, but experiences [[pyrophobia]] and subconsciously inherits Om Prakash's memories. At an awards ceremony, OK unknowingly delivers a speech Om Prakash made when he was drunk, which is heard by Pappu on television. At the event, OK's father introduces him to Mukesh, whose introduction causes OK to fully remember the events of Om Prakash's life. OK later reunites with Om Prakash's mother Bela and Pappu, and conspires to avenge Shanti's death by making Mukesh confess his crime.  OK convinces Mukesh to restart shooting for ''Om Shanti Om'', and he plans to convince Mukesh that Shanti's spirit is haunting him. To impersonate Shanti, OK finds a super-fan Sandhya (Sandy), a [[doppelgänger]] of Shanti. Throughout the film's shooting, OK and his friends arrange incidents to remind Mukesh of the past. During the music launch of the film, OK taunts Mukesh by revealing the extent to which he knows the story of Shanti's death. But when Mukesh runs after Sandy thinking she is the ghost of Shanti, Sandy accidentally cuts her arm and bleeds. Seeing this, Mukesh realises that she is not Shanti's ghost. Mukesh tries to confront OK, but he is suddenly hit by the set's swinging chandelier.  After Mukesh regains consciousness, OK confronts him but Mukesh reveals that he knows Sandy is not a ghost after all. During the quarrel, Sandy reappears and taunts Mukesh. She reveals that after the fire ceased to burn, Mukesh found that Shanti had survived and buried her alive below the chandelier. OK is confused about how Sandy knows this detail. Mukesh attempts to shoot Sandy, shocked by the revelation about the murder, but Mukesh and OK fight, which results in yet another fire. Just when O.K is about to kill Mukesh, Sandy stops him, saying Mukesh will not die by his hand. The chandelier falls on Mukesh, killing him instantly.  Pappu and Sandy rush to join OK, who is shocked when he sees Sandy in two places at once. OK realises that the person he assumed to be Sandy was actually Shanti's ghost, and recalls instances where supernatural events helped when OK's plans almost did not work, realising that Shanti was responsible. She smiles warmly towards OK and tearfully bids him goodbye, disappearing as she moves into the light.

As per the agreement, there are three months time for registration. However, Gowri Shankar's son Kiran ([[Tottempudi Gopichand|Gopichand]]) comes to Mumbai and demands the money immediately. Though Gauthami tries very hard to convince Kiran that it may not be possible to complete the deal early, he does not listen and wants to complete the deal saying he needs the money urgently. Kiran needs money of Rs. 4&nbsp; Crore urgently because his father's bank falls into bankruptcy and his father was arrested; he can get money by selling their guest house. Kiran plans that by giving this amount to an official ([[Tanikella Bharani]]) in Central Government, as bribe solves all the problems.  One day Kiran sees a man ([[Rao Ramesh]]) with a board in his hand, searching for [[Hh blood group|Bombay Blood group]] to save his mother's life. Kiran's blood group is Bombay Blood group. Kiran meets him and tells him that he is willing to donate blood. They go to a hospital and Kiran donates the blood. Kiran gives his mobile number to the hospital people, but not the address.  On the other hand, there is a [[mafia don]] called Sona Bhai ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]), whose blood group is [[Hh antigen system|Bombay blood group]], who needs an urgent [[heart transplant]], and looks for a person who has the same blood group. Despite several efforts, the entire mafia gang could not get a person who is healthy with that rare blood group. The hospital people give Kiran's mobile number to the goons saying that his blood group is Bombay blood group and he is perfectly healthy. Kiran receives a call from Sona Bhai, who requests Kiran to donate blood to him, which Kiran finally accepts, but the real intention of Sona Bhai and his gang is to get Kiran's heart.  Kiran meets Sona Bhai and his goons at a hospital on the next day, and doctors give Kiran some injection so that he goes into an unconscious state. Sona Bhai's nephew ([[Rahul Dev]]), who eyed his property, tries to save Kiran by showing a written message on his left hand ('Escape, these people will kill you.'). Kiran sees the message but could not get up from the bed and eventually goes unconscious. When doctors plan to start the heart transplant operation, Sona Bhai's BP raises to abnormal levels. The doctor reveals that it is not safe to do the operation for next 24&nbsp; hours as Sona Bhai's condition is serious, and insists that operation should be done to both Sona Bhai and Kiran simultaneously and also that it would kill Kiran if they try to keep him in the unconscious state for such long time.  When Kiran gets up, he remembers the message he has seen on Rahul Dev's hand and escapes from that situation by beating up the goons. Kiran safely reaches his guest house, and there he gets a phone call from Rahul Dev in which Rahul Dev (without revealing his identity) warns Kiran to leave Mumbai immediately and never come back. Frustrated, Kiran goes to Gauthami's office and demands angrily to complete the sale of his guest house immediately, breaking computers in the office. Gauthami files a case on Kiran but withdraws it immediately as she understands his situation and it was all out of frustration. Kiran explains all the problems to Gauthami.  One day, Sona Bhai's gang's main member Jayadev ([[Nassar]]) comes to know about why Kiran came to Mumbai. Jayadev alone meets Gauthami and says to her that he is willing to buy Kiran's guest house and gives his card to her. She says to him that the guest house is already registered to someone else. Gauthami convinces Marwadi to pay all the amount at once the next day. The next day, Gauthami informs Kiran that Marwadi is ready to pay all money immediately, but by then he is surrounded by goons. During the fight, one of the goons gives him an injection, which makes him go unconscious in 3&nbsp; minutes, but Kiran beats all the goons within 3&nbsp; minutes and comes out of his guest house; by then Gauthami reaches there. Losing consciousness, Kiran falls on Gauthami and asks her to take him to the hospital.  When Kiran is explaining Gauthami (in her house) about what has all happened, the goons (without Jayadev) reach there, Gauthami tells Kiran to hide, and the goons warn Gauthami that she should inform Kiran that his guest house is now under Sona Bhai's control. Kiran and Gauthami reach Marwadi's house to get money, but he is afraid of Sona Bhai, and says that he is not buying the guest house and asks them to pay back the advance. Kiran refuses and forces Marwadi to pay all the money. Marwadi convinces Kiran to stay near the end of the road, and he'll give all the money there within 30&nbsp; minutes. While Kiran and Gauthami are waiting for Marwadi at the end of the road, to their surprise, Rahul Dev reaches there, and explains that Marwadi, in fear of Sona Bhai, won't give him money, and he tells Kiran to meet him in a bar. As Marwadi did not meet them in 30&nbsp; minutes, they go to his house only to find out that he locked his house and escaped.  Gauthami contacts Jayadev on the phone, telling that the guest house is still vacant, and he can buy it now. Jayadev, along with the goons, reaches Gauthami's office, beats them up, and warns them not to try to sell that guest house. Meanwhile, Kiran meets Rahul Dev in a bar, and there, Rahul Dev explains his pitiful situation and the reason why he is saving Kiran, but then he suddenly tries to kill Kiran so that Sona Bhai would not get Kiran's heart, but Kiran beats up everyone including Rahul Dev, but spares his life as he once saved him.  Frustrated again, Kiran goes to Sona Bhai's house, catches up a wire that goes into Sona Bhai's chest (which helps keep his heart functioning normally), and threatens him that he would pull it out if he does not give Rs. 2&nbsp; Crore in cash immediately. As there is no other way, money is arranged for him. Kiran takes the money and escapes. By that time, Tanikella Bharani contacts Kiran, and tells him that he is in Mumbai, and asks Kiran to meet him in a hotel.  As Kiran and Gauthami reach the hotel room, they found no person inside but a CD. When they play the CD they find out Tanikella Bharani was killed by Sona Bhai's goons. One day, Kiran's father calls his son and tells him that someone in Mumbai is ready to invest an amount of Rs.200&nbsp; Crore in their bank. Kiran meets them only to find out that person is Sona Bhai himself. Sona Bhai makes a deal that if Kiran gives his heart, then Rs. 200&nbsp; Crore would be invested in their bank, otherwise not. Kiran tells that he needs some time to think about it. Meanwhile, Kiran and Gauthami fall in love with each other.  Kiran's father calls his son again and asks him about what happened. Kiran tells his father that they have put some conditions that can cause difficulties to them. Not explaining the real problem, Kiran's father tells his son that he should accept the deal regardless of what their conditions are.  Not knowing what to do, Kiran meets Sona Bhai in a hotel where there is Rs.200&nbsp; Crore in one of the rooms. At this point, Rahul Dev again tries to help Kiran, by showing the room number on his hand in which the money is present. Kiran beats up all the goons, takes all the required money, comes to Sona Bhai, pulls all the wires out of his chest, and destroys the equipment that is needed for his heart functionality so that he would die. Sona Bhai finds out that Rahul Dev cheated by trying to help Kiran by seeing at his hands. Soon, Jayadev kills Rahul Dev and announces the goons that they don't need Kiran's heart and orders to kill him, but Kiran escapes with all the money with Gauthami's help. Sona Bhai dies. Jayadev, who can't bear all of this, kills himself. Soon, because of gas leakage, there is a big fire blast in hotel killing all goons.

 A narrator explains that according to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] belief the evolution of birth can be divided into three forms:  *''Sangsethaca'': To be born amongst rot and decay, as a worm or maggot. *''Anthaca'': To be born from an egg, in the various forms of birds. *''Chalaphucha'': To be conceived in the womb as a human or other mammal.  Then there is a fourth form, ''Opapatika'', which goes against Buddhist beliefs because it involves [[suicide]]: a class of supernatural beings who are born out of suicide. However, the powers that they gain also have a negative effect.  The narrator, it is revealed, is Thuwachit ([[Pongpat Wachirabanjong]]), the loyal mortal [[henchman]] for the elderly Sadok ([[Nirut Sirijanya]]), an Opapatika who is quickly decaying and needs to feast on the flesh of other Opapatikas in order to sustain himself. He sends Thuwachit out to capture others.  Four Opapatikas remain: *Paisol ([[Chakrit Yaemnam]]), a ruthless assassin who must bear all the scars and wounds of his victims. *Jiras ([[Somchai Khemklad]]), an immortal Opapatika, and the most powerful of them all. He considers his immortality a curse. *Aruth ([[Ray MacDonald]]), an invincible fighter by night, but weak in the daylight. *Ramil ([[Athip Nana]]), an adrenaline-fueled daredevil who can project a monstrous, ghostly creature to do his bidding.  Investigating the Opapatikas is a private detective, Techit ([[Leo Putt]]), whom Sadok transforms into an Opapatika. Techit has the [[psychic]] powers of a mind reader, but his power costs him the use of his five senses.  Techit is teamed up with Thuwachit, who leads a vast paramilitary army against the four Opapatika. The four immortals are also mysteriously drawn to a woman, Pran ([[Khemupsorn Sirisukha]]).

Ore Kadal
  The film is based on [[Sunil Gangopadhyay]]’s novel ''Hirak Deepthi''. Dr. S.R. Nathan ([[Mammootty]]) is a world-renowned professor of economics. A theorist to the core, he always harps on his pet topics of poverty and developmental issues that concern the developing world. He is a loner who hits the bottle. He is not a womanizer though; in his own terms, he loves their company.  His close friend Bela ([[Ramya Krishnan]]) is more practical. She tries to identify herself with some of the stark realities of life.  Deepti ([[Meera Jasmine]]) is a housewife who stays in the same apartment complex with her husband ([[Narain (actor)|Narain]]) and son. Her husband is on the lookout for a job. On his persuasion, Deepti approaches Nathan.  Their chance encounter ends up in a complex relationship. But Nathan is unperturbed and quite unmindful of his ways. While Deepthi gets a feeling of guilt, Nathan just shoos it away. In fact, he is working on a book on middle-class attitudes and notions. Yet, when confronted with real questions, Nathan loses ground — a reference to the pseudo-intellectual image.  Here, the director closely examines the disturbing relationship between two individuals. Deepthi is not able to pull herself away from Nathan.  The undercurrents in the minds of Deepti and Nathan, their tormented souls as turbulent as the sea, are captured on frame dexterously by Alagappan, the cameraman. Though the film does not give any direct message, it does hint at what makes or breaks a relationship.

After receiving some assistance from the security guard named Thomas ([[Wes Bentley]]) and turning down his offer to spend Christmas with him, she calls for a taxi and waits in the lobby. When the taxi arrives, she discovers she is locked in the lobby and runs back into the parking garage. The taxi leaves without her and the lights soon shut down. Angela, guided by the light on her cell phone, wanders around the deserted parking lot. Thomas attacks Angela, drugs her with [[chloroform]], and takes her to his office.  Later, Angela awakens in a haze inside Thomas' office, having been changed into a white dress and high-heels by Thomas and her foot chained to the table. Thomas tells Angela that he loves her despite her "many sins", having obsessively watched and recorded Angela for some time through the [[CCTV]] in the office block. Despite Angela's pleas and threats, Thomas continues to hold her against her will, even forcing her to call her family and lie about an illness so that no one will come looking for her. Angela tries to escape, but cannot due to Thomas' [[Rottweiler]].  Thomas handcuffs Angela.

He hides Angela in the trunk of a car just as two police officers arrive in response to a reported disturbance.

Outlaw (2007 film)
 The film begins by exploring stories involving a number of different characters who live in and around [[London]], all of whom have experiences which lead them to believe that justice in the country is not being handed out fairly. These characters include [[nice guy]] [[white-collar worker]] Gene Dekker ([[Danny Dyer]]), who is brutally beaten by yobs without any reason on the way to his wedding. Danny Bryant ([[Sean Bean]]) is a [[paratrooper]] who has seen action in the [[Falklands War|Falklands]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and who arrives back from abroad to find his wife with someone else, and also believes that the state of the country is worse than the war-torn places he has recently served in. [[Crown Court]] [[prosecution]] [[barrister]] Cedric Munroe ([[Lennie James]]) receives [[death threat]]s towards his pregnant wife, being told they will only be safe if he pulls out of the case against club owner and [[heroin]] dealer Terry Manning (Rob Fry), a boss of the criminal underworld, who Munroe is currently prosecuting. [[Cambridge University]] student Sandy Mardell ([[Rupert Friend]]) and son of Bryant's former commanding officer has only recently left hospital, though the thugs who scarred him for life in an unprovoked physical attack were released from prison before he had made his recovery.  Through the help of [[Jingoism|jingoistic]] hotel security guard and former [[football hooligan]] Simon Hillier ([[Sean Harris]]), who has a connection to all the men in one form or another, the men are united - Munroe had previously defended him in court, Dekker had gone to school with him, and Bryant stays in the hotel where he works. The men form a [[vigilante]] gang, targeting individuals who they determine to be a threat to society. Information on said targets is provided to them by Munroe's police contact Walter Lewis ([[Bob Hoskins]]), one of the few police officers who is not corrupt and who has been demoted to work behind a desk by his superiors. The men work through targets associated with Manning, whose men went ahead with their threat against Munroe's pregnant wife, killing her and their unborn child. The men use firearms Bryant stole from active duty with the army.  The gang attract media attention and become known as the "Outlaws", but get themselves into trouble when they reveal their identities to one of Manning's men, Ian Furlong, yet fail to kill him. As a result, Furlong kills Lewis, and Bryant, the leader of the outlaws, is subsequently framed for the murder. Following this the gang go their separate ways, though not before Bryant hangs Hillier for being a liability, questioning his authority and insulting his wife.  As they all go back to their day-to-day lives, Manning is released from custody because of lack of prosecution. Bryant confronts Furlong in a pub regarding Manning's location, and shoots Furlong through the head. Dekker receives word from his friend and colleague Frank Lordish that he learned from his brother that Manning is hiding in the countryside. Dekker flees his wedding to contact Munroe when he realises that he cannot live a quiet life while letting Manning get away. The pair contact Mardell, who after meeting up with Bryant, decides that they will not survive the attack on Manning's home. Bryant, Munroe and Dekker infiltrate Manning's home, yet quickly discover that it is an ambush, with armed police soon arriving outside, led by the corrupt Sgt. Grieves (George Anton) of the [[Flying Squad]], who is in league with Manning.  The three outlaws engage in a gunfight with the police and manage to flee into the woods for one final showdown. Dekker is shot in the shoulder and Bryant is killed while advancing towards the armed response squad and shooting at them. Munroe willingly surrenders only to be murdered by the now blatantly corrupt police officers. When it appears that all the vigilantes are dead, Dekker is revealed to still be alive and was playing dead. He successfully escapes through the forest, pursued by gunshots.  The final scene shows Frank being handed an envelope of cash by Terry Manning in his workplace's car park. As the crime lord drives away he is confronted by a gun-wielding Dekker, who points the gun directly at Manning's face. Manning taunts Dekker, saying "You haven't got the bollocks, son", to which Dekker smiles menacingly, and pulls the trigger.  
Owl and the Sparrow
 The film takes place during five days in the lives of the main characters: Thuy (Pham Gia Han), a ten-year-old runaway orphan, Lan (Cat Ly), a flight attendant, and Hai (Le The Hu), a zookeeper.  Thuy works in a factory for her uncle, Minh (Nguyen Hau), who thinks she is useless and unfit for school.  Longing for a life elsewhere, she runs away from home and ends up on the streets of Saigon selling postcards and roses to earn a living.  One night, Thuy meets Lan at a noodle shop and the two become friends.  On hearing that Thuy is homeless, Lan gives her a place to stay at her apartment and Thuy comes to admire her for her kindness, beauty, and independence.  Unbeknownst to everyone, however, Lan is having an affair with a co-worker and is secretly unhappy with her life.  The next day, Thuy goes to the zoo and befriends an elephant whose keeper, Hai, takes her under his wing.  His uncanny ability to understand the animals captivates Thuy, who begins helping at the zoo.  While at the marketplace, Hai asks Thuy to deliver a bouquet to a woman named Phuong (Nguyen Kim Phuong) and tells her that he and Phuong were once engaged, but (it is implied) the relationship dissolved due to her family’s disapproval of his profession.  Thuy warns that even if Phuong returns, she will only break his heart again.  To ensure this doesn’t happen, she tells Hai that Phuong has a new boyfriend (although the latter informed her that she was single).  Feeling dejected, Hai brings Thuy back to the zoo and tells her that he knows of an orphanage where she will be safe.  Thinking that Hai wishes to see her locked away like an animal, however, she leaves and returns to the city.  At the same time, Lan breaks off her affair with her co-worker (who is already married).  She comes home and finds Thuy asleep at her doorstep.  They go out for dinner at a restaurant where Hai shows up and meets Lan for the first time.  Despite an awkward beginning, the night turns into a family outing of sorts and ends with Lan and Hai realizing that they are both lost souls unsure of what they want in life.  Having brought them together, Thuy leaves Lan in the apartment with a single rose as a thank you and a goodbye.  Hours later, policemen canvas the streets checking for employment papers.  While most of the children escape, the police catch Thuy, whom they send to an orphanage in the city.  Lan searches frantically for Thuy and goes to the zoo to seek Hai.  They find the orphanage, but are unable to claim her as neither of them are relatives.  To everyone’s dismay, Minh arrives with documents proving he is Thuy’s legal guardian and takes her back to the country to work in the factory.  Unwilling to live a life of servitude, however, Thuy escapes and takes a large amount of Minh's money.  She goes to Hai and offers to buy his favorite elephant (so it won’t be deported to a zoo in India).  Moved, but disappointed, Hai returns the money to Minh.  On witnessing first-hand the life that Thuy endures, Hai offers to pay for her to live and work at the zoo where he will be her guardian.  Thuy is elated but saddened that Hai and Lan are not together (due to Hai’s insecurities about not being good enough for her).  In a last ditch effort, Thuy visits Lan at her apartment, but finds her gone.  She leaves a note and a package before going.  At the airport that evening, Lan opens the package and reads the note from Thuy in which she says that Lan is her family.  The package also contains a pair of dolls (Thuy’s prized possessions).  Deeply touched, Lan races out of the airport and through the streets of Saigon.  On finding Thuy, she drops to her knees and embraces her while Hai smiles down on them both, overjoyed at seeing their “family” complete.

While the train is moving a security guard notices the pair, chases after them, and tries to get them off by hitting Scratch with his flashlight. During the melee, Alex hits him with his skateboard and the guard, losing balance, falls onto another track into the path of an oncoming freight train which cuts him in half. Alex tries to destroy some of the evidence. For example, he throws his skateboard into the [[Willamette River]] from the [[Steel Bridge]], and when he arrives at his friend Jared's house, he showers and disposes of the clothes he had been wearing.  Alex is later questioned at school by Detective Richard Lu, as are several other students who had been skateboarding on the night in question. It is revealed that the police have recovered Alex's skateboard, though they have not traced it back to him, and have identified [[DNA]] evidence which places the skateboard at the scene of the security guard's death.  Throughout the film Alex keeps the incident to himself, and does not confide in anyone else. After having impassive sex with his girlfriend, Jennifer, he breaks up with her. Another of his friends, Macy, notices that he is worried about something. She advises him to write down whatever is bothering him as a [[catharsis|cathartic]] release if nothing else.

Paranormal Activity
  Young couple Katie and Micah move to a new house in [[San Diego]]. Katie claims an evil presence has been haunting her since she was a child, so Micah sets up a camera in their bedroom to record any paranormal activity that occurs while they sleep. A famous [[psychic]] Dr. Fredrichs, who reveals that Katie is being haunted by a demon that feeds off of negative energy and is intent on tormenting Katie,  advises them not to communicate with the demon and to contact [[Demonology|demonologist]] Dr. Johann Averies if needed. Katie seems interested, but Micah does not take this seriously.  The camera manages to capture many strange occurrences, which are minor at first, such as noises, flickering lights, and doors moving on their own. However, Micah taunts and mocks the demon, worsening the situation. During the thirteenth night, the demon angrily screeches and there is a loud thud, causing the entire house to vibrate. Voice recorder tests are conducted by Micah the following morning, which reveal demonic grunting when Micah asks if it would like to use a [[Ouija board]]. During the fifteenth night, Katie, in an apparent trance, stands beside the bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going outside. Micah tries to convince Katie to go back inside, but she refuses and appears to remember none of it the next day.  Micah brings home a Ouija board, which infuriates Katie. When they leave the house, the camera records an unseen force moving the planchette to form an unknown message on the Ouija board, which then spontaneously catches fire. Katie sees the video and pleads with Micah to contact the demonologist, but again he refuses. During the seventeenth night, Micah sprinkles [[baby powder]] in the hallway and outside the bedroom door. The couple are awakened by creaks, and find non-human footprints leading to the attic, where Micah finds a burnt photograph of a young Katie (same picture from the [[Paranormal Activity 2|second film]]). Katie finally calls the demonologist, Dr. Averies, but he is out of the country.  The events of the seventeenth night have psychologically terrified the couple, which in turn has strengthened the demon. Over the next few nights, the paranormal activity is excessive and intense. They eventually call Dr. Fredrichs back to the house, but he is overwhelmed by the demonic energy upon entering. He apologetically leaves despite their pleas, stating that his presence only makes the demon angrier. The bleak reality causes the couple to lose all hope, which makes the demon strong enough to be able to pull Katie out of the bedroom and bite her, causing her to become fully possessed. Micah discovers the bite mark and—deciding events are too out of control to remain in the house—he packs to head to a motel. Just as they are set to leave, the possessed Katie insists they will be okay now.   The following night, Katie gets out of bed and stares at Micah for two hours before going downstairs. After a moment of silence, Katie screams for Micah; he abruptly rushes to help her. Afterward, Micah exclaims in pain, Katie stops screaming, and then heavy footsteps are heard coming upstairs. Suddenly, Micah's body is violently hurled at the camera, which is knocked off the tripod, revealing a demonic Katie standing in the doorway. She slowly walks into the room, stained with blood, and crawls to Micah's body, then looks up at the camera with a grin. As she lunges toward the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance just as the scene cuts to black. [[Epilogue]] text states that Micah's body was discovered by the police on October 11, 2006, and [[Paranormal Activity 2|Katie's whereabouts remain unknown]].   ===Alternate endings=== Once Paramount acquired the film, the original ending was scrapped, and two new endings were developed for the film, one of them being the one seen in theaters (the scrapped ending was shown at only one public viewing).<ref></ref><ref></ref>  ====Original==== Katie returns to the bedroom and sits down against the bed with the knife in her hand, rocking back and forth, for almost two days straight. Her friend Amber calls and leaves a message, saying that she is concerned because she hasn't heard from Katie or Micah. Amber eventually comes looking for her, but when she enters the house, she is heard screaming after seeing Micah's body. The creature possessing Katie leaves her body, scaring Amber out of the house before returning to Katie, who resumes rocking back and forth.  Police officers arrive at the house about a half hour later and discover Micah's body as well. They call to Katie, who wakes from her [[catatonic]] state and seems confused. Katie comes out of the bedroom with the knife still in her hand. The police ask her to drop the knife. Following a heated confrontation, a door behind one of the police officers slams shut, startling one of the officers, which causes him to shoot Katie, killing her. The film ends with the police investigating the area and finding nothing but the camera, still running.  ====Paramount alternate ending==== In this ending, available as alternate ending on the home releases of the film, Katie returns to the bedroom after the screaming and noise of her and Micah struggling downstairs. She is holding a knife and covered in blood. She closes and locks the bedroom door. Katie walks over and smiles at the camera before cutting her own throat. The screen then fades to black.  ====Unfilmed alternate ending==== A third alternate ending was written in which a possessed Katie would corner Micah and bludgeon him to death with his camera, while viewers watch from the camera's point of view. This version was deemed too complicated and too brutal to shoot.<ref></ref>

Passage to Zarahemla
 The story begins with its focus on a group of hunters illegally hunting game out in the woods.  Originally thought to be dead, the hunter's target springs back to life and flees into the heavy brush and trees.  Determined not to let the game suffer, one of the hunters decides to pursue the [[elk]] in its flight.  After some amount of exploration he finds his elk...hanging over a branch, shot by an arrow.  Hearing noises he turns around to an arrow shot at him and screams.  Kerra and Brock are introduced to the story line at their mother's funeral.  With their father having apparently disappeared for some unknown reason years ago, their mother recently dying, and no other known relatives within the area, the two are set to become wards of the state.  In an effort to keep the two together, Kerra decides that they must pack up their belongings and escape before the return of the social worker assigned to their case.  Brock, having prior association with a local gang and a criminal record, assists his sister in stealing the social worker's vehicle.  The two drive off in a fury in an effort to escape.  Remembering a relative from early on in her childhood, Kerra plots a course for [[Leeds, Utah]], a small LDS rich community in the southern part of the state.  Arriving at their aunt and uncle's house, the two concoct a story indicating that they are traveling across the country to meet up with their mother who had recently acquired a new place of employment.  With the stolen car having problems, the pair is unable to travel any further until it is fixed, and are offered a place to stay until repairs are completed.  Shortly after their arrival, Kerra is confronted by her cousins with stories from her early childhood days.  These stories recall "strange noises" in the woods behind their house and dealings with an "imaginary" being whom Kerra had termed to be "Kid Donni."  One night after the siblings arrival, an earthquake shakes the area with the epicenter believed to be near the property of their Aunt Corrine and Uncle Drew.  Following the quake, Kerra is reunited with her "imaginary" childhood friend Kiddoni, who is in reality a noted being from the [[Book of Mormon]].  The earthquake is revealed to have caused a "rift" in time - allowing Kerra contact with the ancient Nephite peoples and their adversaries, and allowing Kiddoni and his people to cross the time gap into the modern world.  As the story progresses, the time portal gap expands and eventually allows the [[Nephite]] and  [[Gadianton robbers|Gadianton armies]] to exit the past near the  Whitman's home.  Brock on the other hand is unaware of this time rift and eventually finds himself captured by the Gadianton armies.  It is at this time that he comes into contact with a scraggly-bearded individual from "modern" times named Chris.  Meanwhile, during their escape from California, Brock had been given a bag by a former gang-member to take out of the area, which is later revealed to be a bag full of illegal drugs.  Upon realizing who was in possession of the bag, the gang leader decides to make a trip to the small Utah community to recover the bag.  Near the end of the story the two worlds clash as the rift in time grows very large.  The [[Gadianton robbers|Gadianton army]] crosses the time border into the present day in an effort to find food for their armies.  Through sheer coincidence Chris and Brock reunite with Kerra near the Whitman home, where it is revealed that Chris is the siblings father, who had disappeared during a hunting trip many years earlier.  A major [[Nephite]]-[[Gadianton robbers|Gadianton]] battle eventually ensues near the Whitman home while the trio of family retreats into hiding.  Shortly thereafter, another quake hits the area and the division between the time periods is restored.  Kerra is heartbroken at not getting to say goodbye to her Nephite friend, but both families are happy that they were kept safe and that father and children were reunited again.

However, Adam decides to join them the next day.  When Luke and Zahra arrive to the village (previously a skiing center), they go to the only hotel left but are turned away by the angry receptionist who does not allow unmarried couples to stay overnight. They are forced to find another location to spend the night and they find a local man who offers them to spend the night in one of his cabins.

While walking home, Rowena meets her childhood friend, Grace Clayton ([[Nicki Aycox]]), who seeks her help in taking down Harrison Hill (Willis), a wealthy advertising executive. Grace gives Rowena her e-mails as proof of their extramarital affair, which Hill recently ended.  A few days later, Grace is found dead, drowned and poisoned with [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]], leading Rowena to suspect Harrison. Grace was revealed to be in her first trimester of pregnancy. With Miles' help, Rowena goes undercover, under the alias of Katherine Pogue, as a temporary worker at his company, H2A at [[7 World Trade Center]]. While setting up gift bags for a [[Victoria's Secret]] collection launch, she meets fellow worker Gina. Gina gives her information about the questionable lifestyles of the senior management of H2A.  Hill is revealed to be rich because of his wife, Mia Reinhart-Hill. If she divorced him, he would be penniless, revealing the reason why he keeps his affairs with female workers secret. Rowena flirts with Hill both online and in real life (not realizing the online Hill is actually Miles), but is warned to stay away by Hill's lesbian PA, Josie. When Hill catches her snooping, believing her to be a corporate spy, he fires her.  At Miles's apartment, Rowena discovers a shrine to her and explicit pictures of Miles and Grace. Miles arrives home and Rowena confronts him; he defends himself by providing evidence that Hill had access to belladonna for poisoning. She goes to the police, who arrest Harrison for the murder of Grace.   After Hill's conviction, Miles visits Rowena. He then tells her that he knows she is the real killer and has been using this investigation to frame Hill. Rowena flashes back to a memory of her father attempting to [[child sexual abuse|molest]] her, and her mother subsequently bludgeoning him to death with a fireplace poker. A younger Grace watches from her window as they bury his body.  Grace has been blackmailing Rowena with this knowledge. Miles describes in detail how she had plotted the murder to end Grace's blackmail and pinned the murder on Hill. Miles asks how she intends to keep him quiet, implying she might sleep with him, since he has long lusted after her. However, Rowena stabs him to death and ransacks the kitchen. She then calls the police, claiming to have been attacked by Miles and that he might have been the real murderer. The film ends with a man looking out of a neighboring window, presumably having witnessed what really happened.  
Perfect Creature
  The film opens as a pregnant woman ([[Danielle Cormack]]) gives birth to a vampire. A young Brother, Silus, aged 10–13 is told this child, Edgar and he are from the same mother. Throughout this introduction, the mother is in visible emotional distress, reaching out across the room to Silus, trying to touch him.  Captioned "100 Years Later." Jamestown slum has had a series of attacks on women, who are all found with their throats bitten. Lilly Squires ([[Saffron Burrows]]) is in charge of the human police investigating these cases. She states that she comes from a workhouse in this same slum, and we establish that she is one of the few cops who care what happens to these people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap.  Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus.  Silus ([[Dougray Scott]]) is detailed by the church cardinals to work with the human police, because the Brothers know that these attacks have been carried out by a Brother; Silus's brother Edgar ([[Leo Gregory]]). Edgar has sent Silus a recording of his last murder, challenging him to find and stop him before he kills again. Edgar provides the location of his next murder.  With Silus' help, Lilly puts together a task force to stake out the area Edgar has targeted. However Edgar distracts the cops and attacks Lilly, biting her in the neck. An officer interrupts the attack and Edgar flees. To save Lilly's life, Silus tells her to drink his blood, which she does. Silus then pursues Edgar, managing to shoot him with a tranquilizing dart. Silus later visits Lilly in hospital. We establish that she has no family as they died from influenza. Lilly is having visions from drinking Silus' blood. The newspapers have published a fake story of the death of the killer; a deranged human who believed he was a Brother.  Edgar is being held in a "brace", a spiked body restraint in a cell in the church basement. Because Silus is soon to be made a member of the "inner circle" he is told the full details of what happened to Edgar. The cardinals are worried that not a single Brother has been born for 70 years, and that a female vampire has never been born. Although they have publicly banned genetic research, the church has been carrying it out in secret. Edgar has been developing a virus to inject into pregnant women, to force the baby to be born a vampire. Alas the virus has mutated, and it has turned the women into violent, insane, psychopaths. Ten of Edgar's research subjects are already dead, and the last one is dying. Edgar has also become infected, and is now insane, although the effect is slower due to his strong immune system.  Silus visits Edgar, who vows to escape and finish off Lilly. Edgar accuses Silus of being in love with Lilly, despite Brothers being forbidden to love. The night Silus is at a ceremony in the church for his investiture as a cardinal Edgar escapes, killing the guards and receptionist, and disappears into Jamestown. He enlists the help of a local named Freddy to help him catch Lilly. Edgar has installed a tap and tube system into his forearm, so he can turn on a flow of his own infected blood at any time. He catches a policewoman and fills her mouth with his blood. Freddy insists on getting his own share as well, not knowing it is infected.  Silus is guarding Lilly at her apartment with Lilly's colleague Jones. When she is sleeping Silus shows some affection for her by imagining kissing her. Later, Silus leaves to investigate a noise downstairs and Lilly and Jones patrol around. When Lilly approaches a window, Edgar bursts through from outside and grabs her. Silus and Edgar grapple, however Silus is knocked unconscious long enough for Edgar and Lilly to disappear.  The virus has spread throughout Jamestown. The government has instituted a quarantine, and soldiers shoot anybody who attempts to leave. Humans are rioting outside the churches, and throwing their rosaries back at the Brothers.  Silus discovers Edgar's location is Jamestown's water source. Edgar is dripping his blood into the water supply, infecting all of Jamestown. However, each suburb has its own separate water supply. Silus is determined to go in and rescue Lilly, however another cardinal tells him that Jamestown will be burned to the ground to make sure that the virus dies, and Edgar with it. He warns Silus that his own career will be doomed if he ignores the "greater good" and breaches quarantine.  Silus breaks through into Jamestown and heads to the aquifer, dodging the infected. Lilly is handcuffed to a water pipe in a locked basement. Edgar comes in and she tries to persuade him to stop but instead he challenges her about her dead child, saying that her race is good at abandoning children. Edgar finds Silus and they fight. Just as Silus is winning, Edgar throws him backwards onto the prongs of a steam injector. As Silus lies groaning, and possibly dying, on the ground, Edgar approaches with a portable steam injector. When Edgar depresses the trigger steam comes out. Edgar threatens to burn Silus's face off so that he will be more of a monster just like him. Lilly comes up behind Edgar and kills him by stabbing another steam injector into the back of his skull.  Silus escorts Lilly from the water facility. He kisses Lilly and says she must do something. He gestures to a building then tells Lilly she must look after what she will find in there and keep it away from the Brotherhood. Lilly enters the building, and finds the other Brother, a dead woman, and a baby. The Brother tells Lilly the infant is the first female vampire ever born. The virus has created her and she is truly the first Perfect Creature.  Silus is branded a heretic, and must stay in hiding. Meanwhile, Lilly is caring for the baby and Silus is watching over her. The movie ends with Silus saying that he is being hunted but he will always fight back, leaving scope for a second movie.  
Persepolis (film)
   At an airport in France, an Iranian woman, [[Marjane Satrapi|Marjane 'Marji' Satrapi]], looks at the flight schedule; her eyes come to rest at a listing bound for [[Tehran]]. She then takes a seat and smokes a cigarette. She reflects on her childhood, full of politically driven conflict.  As a young girl, Marji lived in Tehran and wanted to be a [[prophet]] and was a great fan of [[Bruce Lee]]. At the time, her passion was to participate in a revolution against the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]]. Her middle-class family participates in all the rallies, though Marji herself is forbidden from attending. One day, Siamak Jari, a friend of the family and the father of Marji's friend Lali, is released from prison. They all listen as he explains the pains from prison, and Marji grows jealous of Lali having a real 'hero' in her family.  Some days later, Marji and a group of friends attempt to attack a young boy named Ramine, whose father, a member of [[SAVAK]], the Shah's secret police, had killed [[Communism|Communists]] and revolutionaries as part of his work. They retrieve nails from a toolbox and attempt to nail him. They are stopped by Marji's mother, who punishes Marji. In her room, God tells Marji that Ramine's father's crimes are not Ramine's fault. Marji walks up to Ramine the next day to say she forgives him for his father being a 'murderer' but an indignant Ramine staunchly defends his father and angrily rides away on his bike.  One day, Marji's Uncle Anoosh arrives to have dinner with the family after recently being released from his nine-year sentence in prison. Marji is ecstatic to meet him as he is the very sort of family 'hero' she wants to have. Uncle Anoosh inspires Marji with his stories of his life on the run from the government, a result of rebelling.  Political enemies cease fighting and elections for a new leading power commence. Marji's family's situation does not improve, in spite of Anoosh's optimism, and they are profoundly upset when [[Islamic Fundamentalists]] 'win' the elections with 99.99% of the vote and start repressing Iranian society, imposing strict Islamic ideals onto them. The government forces women to dress modestly, including wearing a headscarf, and Anoosh is rearrested and executed for his political beliefs, as are other political dissenters who Marji has come to know, while Siamak Jari narrowly flees with his family after his sister was killed in his place. Many of the family's friends, as well as thousands of Iranians, flee the new regime to Europe or the USA. Upset that God did nothing to prevent the execution of her beloved uncle, she rejects her faith.  Profoundly disillusioned, Marji tries, with her family, to fit into the reality of the new regime. The [[Iran–Iraq War]] breaks out and Marji sees for herself the horrors of death and destruction. The Iranian government begins implementing ridiculous laws that create blatant injustices and cut down even more on social freedoms. Marji witnesses her father threatened by corrupt rifle-wielding teenaged government officials.  Later, one of her uncles has a heart attack. They are informed that he needs open-heart surgery. As they do not have the equipment in Iran, he needs to be sent to England. However, since the borders are closed, only very sick people, if approved by the Board of Health, can leave. When the uncle's wife attempts to get permission, she finds that the hospital director that she must deal with was her former window-washer; incompetent and totally submissive to his beliefs, he refuses to allow the uncle to travel abroad for medical treatment.  Marjane and her father go to see Khosro, a man who prints fake passports. He tells them he can make the passport in a week. Khosro is sheltering a relative named Niloufar, an 18-year-old wanted for her Communist beliefs, and who Marjane takes an instant liking to. Later, however, Niloufar is spotted and promptly arrested and executed; Khosro's house is ransacked in the process. Khosro flees without ever making the passport. Marji can only watch as her uncle eventually dies from his heart problems. His official passport arrived on the day of his death.   The family tries to find solace in secret parties where they enjoy simple pleasures the government has outlawed, including [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. As she grows up, Marji begins a life of over-confidence. She refuses to stay out of trouble, secretly buying Western [[heavy metal music]], notably [[Iron Maiden]], on the [[black market]], wearing unorthodox clothing such as a [[denim]] jacket, celebrating [[punk rock]] and other Western music sensations like [[Michael Jackson]]. She nearly avoids being taken into custody by the female Guardians of the Revolution by lying. Marji is expelled from school when she openly rebuts a teacher's lies about the abuses of the government.  Fearing her arrest for her outspokenness, Marji's parents send her to [[Lycée Français de Vienne|a French lycée]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], where she can be safe and free to express herself. She lives with [[Catholic]] nuns and is upset with their discriminatory and judgmental behavior. Marji makes few friends, and ultimately feels intolerably isolated in a foreign land surrounded by annoyingly superficial people who take their freedom for granted and view her with open disdain. As the years go by, Marji is thrown out of her temporary shelter for insulting a nun.   Marji continues to go from house to house until ending up in the house of Frau Dr. Schloss, an unstable former philosophy teacher. One night, her grandmother's voice resonates, telling her to stay true to herself as she leaves a party after lying about her nationality, telling an acquaintance that she was French. Her would-be lover [[Coming out|reveals his homosexuality]] after a failed attempt at sex with Marji. She engages in a passionate love affair with Markus, a debonair native, which ends badly when she discovers him cheating on her. Marji is then accused of stealing Frau Dr. Schloss' brooch, and finally leaves. She spends the day on a park bench, reflecting upon how 'stupid' she had been, and realizes that she has nowhere else left to go. She lives on the street for a few months. Eventually, she becomes ill and contracts [[bronchitis]], and almost dies.  Marji recovers in a Viennese hospital and returns to Iran with her family's permission, and hopes that the conclusion of the war will improve their quality of life. After spending several days wasting her time watching television, Marji falls into a [[clinical depression]]. She attempts suicide by overdosing on medication. She falls asleep and dreams of God and [[Karl Marx]] reminding her what is important and encouraging her to live. Her determination is renewed and she begins enjoying life again.  Marji attends university classes and parties. She enters into a relationship with a fellow student. Marji notices that her situation has gradually worsened and that Iranian society is more tyrannized than ever. Mass executions for political beliefs and petty religious absurdities have become common, much to Marji's dismay. She and her boyfriend are caught holding hands and their parents are forced to pay a fine to avoid their lashing.  Despite Iranian society making living as a student and a woman intolerable, Marji remains rebellious. She resorts to personal survival tactics to protect herself, such as falsely accusing a man of insulting her to avoid being arrested for wearing makeup and marrying her boyfriend to avoid scrutiny by the religious police. Her grandmother is disappointed by Marji's behavior and berates Marji, telling her that both her grandfather and her uncle died supporting freedom and innocent people, and that she should never forsake them or her family by succumbing to the repressive environment of Iran. Marji, realizing her mistake, delivers a speech at a gathering at the university, and her grandmother is pleased to hear that Marji openly confronted the blatant sexist [[double standard]] in her university's forum on [[public morality]].  The fundamentalist police, however, manage to discover and raid a party that Marji attends. While the women are detained (though having just barely managed to cover themselves up, they ultimately avoid punishment), the men escape across the rooftops. One of the men, Nima, hesitates before jumping, consequently falling to his death. Her family decides that Marji, after her friend's death and her divorce, leave the country permanently to avoid being targeted by the Iranian authorities as a [[political dissident]]. Before she leaves Iran, she takes a trip to the [[Caspian Sea]] and visits the graves of her grandfather and uncle. Marji's mother forbids Marji from returning to which Marji agrees. Marji states that this would be the last time she saw her grandmother, who died not long after her departure.  Marji collects her luggage and gets into a taxi. As the taxi drives away from the south terminal of Paris-Orly Airport, the narrative cuts back to the present day. The driver asks Marjane where she is from and she replies "Iran;" she has kept the promise she made to Anoosh and her grandmother that she would remember where she came from and that she would always stay true to herself. She recalls her final memory of her grandmother telling her how she placed [[Jasmine]] in her brassiere to smell lovely every day.

Once every ten years he could come ashore to be with the woman he loved. But he corrupted his purpose and was cursed to become a monster. The soul of Governor Swann reveals that the ''Dutchman'' must always have a captain.  Returning to the living world, the ''Pearl'' stops at an island for fresh water, where the crew find the [[Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)|Kraken]] lying dead on the beach, having been killed by Jones under orders from Beckett.

Jack and Elizabeth escape the ''Dutchman'' as it is sucked into the maelstrom.  As Beckett's ship, the ''Endeavour'', approaches to destroy the ''Pearl'', the ''Dutchman'' rises from the sea, now captained by Will; the crew has been freed from Jones's curse. Together, the two pirate ships destroy the ''Endeavour''. A stunned Beckett goes down with his ship while his navy retreats. With Will now forever bound to escort souls lost at sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell to each other on the beach of an abandoned island. Will departs on the ''Dutchman'', leaving Elizabeth pregnant and with the chest containing his heart.  Jack and [[Joshamee Gibbs]] discover Barbossa has stolen the ''Black Pearl'' again, but Jack planned ahead and stole Sao Feng's navigational charts. He departs from [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] alone [[Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides|to track down the mythical Fountain of Youth]].

Planet Terror
  In rural Texas, [[go-go dancer]] Cherry Darling, resigning from her low-paying job, runs into her mysterious ex-boyfriend El Wray at the Bone Shack, a restaurant owned by brothers J.T. and Sheriff Hague. Meanwhile, the demented Lt. Muldoon and his men are making a transaction with chemical engineer Abby for mass quantities of DC2 (codename "Project Terror"), a deadly biochemical agent. When Muldoon learns that Abby has an extra supply, he attempts to take Abby hostage. The latter intentionally releases the gas into the air, mutating most of the town's residents into deformed [[Zombie|zombies]]. The infected townspeople are treated by the sinister Dr. William Block and his unhappy, unfaithful, [[bisexuality|bisexual]] [[anesthesiologist]] wife, Dakota, at a local hospital.  Random attacks begin along the highway, causing El Wray, with Cherry, to crash his truck. In the aftermath, several zombies tear off Cherry's right leg. At the hospital is another victim, Tammy, the former lover of Dakota. Block recognizes her and compares [[text messages]] on Tammy's and his wife's phones, realizing Dakota was about to leave him. He then stabs Dakota's hands with her [[anesthetic]] [[hypodermic|syringe]] needles repeatedly, rendering them useless, before locking her in a closet to tend to other patients, including Cherry, who is still alive.  El Wray is detained by Sheriff Hague based on past encounters between the two. As the patients mutate, El Wray leaves the station and arrives at the hospital, attaching a wooden table leg to Cherry's stump. As El Wray and Cherry fight their way out of the zombie-infested hospital, Dakota escapes in her car, despite accidentally breaking her left wrist as her hands are still numb. Meanwhile, Block becomes infected along with others, while Cherry and El Wray take refuge at the Bone Shack.  Dakota retrieves her son Tony and takes him to her father, [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] [[Earl McGraw]]. Tony, given a [[revolver]] by his mother, accidentally shoots himself in the face after being told not to point it at himself. Cherry and El Wray make love in J.T.'s bedroom. Due to [[Planet Terror#Editing|a "missing reel"]], what happens after this is unknown; When the film returns, Sheriff Hague has been shot in the neck by one of his officers, zombies are massing outside the burning Bone Shack and El Wray's true identity is implied by Hague. Dakota, Earl, Cherry's former boss Skip, and Tony's crazed babysitter twins arrive at the Bone Shack. With Hague badly injured, the group decides to flee to the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican border]], before being stopped by a large mass of zombies. Muldoon's men arrive, killing the zombies before arresting them. Abby tells them that the soldiers are stealing the gas supply because they are infected, constant inhalation of the gas delays mutation. They also learn that a small percentage of the population is immune, suggesting a possible treatment, which is why Muldoon quarantined the survivors.  As Cherry and Dakota are taken away by two soldiers, the others defeat the security guards. J.T. sustains a gunshot wound in the process while the group searches for Muldoon. Discovered by El Wray and Abby, Muldoon explains that he killed [[Osama bin Laden]] before he and his men were infected and were ordered to protect the area. El Wray offers a respectful recognition of Muldoon's military service before he and Abby shoot the mutating Muldoon.  Meanwhile, Cherry is forced to dance by the first soldier held at gunpoint. Eventually, she breaks her wooden leg across his face and stabs him in his eye with it. Dakota, after realizing her hands have regained feeling, quick-draws her syringe launcher and stuns the second soldier. El Wray and Abby arrive to rescue Cherry and Dakota, and El Wray replaces Cherry's broken wooden leg with a modified [[M4 carbine|M4 Carbine]] with an [[M203 grenade launcher|M203]]. She promptly kills the first soldier and several zombies with it.  J.T., wounded and lying beside his dying brother, stays behind to detonate explosives to eliminate the remaining zombies while the others flee. The survivors make plans to escape by stealing [[helicopters]] but must fight past the remaining zombies. Abby dies, along with hope for a cure, when a ballistic projectile blows his head up. The survivors use the blade tips of their helicopter to kill the rest. However, while saving Cherry from a zombie, El Wray is fatally wounded. In the epilogue, Cherry, now sporting a [[minigun]] leg, leads the group and many more survivors to the [[Caribbean]] beach at [[Tulum]], where they start a peaceful new society during a world-wide zombie outbreak. It is also revealed that Cherry has given birth to El Wray's daughter (alluded to earlier during El Wray's final scene when he puts his hand on her stomach and restates his motto "I never miss").  In a [[post-credits scene]], Tony is sitting on the beach at the survivor's "base" playing with his [[turtle]], [[scorpion]] and [[tarantula]].  
Ploy
 The death of a relative brings a [[Thai American|Thai-American]] couple, Wit and Dang, back to [[Bangkok]] for the first time in many years. Arriving at Bangkok's [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]] at around 5 a.m., they check into a hotel in the city. Suffering from [[jet lag]], Dang wants to sleep, but her husband Wit is restless and heads down to the hotel bar to buy some cigarettes. While unpacking their luggage, Dang finds a small paper with a phone number of a woman named Noy, and she is immediately suspicious.  In the hotel bar, Wit meets Ploy, a young woman who says she is waiting for her mother to arrive from [[Stockholm]]. The two bond over coffee and cigarettes, and Wit then invites Ploy to come up to the hotel room, where she can take a shower and rest while she awaits her mother. Up at the room, Dang opens the door and sees Ploy. To the girl, Dang is pleasant and friendly, but to her husband, she is seething with anger and jealousy. She has bouts of suspicion, followed by hallucinations / nightmares. Fitfully, the three people try to sleep. Dang and Wit discuss their seven-year marriage, and wonder why the love has gone out of it.  Meanwhile, a hotel maid, Tum, has stolen a guest's suit from the hotel's dry cleaners. She takes it up to room 609 and hangs it in the closet. Nut, the silent, weary bartender, enters the room and puts on the suit. He then finds Tum hiding in the shower, and proceeds to kiss her and caress her, and the couple starts having a sexual relationship.  Back in Wit and Dang's room, Dang becomes more upset, and decides to leave. Wit wakes up to find Dang gone, and then he and Ploy sit and smoke cigarettes and talk about love and relationships. They discuss how married life begins to lose its sheen eventually and think of options to keep the flame lit.  Ploy eventually leaves the hotel room, when Wit falls asleep. Out of curiosity, she examines the room in which she thinks the maid and the bartender had sex. She apparently has a dream about the entire episode.  Dang finds a coffee shop, where she takes a seat with a cup of coffee and pours some [[vodka]] in it from a small bottle she took from her hotel room's [[mini-bar]]. She is noticed by Moo, who is using his laptop computer. He recognizes Dang from her days as a famous television soap opera actress and invites her back to his home for some more drinks. Dang, who has already had quite a bit to drink, eventually throws up. Moo, spikes her last drink and tries to get closer to her. When Dang turns down his advances, he attacks and rapes her, although she puts up a fight. When Dang's life is in danger, they end up playing a game of hide and seek that would end with one of them dead.  The film ends with Wit and Dang leaving Thailand, as Dang says nothing about her ugly encounter with the rapist, Moo; when Wit sees her back at the hotel, he is happy to have Dang back with him. He places his hand over Dang's in the taxi, and sincerely tells her he loves her, which she had earlier expressed longing to hear. Dang smiles, and rests her head on Wit's shoulder lovingly as they exit Thailand to return to their home in the United States.

There are three distinct stories, united only by the presence of characters from all the stories in a streetside eatery: *Jonathan, who has yet to lose his [[virginity]], is escorted around Geylang by his army buddy, Kiat, who wants to help his friend make his passage into manhood. The two men visit various brothels, where the touts bestow the various qualities and nationalities of their women, who hail from China, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, India and elsewhere. Jonathan eventually settles on a young Chinese woman whom he envisions being wrapped in a towel. *A teenage girl is called to meet an older [[prostitution|prostitute]] in a hotel room, where the older woman, Linda, is servicing a heavyset older man, who wants to take the younger girl's virginity. The girl is followed to the hotel by a young man named Chris. When she goes in the hotel room, Chris sits outside and waits. *A woman in a red dress gets in a [[convertible]] with a man. She later shows up at the streetside restaurant and pays a young [[busking|busker]] for his "special song", which he doesn't end up singing, and instead is taken back to the woman's room.  
Please Vote for Me
 An experiment in democracy is taking place in Wuhan, China. For the first time ever, the students in grade three at Evergreen Primary School in Wuhan, China have been asked to elect a class monitor. Traditionally appointed by the teacher, the class monitor holds a powerful position, helping to control the students, keeping them on task and doling out punishment to those who disobey. The teacher has chosen three candidates: Luo Lei (a boy), the current class monitor; Cheng Cheng (a boy); and Xu Xiaofei (a girl). Each candidate is asked to choose two assistants to help with his or her campaign.  To prove their worthiness, the candidates must perform in three events. First is a talent show, where each candidate plays an instrument or sings a song. Second is a debate, in which the candidates bring up the shortcomings of their opponents as well as their own personal qualifications. And finally, each candidate must deliver a speech, an opportunity to appeal directly to classmates and ask for their votes.  At home, each of the children is coached by his or her parents and pushed to practice and memorize for each stage of the campaign. Although their parents are supportive, the candidates feel the pressure. Tears and the occasional angry outburst reveal the emotional impact. At school, the candidates talk to classmates one-on-one, making promises, planning tactics (including negative ones) and at times expressing doubts about their own candidacies.  For all three children, the campaign takes its toll, especially for the losing candidates and their assistants. Viewers are left to decide if the experiment in democracy has been “successful” and what it might mean for democracy education in China. PLEASE VOTE FOR ME challenges those committed to China’s democratization to consider the feasibility of, and processes involved in its implementation.

Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai
 A scientist named Tonio is reading a [[diary]] which belonged to a famous [[architect]] named Godey, his great-grandfather, indicating that two Pokémon between their [[dimension]] are fighting, and that the battle could lead to chaos. Those future events occur at same moment as [[Palkia]], who can distort [[space]], and [[Dialga]], who rules over [[time]], are brawling, which causes the [[hourglass]] in Tonio's lab to fall and shatter.  [[Ash Ketchum|Ash]], [[Brock (Pokémon)|Brock]], and Dawn are headed to Alamos Town for the next Pokémon Contest. However, they realize that Alamos is in the middle of a giant lake. Tired, they are greeted by Alice and her [[Chimchar]], who offer them a ride in a [[hot air balloon]]. Brock [[love|falls]] for her and his [[Croagunk]] jabs him. Alice is a tour guide as well as a music student who plays the leaf whistle. On their way, the battle between the dimensions continues and causes a massive [[air current]] [[shockwave]]. After recovering from the slight air current disturbance, Alice offers a tour of the town.  Alice brings them to a [[garden]] where many Pokémon reside in peace and where Alice played at as a little girl. Ash, Brock, and Dawn let all their Pokémon free and they run off to play, which later goes from happiness to chaos. Once the Pokémon begin to quarrel, along with the grass-type Pokémon present, Alice calms them down by playing a soothing song using the leaf whistle. She reveals that she learned the song from her [[grandmother]], who appears to be deceased. Shortly after, a [[Gallade (Pokémon)|Gallade]] hops into the scene. Alice indicates that Gallade senses something wrong and the Gallade requests Ash and the rest of them to follow it. The trio recalls their Pokémon and they pursue the Gallade, ending up at a small [[temple]] with some of its pillars damaged. A man named Baron Alberto walks out of the tunnel, claiming that it was the work of [[Darkrai]]. The name Darkrai puzzles Ash and Dawn. Brock mentions that Darkrai is a Pokémon that causes [[nightmares]]. Everyone hears a noise from a nearby bush and Baron orders his [[Lickilicky]] to fire a Hyper Beam attack into the bush. However, the victim was Tonio who screams and limps out of the bush. Alice quickly hurries to Tonio's pain.  Tonio is introduced to Ash, Brock, and Dawn. Baron flirts with Alice, stating that she is to be his [[wife]]. Brock is deeply shocked, as well as the rest of them. Alice rejects and runs to Tonio claiming that [[puppy love|she likes him]], causing Tonio to [[blushing|blush]]. Just then, Darkrai rises from the ground among the thick trees. Baron orders Lickilicky to attack the Dark Pokémon. Lickilicky's attacks miss while Darkrai fires back a Dark Void attack. Lickilicky dodges the attack and the Dark Void orb impales Ash, instantly knocking him out to sleep and trapping him in a nightmare. The nightmare shows Palkia moving up to Ash and rushing towards him for an attack. This delivers Ash to a part of the garden. Ash realizes the dream is Darkrai's doing, and Darkrai appears in front of him. Ash reaches for a [[Poké Ball]] and tosses it, but it vanishes into thin air. Then, Darkrai disappears to reveal [[Pikachu]], who is about to get devoured by a [[vacuum]] hole. Ash dives into the hole to rescue Pikachu. Having failed, he and Pikachu drop into a never-ending fall. He is then awakened by Pikachu's Thunderbolt at the Pokémon Center. That night, Tonio tries to find more information about Darkrai. He reads that Darkrai had opened his heart to Alice's grandmother years ago and remains in the garden since then, with Godey watching from afar as she plays the leaf whistle. Meanwhile, Baron meets three TV people who are actually Team Rocket in disguise and decide to film Baron as he takes on Darkrai.  The next morning, Ash, Brock, and Dawn visit the Space-Time Towers, which are composed of three "Space" towers and three "Time" towers. They meet Tonio there, and they climb to the top to be introduced to a massive instrument which plays music by the hour throughout the town. Using the instrument, Dawn chooses and plays a song through the tower's bells (the "Market Theme" from the [[Legend of Zelda]] franchise). As Ash and the rest of the group leave the Space-Time Towers, a hole blasts out in the middle of the sky just above the towers, which then dies down. A massive shockwave purges through the entire town. Tonio decides to study the sudden outburst. Later, Darkrai reappears in the courtyard while Ash and company (with Baron joining along) engage in combat with it. Outraged, Darkrai fires multiple loads of Dark Void orbs, trapping many Pokémon in the town square in nightmares. Back in lab, after some intensive research, Tonio finds that the sudden outburst was when Palkia entered their dimension, but he did not know why. Ash and Baron chase Darkrai into a dark alley where the Dark Pokémon lands a direct hit on Baron's Lickilicky, causing it to doze off. Just then, Baron is turned into a Lickilicky himself due to a combination of the distorting of space and Lickilicky dreaming that he turned into his master. With that occurring, ghost-like images of the sleeping Pokémon float around town, some passing through walls, causing the situation to grow quite strange.  After all the Pokémon are in the Pokémon Center, Alamos Town gets surrounded with a massive [[fog]], which can not be cleared off and causes anything attempting to leave the town to reversibly enter the town, resulting in no possible escape. Baron still believes it was Darkrai that caused the abnormalities in the town. All the trainers follow Baron to confront Darkrai, but Ash, Brock, and Dawn do not go along listening to Tonio, who doesn't believe Darkrai is up to this. He believes Darkrai is good since he had saved Alice in their childhood. He reveals that the two of them were playing in the garden when Alice tripped and fell off a cliff. Tonio ran to her, but a [[silhouette]] of Darkrai zipped out and caught Alice just before disappearing. Hearing that, the trio now agree that it was not Darkrai who caused the havoc in the town. Tonio explains that the [[distortion]] caused from the spiritual images of the sleeping Pokémon was caused by a multidimensional disturbance from when Palkia entered the realm. Later that evening, Tonio finds Palkia resting between the towers. Darkrai, who was fighting Baron, instead tries to attack the resting Palkia. Ash then realizes that Darkrai was trying to tell him in his nightmare that the two legendary Pokémon are waging war.  As Palkia and Darkrai battle, Palkia switches the town back into its own battle dimension (the Unown Dimension where [[Unown]] live and is located between time and space). As Palkia is about to hit Darkrai with one of his attacks, Dialga opens fire on the two and immediately runs into Palkia, thus continuing the battle between the two Dragon-types. As they brawl, the entire town slowly [[dissipation|dissipates]] into nothing due to the severe injury suffered by Palkia during its battle with Dialga earlier. Darkrai constantly tries to fend them off as the town evacuates into the garden. After Tonio reads a passage from Godey's diary, Alice hears the word "Oración", which means ''Prayer'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and is the name of the song her grandmother taught her to play on the leaf whistle. Tonio indicates that "Oración is the song that could soothe even the fiercest rage". They realize that they must play Oración on the Space-Time Towers' musical instrument to stop Dialga and Palkia from feuding.   After finding the Oración music disc, Ash, Dawn, Alice and Tonio begin to head up the tower by balloon as Brock stays behind to help Nurse Joy evacuate the townspeople. On their way up, Dialga and Palkia continue their battle, with some flames striking the balloon basket, sending Ash and Dawn flying out of the balloon, but safely landing onto a platform of the tower. Dialga fires its Roar of Time attack at Palkia, while Palkia stands in front of the balloon. Palkia dodges the attack, leaving the beam to crossfire with the balloon. Darkrai instantly comes to the rescue and takes the massive blow from Dialga, causing great damage to the Dark Pokémon. Dialga and Palkia fly passed and cause heavy damage to the balloon, sending Tonio flying and ultimately causing Alice and Chimchar to evacuate the balloon. With the help of their Pokémon, Ash and Dawn travel up the tower by foot.   Dialga and Palkia continue their confrontation and are about to trigger the final blow. Tonio reveals that if the Dragon-types' signature moves collide once more, their dimension will be completely destroyed. Dialga is charging its Roar of Time attack while Palkia charges its Spacial Rend attack. At Alice's cries to the Legendary Pokémon to stop fighting, Darkrai recovers from its injuries and rushes to help. When both the Legendary Pokémon discharge their attacks, Darkrai crosses the attacks' line and forms a sphere around itself to block the attacks, engulfing and immobilizing Dialga and Palkia in the process. Baron, who had already turned back to himself due to his Lickilicky's awakening, then finally believes Darkrai is not the foe. As Ash and Dawn make their way up the tower, they watch as Darkrai's sphere gets weaker and eventually shrinks, causing Dialga and Palkia to break free. The Dragon-types, fed up with the Dark Pokémon intervening with their battle, shoot Darkrai from both sides. Having almost no armor or the energy left, Darkrai bravely takes the destructive blow and disintegrates into the air. Everyone looks on with the fear that they too would suffer the same fate as Darkrai.  Ash and Dawn reach the top of the tower and run to the musical instrument, only to find that the electrical power source is down. Ash's Pikachu uses Thunderbolt at full-blast and Dawn's [[Pachirisu]] uses Discharge to get the machine running. The song plays throughout the town. The towers glow. Each of the six towers to unveil their hidden features added by Godey, including blooming flowers and gigantic golden wings. The song successfully calms the Legendary Pokémon down. Dialga flies away, and Palkia's wound heals and Ash and Dawn successfully plead to Palkia to restore the lost parts of the town, returning Alamos Town to how it originally was, and the townspeople and Pokémon rejoice and return home.  Later, the band mourns the loss of Darkrai thanks him for his efforts. Ash and Dawn begin to cry, believing they will never see Darkrai again. As they walk away, Ash stops as he sees a shadow on the cliffside. He, along with everyone else, looks back at the cliff. On the Space-Time Towers, they find Darkrai standing heroically on top. Everyone is relieved that he is safe and Alice cuddles next to Tonio as they look on at Darkrai, who then glares with a lit up eye, as the film quickly fades.  The end credits present the aftermath, such as the Pokémon contest which Dawn competes in, and Dialga hovering towards its next destination, awaiting a battle, foreshadowing [[Giratina and the Sky Warrior|future adventures]] to come of Ash, Dawn, and Brock.  
Pokkiri
 The city of [[Chennai]] is rife with the nefarious activities of [[land mafia]]. There are two rival gangs; one under Ali Bhai ([[Prakash Raj]]), who resides in [[Dubai]] and controls his India operations through his brothers Guru ([[Vincent Asokan]]) and Logu ([[Subbaraju]]) as well as his girlfriend Mona ([[Brinda Parekh]]); and another operated by a local goon Narasimhan ([[Anandaraj]]). They threaten builders and land owners into giving them protection money or property, through force, extortion or murder. Mohammed Maideen Khan ([[Napoleon (actor)|Napoleon]]) takes charge as the new Police Commissioner of Chennai and starts cracking down on crime.  Tamil ([[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]]), a thug, is abducted by Logu and his henchmen. Tamil has taken a contract from Narasimhan to beat up Logu, which he does. However, Guru and Mona invite Tamil to join their gang. Tamil declines stating that he does not work for any gang, but is ready to do anything given enough money. Meanwhile, Tamil falls in love with Shruthi ([[Asin]]), when he visits his friend Saravanan's ([[Sreeman]]) aerobics class, but she mistakes him for a thug. Shruthi, a college student, lives with her widowed mother Lakshmi ([[Sriranjini (Tamil actress)|Sriranjani]]) and younger brother Pappu ([[Master Bharath]]). Body Soda ([[Vadivelu]]), a bogus [[Kung Fu]] master, lives above Shruthi's house and frequently, albeit comically and unsuccessfully, tries to convince Shruthi to marry him. Inspector Govindan ([[Mukesh Tiwari]]) is a corrupt police inspector in the colony where Tamil and Shruthi live and is on the payroll of Ali Bhai. He lusts for Shruthi and decides to make her his [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], even after she rejects him multiple times.  Tamil's first assignment with Ali Bhai's gang is to kill a member of Narasimhan's gang. However, police show up at the spot where Tamil and the other gangsters are waiting. Tamil engages the cops long enough for the others to finish the task and flee. He also helps Shruthi escape from Govindan. She is impressed by his kindness and a friendship soon blossoms between the two, leading to the development of unspoken romantic feelings for each other. When Shruthi tries to express her feelings to Tamil, they are attacked by members of Narasimhan's gang, whom Tamil finishes off. Shruthi is shocked to learn that Tamil is a gangster with no qualms about killing people.  Later, Govindan arranges for some thugs to pretend to rape Shruthi, so that no decent family will want to take her as their daughter-in-law, as a result of which with no other option Shruthi and Lakshmi will accept his demands. Tamil learns of this and thrashes Govindan incognito. After much ado and mental anguish, Shruthi accepts Tamil's love.  Soon, Guru is found dead, presumably killed by Narasimhan in retaliation against the death of his gang members at the hands of Tamil earlier, which forces Ali Bhai to come to Chennai and kill Narasimhan. He also meets Tamil to discuss the killing of a minister by blowing up a school. Tamil disagrees with Ali Bhai's method as it would involve killing innocents including women and children. In the middle of their argument, the police raid the club and arrest Ali Bhai. His gang members retaliate by kidnapping Mohammed's daughter, drugging her and creating a lewd video of her which they threaten to release to the media if Ali Bhai is not released, forcing the embattled commissioner to release Ali Bhai. In her drugged state, Mohammed's daughter also reveals that Mohammed had placed a mole in Ali Bhai's gang. The gang members find out that a police officer by the name of Satyamoorthy, the son of a retired police inspector Shanmugavel ([[Nassar]]), has gone undercover to finish off the underworld mafia gangs and is now a part of their gang. Ali Bhai kills Satyamoorthy in front of Shanmugavel. However, it is revealed that the person who died was actually Saravanan, who was Shanmugavel's adopted son. Ali Bhai then kills Shanmugavel, hoping that the real Satyamoorthy would come to see his father's body and avenge his death. When the real Satyamoorthy actually turns up, everyone, especially Shruthi and Govindan, are shocked to see that he is revealed to be Tamil.  After the funerals of Shanmugavel and Saravanan, Satyamoorthy forces Govindan to call Ali Bhai to find out his location, which is Binny Mills. He goes there and starts to dispatch Ali Bhai's men one by one, rescuing the commissioner's daughter in the process. In a final confrontation, Satyamoorthy kills Ali Bhai by slashing his throat with a broken glass window, following which he utilizes his own gun and kills Govindan also.  
Polladhavan (2007 film)
 Prabhu ([[Dhanush]]) is a happy-go-lucky middle-class family guy who spends time playing [[carrom]] in the streets with his friends Sathish ([[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]]) and Kumar ([[Karunas]]). He and his father ([[Murali (Malayalam actor)|Murali]]) keep falling into minor misunderstandings, and he indulges in a hopeless romance with a strange girl Hema ([[Divya Spandana]]), who he meets at a bus stop. When he is caught in the act of stealing a pittance from his father for booze with his friends, Prabhu questions his father’s responsibility towards his upbringing. His angry father gives Prabhu some of his savings and tells him to do something with his life. Prabhu purchases a Bajaj Pulsar bike instead and finds a job. The bike eventually saves his life from a freak incident and gets lost, subjecting him to interminable anguish as he searches for his bike. When his family members asks him about his bike, he tells them that he has given it for dealer service.  Prabhu comes into conflict with the underworld when he witnesses a brutal murder planned by a gang in Kasimedu in North Chennai by a smuggling don Selvam ([[Kishore (actor)|Kishore]]) and his accomplices. Prabhu finds out that his bike was stolen by a petty bike thief who turns out to be in connection with Selvam's younger brother Ravi ([[Daniel Balaji]]). Prabhu traces down the culprit as [[Sendrayan]] and hands him over to the local police station. A formal complaint is lodged on Sendrayan on the same night. Later that night, Prabhu confesses to his family that his bike was stolen. His family is very upset with him due to his irresponsible behavior. The next morning, Ravi visits Prabhu's residence and threatens him to withdraw the complaint against Sendrayan. When Prabhu refuses, a fight breaks between Prabhu and Ravi, where Ravi is joined by few of his accomplices, but Prabhu manages to fight them all and leaves Ravi beaten and embarrassed among the public. Selvam returns home in bail after a murder charge. When he finds out what happened to Ravi, he gets furious and sends his henchmen to kill Prabhu without knowing the reason for his brother's embarrassment. Meanwhile, Prabhu and Kumar meets Selvam at his own residence in [[Kasimedu]]. Ravi is not home at that time. Prabhu tells the truth to Selvam, but refuses to believe that his brother Ravi and his men stole his bike. After hearing from his close ally Out ([[Pawan (actor)|Pawan]]), Selvam believes Prabhu, apologizing for what happened and promises Prabhu that he will do whatever he can to get his bike back, but it was too late for Prabhu's father, who receives the attack from Ravi's men. He was admitted in a hospital, and Prabhu breaks down after knowing that his father may never walk again after his right leg is paralyzed by the attack. Selvam, Ravi, and their men visit Prabhu to condole and apologize for what happened this time. Prabhu turns down the apology and again an immediate fight was about to break between Prabhu and Ravi before Selvam separates them both. Although he wants to stay away, Prabhu invariably gets dragged into rubbing shoulders with the criminals who now target his family to seek revenge.  Prabhu's bike was caught by Anti-Narcotics wing police and they nab Prabhu, suspecting him of [[drug smuggling]] in his bike. They release him after Prabhu tells them that his bike was stolen and shows them his FIR copy. But he doesn't tell them about Ravi or Selvam. Now Prabhu learns that his bike was stolen by Selvam's men to escape from a murder scene, but it was Ravi who smuggled drugs in his bike's petrol tank. Prabhu loses his job as an employee in his workplace since his bike was a source of transport, and as he was kept at police custody for one night. Prabhu also gets despair from Hema's father for being involved unwillingly with Selvam's men. Ravi makes one more attempt at Prabhu's life, but he was snubbed again by Prabhu. Selvam becomes unhappy about this and warns him to quit smuggling if he ever gets in Prabhu's business anymore.

Poor Boy's Game
 Donnie Rose ([[Rossif Sutherland]]) plays a former boxer who is released from prison after serving time for a vicious assault on a Black teen that left the teen physically and mentally disabled. The beating of the teen sparked outrage and further divided the historically segregated city of [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax.]] Upon his release from prison, he is surprised by a hero's  'welcome home' party at his brother Keith Rose's ( [[Greg Bryk]]) house and other members of the White community in Halifax. While at the party Donnie is confronted by the victim's father George Carvery (Danny Glover) who is holding a gun contemplating shooting Donnie to avenge the assault of his son. After a tense, heated exchange between George and Keith who is wielding a baseball bat, Donnie tells George "Just do what you came here to do" . After contemplating for a few moments George returns to his car and drives back to his mostly [[Black Nova Scotians|African Nova Scotian]] [[North End, Halifax|North End Halifax]]- area home. At this time, we get the first glance at his family, his wife Ruth Carvery ([[Tonya Lee Williams|Tanya Lee Williams]]) and his mentally and [[physically challenged]] son Charles ([[K. C. Collins]]). The condition of Charles has an obvious strain on their marriage, as just the sight of Charles condition forces them to come to grips that he will never again lead a 'normal life'.  The release of Donnie from prison is much to the chagrin of members of the Black community in Halifax. Ossie Parris ([[Flex Alexander]]) a famous boxing champion challenges Donnie to a fight in the hopes of seeking retribution for the vicious attack that left Charles disabled, offer him $20,000 to participate in the prize fight. Knowing that Ossie will use the opportunity to murder Donnie in the ring, George offers to train Donnie in order from keeping him from being killed. Later in the movie members of the Black community attempt to enter a night club which has an unofficial policy of not allowing Blacks to enter. The clubs security force which is headed by Keith, Donnie and other members of the White community, refuse entry to the Black would be party goers. A fight at the club's entrance ensues with gunfire breaking out and a car being lit on fire (the scene is to resemble the Halifax race riot in 1991 in which over 150 Black and White  clashed outside a downtown Halifax bar, after Black men were continually being denied entry in local bar establishments due to their race). Looking for further retribution Keith's crew burned down the Black community church. Members of Ossie's crew then kidnap and savagely beat Keith to death, leaving him at the same location where the beating of Charles took place years earlier. Donnie then goes to the Halifax Black Baptist Church during Sunday congregation to kill the culprits, but then leaves the church, instead deciding to turn in the suspects. Days before the fight Donnie and George meet at the same place where both their loved ones suffered brutal attacks, and they share a deep moment that put the film in perspective. George explains that he has a resenting hate in heart from all his years of struggle, and tells Donnie that he has the same hate in his heart and he must let it go. It is then that it was revealed that it was, in fact Keith that brutally beat Charles, and that he only confessed because he was a minor and would have served less time than his brother.  On fight night Donnie enters the ring to a chorus of boos from the crowd. The fight goes back and forth between both fighters landing decisive blows. With George and his family in attendance, Charles suffers an 'episode' and climbs in the ring, causing an already agitated crowd to throw chairs and enter the ring themselves. A riot breaks out in which both Ossie and Donnie fight off crazed fight fans. The fight is subsequently forfeited and Donnie hangs up his gloves to symbolize the giving up of his hate.

June 24, 2006.</ref><ref name="Curve" />  A popular locally produced children's television show, ''Happy Herb & Froggy Doo,'' features magician Happy Herb (Henry Winkler) and his wisecracking marionette sidekick, Froggy Doo. Froggy Doo is stolen and held for ransom, and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) is called in to investigate. Elliott Plumm (Chris Massoglia) used to watch the show, but now feels he is too grown up to do so any longer. His five-year-old brother, Rocky, is a ''Froggy Doo'' fan, however. Their father, Mick Plumm (William Baldwin), is a recovering alcoholic and unemployed ex-[[boxing|boxer]] who believes Elliott's birth prevented him from going to the [[Olympic Games]] 12 years earlier. Mick's emotionally distant relationship with Elliott is causing Elliott to become emotionally troubled. Their mother, Roxie Plumm (Lisa Guerrero), is the only breadwinner in the family, and keeping her husband sober and attending to her job means she has little time for her children.  Elliott shows little interest in the kidnapping. Shortly thereafter, however, Haley Dubois (Morgan Flynn) and her father arrive in their run-down mobile home and move in next door. Haley's father is the new deputy sheriff in town, and Haley is entranced by the mystery surrounding the kidnapping of Froggy Doo. Elliott quickly begins to fall in love with Haley, and soon he agrees to help Haley and Rocky find Froggy Doo in order to win Haley's heart. The three kids have to find the marionette before the two bumbling FBI agents, Hardigan (Peter Scolari) and Brinkman (Rick Overton) can do so. Elliott, Haley, and Rocky's list of suspects include the local bully, a store clerk, and Happy Herb's wife Viv (Brenda Strong). As the kids pursue the case, Elliott and Rocky's brotherly bond strengthens, and Elliott realizes he might not only win back the love of his father but provide his family with the substantial reward money and help his parents' marriage, too.

The Pope's Toilet
 It is 1988, and [[Melo, Uruguay|Melo]], a [[Uruguay]]an town on the Brazilian border, awaits the visit of Pope [[John Paul II]]. Numbers begin circulating: hundreds of people will come,  thousands say the media. To the poor citizens of Melo this means  pilgrims in need of food and drink, paper flags, souvenirs, and commemorative medals. Brimming with enthusiasm, the locals hope not only for divine blessing but also a small share of material happiness. Petty smuggler Beto is certain that he’s found the best business idea of all: "The Pope’s Toilet", where the thousands of visiting pilgrims can find relief.  Beto is thwarted by lack of funds and the local mobile customs enforcement officer. Ultimately the promised "60,000 to 200,000" Brazilians do not materialise. Apparently (in the film's postscript) only 400 Brazilians came, disproportionately served by 387 stalls for food and trinkets. The film makes it clear that the visit was a financial disaster to the town rather than bringing any wealth as promised. Beto has spent his daughter's college fund to no avail, but she forgives him, and at least he has a nice toilet.  Regardless of the claims made in the film's postscript committed to uphold a good sense of humor at all costs, international media reported the Pope's open-air mass in the town of Melo with 39,000 inhabitants was attended by a crowd of about 50,000 people.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

Postal (film)
 The film begins with a prologue, showing Asif and Nabi, a fictional portrayal of two of the Flight 11 hijackers during the 9/11 attacks, debating about the amount of virgins they get as a reward for carrying out the attacks. After a long debate, they decide to call Osama bin Laden, their leader, to find out the exact amount. Osama tells them that there "are not enough virgins to go around", and upon hearing this, the two hijackers abandon the attack in dismay and happily change their flight path to the Bahamas. At this moment, however, the passengers of the plane storm the cockpit and attempt to retake the plane (this was based on what happened on Flight 93, one of the other hijacked aircraft during 9/11). In the struggle, the terrorists try and reason with the passengers, but to no avail, and ultimately, the plane inadvertently flies into the North tower of the World Trade Center.  The film skips forward five years later, taking place in the town of [[Paradise, Arizona]] (a [[ghost town]] in real life), where the volatile [[The Postal Dude|Postal Dude]], after being mocked at a job interview, kicked out of his local unemployment office and discovering that his morbidly obese wife is cheating on him with various and skinny townsmen, is more than a little angry and is desperate to get enough cash to finally leave his dead-end town. He decides to team up with his [[David Koresh|Uncle Dave]], a slovenly [[con artist]] turned [[doomsday cult]] leader who owes the US government over a million dollars in back-taxes. With the help of Uncle Dave's right-hand man Richie and an army of big-breasted, scantily clad cult members, the Dude devises a plan to hijack a shipment of 2,000 Krotchy Dolls, a rare, sought-after plush toy resembling a giant scrotum. Uncle Dave plans to sell them online, where their prices have reached as high as $4,000 a doll.  Unbeknownst to them, [[Osama bin Laden]] and his group of [[Al-Qaeda]] [[Terrorism|terrorists]], who had been secretly hiding in Paradise since [[September 11 attacks|September 11]], under the watchful eye of bin Laden's best friend [[George W. Bush]], are after the same shipment, but for entirely different reasons. Hoping to outdo the catastrophe of 9/11, they plan to instill the dolls with [[Avian influenza]] and distribute them to unsuspecting American children. The two groups meet at the shipment's destination, German-themed [[amusement park]] Little Germany. A fight between ''Postal'' creator Vince Desi and ''Postal'' director and park owner [[Uwe Boll]] (which ends with Boll being shot in the genitals, confessing "I hate video games"), sparks a massive shootout between the cult, the terrorists and the police, resulting in the deaths of dozens of innocent children. The Dude and the cult are able to get away with both the shipment and the park's opening day guest, [[Verne Troyer]], pursued by Al-Qaeda, the police and a mob of angry citizens.  Upon returning to their compound, which has been overtaken by the terrorists, the Dude, Uncle Dave and the rest covertly sneak into the compound's underground bunker, where Richie reveals that he must now fulfill the prophecy foretold in Uncle Dave's fictional [[Bible]]: to bring about the extinction of the human race. As per Uncle Dave's Bible, the event initiating the apocalypse is the rape of a "tiny entertainer" by a thousand monkeys. After Verne Troyer is quickly thrown into a pit of chimpanzees, Richie shoots and kills Uncle Dave, then imprisons the Dude. The Dude manages to escape the compound with a plethora of weapons, deciding to wage a one-man war against al-Qaeda, his uncle's murderer, his cheating wife, the police and the many people who want him dead. On the way to his trailer (where he plans to blow up his spouse), he meets up with an attractive young barista, Faith, who joins forces with him after an explosive gunfight followed later by the Dude's heartfelt but futile monologue about war. The two of them then proceed to kill all the terrorists, all the bloodthirsty townspeople, the remains of the now-mad cult, his wife, and her multiple lovers. In the midst of the shootout, bin Laden is wounded but escapes to a payphone, where he calls Bush for help. Bush sends a helicopter to save him and plans for the two to rendezvous.  Having won their war, the Dude, his dog Champ and the barista drive away in a stolen police car. They casually turn on the radio, only to learn that Bush has blamed the day's shootouts and explosions on China and Pakistan, and has been "forced to destroy both countries with extreme nuclear force". The United States then launches thirty [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear missiles]] at China and Pakistan each. In retaliation China and Pakistan launch thirty nuclear missiles each as well towards America, all missiles are scheduled to hit their targets in under two minutes.  The film's final shot features Bush and bin Laden skipping through a field together, hand-in-hand. As [[mushroom cloud]]s explode on the horizon, bin Laden laughs and says, "Georgie, [[Casablanca (film)|I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship]]". At that moment, all of the nuclear missiles hit, and the country, and possibly the world is destroyed.

The Poughkeepsie Tapes
 When police raid a house in a city north of New York, they discover a profoundly disturbing record of one man's ugly crimes. Investigators find over 800 videotapes shot by the killer which present a visual record of his murders in all their horrifying details. Both state and federal law enforcement teams sift through the gruesome images, looking for clues of his identity, the identity of his victims, and where he could have gone. Repeated viewings of the materials reveal little beyond the terrible facts of the crimes, and as the authorities comb through the madman's images, they find the tapes have had a disquieting effect on them.  The killer not only captures the murders themselves, but the abductions, tortures and postmortem mutilations of his victims (along with bizarre [[Balloon fetish|fetishes involving balloons]]) all the while never allowing himself to be shown on film unless entirely disguised. Because the killer numbered the video tapes in order, investigators are able to determine that he started with the most vulnerable of victims: an 8-year-old named Jennifer Gorman is abducted while playing in her front yard.  After the success of his first abduction and murder, the killer becomes less impulsive in his crimes. Carefully selecting the area in which he will strike next, he convinces a couple, the Andersons, that his car has broken down and they agree to give him a ride to a local gas station for aid. On the way, he clubs the male in the head and subdues the female using a cloth doused in a chemical solution while filming her face in close up. Investigators understand this would have taken considerable practice to achieve. The tape shows that the killer performed a C-section on the female, placing the severed head of her husband inside her womb before sewing her up again to later rouse her from unconsciousness and film her reaction. In the process of investigating the Andersons' disappearance, they come to realise the level of mutilation the killer is capable of, as well as his degree of premeditation. The killer made himself known in the CCTV footage of another gas station some time before the Andersons' abduction and murder, using sign language to give clues where he intends to dispose of one of the bodies.  It is then shown that the killer is stalking his next victim, the teenage Cheryl Dempsey. Taking advantage that she is alone he enters her home, secretly walking through the house. After her boyfriend, Tim Surrey arrives, the murderer places the camera where it cannot be seen and hides in a closet until he is ready to attack. Although he abducts Cheryl, he murders and mutilates Tim, leaving his corpse at the scene. It is only after the discovery of the tapes it becomes clear that this crime scene has been carefully arranged in order to obscure possible psychological profiling. Rather than killing Cheryl, he imprisons her in his basement, abusing her sexually, physically and psychologically as his "slave", a name he beats her into accepting as her new one. Cheryl's mother, Victoria Dempsey, appeals to her kidnapper in a televised statement. He then goes to see her, offering to help in finding Cheryl while filming her response. It dawns on Victoria that she is confronted with the man that has abducted her daughter; he merely chuckles and runs away while she is paralyzed with shock.  At this point the killer changes his modus operandi and begins targeting prostitutes while posing as a police officer. Because of the location in which he dumps the bodies and the level of mutilation they have suffered, the press now dub him "The Water Street Butcher". Forensic investigations discover several of the bodies are found to have the same sperm secretions. Using Ted Bundy's advice on a previous series of murders, authorities come to realize that the killer might indulge in necrophilia with his victims and should stake out areas where they find "fresh bodies" instead of making the discovery public. Investigating one of the victims' apartments, police find fingerprints and saliva on an unwashed glass leading them to arrest former police officer James Foley. Because Foley has a history of visiting prostitutes, no alibi on the dates of the abductions, various evidence found within Foley's car, eye witness statements and matching sperm samples, he is convicted as The Water Street Butcher. Foley continues to plead his innocence and refuses to make any deals. A few days after James' execution by lethal injection, one of the leading investigators finds a map in his mailbox letting him know they have "missed one" and the location of a new body. It becomes clear that the real killer had taken James Foley's sperm from a fertility clinic and meticulously framed him (making James Foley another of his victims by proxy). Foley is exonerated of the murders on September 12. Because of the close date to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]], this goes unrecognized by the general public.  Eventually, Cheryl Dempsey is discovered in the killer's empty house. She is rescued but is severely and irreversibly psychologically damaged from her ordeal. She has been mentally abused to such an extent that she harms herself in secret. In an interview, she [[Stockholm syndrome|identifies with her captor]] and defends him, saying that he loved her and will come back for her. It is revealed that shortly after the interview, she commits suicide.  In one last glimpse of the killer's sadistic nature, after the credits, a clip is shown of the face of one of his bound victims in close up. The killer taunts her by saying that he will make her a deal: he will release her unharmed if she does not blink. After a period of prolonged [[hyperventilation]], the film ends as her eyes close.

Due to that, her photos appear on the newspaper, since that moment they would have to run away.  Hidden places, false disguises and names are the daily life of The Girl, the narrator of the story. Alongside her cousin (''Teo''), they re-live the adventures of their guerrilla parents, building up a labyrinth with superheroes and strategies, in which nobody knows where the reality (or madness) begins. However, this children's game does not hide the deaths, tortures, denunciations and treason within the guerrillas.

Prarambha
 The story of the film begins when Puttaswamy ([[Prabhu Deva]]), a truck driver, arrives at his place in [[Mysore]]. Puttaswamy discovers a little boy Kittu (Skandha) in the back of his truck. Kittu is on a journey to find his mother ([[Anu Prabhakar]]), who left him upon discovering that she was HIV positive.  The next scene involves a [[call-girl]] (played by [[Ramya]]) trying to approach Puttaswamy, but he declines her invitation and says he has stopped indulging these days. Meanwhile, she gets troubled by a thug ([[Sadhu Kokila]]), a pimp who demands money from her. When Puttaswamy tries to stop the thug, he gets thrashed by him. Suddenly a cop (Jai Jagdeesh) arrives at the place and harasses Puttaswamy for the happenings. Kittu saves him by pretending Puttaswamy is his dad, so Puttaswamy agrees to help the boy find his home. Later, he takes the boy to his home. He discovers that the lady in the house (Chitra Shenoy) is not Kittu's mother, and learns from her that Kittu's mother has been admitted to hospital. Immediately he rushes to the hospital. It turns out the mother is dying of AIDS and doesn't want to face her son.

Prey (2007 film)
 Tom Newman, a hydro-electrical engineer, arrives in [[Africa]] with his family to help build a dam. His daughter, Jessica, isn't getting along with her stepmother, Amy, because she is not happy about her parents divorce. The next morning, Amy, Jessica and her brother David go on a game drive with Brian, a ranger, while Tom goes to the dam. While driving off-road, David asks the ranger to stop the jeep because he has to defecate. Brian grabs his rifle and escorts David to a nearby tree. They encounter two lionesses, backed by a [[African Lion|lion]] behind them. One lioness attacks and David runs back to the car, where Brian sacrifices himself to save the others. The keys lost, Amy, Jessica, and David are trapped in the car and stalked by the lions, who devour Brian.  Back at the lodge, Tom is informed of his family's disappearance, and attempts to contact Crawford, a professional hunter and guide, at the suggestion of the park rangers. Crawford refuses to help him, as he is a big five hunt guide, not a leader of search parties. The next day, after not being able to accompany the rangers in the air, Tom goes to see Crawford, and manages to hire his services at the latter's own price. Back in the car, David spots Brian's keys, and Amy retrieves them, only to wreck the truck when she drives the wrong way. Crawford and Tom look for signs of them while checking in on the rangers trail periodically, but the rain the previous night has washed away any tracks. When the rangers fly by without noticing them, Jessica gets out and tries to draw their attention. She fails and, along with Amy, is attacked by one lioness, which is killed by two native hunters.  Amy and Jessica manage to sign well enough to convince the hunters that they need water, and one leads Jessica to a watering hole nearby. They hear a gunshot and rush back, where the second hunter had been attacked and killed off-screen by the remaining pride members. The first goes to find his friend, and Jessica provides Amy and David with water.  Tom and Crawford locate lion dung, which indicates that it had eaten and was far away, before setting up camp. After dark, Tom and Crawford discuss lions at the fire, and Amy and Jessica discuss how she met Tom back in the car. The hunter comes back and is killed when the lion smashes through the window and drags him out. The next day, Amy, Jessica, and David resolve to survive with what they have and list what that is, and Crawford and Tom find the bones of one of the pride's previous victims.  Crawford and Tom's trail goes cold and he says they'll pitch and start west tomorrow, with Tom disagreeing. Amy gets out of the car, having heard Crawford's car, and begins to call out. Crawford and Tom run to the top of the hill. Crawford senses something is wrong, but Tom rushes down ahead of him, and is confronted by the last lioness. Before she can kill him, Crawford shoots the lioness through the heart. Tom makes it to the car, but on his way up, Crawford is attacked and killed by the lion. Tom crawls under the car and Amy breaks open the gas tank, telling Tom, Jessica, and David to run when she says so. Amy draws the lion's attention, and they dash for a tree as it jumps into the car. Amy lights a cloth fuse with her lighter and causes the truck to explode and kill the lion. Tom believes Amy is dead, but she appears beside the fire, and they all head back to Crawford's car to return to the lodge as the camera focuses on the savannah grass.  
Primeval (film)
   In [[Burundi]], a [[British people|British]] [[forensic anthropologist]] is examining the corpses in a [[mass grave]], claiming they were all killed in an identical manner. When the woman digs her shovel into what she believes is another grave, an unseen creature attacks, and violently drags her into the river. The [[United Nations|UN]] soldiers accompanying her fire into the water, but only her partially devoured corpse floats to the surface, before being devoured.  In a [[New York City]] newsroom, television journalist Tim Manfrey ([[Dominic Purcell]]) is assigned by his boss, Roger ([[Patrick Lyster]]), to travel to Burundi with Aviva Masters ([[Brooke Langton]]), a reporter who deals with animal stories and has become interested in [[Gustave (crocodile)|Gustave]], a gigantic, fierce crocodile known to have killed hundreds of people in Africa, over the years. With the killing of the anthropologist, Gustave is suddenly a story of interest to the world. Tim doesn't want to go, knowing that Burundi is a war zone, but he has little choice, since one of his stories turns out to have been based on falsified evidence. Tim and Aviva are accompanied to Burundi by Tim's cameraman and friend, Steven Johnson ([[Orlando Jones]]) and [[herpetologist]] Matt Collins ([[Gideon Emery]]), who is intent on capturing Gustave alive.  At the airport in [[Bujumbura]] they are met by a government official nicknamed Harry ([[Dumisani Mbebe]]), who tries to delay their departure by warning them of unrest in the bush, caused by a dangerous [[warlord]] who has nicknamed himself "Little Gustave." Tim manages to overrule Harry by faking a call to Roger, and the team departs the next day, accompanied by two soldiers. When the party reach the village where the last attack occurred, they meet their guide, a licensed hunter named Jacob ([[Jürgen Prochnow]]), and are blessed by the local shaman. The friendly villagers later assemble a steel cage in order to capture the crocodile and take it to a nearby swamp. The first attempt to capture Gustave, by placing a goat as bait, fails, but Matt manages to shoot a tracking dart into it.  In the next attempt, Jojo ([[Gabriel Malema]]), a teenage villager who helped set up the cage, uses himself as live bait to capture Gustave. The beast arrives, and tries to devour him, but disappears, as Tim, Matt, and Steven race to rescue him. Meanwhile, Aviva catches one of the soldier escorts stealing money from a tent. The soldier knocks her down and attempts to rape her, but Gustave arrives and kills him. Aviva escapes unharmed, and catches up with the others. The remaining guard relays over his radio that the Americans videotaped the shaman's execution. Just as the group realizes that the soldiers work for Little Gustave, the remaining guards, believing Jacob videotaped the evidence, wounds him; Jojo intervenes, and shoots them. While Jacob's wound is being treated, Gustave attacks the group. Jacob recalls the story of how his wife, Ona, was killed by Gustave, and that he swore revenge. Jacob produces a grenade, and detonates it as Gustave grabs him in his jaws, and devours him, but the explosion fails to kill the crocodile.  The next day, a helicopter arrives to airlift the survivors, but a truck arrives with two of Little Gustave's men, who fire a rocket at the helicopter. The group ducks, except for Matt, who runs after the helicopter to stop it from flying away. Matt is rammed by the truck and shot to death by the younger of the two militia members, a teenager performing what is clearly his first execution. When the driver of the truck notices the rest of the group, Tim yells for them to split up. In the ensuing chase, both of Little Gustave's men are killed: when the truck crashes into the river, the teenager is thrown out and dies on impact, while the driver is shot by Aviva when he tries to strangle Tim to death.  Steven stumbles upon Gustave and struggles to escape. While Aviva stays with the injured Jojo, Tim goes to look for Steven, but finds only his camera. As they are waiting for help, Tim remarks to Aviva that he now understands the shaman's earlier words that "we make our own monsters." Matt had earlier told the group that crocodiles frequently feed on [[carrion]], and there is no limit to how large they can grow, given enough sustenance; it is the bodies from the civil war, floating in the river, that have given Gustave a taste for human flesh, and allowed him to reach such a gargantuan size, as the years go by.  Harry arrives in a [[Range Rover#Second generation|Range Rover]], but Tim realizes that he is actually Little Gustave upon discovering the shaman's necklace in his possession, who wants the video evidence. Tim attempts to trick Harry by giving him the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] tracker linked to the dart on Gustave, saying it will locate the computer with the video. Harry forces Tim and Aviva to lead them to the "computer." While Harry holds Aviva at gunpoint, Tim and one of Harry's men follow the tracking signal to Gustave's lair, where the crocodile is sleeping. Tim finds Steven's mutilated body, and a combat knife in the scattered human remains, and stabs the guard. At the same moment, Aviva splatters Harry with Matt's container of crocodile [[pheromone]]s and runs. Gustave wakes up but catches the scent of the pheromones, ignoring Tim and Aviva in favor of devouring Harry.  Tim, Jojo and Aviva climb into the Range Rover, but Gustave attacks through the rear window. Tim stabs the crocodile in the mouth with a [[machete]]. It then roars in defeat, as the others manage to escape. Tim, Aviva, Jojo, and Wiley receive medical treatment and fly back home to America, watching leftover footage of Steven on his camera. The end credits state that the [[Burundian Civil War]] ended with a [[ceasefire]] in 2005, but Gustave is very much alive and still killing people in the Rusizi River of Burundi.

Throughout their struggles in and out of the swimming pool, Jim and Elston encourage and mentor the kids, helping them not only to become successful at swimming but also in their struggles against prejudice, crime, and poverty.  
Probhu Nosto Ho Jai
  The movie in its entirety is shot in retrospect with the father, Anupam Chaudhury, being placed at the beginning of the movie to talk about his intense and sexual relationship with his daughter Jhilmil's friend, Maithrayee. The scene then switches to the event that Anupam was talking about as the scene involves Maithrayee getting intimate with Jhilmil's father, Anupam, in his bedroom and Maithrayee revealing that she came from a divorced family and that she has a strained relationship with her mother. As they get intimate, Maithrayee says that she is in love with him and begs him to love her back. Maithrayee also confronts Anupam about him being the ghost writer for his wife, Aaloklata's novels and poems and questions the reason behind choosing to do so. As the movie progresses, Maithrayee confesses that she presumed Anupam to be the cook of the household when she had made a move on him but continued to indulge even after she discovered that he's the father of her friend Jhilmil.  Meanwhile, Aaloklata, Anupam's wife, receives a call from one of her publishers and is asked to write a novel that should be explicit and raw unlike the previous novels that are poetic and conventional in nature. But when Aaloklata brought this up with her husband, he refused to write such a novel. Driven by anger, Aaloklata informs her husband, the next day, that she would be inviting one of the publishers Moinak Mitra from Mitra and Ghosh Publishers over for dinner and drinks. After Moinak came over, she got him drunk and insisted that he have dinner and spend the night and ordered Anupam to get the guest room ready. After Moinak retired to his room, Aaloklata sneaked in later at night and slept with him. The following morning when Anupam entered his room with tea and biscuits, guilt-ridden Moinak could not tolerate Anupam's unconditional hospitality and indirectly confessed what he did to Anupam. Completely unperturbed after listening to everything, Anupam asked him to freshen up and get read for breakfast before he decided to leave.  The plot intensifies as Jhilmil tells Maithrayee that she is four months pregnant and that her political science professor, Dr. Suprathik Dhar who is married with children, is the father. Maithrayee then suggests an abortion but Jhilmil refuses to get one done because it is her first baby and she wishes to keep it. Maithrayee urges Jhilmil to confront her parents about the matter. Maithrayee, in turn, reveals about her feelings towards Jhilmil's father to Jhilmil and tells her that she has fallen in love with him. Jhilmil's reaction was shock which later transpired to acceptance. As Jhilmil anticipated, her mother, Aaloklata, does not take it well when she told her about the pregnancy and Jhilmil's mother said that she deserves it as she will at least learn her lesson in this way and then later on tells her that she needs to get the baby aborted since she cannot afford to have her name tarnished because of such a scandal but Jhilmil refuses and they get into an argument. On the contrary, when Jhilmil and Maithrayee approached Anupam about the issue, he simply offered his support and said that Jhilmil will have to be a single parent but he wouldn't abandon her side. Jhilmil, surprised and happy at the reassurance, mentioned to him that Maithrayee is in love with him and then exits the scene to give them privacy.  The plot further intensifies as Anupam and Maithrayee get physically intimate and sleep together. But during the intercourse, Anupam ends up inadvertently strangling Maithrayee and because they were so caught up in the act, Anupam realised only much later on that Maithrayee was no longer breathing. The scene changes to him covering her body and proceeding to sit on the ground and play the [[Sitar]]. The movie ends with Jhilmil speaking to the screen, in retrospect, of all the events that took place and mentions that after Maithrayee's death, her father, Anupam was taken to prison where he continued to write endlessly and that her mother, Aaloklata, was still suffering and living her life. The film ended with her also mentioning that she is 7 months pregnant and that she intends on giving birth to her child and that Maithrayee was a valuable part of her life.

Haggis tells him of the price it costs to summon Pumpkinhead and Haggis is shown talking to Ed Harley's spirit. Haggis states that her choice does not matter in the end; only the summoner may make the decision to kill Pumpkinhead. The two invoke Pumpkinhead to kill the Hatfields.

The Promise (2007 film)
  A grandfather is walking along the beach when his grandchildren inquire about the lighthouse that looks over the waters. He replies by telling them that the lighthouse is older than himself and tells him a story about it. The story is about a young girl named Andrea ([[Angel Locsin]]) and her older brother Jason ([[Ryan Eigenmann]]) whose parents work in a sugar cane field of a family called the De Veras. One day, Andrea finds a dirty boy hiding out in their truck. Her father pities the boy and takes him in as his own son.  As the years go by and the children get older, Andrea and the boy, Daniel ([[Richard Gutierrez]]) grow very fond of each other while Jason becomes jealous of Daniel because of how much attention he has gotten from his family. One day Jason and Daniel get into a fight when their parents are not home and Jason beats him up and tells him that he will be sleeping outside that night. Andrea goes out to comfort Daniel and the two imply that they love each other. The two play together and pretend to get married: Andrea is the bride, Daniel the groom and the De Vera's daughter, Monique ([[Rhian Ramos]]), is the bridesmaid. Monique complains that she is always the bridesmaid and now she wants to have her turn at marrying Daniel. One day, Andrea's parents have news that they are moving into the hacienda behind the De Vera mansion and Jason, disappointed that he will not actually be living in the big house, runs away swearing to one day get rid of Daniel for good.  Now Andrea and Daniel are in their early twenties. Andrea's parents get into a car accident and die. Jason secretly comes back for his parents' funeral and afterwards, he shows up at the hacienda and tells Daniel and Andrea that he is the head of the household and kicks Daniel out. The De Vera's children, Antonio (aka Anton, ([[TJ Trinidad]])) and Monique, come back from studying abroad and their mother throws them a welcome home party. After hearing that Monique has returned, Andrea and Daniel go to check it out even though they were not invited. Andrea had a scheme to get a glimpse of the party but she was unable to see anything when she was bitten by one of the guard dogs. Daniel carries her into the party to seek help and then Anton gets the doctor to inspect her. She stays at the De Vera mansion for a few days, just until her foot recovers. It then seems that Anton has fallen hard for Andrea and Monique for Daniel but they are not interested. Daniel and Andrea love each other very much and make a promise to always be together. To physically seal the deal, they go to the lighthouse near the beach, Daniel gives Andrea a locket with their pictures in it and the two make love. When Andrea comes home from the lighthouse, she meets her brother and he tells her that he has made a business deal with Anton. The deal will only work if Andrea agrees to marry Anton. Andrea refuses because she clearly loves Daniel. Jason threatens to kill her if she does not obey him and starts beating her. She cries herself to sleep and hears Daniel calling to her from her window. She ignores him in fear that Jason might catch her if she tried to meet up with him.  The next day Daniel tries to meet up with Andrea again but she unwillingly ignores him and heads into Anton's house. Shocked, he tries again to talk to her but she tries to avoid him. He finally gets her attention and interrogates her about her being at Anton's house instead of meeting with him. She does not answer until she is questioned about the wound under her lip, the one given to her by Jason the previous night. She says that she tripped and hurt herself. She tells Daniel not to worry about anything; everything's gonna be alright. In the next scene the couple intimately makes out at Daniel's house but they are interrupted when Jason furiously barges in at the sight of the two kissing. He shouts at Andrea and pulls at her hair and then goes after Daniel, who he beats to the ground, his final blow is to the head with a wooden crate full of bottles. He leaves the scene and Andrea attends to the now unconscious Daniel, asking him to forgive her. A few days later Daniel goes down by the lake to wash off his wounds. Monique sees him there and tries to flirt with him. She asks him if he is going to Andrea's birthday party but he replies by saying that he was not invited. Monique tells him that she was invited and now she is inviting him so the two go to Andrea's party together. Once there, Andrea notices that Daniel is attending. She thinks nothing of it and the party continues. Anton then holds a box out in front of her and opens it, revealing a necklace with a diamond pendant. Daniel sees that Andrea is still wearing the locket that he gave her and he is surprised when she has to take it off just to try on Anton's necklace. Then Anton gets down on one knee and asks Andrea if she loves him. Despite her heart telling her the contrary, she sadly looks up at Daniel and says yes. Daniel is shocked to hear this. Anton then asks her to marry him and before she can answer, Daniel has already fled from the party. Andrea says she will think about it and runs off to find Daniel and explain things to him. She searches everywhere but once she gets to his house, she finds no one and concludes that he took all his savings and ran away.  Andrea gets married to Anton according to her brother's wishes and Daniel becomes a very successful man by being an underground mixed martial artist/brawler. Three years have passed since Andrea's party and one day Daniel decides to return to his hometown. Anton, Andrea and Monique patiently wait for a friend of Anton's, someone who he has made business with. The man arrives on a yacht and he turns out to be Daniel. Everybody is surprised at this, especially Andrea. Daniel tries to win over Monique's heart again in attempts to make Andrea jealous. Andrea at this point is not jealous at all, in fact she is still so shocked by Daniel's presence that she faints. She is revived and that night, Daniel comes by Andrea and Anton's house to speak to her. The two meet in the backyard and it is revealed that their feelings for each other have not changed one bit. Daniel tells her to meet him later at the lighthouse and Andrea goes back into the house to prepare for the "meeting" and looks for the locket that Daniel gave her three years back. Anton goes up to their room and the couple sleeps together. Then when Andrea is sure that Anton has fallen asleep, she goes to the lighthouse to meet with Daniel and the two make love.  When Andrea comes home from the lighthouse, she is shocked to see that Anton has awakened and that he knows where she has been and with whom. He shows her that he also knows about the locket, which she forgot to wear when she went to meet up with Daniel, and he throws it to the ground. He then approaches Andrea and pulls at her hair asking her questions. At this time Monique walks into this scene of the fight and asks what is going on. Anton says that Andrea is making a fool out of him, and pretending to love him when she really loves someone else. Then Andrea tells Anton to let her go because Daniel is waiting for her at the lighthouse but Anton tells her to let him wait forever and takes her to their bedroom. Monique notices Andrea's locket on the floor. She picks it up and looks at the pictures; it has now become clear to her as to what this was all about. Then she goes to the lighthouse to meet Daniel instead of Andrea and she deceives him, telling him that Andrea sent her to tell him that she does not love him any more and that she has changed her mind and loves Anton. She gives Daniel back the locket.  The next night Andrea, Anton, Monique and Daniel have dinner together on the beach. There, Daniel declares that the yacht that he arrived in a few days ago now belongs to Monique. Also, just like Anton did when he proposed to Andrea, Daniel proposes to Monique with a necklace. Shocked and surprised, Monique accepts and Andrea is crushed. Daniel and Anton go off to talk for a while and they make a deal: Anton will let Daniel marry his sister only if once they marry, they will move somewhere far away to settle. Daniel agrees. Meanwhile, Andrea tells Monique not to marry Daniel because she will be truly heartbroken, that he only wants to marry her to make Andrea jealous. Monique does not believe her and leaves. When Andrea and Anton go to bed, Andrea begs Anton not to let his sister and Daniel marry because it will shatter her heart. In the middle of the night, Andrea wakes up, and she can be seen in the bathroom clutching her stomach and seems to be in massive pain. The next morning she is still asleep, and Anton is watching her. She starts muttering words in her sleep, as if she was talking to Daniel, saying such things as "Daniel, don't go, don't leave me." Anton checks on her, feels her forehead and calls the doctor.  After the examination, the doctor concludes that Andrea has a fever and that she has to take a special medicine to get rid of the infection that is causing it. The doctor explains that he cannot give Andrea antibiotics because it could harm the baby. Anton does not know anything about a baby and the doctor states that Andrea is, in fact, pregnant, but she has an ectopic pregnancy. If Andrea is not treated soon she could have a hemorrhage or severe internal bleeding. As Anton is infertile, the only explanation for her pregnancy is Daniel. As soon as the doctor leaves, Anton locks Andrea and himself in the bedroom and he starts to beat her. The maid and Monique overhear Anton and Andrea from the outside of the door and when they hear that Daniel got Andrea pregnant, Monique cries, heartbroken after hearing the news. She then runs to Daniel's house and tells him what she has just found out. Anton keeps on hitting Andrea despite the screaming and pleading for him to stop. Then she falls to the ground, and blood can be seen on her white dress. Anton stops just as Daniel kicks down the door and runs to Andrea's side. He carries her out of the house.  Daniel takes Andrea to the beach, where they talk. The two profess their undying love for each other and promise that they will live in each other's memories. After the promise is made, Andrea dies.  The movie is brought back to the grandfather from the beginning of the movie. His grandchildren ask if Andrea is still alive and he answers "Yes. She is still alive right here, in my heart." A montage shows Andrea and Daniel playing together on the beach. At the end it shows a clip of him on the sand, his hand held out, holding the same locket with Daniel and Andrea's picture in it. This implies that he is, in fact Daniel and that his last memory was of Andrea and himself, being together at last.

Benjamin then says that there is money in the house, and that the family will give it to them if they want to remain unharmed. However, Simon, the man of the house, says that they are wrong and that they are a really poor family who have never had much money. A furious Benjamin holds Simon at gunpoint, while one of his henchmen begins taking measures of all the family member's necks, he realizes that the only person who has the "desired" measures is Simon's wife, Ofelia. The man then takes out the package seen at the beginning of the film and opens it, revealing 2 pieces of PVC pipes and other instruments; he places the pieces around Ofelia's neck and straps them together, forming a "collar bomb". Benjamin then orders the family to lay down on their stomachs, the family complies and, a few minutes later, realize the gang is gone.  The shocked family, still asking themselves why they were attacked if they had no money, begin trying to take the device off Ofelia's neck (being completely unaware of what the device was) but are unable to do so. They find a cassette tape in the package where the device was, and play it on a stereo player. The cassette is a message left by the gang, asking for a ransom of 15 million [[Colombian peso|pesos]] to remove the collar, and at the same time warning them not to tamper with the device or go to the police.  Since the family has no money, they decide to ask help to the police anyway. They use a cellphone to call Ofelia's sister so that she in turn can call the police.  The national guard and the Colombian army reacts quickly and arranges a meeting with Ofelia so that they can remove the device. However, the meeting point is far away, and so the family asks a neighbor (who is also unaware of what the collar was) to drive them to the meeting point. He initially complies but then tells them to get off the car after realizing the device is actually a bomb.  The family are forced to walk, but luckily they are given a ride by a couple of men who were pushing a wagon along the train rails.   Soon after, the device begins making a beeping noise, which terrorizes the family.  They eventually reach the meeting point and meet with Jairo, an officer from the national guard's  bomb squad, who begins examining the device. He knows the procedure to remove it, but he lacks the proper tools and is forced to improvise with a kitchen knife, a candle, and a lighter.  The process takes a long time, since the knife is not very sharp and the candle takes a lot to heat it. The army eventually arrives and sets around a perimeter, and a lot of passersby start gathering around the perimeter to watch.  Ofelia, who was initially relatively calm, is now visibly distraught and has a breakdown after Jairo tells her to "excuse her for a second" to which she replies "I have no spare seconds".  Jairo eventually manages to remove a piece from the device, and finds the explosive component.  He attempts to remove it but realizes it's more complicated than that when the device releases toxic fumes from a chemical detonator that was hidden inside. Jairo barely manages to avoid the fumes. Ofelia however, doesn't and she goes into respiratory arrest, but is helped by the paramedics on site and manages to breathe normally again. Jairo successfully removes the chemical detonator, he reports it to his CO, who congratulates him and reassures Ofelia that she will be fine, Ofelia takes his word and starts calming down. As the CO begins walking to the safe zone, the camera turns black, and an explosion is heard, Ofelia's family rush to the site and realize that despite all efforts, the bomb has detonated, killing Ofelia. Jairo can be seen lying on the floor with severe burns on his arm (although it is unknown if he is dead or just injured) the camera then runs towards Ofelia's youngest daughter, who is watching In horror from a distance, the film ends with the girl crying and asking "Why God why?". Jairo's fate, as well as the gang's, is left unknown.

The restaurant continues to thrive, as all of Remy's recipes become immediate hits. A romance develops between Linguini and Colette, and Remy begins to feel left out. Remy finds that his clan has come to Paris as well, and is taken to their new lair, but his father Django's attempt to rid his son of his admiration for humans fails and Remy leaves.  France's top restaurant critic, Anton Ego, whose previous negative review cost Gusteau's one of its [[star (classification)|stars]] and caused Gusteau's death, announces he will dine at the restaurant the following evening.

Having discovered Remy's skills, Skinner captures him in an attempt to use him to create a line of frozen foods. However, Remy is freed by Django and his brother Emile. He returns to the restaurant to find Linguini, who has been unable to cook without him. Linguini apologizes and reveals the truth to the staff, but they all leave in disbelief. Colette later returns after recalling Gusteau's motto, "Anyone can cook."  Django arrives with the rest of the clan, offering to help after seeing his son's determination. Remy has the rats cook, while Linguini waits tables. For Ego and Skinner, Remy creates a variation of ratatouille, [[confit byaldi]], which reminds an astonished Ego of his own mother's cooking. During the meal, the rats are forced to tie up Skinner and a health inspector to prevent them from revealing the rats' involvement in the cooking. When Ego requests to see the chef, Linguini and Colette make him wait until the rest of the diners have left before introducing Remy. Ego is stunned and leaves the restaurant, deep in thought. He writes a positive and thoughtful review for the newspaper the next day, stating that Gusteau's chef is "nothing less than the finest chef in France."  Linguini and Remy have to release Skinner and the health inspector, however; thus, despite receiving a good review, Gusteau's is forced into closure, and Ego loses his job and his credibility as a critic. Luckily, Ego funds (and frequents for Remy's cooking) a popular new bistro, La Ratatouille, created and run by Remy, Linguini, and Colette. The rats settle into their new home in the bistro's roof.

Later that evening, Katherine tells Doug why she left the church; five years ago, she was an ordained [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]]. While doing [[missionary]] work in the [[Sudan]] with her husband and daughter, the locals [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]] her family, believing they caused a drought. Katherine then has intense dreams that she and Doug have sex.  Katherine goes to talk to Loren. Loren remains silent the whole time. Katherine notices that her leg is soaked in menstrual blood. Katherine helps clean her up and has a vision of Loren turning the river red. Loren's mother appears, asking if Katherine is there to kill Loren. Before she can explain, Loren attacks her and Katherine runs away. Ben and Katherine examine Loren's brother's body, finding the sickle-like symbol branded into his lower back. Test results prove the river contains human blood. The citizens, meanwhile, are shaving their children's heads, due to an outbreak of [[lice]]. Ben and Doug try to get the mayor to evacuate the town, but he and his staff are afflicted with [[boils]].   A posse gathers to kill Loren to try to stop the plagues. Katherine calls Father Costigan, who explains that he has researched a satanic cult which sacrifices every second-born child once they reach puberty to create a "perfect child with the eyes of the Devil" to bring them power. He believes that Loren is the devil child. He also states that an angel, who cannot be harmed by the cult, will destroy them. He insists that Katherine is the angel, as the term is sometimes used to mean servants of God. Suddenly, a supernatural force burns Costigan's room, killing him. Katherine returns to the McConnell house, where she finds the cult's sacrificial chamber. There, Loren's mother says that Loren is "his servant" now, then kills herself. Outside, Katherine finds [[locust]]s everywhere. As the townspeople arrive, with Ben and Doug in tow trying to stop them, Loren causes the locusts to kill the posse. Doug runs away and falls in the river; Katherine locks herself in the house; Ben hides in a crypt, where he discovers skeletons and bodies of sacrificed children. He calls Katherine when Loren appears outside.  Katherine finds Ben dead. She confronts Loren. Katherine is about to kill Loren, when suddenly she says something that Katherine told her own daughter in Sudan. Katherine asks how she can tell what is real. Loren answers "faith," and shows her a vision of the truth. The cult, which actually encompasses the entire town and Doug, are shown trying to kill Loren since she has reached puberty. Loren escaped and her brother Brody stabbed her, but her wound miraculously healed, and Brody died. Katherine realizes that Loren is the angel God sent. She also sees that Doug killed Ben. The townsfolk surround them as Doug tells her that only an ordained servant of God like Katherine can kill Loren. He reveals that his family recruited the entire town into the satanic cult, believing that God had abandoned them because of the natural disasters. He invited Katherine to investigate the plagues because they hoped she would join them, since she had turned her back on God. Katherine refuses. Suddenly fire rains down on the town, killing the satanists.  As they drive away, Loren says that Katherine is pregnant. Katherine realizes that the dreams she had of sex with Doug was actually Doug having drugged and raped her. Since this is her second child, Katherine realizes that her son,  fathered by Doug, is the prophesied demonic child.  
The Rebel (2007 film)
  The movie is set in French-occupied Vietnam (1922), where anti-French colonialist rebellions by peasants have emerged all over the country. In response, the French have activated units of Vietnamese secret agents to track down and smash the rebels. One agent is Le Van Cuong. Although he has a perfect track record, his conscience is troubled by the bloodshed he has caused. Following the assassination of a high-ranking French official, Cuong is assigned to seek and kill the notorious leader of the resistance. Cuong encounters Vo Thanh Thuy, a relentless revolutionary fighter and the daughter of the rebel leader. She is captured and imprisoned by Cuong's cruel superior, Sy. Cuong suspects that Sy learned about the attack on the French official beforehand and could have prevented it. Suspicious, he warns Thuy that her organization has a mole and helps her escape the prison, thus becoming a fugitive himself. Her fiery patriotism inspires Cuong, and he develops feelings for the young woman as well. Meanwhile, Sy follows Cuong and Thuy, knowing the pair will lead him to Thuy's father.  Cuong changes his clothes and accompanies Thuy to her father. French soldiers attack them one night, but they managed to defeat them all. Thuy and Cuong then encounter Sy and Hua Danh. Though Sy couldn't find them, Cuong has to fight Hua Danh and manages to kill him, but not before being wounded. Later, while tending Cuong's wounds, Thuy reveals that her mother killed herself after being raped by a French soldier and couldn't bear having a child. Her father didn't learn of her mother's death until after he was freed from prison due to opposing the government. Cuong and Thuy then make love. Meanwhile, Sy finds Cuong's father and tortures him before gouging his eyeball. He then faces Cuong and asks him where the rebel's hideout is. Cuong says that they have to go on a train, and Sy leaves. Cuong meets with Thuy, and she reveals that she lied about the train because she didn't trust him. She then takes him to her father's hideout.  Thuy's brother is suspicious of Cuong, while her father accepts him regardless. Suddenly, the hideout is ambushed because the French saw Cuong and Thuy together. Sy captures Thuy's father, and reveals Cuong as a traitor to the French. When Sy delivers Thuy's father to his boss, his boss instead gives Sy another boss, not trusting a Vietnamese person to be in charge. Furious, Sy kills both of his bosses, then plans to execute Thuy's father soon. Meanwhile, the rebels are being held at gunpoint for execution in a village. Cuong asks the firing squad to take off his blindfold because he doesn't fear death. Using a hidden knife, he cuts his bindings and frees all the rebels. He and Thuy fight off the soldiers, and Thuy's brother tells her to go save her father before dying.  Thuy and Cuong fight off the French people near a train, and Cuong finally confronts Sy. Cuong and Thuy finally manage to kill Sy by stabbing him in the eye. After they save Thuy's father, they return to the village where they found most of the people dead, except for a little girl. They pay their homage, and Cuong and Thuy spread the ashes across the rivers of Vietnam.  
REC (film)
 Reporter [[Ángela Vidal]] ([[Manuela Velasco]]) and her cameraman Pablo are covering the night shift in one of [[Barcelona]]'s local fire stations for the documentary television series ''While You're Sleeping''. While they are recording, the firehouse receives a call about an old woman, Mrs. Izquierdo, who is trapped in her apartment and screaming. Ángela and Pablo accompany two of the firefighters, Álex and Manu, to the apartment building, where two police officers are waiting. As they approach the old woman becomes aggressive and attacks one of the officers, biting his neck.   As they carry the injured officer downstairs, they find the building's residents gathered in the lobby. The police and military have sealed off the building and trapped them inside. As people begin to panic, Álex, who remained upstairs with the old woman, is thrown over the staircase railings and seriously injured. The old woman then kills a girl, and the remaining officer, Sergio, is forced to shoot her. Ángela and Pablo begin interviewing the residents, including a sick little girl named Jennifer. Her mother Maricarmen claims she has [[tonsillitis]], and says her dog, Max, is at the vet because he is sick as well.  The injured are put in the building's textile warehouse. A health inspector in [[hazmat suit]] arrives and attempts to treat them. Suddenly, they become aggressive and start attacking other people. The residents flee and Guillem, an [[Internship (medicine)|intern]], is locked in the warehouse. The health inspector explains that they are infected with a virus similar to [[rabies]], and the time in which the disease takes effect varies by blood type. He reveals the disease is traced back to a dog in the apartment building, and Ángela realizes the dog to be Max. When the residents confront Maricarmen, Jennifer turns, vomits blood at her mother's face and flees upstairs.  Sergio handcuffs Maricarmen to the stairs and proceeds upstairs with Manu and Pablo. They find Jennifer but she bites Sergio, who tells the others to leave him. Manu and Pablo find the remaining residents running upstairs as the infected in the warehouse have broken down the door. Leaving the handcuffed Mari behind, they enter an empty apartment along with Ángela, a resident called César, and the health inspector, who has been bitten. César mentions that there might be another way out through the basement, where there is a large drain that is connected to the sewers, but says the keys are in Guillem's apartment. The infected health inspector then bites César, forcing Ángela, Manu and Pablo to escape and fight their way up to Guillem's apartment on the third floor.  Having found the key, Ángela and Pablo leave the apartment and find Manu among the infected. The pair are chased upstairs, and take refuge in the penthouse. They discover a tape recorder which explains the virus' origin. The penthouse's owner was an agent of [[Holy See|the Vatican]]. He was researching and isolating an enzyme believed to be the biological cause of [[demonic possession]]. He located a possessed young girl named [[Tristana Medeiros]], kidnapped her and brought her to the penthouse for research. During this time, the enzyme mutated and became viral. The agent, having no other options, sealed Tristana in the house, presumably to let her die of starvation.   Pablo reaches up with his camera to record around inside the attic. An infected child swipes at the camera and breaks its light, shrouding them in complete darkness. Pablo turns on the night vision and discovers a sealed door. Tristana, now a blind and horribly emaciated figure, emerges and searches the penthouse for food. Ángela and Pablo try to escape, but Pablo is killed by Tristana and drops the camera. Ángela then picks it up and looks through the screen. Seeing Tristana eating Pablo, she panics, trips and drops the camera. The camera continues to record as Ángela is dragged into the darkness screaming.

Redline (2007 film)
 Natasha Martin is a beautiful auto mechanic and aspiring musician who is invited to join music producer Infamous aboard his private jet en route to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in appreciation of her services on his [[Ford GT#First generation (2004–2006)|Ford GT]]. She is also a highly skilled race car driver, but is sometimes haunted by memories of her father's death at a [[NASCAR]] race many years ago. Meanwhile, on another side of town, Carlo has just returned from a tour of duty in [[Iraq]]. He meets up with his brother Jason before heading to Vegas themselves. Carlo is not happy that Jason is living with their mob boss uncle Michael D'Orazio, whom he always sees as the cause of their family's destruction. They are unaware that Michael has been running an unsuccessful counterfeiting ring and owes millions of dollars to another syndicate led by the "Godfather".  On the outskirts of Vegas, a high-stakes race event is being held, with Michael, Infamous, Hollywood producer Jerry Brecken and Chinese businessman Marcus Cheng placing their bets over who has the better car. When Infamous' driver fakes an ankle injury, Natasha becomes Infamous' driver in exchange for $300,000 and a recording contract. However, she is unaware that Infamous has to place her on his wager, as Michael - who has been obsessed with her since watching her band perform on stage earlier - has placed four [[platinum]] bars at stake. At the same time, Brecken wagers his brand-new [[Enzo Ferrari (automobile)|Enzo Ferrari]] on Natasha.  Natasha (driving a [[Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren]]) takes on Jason (driving a [[Lamborghini Diablo]]). As they approach the finish line, Natasha is several car lengths ahead of Jason, but he quickly zips past her by engaging the onboard [[nitrous]] system. Unfortunately, because of the excessive speed, the Diablo loses [[downforce]], flies off the ground and flips in mid-air before crashing upside down at the finish line. Attempting to avoid the falling Diablo, Natasha crashes on a barrier and is knocked unconscious. Before Carlo can reach Jason to rescue him, the Diablo bursts into flames, killing his brother instantly. Michael's henchmen, dressed as paramedics, place Natasha in an ambulance and speed off.  Natasha wakes up in Michael's mansion, realizing that she is now his property. Meanwhile, Carlo meets up with an old military friend and picks up some ammunition and gear before riding a [[Ducati 999]] with the intent to kill Michael. After breaking into Michael's mansion, Carlo and Natasha bump into each other and leave the complex. This prompts Michael to have his henchmen kidnap her mother and convince her to drive for him at the next race at [[Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area|Red Rock Canyon]] in Nevada. Meanwhile, after receiving an ultimatum by the Godfather to pay him $80 million following a botched attempt at giving him counterfeit bills, Michael raises his funds for the upcoming race by borrowing money from the banks using his mansion as collateral.  In the final race, Michael, Brecken, Infamous and Cheng place their bets for a combined purse of $100 million. Infamous and Cheng are eliminated from the race after their cars (an SLR and a [[Porsche Carrera GT]], respectively) are involved in separate crashes. During the race, Natasha (driving Michael's Enzo) receives a phone call from Carlo notifying her that he has rescued her mother. While she is several car lengths ahead of Brecken's [[Saleen S7#S7 Twin Turbo|Saleen S7 Twin Turbo]], she stops the Enzo an inch away from the finish line and gives the S7 the win, costing Michael the race.  With no money left, Michael is given a last ride from the Godfather's henchmen. As a way of thanking Natasha for handing his driver the victory, Brecken gives her a recording contract (which shortly gives her a gold record and lands her on the cover of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''), an Enzo and a [[Koenigsegg CCX]]. The film ends with Natasha (in the Koenigsegg) and Carlo (in the Enzo) racing each other before being chased by the police on the freeway.  
Redacted (film)
 In early April 2006, [[Private First Class]] Angel "Sally" Salazar (Izzy Diaz), a young [[United States Army]] soldier serving in the [[Iraq War]], is an aspiring filmmaker who enlisted in the U.S. Army to help him get into film school, as he "did not get into [[University of Southern California|USC]]". Salazar, based out of Camp "The Oven" Carolina, near [[Samarra|Samarra, Iraq]], is using his [[camcorder]] to record an amateur documentary, ''Tell Me No Lies'', about his deployment in Samarra, to present to a film school of his choice as part of his future enrollment there as a student. Meanwhile, a [[France|French]] documentary crew is shooting a documentary called ''Barrage'' while they are embedded with Salazar's platoon.  The French documentary crew films the soldiers performing their routine duties as they man a [[random checkpoint]] as part of their deployment in Iraq, to help curtail [[insurgent]] logistics. Using mirrors and bomb-sniffing dogs, the soldiers spend their days searching cars at the checkpoint. One day, the French documentary crew manages to videotape an incident in which Private First Class Reno Flake (Patrick Carroll), while manning a [[Humvee]]-mounted [[M2 Browning]] machine gun, fires on a speeding car that tries to rush through the checkpoint. A pregnant woman who was a passenger in the car, is shot and is rushed to the hospital by her husband, and later dies. It is later revealed that the husband, the driver of the car, was simply trying to get his pregnant wife to the hospital, as she was in labor, and misinterpreted the soldiers' commands to stop, believing that they were telling him that he was clear to proceed on through.  Back at Camp Carolina, Salazar, camcorder in hand, asks Flake how he felt about killing a pregnant woman, and he replies that he felt "nothing", and that it was like "gutting [[catfish]]". When [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist]] Lawyer McCoy (Rob Devaney), a married, college-educated soldier, is disgusted by this response, Salazar and McCoy press the issue further, and Flake offers a sarcastic, facetious apology to Salazar's camcorder, enjoying the limelight, which further inflames the situation. [[Sergeant]] Jim Vazquez (Mike Figueroa) defuses the situation before it gets out of hand, stating that, under the [[rules of engagement]] (ROE), Flake's actions were justified.  While on a foot patrol, one of the more experienced soldiers, Master Sergeant Sweet, is killed after stepping on an [[Improvised explosive device|IED]], causing it to detonate. Flake and his friend SPC B.B. Rush (Daniel Stewart Sherman) are enraged by Sweet's death and wish to take revenge by attacking some Iraqis. During a [[poker]] game, Flake and Rush announce their plan to go to the house of an Iraqi family with the goal of raping a 15-year-old girl who is one of the family members. Despite objections from Blix and McCoy, Flake and Rush carry out their plan, with Salazar and McCoy accompanying them; the former to videotape the incident and the latter in the hopes of stopping them.  McCoy tries to stop the pair, but he is ordered out of the house at gunpoint. Flake and Rush rape the girl as Salazar films the events using a hidden helmet-mounted video-camera. Afterwards, the girl and her entire family are killed and the girl is burned. McCoy tries to tell Blix about the rape, when Rush confronts the two. Rush grabs McCoy, putting him in a choke-hold at knife-point, demanding he not report the rape. Afterwards, McCoy is deeply disturbed by the rape and murders, and he tells his father about the incident via webcam. His father, citing the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib incident]], urges him not to report the incident, fearing the publicity generated by it would diminish the reputation of the U.S. in the eyes of the world. Regardless, McCoy ignores his father's objections and reports the rape, going to the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigation Division]] (CID) to make them aware of the crimes and they subsequently interview him. Salazar too is disturbed by the scenes he recorded, and he meets with an army psychologist to discuss his deteriorating mental state.  While busy making a video for his mother during a foot patrol, a preoccupied Salazar is kidnapped by Iraqi insurgents at knife-point and driven away in a van. Rush notices Salazar missing and his camera, which was left behind during the kidnapping. Later, Salazar is beheaded alive by the insurgents and a video of his murder uploaded onto the internet. Before beheading him, the insurgents claim that his beheading was retribution for Farah's rape. Salazar's decapitated corpse is discovered by a [[Bedouin]] man and subsequently retrieved by U.S. soldiers. The U.S. tries to frame the rape and murder as being perpetrated by insurgents, but a relative rejects the claim, stating that they are of the same religious sect as the supposed insurgents. After the story makes the news, Flake and Rush are arrested and interrogated by the CID and the duo conceitedly admit to the rapes in rambling racist diatribes.  In October 2006, after returning home from Iraq, McCoy is at a bar with his wife when he is asked by his civilian friends to tell them a "war story". He obliges and tearfully tells them about the rape and murders, before sobbing into his wife's arms.

Resident Evil: Extinction
 Alice ([[Milla Jovovich]]) wakes up disoriented in a mansion. Wandering through its halls, she is forced to escape several [[Booby trap|security traps]]. However, she is eventually killed by a [[bounding mine]] hidden in the floor. Her body is dumped into a pit filled with dozens of Alice copies and is revealed to be one of many clones being produced inside of an underground facility whose entrance above ground is surrounded by thousands of zombies.  Despite the best efforts of the bio-tech company [[Umbrella Corporation]] to cover up the [[Resident Evil (film)|contamination of The Hive]] and the release of the T-virus to the surface, going so far as to authorize the [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|bombing of Raccoon City]], the T-virus has spread around the world. As the virus spread, it affected not only humans, but other animals as well, and the environment deteriorated, turning cities into desolate landscapes and the wilderness into wastelands. The real Alice (from whom the clones are made) wanders the wastelands of the Southwestern U.S. On her travels, she finds a dead man's diary which states that there is an uninfected area in [[Alaska]].  She later begins to realize that she has developed [[telekinesis|telekinetic abilities]] due to the experiments performed on her.  Meanwhile, Dr. Alexander Isaacs ([[Iain Glen]]), former head of Project Alice and the head of the North American Umbrella facility seen earlier (based in [[Nevada]]), considers Alice's recapture to be a top priority, since she has the ability to bond with the T-virus and not suffer mutation. He tries to persuade the Umbrella board, operating via holograms from the worldwide Umbrella facility, that he can use her blood to develop a permanent cure as well as tame the infected zombies. The new Umbrella chairman [[Albert Wesker]] ([[Jason O'Mara]]) orders Isaacs to use the clones to create a cure, and he refuses to authorize Alice's recapture until they are informed of her location.  Meanwhile, a convoy of survivors led by [[Claire Redfield]] ([[Ali Larter]]) travels across the country in search of supplies. The convoy includes Raccoon City survivors [[List of Resident Evil characters#Carlos Oliveira|Carlos Oliveira]] ([[Oded Fehr]]) and L.J. ([[Mike Epps]]), along with new survivors [[List of Resident Evil film characters#K-Mart|K-Mart]] ([[Spencer Locke]]), Mikey ([[Chris Egan (actor)|Christopher Egan]]), Chase ([[Linden Ashby]]), Otto ([[Joe Hursley]]) and Nurse Betty ([[Ashanti (singer)|Ashanti Douglas]]), among others.  While searching a motel for supplies, L.J. is bitten by a zombie, which he keeps secret. The next morning the convoy is attacked by crows that had been feeding on the infected. The crows almost overwhelm the convoy, killing Nurse Betty and Otto and taking out the flamethrower operator, causing the weapon to careen out of control. Alice finally appears and saves Carlos and the others from a fiery death, using her telekinesis to fill the sky with fire, killing the crows and leaving her unconscious. After recovering, Alice is introduced to Claire and gives her the diary she found, and she and Carlos then convince Claire to take her convoy to Alaska.  Dr. Isaacs' attempts to domesticate the infected have led to a new zombie breed that remembers basic things, such as how to use phones and cameras. Wesker's security officer, Captain Alexander Slater ([[Matthew Marsden]]), is adamant about Isaacs' disregard for Umbrella's regulations. Wesker, in private, informs Slater to keep watch on Isaacs' actions, and tells Slater that if Issacs disobeys orders, Slater should kill Isaacs.  Umbrella triangulates Alice's location based on the signal sent out by her telekinetic abilities. Dr. Isaacs has a crate of his new zombies sent to ambush the convoy, against Wesker's specific orders. L.J. succumbs to his infection and bites Carlos. Most of the convoy, including Mikey and Chase, are killed in the ambush. Umbrella tries to shut Alice down remotely, but she breaks free from their programming and continues to fight. She finds Isaacs at the scene, and he becomes infected as he flees via helicopter. Alice and K-Mart use Isaacs' computer to track the helicopter's flight path, leading them to Umbrella's underground location.  The convoy heads over to the site, which is surrounded by thousands of zombies. Carlos sacrifices himself by plowing his truck into the zombie mob and blowing the rig apart, giving Alice and Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Alice decides to stay behind. Ordered by Wesker to terminate Isaacs, Slater arrives with a group of commandos and finds the scientist locked in his lab, injecting himself with massive doses of anti-virus in an attempt to counteract the infection. Slater reveals that his employment is terminated and shoots him, triggering a mutation that transforms Isaacs into a monstrous [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|creature]]. Despite retaining his intelligence and thought, Isaacs kills Slater and all the facility employees, but is confined to the lab's lower levels.  Entering the facility, Alice meets a holograph of the Red Queen's "sister" [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], the White Queen ([[Madeline Carroll]]). The White Queen informs Alice that her blood is the cure to the T-virus, while also defending the Red Queen's prior actions. She then tells Alice about Dr. Isaacs. Alice agrees to deal with him. On her way to the lab's lower levels, Alice discovers one of her clones, still in development. The clone awakens, but appears to die from shock shortly after. Alice soon discovers a replica of the [[Resident Evil (film)|Racoon City mansion]] deep within the complex and finds Isaacs.  The two engage in a fight, eventually leading them to a replica of The Hive's laser corridor, where Isaacs is killed by the laser-defense system. Just as Alice is about to meet the same fate, the system is deactivated by her clone, whom is revealed to still be alive.  Later, in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], Wesker, who is the head of the Tokyo Umbrella facility, informs the rest of the Umbrella chairmen (all holograms) that the North American facility has been lost. Alice's hologram makes an appearance, declaring that she is coming for him, and she's bringing some of her "friends." Standing beside her clone, Alice looks out onto a huge number of pods containing numerous developing clones.

Reno 911!: Miami
 The film opens outside of a building where [[Terrorism|terrorists]] are holding hostages and a nuclear bomb. The [[Reno]] Sheriff's Department arrives in a helicopter, called in as experts. As the group prepare to deal with the situation, Deputy Travis Junior wakes up and realizes it was a dream; he was sleeping at the wheel and the vehicle he and Lt. Dangle are in crashes.  The film continues with introductory clips of the officers, telling how they became interested in law enforcement, à la ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]''. After a scene involving a chicken in the road miscoded as an "armed person on a roof", Dangle tells everyone that they have been invited to the American Police Convention in [[Miami Beach]]. On arrival, the group finds they are not on the entrant list. Having nowhere to stay, they rent rooms at a motel that seems to be a hub of illegal activities. After partying most of the night, most of the police officers unsuccessfully attempt to seduce one another at the motel, with the guys eventually turning to [[Masturbation|pleasuring themselves]] to the shock of the ones outside.  As everyone recovers from their hangovers, Johnson discovers a tattoo on her breast of a mystery man. The team return to the convention to see if their tickets were found, but discover the building has been the subject of a bio-chemical terrorist attack that has quarantined the police inside. The only city official left outside is assistant deputy mayor Jeff Spoder. The head of National Security asks Reno Sheriffs Department to provide law enforcement for Miami Beach. A high-ranking [[SWAT]] agent, Rick "The Condor" Smith, arrives on the scene to give a pep talk, but soon ends up blowing himself up with a grenade he had unpinned during the talk.  The team assume the Miami Sheriff's responsibilities, and respond to several emergency calls including an alligator in a swimming pool; street prostitution that leads to ''Reno: 911'' regular Terry who is in town to record an album; and a dead beached whale, which they eventually remove by [[Exploding whale|blowing it up]]. Jones and Garcia are repeatedly kidnapped by Ethan, a drug lord who tries to act like [[Tony Montana]] from ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]''. Spoder fires the team for their incompetence, but as the team brings a cake to apologize to him they discover Spoder in cahoots with Ethan to create a drug empire. Spoder kills Ethan and escapes with the bio-terrorism antidote. The team chase Spoder, who holds them at gunpoint until Jones and Garcia arrive in a Marine helicopter and Spoder surrenders. Lt. Dangle arrests him, but Wiegel, who had been piloting the helicopter, accidentally blows Spoder up.  The antidote is distributed, and the Reno Sheriff's Department are eventually congratulated by their peers for their actions. Dangle accepts a job at the Sheriff's Department at [[Aspen]], who had repeatedly turned him down previously. The remaining team are offered a flight back to Reno by Terry, revealed to have a rich father, on his private jet. Back in Reno, Garcia briefs the team on their day's work. Dangle enters, interrupting the briefing, and explains that Aspen has a zero-tolerance policy forbidding homosexual sheriffs. Dangle continues the briefing, and reveals the group have been invited to a convention at [[Scotland Yard]].  
Rendition (film)
  In [[North Africa]], CIA analyst Douglas Freeman ([[Jake Gyllenhaal]]) is briefing a newly arrived CIA agent in a district when a [[suicide attack]] kills the CIA agent and 18 African civilians. The target was a high-ranking police official, Abbas-i "Abasi" Fawal ([[Yigal Naor]]), who acts as a liaison for the [[United States]] and whose tasks include conducting interrogations and overseeing the application of techniques amounting to torture. Fawal escapes unscathed.  Meanwhile, [[Egypt|Egyptian]]-born Anwar El-Ibrahimi ([[Omar Metwally]]), a chemical engineer who lives in [[Chicago]] with his mother, his pregnant wife Isabella ([[Reese Witherspoon]]) and their young son, is presumed to have been linked to a violent organization by telephone records indicating that known terrorist Rashid placed several calls to Anwar's cellphone. Returning to the United States from a conference in [[South Africa]], he is detained by American officials against his will and sent to a secret detention facility near the location of the suicide attack depicted earlier, where he is subjected to interrogation and is also verbally and physically tortured.   At the same time, Isabella is not informed and all records of his being on the flight from South Africa are erased, although records remain of his boarding the plane at [[Cape Town International Airport]].  For lack of more experienced staff, Freeman is assigned to observe the interrogation of Anwar, whose interrogator in turn is Fawal himself. After Freeman briefly questions Anwar, he is doubtful of Anwar's guilt, but his corrupt boss, Corrine Whitman ([[Meryl Streep]]), insists that the detention continue, justifying such treatments as necessary to save thousands from becoming victims of terrorism.  Growing worried about her husband's safety, Isabella travels to [[Washington, D.C.]] to see her old friend Alan Smith ([[Peter Sarsgaard]]), who now works as an aide to Senator Hawkins ([[Alan Arkin]]), and pleads with him to find out what has happened to her husband.   According to Smith, Isabella is informed that there was a mix-up in Cape Town and Anwar had failed to board his plane, but she shows him her husband's credit card record, which shows that he made a purchase at the in-flight duty-free shop; this confirms that he was on the flight. Smith slowly pieces together details of Anwar's detention but is unable to convince either the senator or Corrine Whitman, who had ordered the [[Rendition (law)|rendition]], to release him, or to openly acknowledge that the rendition had taken place. After the senator advises Smith to let it go on the basis that it's not the right time to start debating an [[extraordinary rendition]] because he's fighting to have a bill passed in Congress, he gives Isabella a phone number for an excellent lawyer he knows and advises her to call it, but she refuses.  Upon hearing the confrontation from her office, his sympathetic secretary quietly tips Isabella off that Whitman will be visiting the following day. Isabella angrily confronts Whitman and Hawkins before being led out by security, only to go into labor in the hallway.  Eventually, Anwar is able to confess that he advised a man named Rashid on new chemical compounds used to increase the power of explosive devices and was promised $40,000 in return. Suspicious that it's a [[false confession]], Freeman asks where the money is and Anwar replies that it should have been delivered to him in South Africa but the courier never arrived. Freeman's suspicions are confirmed when he has the names Anwar gives traced by [[Interpol]] and draws a blank.   A quick [[Google]] search reveals that the names are of the Egyptian soccer team from the year Anwar left Egypt. Without the consent of his superiors, Freeman approaches the Minister of the Interior, and presents him with this finding, and also questions whether $40,000 would really be enough to persuade a man whose annual salary is $200,000 to risk his entire life, and that of his family. The Minister quotes [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' while making a point on the value of intelligence gathered through torture:  '''I fear you speak upon the rack, Where men enforced do speak anything.'''  Eventually, Freeman persuades the minister to authorise Anwar's release, and sends him back to America via a clandestine ship to [[Spain]]. Freeman is contacted by Whitman, who franticly orders him to hand Anwar back to Fawal immediately. Instead, Freeman leaks the tort details to the press that turns into a worldwide scandal, thus ruining Whitman and Hawkins' careers in the process. The film ends with Anwar arriving home and reuniting with Isabella, his son, and the family's newborn baby.   ===Sub-plot=== In a parallel storyline, Abasi Fawal's daughter Fatima ([[Zineb Oukach]]) has run away from home with her boyfriend Khalid ([[Moa Khouas]]). Fatima sees a picture of Khalid's brother, but he does not tell her what has happened to him. Abasi is told that Khalid's brother was an inmate at his prison and later died.   Fatima is unaware that Khalid is a member of a terrorist group until his friends are arrested at a planned march and he leads her to the terrorist group's base. Near the end of the movie, Fatima discovers a notebook that contains pictures of Khalid and his brother together, showing that they were extremely close, as well as a picture of the two brandishing [[AK-47|AK-47s]], then some pictures of a grief-stricken Khalid standing over his brother's corpse, some pictures of her father, and finally a statement saying that Khalid is doing a deed to avenge his brother's death.   Realising that Khalid's brother met his death at the hands of her father and that Khalid is about to assassinate him, she runs off. It is then revealed that this second story took place before the suicide attack. (From the briefing with the CIA agent in the beginning, it is known that the first story took place after the suicide attack.) At the town square, Fatima begs him not to do it, reminding him that the target is her father (we know that Khalid knows the identity of her father because of his book of history, and also the conversation in the mosque with the terrorist organizer). After removing the pin of his [[detonator]], he hesitates, and is therefore killed by the organizers of the attack. As a result, he releases the handle of the [[Dead man's switch|detonator]] and the bomb explodes, killing Fatima.   In the present, Abasi rushes to Khalid's apartment and discovers Khalid's grandmother grief-stricken over the loss of both her grandsons and Fatima. Abasi then realizes that his daughter died trying to protect him and is filled with grief himself.  ===Theory=== The record of a phone call supposedly made by Rashid to Anwar is not explained in the film. However, earlier it was mentioned that phones are sometimes passed on from one person to another in order to avoid phone tracing (the DVD extras explain that there was a subplot dropped from the film that elaborated on this concept). The film's director, Gavin Hood, stated in an interview that the lack of explanation on the call was deliberate, so as to create ambiguity about whether Anwar was guilty or innocent, and to let the viewer decide whether the possibility of his guilt was enough to justify kidnapping and torturing him.  
Reservation Road
  Dwight Arno (Ruffalo) is an attorney who is divorced from his wife Ruth (Sorvino). Ruth controls custody of their son Lucas (Alderson) while Dwight maintains visitation rights. Dwight and Lucas are at a baseball game when Ruth calls, informing Dwight that he is late returning their son home. Dwight drives Lucas home in a hurry, thinking he might otherwise forfeit his visitation privileges. When he loses control of his vehicle, he strikes a young boy, Josh Learner (Curley), who is standing by the roadside.  Aware that he has struck the boy, Dwight decides to flee the scene. He further lies to Lucas, who has a minor injury from the incident, saying that they had collided with a tree log. Dwight later hears on a newscast that Josh died in the collision. Subsequently, he tries to cover up the evidence which implicates him in the hit-and-run. After the initial shock of losing Josh, Grace (Connelly) gradually tries to get on with life, but her husband Ethan (Phoenix), is obsessed with finding out who killed their son and frustrated with the lack of progress the police are making in their investigation. Ethan eventually decides to hire a lawyer, who oddly enough turns out to be Dwight.  Ethan later discovers, quite by chance, that Dwight is the perpetrator. Fearing that Dwight would be incarcerated for only a few years via the court system, he buys a gun to dispense his own form of justice.  
Remember the Daze
 The film takes place in a small [[suburban]] town in North Carolina in 1999. It's the last day of school and kids just want to have fun. That, at least, is the plan.  
Resolved (film)
 ''Resolved'' begins by focusing on the careers of Matt Andrews, Sam Iola, one a stand-out rising sophomore, one a rising senior famous within the policy debate community, respectively.<ref name="Variety's Review of Resolved" /> The team of Iola and Andrews hails from [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]], a recognized national debate power from [[Texas]] and located in one of the state's wealthiest communities, where students are expected to attend college after graduation. From there, Whiteley shifts his focus to Louis Blackwell and Richard Funches of Jordan High School in Long Beach, California. By contrast to Highland Park, Jordan High's debate team is underfunded, and the school is a [[public high school]] with only 12-18% of its students going on to a four-year [[college]].<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/film/reviews/article_display.jsp?&rid=9492 Hollywood Reporter]</ref> In an [[underdog (competition)|underdog]] style victory, the team of Funches and Blackwell capture the [[California]] state championship.  Once the team from Long Beach has won the state championship while playing by the conventional rules of modern policy debate, the team is introduced by their coach Dave Wiltz to [[Paulo Freire]]'s  ''[[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]''. From there, the team from Jordan High changes their debate strategy, arguing against the current strategy used in high school debate, and using Freire's work to show the oppressive nature of the spread and the structure of debate as a whole. Along these lines, Jordan High's team chooses to read slowly and focus on [[persuasion]] rather than pure quick [[argumentation]]. The team's strategies of using hip-hop music and arguing that policy debate is structured to disadvantage minorities were inspired by [[The Louisville Project]].  At the end of the documentary, however, they are defeated by a "traditional" team: Rahul Hirani and [[Timothy Jurka|Tim Jurka]] from [[Saint Francis High School (Mountain View)]]. The judge defends his decision by stating that the Jordan High team convinced him that the structure of debate is flawed, but then the debaters went on to use the very structure of debate to continue to defend their arguments. Thus, their arguments were not consistent. They attempt to qualify for the tournament of champions, but this loss substantially curtails their dream.  In addition to the social message, ''Resolved'' involves commentaries from [[Samuel Alito|Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito]], [[Jane Pauley]], and [[Juan Williams]].<ref name="Hollywood Reporter"/>

In defiance of danger the two teenagers travel down the Nile to the burning-hot desert dunes, courageously facing the mercenary [[Zannanza]] and priests of [[Amun Ra]], who are conspiring to overthrow the pharaoh because of his rejection of their god. With innocence their only weapon, Akhesa and Tut overcome many hardships, and encounter an extraordinary destiny.  
Resurrecting the Champ
 Erik Kernan Jr. (Hartnett) is a young fledgling journalist employed by ''The Denver Times''. Frustrated, Kernan struggles with his supervising editor Ralph Metz (Alda) concerning rudimentary coverage over his articles related to professional sports. Metz views Kernan's editorial work as bland and uninspiring considering his recently deceased father was a famous sportscaster. Kernan is separated from his wife, Joyce (Morris), who also works at the newspaper, and worries that he might be losing touch with their young son, Teddy (Goyo).  In an alley near the [[Denver Coliseum]], three rowdy young men taunt an elderly homeless man (Jackson), who calls himself "Champ" and claims to have been a professional boxer. As the men begin to assault him, Kernan, leaving a boxing match he was covering at the venue, comes to his aid. Eventually, Kernan learns that Champ was once a famous former heavyweight boxing contender, Bob Satterfield.  [[File:Denver Colorado Downtown 2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Denver, Colorado, where the provincial story takes place.]] During an interview with a magazine publisher named Whitley (Paymer), Kernan informs him that he has an influential story about the former boxer Satterfield, who's now a homeless man living on the streets assuming the moniker "Champ". Though at the same time, Champ is reluctant to cooperate for any biographical piece. In order to gain Champ's confidence for the chronicle, Kernan recruits an associate at the newspaper, Polly (Nichols), to assist him in retrieving information about his past.  The magazine ultimately publishes Kernan's article. It wins applause from readers and journalists alike. The story even draws the attention of a TV personality from [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]], Flak (Hatcher), who boldly suggests it should be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. But the intense publicity brings Kernan into contact with elderly folk who knew Satterfield personally, and are adamant that he's deceased. Kernan later learns that Champ is in fact a lesser known boxing contender, Tommy Kincaid, whom Satterfield once defeated in the ring. He makes a conscious choice and decides to inform his editors about the profile error. However, before he can do so, he learns that he and the newspaper are being sued by Satterfield's son, Robert (Lennix). Satterfield Jr. is angered, since it had been long known to a number of people that Champ had a lengthy history of impersonating his father. Metz derides Kernan for not having done due diligence in examining Champ's authenticity regarding his past.  Satterfield Jr. is later appeased with a proposal by Kernan to write another article retracting his mistake; and to include personal journalistic material about the elder Satterfield which he long wanted someone to articulate about. Kernan is also gratified with knowing that his young son Teddy will be proud of his father even if he does not know the famous people he once claimed to know.  
Return to House on Haunted Hill
 Ariel Wolfe ([[Amanda Righetti]]) is the sister of Sara Wolfe, a survivor of a birthday event eight years ago in the Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane. In the 1930s the asylum was overseen by the sadistic [[psychiatrist]] Dr. Richard B. Vannacutt ([[Jeffrey Combs]]). Sara claimed that ghosts of the house residents killed the party guests, and later commits suicide.  Ariel and her friend Paul ([[Tom Riley (actor)|Tom Riley]]) are kidnapped by an art dealer, Desmond Niles ([[Erik Palladino]]). Ariel realises that Sara didn't commit suicide: Desmond killed her. Desmond forces Ariel to help him find an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] located inside the old Vannacutt Psychiatric Institute, a figurine of the [[demon]] [[Baphomet]]. Inside the building, they encounter Dr. Richard Hammer ([[Steven Pacey]]) and his assistants Kyle ([[Andrew-Lee Potts]]) and Michelle ([[Cerina Vincent]]).  Ariel explains that the building has been rigged to keep everyone inside for at least 12 hours. The group splits up to search for the idol. Desmond's henchmen are killed by the inmate ghosts, having visions of the patients there suffering the same deaths as them. A ghost shows Ariel the depravity the inmates suffered under Dr. Vannacutt. These images reveal that Vannacutt was driven mad by the idol, and performed experiments on the mentally ill. The inmates led a revolt against Vannacutt, during which the sanatorium burned down. (The audience is shown footage from the 1999 film ''House on Haunted Hill''.) The deaths in the previous film were assumed to be caused by the ghosts. But now Ariel is shown that the dead are actually forced by the idol to do Vannacutt's bidding and did not willingly kill.  Although the 12 hours are up, the master locking mechanism begins to lock the house down again. Ariel escapes but discovers that Paul has entered into the house to look for her, and goes back inside. Convinced Michelle wants the idol for herself, Desmond attempts to kill her. Michelle however is killed by Vannacutt. The rest of the group discovers a way out of the asylum but it is blocked by iron bars. The ghost of an inmate shows Ariel that the idol is in the asylum's basement [[Crematory|crematorium]].  Ariel, Paul, and Dr. Hammer descend to the crematorium and discover the "heart of the house," composed of living flesh. Ariel tries to destroy the idol but it is indestructible. She then reasons that if it is flushed down the sewer and leaves the building, the spirits will be freed. The team is ambushed by Desmond, who wants the idol. The ghosts seize Desmond and burn him alive after he has a vision about a patient dying a similar death. Dr. Hammer is overcome by the idol's evil and tries to strangle Ariel. The ghost of Vannacutt and inmates appear, Vannacutt hoping one of them will die in the fight. Hammer recovers his senses, but Dr. Vannacutt kills him. Ariel throws the idol into the sewer. The spirits vanish, and several attack Dr. Vannacutt, tearing him apart. The building comes unsealed and Ariel and Paul leave.  In a [[post-credits scene]], a man and woman are about to have sex on a beach. The woman feels something under the sand. They dig, and pull the Baphomet idol into the light.  
Return of Hanuman
 Devas are ’busy’ in their Swarglok (heaven). Technology has crossed boundaries of earth and even non-mortal devas have become techno-geeks. They converse in [[Hinglish]]. Meanwhile, a terrific war is being fought between the Devas and the Asuras. In this war, Lord Vishnu slices the demon Rahuketu into 2 parts through his stomach. His collapse invokes the Guru of Asuras, Guru Shukracharya and he comes forward to battle with Lord Vishnu. He also slices a large snake named Kaladansh into 2 parts. Lord Vishnu gains an upper hand in the war and throws Shukracharya in space. Shukracharya announces a prophecy throughout the Universe warning Lord Vishnu that the same humans whom he is protecting, in Kalyuga they will themselves become very cruel than even demons and a day will come when their cruelty will give rise to the greatest demon of the Universe which will engulf the whole humankind. Shukracharya then transforms himself into Planet Shukra or Venus and it becomes the home of demons. Later he joins Rahuketu's sliced body with that of Kaladansh's tail and vice versa. This gives rise to 2 demons Rahu and Ketu. Shukracharya declares that as long as his Sarpdand i.e Snake Wand lives, the demons will remain powerful.  Hanuman, who has returned to heaven after completing his task on earth, is bored. He sees a village boy who is bullied by local hooligans. He decides to help him but for that he has to take birth as a human. He decides to do so after agreeing to some conditions of Lord [[Brahma]]. He appears on earth in a village named Bajrangpur from a priest and his wife as a human baby. What makes the reincarnated Hanuman different from other humans is that he has a tail and a huge appetite. The baby is christened "Maruti" by his mother. After Maruti is three months old, he takes admission in school. Thereafter, he teaches a lesson to local hooligans, Gabbarsingh and his gang.  Meanwhile, on planet Shukra, there is a fight between Rahu and Ketu and accidentally the Sarpdansh comes to Earth. Danavs come to Earth to search for it but they have to face Maruti. Maruti easily defeats Rahu and Ketu with the help of his army of [[monkeys]] that came to help him to get free from the hands of culprits (who caught him because he stole the mangoes from his garden).  In order to stop Rahu and Ketu from covering the sun, [[Narada]] must remind Maruti that he is actually Hanuman. After Narada and Maruti met and signed a contract, Maruti became the more powerful Hanuman, with more godly powers. He also had a new appearance which he looks like child Hanuman from the film's [[Hanuman (2005 film)|predecessor]]. Then a monster made of polythene and other non-biodegradable waste appears from a volcano that was said to form when Sarpdansh merged with the Kamandal thrown by Shukracharya which coincidentally fell in the volcano in Bajrangpur. The monsters keeps on swallowing the villagers of Bajrangpur.After struggling to stop the monster, Hanuman asked help from God [[Rama|Ram]]. God Ram then said that when a blockage, which is seen in the end, is cleared then the monster (mainly made of plastic and other waste thrown by humans) will finish up. Hanuman did what Ram said, and the monster was defeated. Finally, Hanuman said his farewells to his family and friends and leaves Bajrangpur.  
Rezerwat
 The story is set in a poor neighborhood in Warsaw and concerns a pickpocket and a photographer. A more substantial plot summary is available in the Polish Wikipedia and needs to be translated to English to include here.  
Rise: Blood Hunter
 Reporter Sadie Blake has just published a notable article featuring a secret [[Goth subculture|Gothic]] party scene. The very night following the publication, one of Sadie's sources, Tricia Rawlins, is invited by her friend Kaitlyn to an isolated house in which such a party is to take place. Tricia is reluctant to enter with the curfew set by her strict father, so Kaitlyn goes alone. When she does not return, Tricia becomes worried and enters the house as well. To her horror, she finds Kaitlyn in the basement with two vampires hanging onto her and drinking her blood. She tries to hide, but the vampires find her quickly. The next day, Sadie learns of the girl's death and decides to investigate the matter. She soon attracts the interest of the vampire cult, who kidnap her and bring her in for questioning. Following that, she is raped and murdered by the vampires.  To her surprise, Sadie abruptly awakes inside the cold box of a [[morgue]]. She escapes, but in the course of the following hours she finds to her horror that she has turned into a vampire herself. After wandering the streets she ends up in a homeless shelter where she soon gives in to temptation and kills an old sick man and begins to drink his blood. She then runs out of the shelter when a young girl notices her causing her to break down. She attempts suicide by throwing herself off a bridge, but is found and taken in by fellow vampire Arturo who is less blood-thirsty and more benevolent than his brethren. Though his true motives are unclear &mdash; a power struggle between Arturo and the leader of Sadie's killers, Bishop, is mentioned &mdash; he helps Sadie to cope with her new condition and trains her to fight when she announces her intent to get revenge on her murderers.  Sadie tracks the vampires across the state, killing them one by one, while at the same time fighting the urge to consume blood from human victims. She soon crosses paths with Detective Clyde Rawlins, Tricia's father, who has taken upon himself to avenge his daughter's death despite the objections of his superiors and colleagues. At first he takes Sadie for an enemy, but in time he recognizes that she is not of the same breed as Tricia's killers, and they team up in their pursuit of Bishop, the last survivor of the band. They track him to an abandoned stable complex, where they find not only Bishop but also Tricia, now a vampire, who openly voices her resentment and anger for her father. A hard fight ensues in which the evil vampires temporarily gain the upper hand. Along with two other women, Sadie is stripped naked and suspended by her ankles, with her wrists bound behind her back, to slowly drip blood.  She is saved by Rawlins. The pair then turn the table against their enemies.  After Tricia and Bishop are killed, Sadie asks Rawlins to kill her too. She cannot bear the thought of having to give in to her bloodthirst and that she, since she is already dead, can never see her mother and sister again. Reluctantly, Rawlins grants her request and stabs her with a silver crossbow bolt. Once again, Sadie's body ends up in the morgue, but we see her come back to "life" again once more as the end credits begin to roll.  
Richard III (2008 film)
   
Risk (2007 film)
 For years, Khalid Bin Jamal([[Vinod Khanna]]) has ruled the Mumbai crime underworld by staying in Bangkok, Thailand. Despite his distance from Mumbai, Khalid is able to control his Mumbai empire through keeping the ruling members of his network very close to him. He is also ruthless and shows no hesitation towards his enemies.  The Indian police has been trying for years to extradite Khalid to India but in vain. Inspector Suryakant ([[Randeep Hooda]]) has been in the police force some years and has been keeping track of Khalid's activities. He makes up his mind to put an end to Khalid's criminal empire and bring Khalid to justice. To do so, he starts carrying out [[encounter killings|encounters]] against Jamal's henchmen. Over the course of a few weeks, Khalid's network suffers as his men are simply killed in encounters and raids by Suryakant, who is supported by D.C.P. Uttam Bhandari ([[Shivkumar Subramaniam]]).   Khalid becomes increasingly alarmed but comes up with a counter-plan. He arranges for one of his leading associates, the politician Devki Wardhan ([[Seema Biswas]]), to be attacked while Suryakant is arresting her. Her opponent, the Home Minister A.R. Sarang (Anant Jog), has been known to be in favour with Suryakant and is blackmailed by Khalid into opening fire on Devki Wardhan. This implicates Suryakant as being an accomplice to Devki Wardhan's attempted murder where two of Devki's men are shot dead by Suryakant. Soon, a string of allegations that include taking bribes from different crime lords is formed against Suryakant. His plan to capture Khalid with bold moves thus backfires because of Khalid's premeditated scheme. The Police Commissioner is close to Devki Wardhan and is against Suryakant and tries all the time to suppress him. Suryakant's love interest Shraddha ([[Tanushree Dutta]]) also does not support him and distances away from him due to his involvement with the underworld.  In jail, Suryakant receives messages from Khalid. His image tarnished, Suryakant is offered his police officer position by Khalid as long as he does his bidding. He is also handsomely rewarded. Suryakant starts working energetically for Khalid and wipes out Khalid's sworn enemy, S.P. Naidu's ([[Zakir Hussain (actor)|Zakir Hussain]]) men who eventually Khalid's enemies as also Khalid's men on the pretext that they were killed by Khalid's goons. Arbaaz ([[Yashpal Sharma (actor)|Yashpal Sharma]]), Khalid's hot-headed brother, smells a rat and suspects the designs of Suryakant. He travels to India with Hari ([[Makarand Deshpande]]) without informing Khaled to personally deal with Naidu . Naidu is killed by Arbaaz but suddenly Suryakant reveals his true colours by killing Arbaaz and home minister Sarang and making it appear as if Arbaaz had murdered Sarang.  The supposed death of a Home Minister at the hands of Khalid's brother is enough to have Khalid extradited to Mumbai for trial. However, despite all of Suryakant's painstaking uncovering of Khalid's illicit activities, the Indian police cannot make a firm case against him. Moreover. Khalid heavily bribes the police prosecutor in his favour. Khalid is sure his case will be dismissed by the Court and he will leave India in a day but before doing so, wants retribution for Arbaaz's death and orders his men to dispose of Suryakant's comrades in the police force. Shraddha realizes her folly of not being supportive to Suryakant and asks for his apology. Suryakant is informed that Shraddha's life is in danger and that she will get killed by Khaled's men. Suryakant sends Shraddha safely away out of the country.  Khaled sends message for Suryakant to meet him in jail. Before Suryakant has a chance to find out about the murders of DCP Bhandari, Inspector Shridhar ([[Ganesh Yadav]]) and his other close colleagues, Khalid himself tells him about them during their meeting in jail. He also tells Suryakant he will go free despite all he has done. Suryakant is shocked by this truth and decides the only choice he has is to eliminate Khalid Bin Jamal. In a climactic ending, Suryakant storms the heavily guarded jail where Khalid is being held and manages to kill him. Probably mortally wounded, the last thing Suryakant sees is Khalid's lifeless body. He smiles and the movie ends.  
The Riddle (film)

The three are Mike (Jones), an ambitious [[Sports journalism|sports]] [[Tabloid journalism|tabloid journalist]] determined to make a name for himself, Kate (Cox), a police officer, and an eccentric old beach-combing [[tramp]] (Jacobi). Together they must track down the mystery and we are taken back to the world of Charles Dickens. Only when they solve the riddle of the manuscript are they able to solve the present day crime, but they must also face opposers: a greedy detective (Moriarty), a publisher (Redgrave), and a ruthless construction company owner (Flemyng).  
Rogue (2007 film)
  While carrying out his research as a travel journalist, cynical American Pete McKell ([[Michael Vartan]]) joins a group of tourists on a [[crocodile]] watching [[river cruise]] in [[Kakadu National Park]] of Australia's [[Northern Territory]], led by wildlife researcher Kate Ryan ([[Radha Mitchell]]). After a run-in with two locals, Neil ([[Sam Worthington]]) and Collin (Damien Richardson), the cruise winds to a close and Kate prepares to return the group to base.  Everett ([[Robert Taylor (Australian actor)|Robert Taylor]]) spots a [[flare]] in the distance, and Kate tells the group that they must investigate to determine whether someone needs rescuing. A few miles up river, they come across a half-sunken wreck when suddenly, something crashes into the tourists' boat, creating a crack in the side. Kate's only choice is to run it ashore on a small island in the middle of the river. The group disembark and begin discussing what to do when Everett is suddenly pulled into the water by an unseen predator and killed. Kate comes to the conclusion that they are in the heart of a large crocodile's territory and that it will be more aggressive than usual. The tourists realize that, by nightfall, the tide will start to rise and in a matter of hours, their small island will be submerged.  Neil and Collin arrive soon after and, as they near the island, an unseen force smashes their boat and sinks it. Neil manages to swim to the island safely, but Collin has been killed.  As night falls, Neil suggests that he swim to the riverbank in order to string a rope between two trees, creating a [[zip-line]] that will allow the group to cross the river. Neil succeeds in setting up the rope and Mary Ellen ([[Caroline Brazier]]) crosses first, only to freeze in fear halfway across. Allen ([[Geoff Morrell (actor)|Geoff Morrell]]) becomes impatient and aggressive and attempts to get himself and his daughter Sherry ([[Mia Wasikowska]]) across with Mary Ellen still on the line. While trying to secure the rope, Neil is attacked by the croc and killed. The tree holding the rope breaks and the three on the line fall into the water. They manage to swim back to the island, but as Allen crawls up the beach, the gigantic 23-foot beast suddenly lunges out of the water, rips off his right arm, and throws him into the middle of the river, where he is dragged under and killed.  Later that night, Pete suggests they can delay the beast with a hook and bait on one side of the island while everyone escapes off the other side. Simon ([[Stephen Curry (comedian)|Stephen Curry]]) is skeptical of the idea, but Russell ([[John Jarratt]]) agrees to try. Lacking bait, everyone suggests using Kate's dog, Kevin, but they decide to use two dead birds that Neil and Collin had shown them earlier. Kate hooks the birds onto the boat's anchor while Pete secures the other end of the rope to a boulder and throws the bait out into the river. After a long wait, the anchor is suddenly grabbed and pulled and the group make a break for the far shore. Russell assists Sherry's mother, Elizabeth ([[Heather Mitchell]]), who can't swim. Pete tries to stop the boulder from being pulled over as Kate swims across behind the group. The beast suddenly lets go of the hook and bait, seizes Kate, and drags her underwater. Pete hurriedly makes the swim across the river with Kevin in tow, and heads off into the bush to meet up with the others.  As day breaks, Pete is crossing a stream when Kevin runs away. Pete chases the dog into a cave and falls down a narrow chute into a larger cave, where he discovers Neil's mangled corpse. He realizes that the cave is the beast's lair and, to his surprise, he finds Kate alive, but badly injured and unconscious. He attempts to carry her out but has to hide when the beast returns and kills Kevin, then enters the cave and falls asleep. Trying to reach the entrance carrying Kate, Pete wakes the beast, and it makes several attempts to kill both him and Kate as he retreats into the narrow confines of the cave. Finally, after a long fight in which he gets tossed around and is severely bitten on the hand, Pete makes one desperate last stand. He braces a broken log against a large boulder with the sharp end pointing out towards the beast. The beast lunges at him, and Pete successfully impales it through the head killing it. He escapes from the cave with Kate to join the surviving tourists and waiting paramedics.  As the credits roll, the camera zooms in on a newspaper article detailing Pete's heroic battle with the beast and rescue of Kate. The article also states that authorities believe the beast was being territorial (having mistaken the boat's motor as the sound of a rival crocodile), while others believe that the beast had acquired a taste for humans.  
Rocket Science (film)
 Hal Hefner is a fifteen-year-old student of [[Plainsboro, New Jersey|Plainsboro]], [[New Jersey]] with a pronounced stutter. His older brother Earl is an obsessive-compulsive kleptomaniac, his father Doyle has recently walked out on the family after a heated argument, and his mother Juliet has begun to date the father of his school friend, Heston.  Hal is riding the school bus home one day when he is approached by Ginny Ryerson, the articulate, competitive star of the debate team. She urges him to join her and replace her former partner, Ben Wekselbaum, who has dropped out of high school after falling silent mid-speech and losing the New Jersey State High School Policy Debate Championship. Though Hal initially declines, he finds himself besotted with Ginny and agrees to be her partner. Hal and Ginny begin to study for the upcoming tournament and form arguments on either side of whether the federal government should support the teaching of sexual [[abstinence]] in public schools. When Hal finds himself unable to talk during a practice debate, he runs out of the room and hides in the janitorial closet, where Ginny joins him. Hal kisses her hopefully, and they make out, but she subsequently falls out of contact with him. Ginny's parents assure him that she is confident with the work they have already completed and that she will meet him on the day of the debate.  On the day of the tournament, Coach Lumbly tells the debate team that Ginny has transferred to Townsend Prep for the remainder of her senior year and that Hal will be paired with Heston for the day. Struggling with his speech and his stutter, Hal calls his therapist, who suggests that he sing his speech or talk with a foreign accent. Hal and Heston finish the day without much success, while Ginny wins a trophy for First Place as an Individual Speaker, which inexplicably goes missing. Coach Lumbly asks Hal to leave the team, telling him that Ginny had never planned to debate as his partner and had only recruited him as a cruel joke to damage the school's chances of winning. He breaks into Earl's bedroom and takes a bottle of stolen tequila, then rides with Heston to his friend Lewis's house, who lives across the street from Ginny. A drunken Hal drags Lewis's mother's cello across the street and throws it through Ginny's window just as she is arriving home with her new teammate, Ram.  Later in the year, Hal's mother breaks up with Heston's father, and Hal decides to seek out Ginny and return her trophy, which he stole. She rejects his apology, and he travels to [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]]—the "Big City"—to find Ben, Ginny's former debate partner. Hal convinces Ben to debate with him, and they register as a home-schooled team in the upcoming Policy Debate Championships. In order to overcome his stutter, Ben helps Hal to write his entire speech to the tune of "[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]". During the tournament, Hal is interrupted in the middle of his song-speech by Coach Lumbly and a Debate Official who disqualify Hal and Ben on the grounds that neither of them is home-schooled. Ben is satisfied with their efforts, but Hal finds Ginny before leaving. He insists that one day will be his day, while she tells him that it was not easy for her to betray him as he walks off, having gained a sense of confidence. He spends the evening at a nearby beach, and when his father picks him up, Hal tries to tell him that life and love "shouldn't be rocket science", although he is unable to say the phrase "rocket science" due to his stutter.

He finds out that Whit is running the Nike River Marathon in [[London]], and to prove himself to his uncertain friends and, most importantly, Libby and his son, he decides to run the race himself.  He receives motivation from his two "coaches", Gordon ([[Dylan Moran]]), a well-meaning [[slacker]] who is Libby's cousin and Dennis' best friend, who has made a hefty bet on Dennis succeeding, and Mr. Ghosh Dastidar ([[Harish Patel]]) his landlord, who uses unorthodox methods of training, such as using a spatula to spank him. Days before the race, Whit proposes to Libby at her birthday party. Libby accepts and this puts Dennis in a state of deep [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. As a result, he decides to quit the race.  Meanwhile, Jake, who has formed a crush on a girl in his class, runs away upset when he discovers that she prefers another boy just because he has a ponytail. Dennis, upon being informed by a frantic Libby, tracks him down and explains to him that he will find many things he does not like in his life and he should just stand up to them and face them, rather than running away. Having made that mistake himself, he decides to race after all.  Dennis starts the race alongside Whit, who informs Dennis that he intends to move Libby and Jake to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. Enraged, Dennis mocks Whit and they altercate for a while at the start of the race and, in their efforts to out-do each other, they catch up to and then overtake the professional runners, and suddenly Whit trips Dennis and severely injures him. Stretchers prepare to take Dennis to the hospital.  Whit continues, but is taken to the hospital after feeling pain in his leg. Libby goes to the hospital to look for Dennis, but finds Whit, who claims loudly that his injuries are the result of Dennis deliberately tripping him. The doctor tells him he is not actually injured and has only "[[Hitting the wall|hit the wall]]".  Jake is playing with Whit's hospital bed, and to Libby's disgust, Whit calls him a "little shit".  Dennis has in fact refused to be transported to the hospital or even get medical attention and is continuing the race well into the afternoon and evening with a sprained ankle, accompanied by a growing group of supporters, including Gordon and Mr. Ghosh Dastidar. A panting Dennis almost "hits the wall" but after an emotional [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], his goal to complete the race is restored. Later at Whit's house, Libby, Jake and Whit, watch a television replay of the Whit/Dennis altercation, as the replay shows that in fact Whit had deliberately tripped Dennis and had fallen over because Dennis pulled him down as he was falling.  As Whit tries to justify his behaviour, he blurts out his intentions to have Libby and Jake move to Chicago with him. A fed up Libby puts the engagement ring on a table, telling Whit "nobody's perfect" and storms out with Jake. The two go to meet Dennis as he arrives at the finish line. Dennis falls over just metres from the finish line and cannot get up until he sees Libby and Jake calling to him at which point he gets up, sprints to the finish and collapses in their arms.  Some time later, notably healthier and fully recovered from his injuries, Dennis calls at Libby's house to pick up Jake. He says that he has something to ask her, but is interrupted by Jake, and says he'll talk to her later. However, just after she shuts the door, he knocks again and asks her on a date. She accepts.  In the film's postscript, Gordon &mdash; on the bridge of a new yacht &mdash; tells the tale of the race to two attractive bikini-clad women, whom he invites aboard for a drink.

The following morning, a banker arrives at the school and serves Camilla with a foreclosure notice, as the school owes the bank in excess of £500,000 and has ignored six previous final demands. A subsequent meeting between Camilla and Carnaby is watched by the girls using hidden cameras, in which Carnaby confesses his distaste towards his daughter. Annabelle is clearly upset, despite Camilla defending her.

He always coldly refuses, and is treated rudely at the local store as a result.  Eliseo works as a teacher of English, and one of his students is 15-year-old Natalia. He develops a crush on Natalia, who is gentle and polite during lessons. Invited to Natalia's birthday party, Eliseo is angry when he realizes that Natalia has a boyfriend, Esteban.  After a heated argument with his mother, Eliseo loses his temper, shoots her, and then sets the place on fire. On his way out he encounters Beatriz and he kills her too. Arriving at Natalia's house, he viciously attacks Natalia and her mother, killing them both. In the evening, he visits an old friend, a librarian who has always been kind to him. He tells her that he is leaving town and thanks her for her friendship. From there, he goes on the last leg of his killing spree, the high class restaurant, "Pozzetto". He chooses an expensive meal and a few drinks, and consumes them both. He pays the bill, leaving a big tip. He then goes into the bathroom and prepares himself for the upcoming massacre. When he comes out, he shoots indiscriminately.   Paola is an attractive young woman who hates her job in the marketplace. She accepts an offer from an acquaintance to become a member of a gang of robbers.

At the same party Hanieh meets a musician named Javid ('''Siamak Khahani''') who invites Hanieh to join a musical group that plays for charities and goodwill events. The film then shows the downfall of Ali and Hanieh's marriage caused by Ali's increasing drug use as well as his hate for Javid. Ali beats Hanieh and she goes to her mother's ('''Maedeh Tahmasebi''') house.

Saw IV
 A wax-coated [[microcassette]] is found in [[Jigsaw (Saw character)|John Kramer]]'s stomach during his autopsy, and reveals to Detective [[Mark Hoffman]] that the games will continue and he will still be tested. Elsewhere, two men - one with his eyes sewn shut, the other with his mouth sewn shut - awaken in a [[mausoleum]], chained at the neck to a winch. The blinded man panics and activates the winch before attacking the muted man, who kills him in self-defense and uses a key from his collar to free himself.  Four days after Allison Kerry's death, a [[SWAT]] team led by Hoffman and Lieutenant Daniel Rigg find her body, and Hoffman warns Rigg against breaking through an unsecured door to reach her. The scene is also investigated by Peter Strahm and Lindsey Perez, Kerry's FBI contacts, who received a message and a key from her. Noting John and [[Amanda Young|Amanda Young's]] physical limitations, Strahm speculates that a third accomplice was involved and soon becomes suspicious of Rigg, who has developed an obsession with saving people in the six months since the disappearance of detective [[Eric Matthews (Saw)|Eric Matthews]]. That night, Rigg is attacked in his home; he awakens and watches a video from Jigsaw, which is where he learns that Eric is still alive and he has ninety minutes to save him, with Hoffman's life at risk as well. Meanwhile, he must play his own game in order to face and overcome his obsession.   Rigg finds a prostitute, named Brenda, bound to a chair in his living room, and accidentally activates the trap, which slowly tears her scalp off. He manages to free her, but kills her in self-defense when she attacks him with a knife in order to evade arrest. Rigg is then led to a motel and instructed to abduct the owner, Ivan Landsness, who Rigg later finds out is a serial rapist. He forces Ivan onto a bed, which requires Ivan to blind both of his eyes in order to escape. However, Ivan only blinds one of his eyes, and the trap dismembers him. Next, Rigg is led to a school, where he finds a married couple impaled by metal spikes: Rex, who has already died from blood loss; and his abused wife Morgan, who has remained alive at his expense by pulling the spikes from both of their bodies. Rigg pulls out the last spike and gives her a key to free herself. He then turns on a fire alarm and goes to the location of his final test.  The agents alternate between investigating the scenes and questioning Jill Tuck, John's ex-wife. Jill reveals John worked in civil engineering and property development, and that she miscarried her son Gideon after seven months when Cecil Adams, a drug addict, slammed a door into her stomach while robbing her health clinic. At the motel, the agents learn that the room was rented out to a lawyer named Art Blank, the survivor of the mausoleum trap, who vanished two weeks prior. Art is revealed to be the man overseeing the current game when he hands Eric a gun. At the school, the agents learn that all three victims, and Jill were Art's clients. Strahm and Perez find a puppet and a tape recorder in another room, which plays a cryptic message for Perez before its face explodes, sending shrapnel into her face. After Perez is hospitalized, Strahm furiously questions Jill. He learns how Kramer ended his work with Art after falling into his depression, and that Cecil became the first victim of John's "games". Strahm connects his story and a prior clue to the Gideon Meatpacking Plant, the location of Rigg's final test.  Strahm arrives after Rigg, but ends up following Jeff Denlon, the protagonist in [[Saw III]]. After finding Jeff in the sickroom, Strahm shoots him in self-defense when Jeff demands his daughter back. Meanwhile, Art pulls out a device which will free them when the timer expires; if used before then, a pair of pincers will sever his spine. Rigg finds them and is shot by Eric as he breaks into the room with one second to spare, releasing two overhead ice blocks that swing down and crush Eric's head, killing him. Rigg shoots and kills Art, believing he is responsible for the game, only to learn from Art's tape recorder that his interference and continued obsession caused Eric's death. Hoffman, the actual accomplice, releases himself from the chair, but leaves Rigg to die. He then seals Strahm in the sickroom and leaves the plant. The scene then cuts to Hoffman at the morgue, revealing that John's autopsy took place after the events of the film.

Seed (2007 film)
  As a boy, a reclusive and antisocial Sufferton resident, Max Seed, was disfigured in a school bus crash that killed everyone else involved in it. In 1973, Seed began torturing and murdering people, filming some of his victims starving to death in his locked basement, and ultimately racking up a bodycount of [[Number of the Beast|666]]. In 1979, Seed is arrested by Detective Matt Bishop in a siege that claims the lives of five of Bishop's fellow officers. Seed is sentenced to death by electric chair, and incarcerated on an island prison, where he is a model inmate, only acting out when he kills three guards who try to rape him.  On Seed's execution date, the electric chair fails to kill him after two shocks. Not wanting Seed to be released due to a state law that says any convicted criminal who survives three jolts of 15,000 volts each for 45 seconds walks, the prison staff and Bishop declare Seed dead and bury him alive in the prison cemetery. A few hours later, Seed digs his way out of his grave and returns to the prison, where he kills the executioner, doctor, and warden before swimming back to the mainland. The next day, while investigating the massacre, Bishop realizes Seed was responsible when he discovers the serial killer's empty cemetery plot.  Over the course of several months Seed kills dozens of people, with one [[Long take|long shot]] showing him beating a bound woman with a lumberjack's axe for five straight minutes. One day, a videotape showing Bishop's house is sent to the detective's office. Knowing this means Seed is going to go after his family, Bishop races home, finding his wife, Sandy, and daughter, Emily, gone, and the four officers charged with guarding the house dismembered in the bathroom.  Driving to Seed's old residence, Bishop is lured into a basement room containing a television and a video camera, and locked inside. The television turns on, and depicts Seed with Sandy and Emily. Emily informs Bishop that Seed wants Bishop to shoot himself. When Bishop hesitates, Seed kills Sandy with a nail gun, prompting Bishop into shooting himself in the head, believing that doing so will make Seed release his daughter. Instead, Seed takes the daughter to the room containing her father's corpse, and locks her in it. As Emily sobs for her parents, the film ends.  
The Seeker (film)
  Will Stanton ([[Alexander Ludwig]]) is a day away from his fourteenth birthday. As the Stanton children walk home, Miss Greythorne ([[Frances Conroy]]), the local mistress of the Manor, and her butler Merriman Lyon ([[Ian McShane]]) invite the siblings to a Christmas party. Later, two farmers, Dawson ([[James Cosmo]]) and Old George ([[Jim Piddock]]), whom Will does not know, arrive at his house with a large Christmas tree ordered by the family. The farmers know Will’s name, wish him a happy birthday, and predict a storm despite the relatively clear sky. Will’s birthday is so close to Christmas that everyone in his large family ignores it except for his little sister Gwen ([[Emma Lockhart]]), who gives him his only birthday present (a [[G-Shock|Casio G-Shock Mudman wristwatch]]). The family has moved from the United States to a small English village and one of his brothers has arrived home for the holidays and displaces Will to the attic. For a Christmas present, Will buys Gwen an enigmatic stone pendant at the local mall. Two suspicious security guards accuse him of shoplifting and take him to their office. Alarmingly, as they question Will under the room's flickering lights, the guards metamorphose into [[Rook (bird)|rooks]]. They attack Will, but he manages to escape, accidentally using his powers for the first time. Will begins to experience more odd incidents and receives a strange and Celtic-looking belt from his oldest brother, Stephen ([[Jordan J. Dale]]).  At the Manor Christmas party, Will once again sees Dawson and Old George who seem to know him well. Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about when and how to approach Will about his destiny. Maggie Barnes ([[Amelia Warner]]), an attractive local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset when one of his older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As the ominous figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider ([[Christopher Eccleston]]), who warns them all that in five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the [[seventh son of a seventh son]] whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The Light power over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls and twists his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much worse before restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning [[superhuman strength]], commanding [[light]] and [[fire]], [[telekinesis]], stepping through [[time]], and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.  Will returns to The Great Hall, and learns the form each sign will take. Will reveals the first sign within Gwen’s pendant. As the sign-seeker, Will travels through time to find the next four signs. The Rider enlists a mysterious figure to help him get the signs from Will. When Will's brother invites Maggie to their home, she reveals some of her powers to Will. Will reveals his affections for her, saying he felt an instant connection with her. He tells her he has been thinking of her constantly. The Rider also tricks Will's older brother Max, using his magic to partially control him. The spell over Max is finally broken when Will uses his great strength to give Max a concussion. By the fifth day, The Dark that The Rider commands has now gained tremendous power and begins to attack the village with a terrible blizzard. Will locates the fifth sign but without the sixth sign, the Dark continues to rise. Maggie is revealed to be the mysterious witch helping the Rider in exchange for eternal youth. She is betrayed by him (for failing to get ANY of the signs) when she fails to get the fifth sign and ages rapidly, disintegrating into a flood of water while trying to steal them from Will. The Old Ones and Will seek sanctuary in the Great Hall, where the Rider cannot enter unless invited. However, The Rider's final trick (impersonating the voices of Will's mother and father, as well as Gwen) gains him access to The Great Hall. The Rider reveals that he has trapped Tom, whom The Rider mistook for The Seeker and kidnapped, within a glass sphere (and apparently took care of all these years). He sends Will into an evil dark cloud. As he enters, Will solves the riddle of the sixth sign: he himself is the sixth sign. With all six signs identified The Rider cannot touch nor harm Will. Using his power over the dark, Will banishes both The Rider – imprisoning the evil figure within one of his own glass spheres – and The Dark. The sphere disappears into murky water. Will and Tom are reunited and return to their family, who are shocked to see Tom.

Secret (2007 film)
 Ye Xianglun ([[Jay Chou]]), a music student majoring in piano, transfers to Tamkang (Danjiang) Secondary School. It is a school famous for musically talented students, especially in piano. On the first day of school, as he wanders through the piano building, he hears a mysterious melody being played that leads him to Lu Xiaoyu ([[Gwei Lun-mei]]), another piano major. When he asks her about the song she was playing, she tells him that it is a secret that cannot be told. The two develop a relationship that is clouded in mystery. When Xianglun tells Xiaoyu about the demolition of the piano building on graduation day, she teaches him the mysterious song.  However, when a mis-passed note leads to Xianglun accidentally kissing another student Qing Yi ([[Alice Tzeng]]) who was interested in Xianglun, Xiaoyu disappears for five months, only to return on graduation day and mysteriously disappear again. Xianglun asks around and discovers from Xiaoyu's mother and his father ([[Anthony Wong Chau-sang]]) that Xiaoyu was actually a student from the class of 1979, who graduated 20 years ago. His father tells him she claimed she traveled forward in time to the present with the help of a piano piece called "Secret" that she played on an old piano in the piano building. She had fallen in love with Xianglun, but the only barrier is that, in the present, the first person she sees on each trip is the only person that can see her. As such, she memorizes that it takes 108 steps to get from the piano building to Xianglun's classroom, and only opens her eyes after those 108 steps so that the first person she sees is Xianglun.  When Xiaoyu saw Qing Yi kiss Xianglun, she returned to her normal time. During her absence at home, her story spread and everyone believed that she was mentally ill. Remembering that the piano room would be destroyed on graduation day of 1999, she tried [[time travel]]ing to see Xianglun one last time, but she spotted Xianglun wearing Qing Yi's bracelet. Believing that Xianglun now belonged to Qing Yi, Xiaoyu returns to her own time with a heavy heart. Due to an [[asthma attack]], while writing on her desk trying to leave a message to the boy she loves, Xiaoyu dies heartbroken. The message formulates in the present due to the fact that Xiaoyu would not have written the message if she had not seen Xianglun wearing Qing Yi's bracelet. Xianglun sees the writing on the desk and desperately tries to write back using [[Correction fluid|white out]] but when he gets no response he rushes to Xiaoyu's house only to find her room empty. Xiaoyu's mother finally recognises Xianglun as the boy her daughter had drawn a picture of twenty years before and Xianglun learns the truth about her time travels.  After finally learning of Xiaoyu's story, Xianglun realizes that the piece that she taught him was "Secret", which had the power to take the pianist forward or backward in time depending on the tempo at which it is played. He rushes off to the piano room, which is about to be torn down. Xianglun's father retrieves the manuscript of the musical piece that Xiaoyu had given to him for safekeeping, then realises that Xiaoyu had written a secret message for Xianglun. Meanwhile, Xianglun enters the piano building and as the demolition begins, Xianglun starts to play "Secret" from memory, recalling something Xiaoyu told him while teaching him the piece: "I always play it that fast when I go back". Just before the piano room is completely destroyed, Xianglun travels back to 1979. Because the time traveled backwards is dependent on how fast the user plays "Secret," when Xianglun recalls this he ends the song on the last key slightly later.  When Xiaoyu played it she did not pause.   Xianglun rushes to the classroom and Xiaoyu sees him and smiles. The last scene is when the 1979 Tamkang (Danjiang) Secondary School graduation picture is taken, in which Xianglun and Xiaoyu are present. As the old piano and the piano building have been destroyed, Xianglun stays forever in the past with Xiaoyu. The magic that the time machine possessed was destroyed when Xianglun traveled back in time at the moment the piano was destroyed. This explains why Xianglun was able to appear on the 1979 graduation photo and live a normal life in 1979.  
The Secret of the Grain
 Slimane Beiji (Habib Boufares) is the divorced head of a Franco-Arabic family living in [[Sète|Sete]].  As he is being forced out of his job at the local shipyard, he interacts in a series of extended vignettes with various members of his extended family including his ex-wife, his sons and daughters, their husbands and wives, and his grandchildren. Determined to leave a legacy for his beloved family, and encouraged by his long-term partner's daughter, Rym, (Hafsia Herzi) he pursues his dream of converting a dilapidated boat into a family restaurant that will specialise in his ex-wife's fish couscous, a meal that she prepares for the entire family every Sunday.  With Rym's enthusiastic help, Slimane applies for the relevant licences and loans, but soon finds himself knee-deep in bureaucratic red tape. Undaunted, Slimane enlists his sons to help with the renovation and arranges an opening gala of a large dinner party, to which he invites the many bureaucrats on whose decision the fate of the project rests, in an attempt to demonstrate the viability of the enterprise. On the night in question attendance is high, although notable by her absence is his long-term partner, Latifa. Insulted and threatened by the involvement of Slimane's ex-wife in the project, the restaurant's cook and creator of the pivotal fish couscous, Latifa refuses to leave her hotel. Rym pleads with her to attend, encouraging her to use the opportunity to flaunt her comparative youth and beauty in front of Slimane's ex-wife, and eventually she concedes.  Having prepared the couscous, fish, vegetables and sauce in large metal cauldrons, Slimane's ex-wife sends the food to the boat with her sons and leaves her apartment to find a 'poor man' so that she can donate a plate of food that she habitually reserves for the less fortunate. At the restaurant, the sons unload the metal cauldrons and the women serve wine and appetisers to the waiting guests. The guests, talking amongst themselves, begin to speak both positively and anxiously about the likely success of the restaurant, now concerned that it may draw custom away from the other restaurants in the area. Slimane's son Majid, whilst surveying the crowd, notices a bureaucrat's wife with whom he has had several illicit sexual liaisons and decides to leave quietly. He instructs his brother to tell the rest of the family that he has gone to help a friend who has broken down on the highway. The women start to heat up the food when they notice the absence of the couscous. Panic mounts when they discover that it is definitively absent and Majid, who has taken the car that still holds the metal cauldron in the trunk, is not answering his phone. Knowing that it will take at least another hour to cook a new batch, they continue to frantically call Majid and attempt to call Souad, who is out searching for an unfortunate in need of plate of couscous. Slimane takes his motorbike out to Souad's apartment building to find her.  In the dining room the guests, despite the attempts of the women to placate them with assurances and date liqueur, become extremely restless. Their comments turn nasty and they turn on the waitressing girls. When he cannot find his ex-wife, Slimane leaves the apartment building to find his motorbike stolen. The culprits, three young boys, sit atop the stolen bike on the other side of the river, mocking him. He runs after them, but every time they stop to mock him they move on before he can catch up to them.  Tensions in the dining room reach a peak and Rym decides to step in. She whispers to the musicians, and suddenly the music stops and the lights go out. When they come back on, Rym stands before the assembled diners in a red belly-dancing outfit. The musicians play for her and she entrances the guests with a fervent performance, charged with youthful, sexual energy. Latifa uses the opportunity to slip off the boat and return to the hotel to start a new pot of couscous.  As Rym dances and sweats, her mother walks up the gangplank with a new cauldron of couscous, whilst Slimane continues to chase the youths around the apartment building. Finally he sinks to his knees, before collapsing flat on the ground, unmoving.

September Dawn
 The fictional love story between Emily Hudson, the daughter of the wagon train's pastor, and Jonathan Samuelson, the son of the local [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|Mormon bishop]], plays out against the build-up to the tragedy itself. The film begins with the deposition of Mormon leader [[Brigham Young]]. The [[Baker–Fancher party]] is then depicted crossing [[Utah]] on its way to [[California]]. The party encounters a group of Mormon militiamen, who advise them to move on. Bishop Jacob Samuelson defuses the situation but is disturbed to learn that the Fanchers have a woman wearing men's clothing and are delivering racehorses to California to be used in [[gambling]]. He is also upset to learn that some are from [[Missouri]], whose inhabitants he blames for the death of [[Joseph Smith]] and for [[Anti-Mormonism|persecuting Mormons]]. He instructs his sons Jonathan and Micah to keep an eye on them.  A scene follows in which the pastor for the Fancher party praises God for their deliverance, while Bishop Samuelson thanks God for delivering the [[Gentile#LDS Church usage|gentiles]] (non-Mormons) into their hands for divine punishment. As the Mormon leadership prepares to defend Utah from an attack by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], Samuelson's son, Jonathan, develops a relationship with the daughter of the pastor, Emily. At the direction of Brigham Young, local Mormons are directed to massacre the gentiles using their allies, the [[Southern Paiute|Paiute Indians]]. By pointing to a rival Indian tribe as their mutual enemy, [[John D. Lee]], the adopted son of Brigham Young, convinces the Paiutes that it is God's will to kill the migrants. Jonathan objects to the plan, which his father has just conveyed to the local Mormons, and is imprisoned by his father. Jonathan has become disillusioned by the Mormon faith not only because of the planned massacre, but because of what he allowed to happen to his mother. In a flashback earlier in the film, Jonathan remembers that his mother was ordered away by a senior religious leader who took her as is his wife; she returned to get her children, for which she was executed in full view of Jonathan and his father.  The Fancher party repels the Indian attack, and the local Mormons are forced to complete the mission themselves. The Mormon militia under the command of John D. Lee is ordered to kill anyone who is old enough to talk. John D. Lee offers to lead the Fancher party to safety; however, they lead them instead to an ambush in which they are all killed. Escaping his imprisonment, Jonathan arrives too late to save them and his lover, Emily, who is killed by his father. John Lee is executed for his role in the massacre in 1877 and Brigham Young denies any knowledge or involvement.

September (2007 film)
 Rick and Eve Anderson are traditional wheat-and-wool farmers in Western Australia's drought-prone wheatbelt. Their 15-year-old son Ed enjoys a close friendship with Paddy, the son of Aboriginal labourer Michael Parker whose family lives in a shack on the farm and receives sustenance provisions in return for their labour. Ed attends school in a nearby township.   Paddy receives no schooling but Ed has taught him to read, and he aspires to more in life than his family's virtual slavery. One weekend, on a shopping trip to town, the boys go to the cinema, where the colour bar obliges them to sit in separate rows. They see a newsreel about the Aboriginal [[Boxing|boxer]] [[Lionel Rose]] who has won a world championship and is a national hero. The boys build an outdoor boxing ring in a field. As they engage in friendly sparring, Paddy forms the ambition of escaping slavery by joining [[Jimmy Sharman]]'s fairground boxing troupe.  Their relationship is also tested by Ed's adolescent attraction to a girl, Amelia, whose family has moved to the property next door.  In the previous year (1967), a [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|federal referendum]] had overwhelmingly determined removal of official discrimination against Aborigines, and given the federal parliament power to make special laws with regard to them. There was simultaneous agitation for other rights, including equal pay for farm workers. However, when Paddy's father enquired whether he could be given wages, his boss Rick Anderson replied that he lacked funds. The Aboriginal family could either continue unpaid or vacate their home on the farm. Michael Parker, whose wife was caring for a new baby, saw no option than to go on working without pay.  The film concludes with Paddy's departure to seek his fortune in boxing, and a reconciliation as Ed apologises for former disloyalty to his friend.

Sex and Death 101
 Roderick Blank ([[Simon Baker]]) is a successful young businessman with a great job as an executive for "Swallows", a high end fast food restaurant chain, and a beautiful fiancée, Fiona Wormwood ([[Julie Bowen]]). On the day of his bachelor party, he is e-mailed a list of all the women he has slept with. Strangely, while the list has 101 names, his fiancée is only number 29. He assumes the list is a prank, courtesy of his best friends Zack ([[Neil Flynn]]) and Lester ([[Dash Mihok]])—until he meets number 30, Carlotta Valdez, who is the stripper at his bachelor party. After sleeping with Carlotta, he realizes the list does, in fact, comprise all of his sexual partners, both past and future.  Roderick cancels his upcoming wedding and begins to sequentially bed all the people on the list. Although he makes a connection with some of the women, he is unable to settle down and is compelled to continue until he has crossed all names off the list. His friends become concerned for his mental well being and convince him to bury the list. Before he does that, he sees only part of the next name, including "Dr." and the first few letters. He falls for Lester's charming and quirky veterinarian ([[Leslie Bibb]]), after believing she is the next name on the list and finding they have much in common, only to discover that she does not return his feelings, and wants to be "just friends". He digs up the list and discovers she was not listed, after which she has an untimely accidental death. He continues on his mission.  Throughout all this, a female vigilante, nicknamed by the media "Death Nell" ([[Winona Ryder]]), has been taking revenge on men who she feels have taken sexual advantage of women. She seduces these men and then drugs them to induce a [[coma]], leaving them behind along with a line of feminist poetry spray painted on the wall or ceiling. But after her most recent conquest, she accidentally leaves behind her drivers license, exposing her real identity, Gillian De Raisx, to the world.  Roderick's precarious mental state is compromised when he realizes the last name on his list is Gillian's. With twenty more names left on the list, he decides to abandon it altogether and takes up various hobbies to keep him from giving in to temptation. After an accident during a bike ride, he is found by a group of female students (all virgins) from a Catholic college who believe that he has been "divinely delivered" to deflower them. Roderick is unable to resist and catapults himself from number 82 through number 99 in the space of an afternoon. He realizes only one woman is left, and then he remembers the girls' bus driver was number 100.  Knowing that Death Nell is the last person on his list (and that he may not survive a night with her) Roderick tries to change his destiny, first by becoming a shut in, and then by tracking down another Gillian de Raisx in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. But when he learns that the Agency are close to catching Death Nell, he has a sudden change of heart. Guilt-stricken over his treatment of his previous conquests, he decides to face the consequences.  Roderick and Gillian meet in a diner, where they share a meal and conversation. Gillian reveals that she was a Poetry/Chemistry student who married young and was forced to perform degrading sexual favors with her husband, who also physically abused her. After his death, which was inadvertently caused by Gillian, she realized that she could dish out similar punishments to other men who treated women badly.  Gillian reveals that she is exhausted from the whole ordeal and unsure if she has the conviction to continue. Roderick and Gillian connect, and agree to each take the sedative together. They take the pills simultaneously, and spend the night together, with "The End" spray painted on the wall behind them.  The epilogue reveals that Roderick and Gillian survived the pills, and that Gillian's name was not the last on the list because of impending death but rather because Roderick decides to remain monogamous with her. They are happily married and have a son. Death Nell's comatose victims are revived and a brief scene at the Agency suggests that Roderick and Gillian's union was fated.

Shadows (2007 film)
   Lazar Perkov is the one man who’s got everything going for him. He’s young, good-looking, has a beautiful wife, lovely little boy, great house and a good job as a hospital physician. In fact, everyone calls him “Lucky.” Nothing’s missing – except maybe Lucky himself, who’s always trying to live up to the expectations of others. Like his bored wife and roguish colleagues. And, above all, his famous physician mother, a driven woman who rose from obscurity to renown with an iron will that crushed all resistance, whether from the living or the dead…  When Lucky is involved in a disastrous car crash and mysteriously saved from a sure death, his life begins to change. He meets strange people: an old man with a baby, an ancient lady speaking a forgotten dialect, a beautiful young woman with a sad secret. Their only message is: “Return what’s not yours. Have respect.” He gradually becomes aware that it is a message from the afterlife, from tormented souls who seem to die over and over again.  But why have they chosen him?  To answer this question, Lucky must finally grow up and become the man he wants to be.  The action begins at Lazar's home where he has a fight with his wife about how messed up his life was. Pissed off from the fight, he goes for a drive. When trying to light a cigarette in his car, without having the seatbelt on, his phone rings — it is his mother. Then the cigarette falls from his mouth in the desperate attempt to grab his mobile phone on the seat next to him, burning him on the arm. Now he loses control over the car, but meanwhile a woman is crossing the road. Lazar's attempt to avoid hitting her is fatal. His car flips, and crashes until he is found hanging off the car's window whose glass had broken in the crash.

Shadows in the Palace
 The film is set amongst a group of ''[[gungnyeo]]'', or palace women in Korea during the time of the [[Joseon dynasty]], and is primarily about the hidden dynamics that unfold between them. Sworn into secrecy, submission, and [[celibacy]], the women of the palace officially devote their lives to the well-being of the royal family. Currently, the kingdom has no heir to the throne, and at such a time, the royal concubine Hee-bin ([[Yoon Se-ah]]) has given birth to a son. The queen mother wishes for the queen to adopt the child as her own, but Hee-bin hesitates proceeding with this, fearing she will be disposed off once the adoption is official.  One morning, as the court maids go about their work, one of them, Wol-ryung ([[Seo Young-hee]]), also Hee-bin's most trusted maid, is found dead, hanging from the rafters of the palace roof. Initially assuming it to be suicide, Chun-ryung ([[Park Jin-hee]]), the royal medic, discovers as she proceeds with the autopsy that Wol-ryung was actually strangled. She also discovers that there are signs that the maid had given birth at some time in the past, which would have been absolutely forbidden under palace rules. Ignoring orders from her superiors to wrap up the case quickly, Chun-ryung sets off in search of answers.  Amidst a tangled web involving suspicion of Wol-ryung's involvement in an affair with a teacher at the nearby school, the torture of a mute court maid, a beheading, and finally the records of the king's nightly visits to his concubine, an elaborate scheme spearheaded by Hee-bin's advisor transpires, where Wol-ryung was chosen to bear the crown prince, and later murdered to hide the truth of the baby's origin. When exposed, the advisor imprisons Chun-ryung, overpowers Hee-bin and makes off with the baby. She is however intercepted in the forest by the ghost of Wol-ryung, and is murdered. The ghost later also visits the royal palace, and kills the queen mother, thus removing the last obstacle between the crown prince and the throne.  The baby is later discovered in the forest by Chun-ryung. The next day, as the palace women mourn the death of the queen mother in white robes, they simultaneously also witness the coronation of the new prince in the arms of Hee-bin and the transfer of power to new hands.

Shanghai Kiss
 Liam Liu is auditioning for a role in a tooth-paste advertisement.  He is rejected after some initial questions by the screeners because he is not considered "[East] Asian" enough.  This begins a glimpse into the casting decision of Hollywood producers, who Liam believes heavily stereotype East Asian men to the point where it is difficult for them to land normal roles.  Liam then takes a city bus home from the audition since his car is towed away, and there, he meets Adelaide Bourbon ([[Hayden Panettiere]]), a young, beautiful, high school student. During the ride home, Liam discovers that Adelaide has been sketching a picture of him.  The two begin to converse and Adelaide sings Liam a song, whereupon they quickly become friends.  Liam feels guilt for becoming friends with such a young girl and Adelaide later asks Liam to go to the prom with her.  He declines, and this serves as the basis for the many times that Liam feels guilty in having a budding friendship with such a young girl.  His friend, Joe Silverman ([[Joel Moore]]), is one of the most vocal opponents of the "friendship", as Joe expresses his belief that no good can come out of what is developing between Liam and Adelaide.  During a scene early in the movie, Liam expresses his frustration in the stereotyping of East Asian men in Hollywood, since he himself is a struggling actor.  Joe reminds Liam that it was Liam's decision to drop out of [[Columbia University]] to pursue a career in acting.  In the "bar scene," as it is known, Joe challenges Liam to ask a Caucasian woman at the bar out. Liam rails against Joe and the woman at the bar, Georgia (Kathleen Lancaster), because she supposedly represents the superficiality and status-seeking of Hollywood and of Caucasian women in the U.S. in general.  Still, Liam is attracted to Georgia and has been in several ''W.G.W.A.G.'' (White Girls With Asian Guys) relationships before in Hollywood.  Nonetheless, Liam takes Joe up on this bar bet and sits down next to Georgia.  In a small period of time, he is able to charm Georgia, saying that her name represents Liam's "favorite Confederate state."  The two sleep together, but Liam weeps after his father calls him while the two are having sex, ostensibly because Liam, while able to have sex with the woman he chose, feels pangs of emptiness from not being connected to his folk, and instead, being lured into the image of success represented by women such as Georgia.  After having sex with Georgia, Liam picks Adelaide up to take her to school. Liam is obviously conflicted as he connects with Adelaide on an intellectual level, but can not get past the difference in their age. Liam then gets a call from his father in New York, informing him that Liam's grandmother has died and has left Liam a small house in Shanghai.  Liam travels to Shanghai, promising to call Adelaide daily while he is there.  Upon arrival, he is greeted by his cousin who speaks English and who has found an older couple to buy Liam's house for him. After spending a night out on the town with his cousin and a call girl named Amy (who he did not have sex with), as well as an awkward late night call from Adelaide at his hotel, Liam goes to meet the buyers of his house. After seeing the view of Shanghai from the house, and being told that the house would sell for five hundred thousand yuan and not five hundred thousand U.S. dollars,<ref>1 Chinese yuan = 0.142763 U.S. dollars (in 2007)</ref> Liam chooses not to sell the house. While at a bar, he meets Micki Yang ([[Kelly Hu]]). Micki is initially resistant to the charms of Liam, but the two slowly tour Shanghai doing things Liam has never done.  Micki is still somewhat skeptical about Liam, since Liam is, in a sense, foreign in his home country and has never visited and knows little about his home-land. After spending the night together, Liam decides to move into his grandmother's house in Shanghai.  Liam returns to L.A. and tells his friends of his plan. After a tearful goodbye with Adelaide, he returns to Shanghai and tries to live as a Chinese person. Unfortunately, Liam is picked up by Micki's gangster boy-friend, of whom Liam was not aware, after he finds out about Liam and Micki's relationship. Pointing out Liam's up-bringing in the U.S., Micki's boy-friend dumps Liam from a limousine in the pouring rain in downtown Shanghai. Liam is reminded of his semiforeign status as he wanders the streets unable to communicate with the people or find his way home. Liam later asks Micki about her boyfriend, and she responds that she is only with him because her family is destitute - her mother raised her and her numerous young siblings alone, and it would greatly aid her family to have access to such money. She also mentioned that Liam can not possibly understand the options one has when one is living a life of abject poverty.  After Micki tells Liam to go back to Los Angeles, he again almost sells the house to the elderly couple, but has another change of heart and decides to leave the house to Micki, who will be able to use the house to abide in with her family and thus will not be forced to remain with her boyfriend because of financial issues.  He returns to the U.S. to reconcile with Adelaide, but she rebukes him as she is leaving for France to attend art school. With a mixed-message good-bye, she goes to France and Liam reconciles with his father, getting a job at Starbuck's and successfully auditioning for an advertisement for a genital herpes treatment. Adelaide later returns to the U.S. and Liam is prepared to meet her upon her arrival to the airport from France. However, as he prepares to walk up to give her some flowers, he sees Adelaide kissing a Caucasian man as they part. Liam walks out of the airport and disposes of the flowers in frustration of himself. As he prepares to leave, however, Adelaide accosts him. When he asks about the man in the airport, she informs Liam that the man was her instructor and that "he's as gay as a pineapple." They agree to restart their relationship on a more solid footing (if for no other reason because she is now of legal age), and he explains that he's "daffy about her." She tells him "anything is possible, that's the beauty of living". The movie ends with the two hugging outside the airport with the song "Home" being sung in the background by Hayden Panettiere.  
Shake, Rattle and Roll IX
  ===Christmas Tree=== Stephen ([[Nash Aguas]]), his mother Myrna ([[Gina Alajar]]), and his two sisters Hazel ([[Lovi Poe]]) and Eunice ([[Sophia Baars]]) planned to visit their Lola Susana ([[Boots Anson-Roa]]) during the Christmas Break. During the long journey, Stephen has a dream concerning his deceased father Chuck ([[Tonton Gutierrez]]): He was running along a forest where he encounters his father's ghost, who encouraged him to be brave for he is the only male member of his family. Chuck's ghost suddenly became a zombie, waking Stephen up, and receiving teases from his little sister.  Upon their arrival in Lola Susana's house, Jong ([[John Prats]]) had already erected their new 8ft tall Christmas Tree. Hazel even hypothesized that it came from the [[Amazon rainforest]] where its kind were a rare species.  A day before the Christmas Eve, the family eagerly decorated it, making it look elegant. However, something eerie grips into the atmosphere. During a night stroll, Stephen noticed Elton John, Jong's parrot, disappeared without a trace. Worse, even Eunice's giraffe doll, Gordon, was found torn to pieces, thus, blaming and resenting the latter's brother. Even their Yaya Sonny ([[John Lapus]]) wonders why the Tree is always getting taller and taller.  [[Christmas Eve]] descended finally. After a sumptuous Christmas feast, the family was ready to sleep. However, Yaya Sonny, wanted to add a couple of Christmas balls. He noticed something strange within the leaves of the tree: green feathers, evidence that the tree supposedly "ate" Elton John. In a worse turn of fate, Sonny was tragically eaten by the Tree itself.  Things began to become tense. Stephen, having heard of the commotions downstairs, wakes his Ate Hazel to investigate. Jong then arrived to the scene next. The three witnessed the horrendous transformation of the Christmas Tree: All those times, there was a monstrous tree, that came from the deepest corners of the same rainforest mentioned earlier, dwelling within the leaves of the Tree itself. Before they could run, Jong was knocked out by the monster. Thinking he was dead, Hazel and Stephen raced to their mother's room, narrating them that the Christmas Tree was truly alive. Myrna dismisses Stephen's story, telling him there were no such things as monsters.  Myrna was wrong: Judging by the stomps heard in the stairs, the Christmas Tree was now upstairs. She peered on the door, only to find out that the monster tree was outside. Danger and tension prevailed over the next events. Myrna warned Lola Susana to stay in the room, while Hazel and Stephen make a diversion, tripping the Christmas Tree.  Hazel and Stephen rushed to the kitchen, while Lola Susana, Myrna and Eunice escaped to the car. Hazel found something: [[acid]]. Stephen also found his Uncle Jong unconscious on the floor. Stephen knew that acid will kill the Tree. He, having experienced being a [[baseball]] player, threw the bottles of acid, missing the first two. At his third turn, the acid went straight into the Tree's mouth, killing it.  ===Bangungot=== Marionne ([[Roxanne Guinoo]]) is a young and beautiful woman, who falls in love with Jerome ([[Dennis Trillo]]). They went on a date at an [[amusement park]]. However, a mysterious woman ([[Eugene Domingo]]) warns Marionne not to sleep otherwise she will die. Before the woman can exit the park, she encounters a red cloaked figure that strangles her, killing her in the process.  In her dorm, Marionne wakes startlingly, remembering it was a dream. Her office mate Tatin ([[Jaymee Joaquin]]) then saw her drawing a picture of the red-cloaked figure: the red-cloaked figure that strangled the woman in her dream. She remembered that her grandfather died of a ''bangungot'' ([[nightmare]]). Tatin said it was nonsense. Marionne, concerned for her grandfather's past, unlocked the latter's room. Shortly after she set foot, eerie things flew in the air.  The young woman was revealed to be a candle sales lady. She and Tatin have been friends. One day, her brother Tonton ([[Jayson Gainza]]) and a handsome man arrived at the shop. This man was Jerome: the same Jerome in Marionne's dream. The latter informed them that he will be leaving for one week; shockingly, he was engaged to a woman named Florence ([[Pauleen Luna]]), a fact that Marionne became jealous of.  Later on, a young girl ([[Andrea Torres]]) wants to order a large candle. Marionne notices the strange-looking parchment with strange words written in ink. She demands what is the girl's purpose for the candle. The latter said that: "if you want to dream of your love ones, and him to you", she must light a candle before sleeping, and chant the words in the parchment. But she must wake up before the candle is consumed otherwise she cannot leave the dream.  Eager to try this, Marionne kept the parchment and did as the girl said. After the ritual was performed, eerie events began to manifest to Jerome and Marionne. The red-cloaked figure reappeared and attempted to strangle the two. Thinking it was a hallucination, they both dismissed it.  Late at night, Marionne visited Jerome in the office, stating that she cannot sleep. She and Jerome began to hallucinate again: the phantom reappeared once more and tries to strangle them again. As they share a kiss of comfort, Florence appeared. Shocked by what she saw, she too was nearly strangled by the phantom, but was comforted by Jerome. Seeing this, Marionne cannot stand this, making her chase the two.  Jerome and Florence walked out of the shop, finally ending up in the peak of an overpass. Florence stumbled and she cannot walk. Meanwhile, the phantom once again reappeared, this time, Jerome confronts it and they both jumped off the overpass. Florence discovered that she too was dreaming.  Marionne, having witnessed of the events before, rushed into the hospital, where she reveals the shocking truth: she and Jerome entered a near-death state already after the spell was performed; this explains why Tonton, Florence and Tatin could not feel Marionne's presence. Florence told them everything, and so as Tatin: in a flashback, Marionne's astral projection saw herself performing the spell, afterwards, she collapsed in her bed, apparently dying. Tatin shook and jerked her up but she would not wake up. Florence's story matched Tatin's: the former found her fiancé hunched in the table but he was in the brink of death in his sleep. Another thing is: Marionne's grandfather did not die of a nightmare, but of a [[heart attack]] and the events happening now is only a ''bangungot'' for Marionne. Jerome, who was on a critical state, dreams of Marionne hugging him very tightly; it was revealed that Marionne was the ''bangungot'' all along. As Marionne and Jerome realize this, Florence cries and asks Jerome to wake up. Jerome tries his best, but Marionne holds him down, determined to spend the eternity with the man she love, but does not love her back. Marionne eventually dies, followed by a struggling Jerome.  ===Engkanto=== A teenage gothic [[band (music)|band]] heads for a gig in a remote province. During the long journey, not many of the young band members talked too much, while, their manager Hans ([[Jojo Alejar]]) keeps complaining why he's the one who should drive. Meanwhile, Tonee ([[Jewel Mische]]) and Ian ([[Felix Roco]]), who were long-estranged couple, ignored each other. Vince ([[Mart Escudero]]), the band's [[leader]] and Richard ([[Matt Evans]]) have a small commotion, only to be stopped by Vince's ex-girlfriend Dang ([[Melissa Ricks]]).  The group stopped into a small store beside the road. The others decided to relax while Vince and Dang disappeared from view. The two latter confronted each other; Vince revealed he will be leaving them soon, a fact that Dang objects strongly.  Back at the store, Lucio (Nanding Josef), a local townsfolk, warned them to stay in sight, for they might be kidnapped by an [[engkanto]] (forest guardian in [[Filipino mythology]]). He then told of the story of his son Paeng ([[Sam Concepcion]]): the latter was gathering firewood when he was suddenly grabbed by someone or something. He then also explained that the engkanto was the reason why they are lost in the middle of nowhere.  Worse, the bus ran out of gas, forcing the band to take refuge in an abandoned resort. Dang, Ian and Tonee then encountered a young and beautiful woman clad in white. Tonee and Ian asked where is the beach. They followed the woman's directions but were lost. Tonee lost her temper but Ian wants to court the young woman. Accidentally, he was bitten by the woman, who revealed to be the engkanto ([[Katrina Halili]]).  Vince then encountered Paeng, the aforementioned boy who was kidnapped by the engkanto. He, Dang and Richard demanded that who did this to him and who is this. As they speak, the engkanto summoned her slaves to hunt the band down. Hans, who was looking for gas, was bitten. Meanwhile, Dang met a retreating Tonee informing the former that Ian was killed by the engkanto and was made into her slave. Suddenly, Tonee too was choked to death.  Paeng and Vince then lured the slaves to the beach, discovering they fear water. They formulated a plan: he and Dang will ward off the slaves while Paeng, Richard and Tikoy (Hector Macaso) refueled the bus. Paeng then noticed the tree beside them; this was supposed to be the engkanto's lair. They must burn it to kill the engkanto.  The engkanto, who stopped in her tracks for she fears water, rushes to Richard and choked him hardly. The young man can hear what the latter was saying: he (Richard) was the one she needed. Paeng, meanwhile tossed the matches in the air, burning the tree and killing the engkanto.  With all things seem to be alright, the remaining band members visit Paeng's home where his father warmly welcomed him. But, something in their plans went horribly wrong: Mang Lucio informs them that destroying an engkanto's home will not kill her, but only leave her temporarily homeless. She will only move into a new dwelling, for she is a spirit of nature. Mang Lucio was right: Richard was kidnapped by the reanimated engkanto and was never seen again. The next day in the resort, the surviving slave of the engkanto, that was hidden in a box, was revealed to have survived.

The visitors are held captive and enrolled by Taro to serve in the army of the [[Great Emperor]]. For the sadistic pleasure of the former [[Japanese people|Japanese]] officers, Yamada organises "inspections" during which the new recruits must prove their devotion to the emperor by sacrificing their lives.  Many years later Shintaro, the son of the fisherman's daughter, finds himself on the island after searching for his father. He learns his father disappeared on the island just before the massacre. He contacts Yamada through the War Veterans Association, who agrees to take him and others to the island. But once they arrive he abandons them and puts Taro in charge. For Shintaro and his comrades this means forced enrolment, military drills and suffering. After months of torture Shintaro and the other captives start to accept Taro's twisted sense of reality. The training intensifies as Taro prepares the recruits to fight a mysterious enemy.  
Shootout at Lokhandwala
 The film opens with shots of brooms and dustpans cleaning dried blood and cartridge casings in and around Swati building at the [[Lokhandwala Complex]].<ref></ref> TVN reporter Meeta Matu ([[Diya Mirza]]) reports that some 3000 rounds of ammunition were discharged by a large police squad at a previously peaceful residential area.  The film moves to the offices of former chief justice turned private prosecutor Dhingra ([[Amitabh Bachchan]]) where he interviews the three leading members of the [[Mumbai Encounter Squad]]: [[Additional Commissioner of Police]] Shamsher S. Khan (Addl.CP S.S. Khan) (referring to [[Aftab Ahmed Khan|A. A. Khan]], played by [[Sanjay Dutt]]), [[Inspector]] Kaviraj Patil ([[Sunil Shetty]]) and Police constable Javed Sheikh ([[Arbaaz Khan (Indian actor)|Arbaaz Khan]]). The main film timeline is the extended interview of the three officers by Dhingra; as the officers answer Dhingra's questions, the film flashes back to show the incidents.  Dhingra asks about the Encounter Squad. Khan explains that he hand-picked 27 of Mumbai police's best enlisted men and officers. He borrowed the concept from the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] [[SWAT]] ([[Special Weapons And Tactics]]) team to help combat crime. The film flashes back to show Khan selecting his men and putting them through intensive physical and mental training to be "fast, efficient and deadly." Dhingra is hardly impressed: He points out that if Khan "shoots to kill" he is no different from the gangsters he seeks to destroy.  Dhingra asks why Khan felt he had to do this. Khan explains that following [[Operation Blue Star]] in 1984, several [[Sikh]] terrorists fled to Mumbai and began establishing a base in the city. They engaged in violence, extortion and other subversive tactics to grow their operations. The film flashes back to show Sub Inspector Mhatre ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]), a very brave officer and disciple of Khan, pursuing and subsequently getting shot down by a group of Sikh terrorists. Khan is deeply frustrated when the Mumbai police, mired in internal bureaucracy and corruption, fail to act. He obtains clearance from the police commissioner Krishnamurthy (played by the real [[Aftab Ahmed Khan|A. A. Khan]]) and sets out after the militants. Khan asks Meeta Matu ([[Diya Mirza]]) to cover the incident so as to deter future terrorists. True to Khan's words, he successfully "[[Encounter killings by police|encounters]]" (it indicates summarily gunning down criminals; [[extrajudicial killing]]s is the term accepted internationally) the terrorists who shot PSI Mhatre. As per [[Aftab Ahmed Khan]] the encounter with Khalistani Extremist was more dangerous and tough than ''Shootout at Lokhandwala''.  The film segues into the life of Maya (referring to Mumbai gangster [[Maya Dolas|Mahindra Dolas]] though the film never mentions Dolas specifically; played by [[Vivek Oberoi]]). Maya is the second-in-command of the "big boss" in Dubai (a clear reference to [[Dawood Ibrahim]] though the film does not mention his name) and runs Dawood's criminal activities in Mumbai. Maya recruits Bhua (referring to [[Dilip Buwa]], played by [[Tusshar Kapoor]]) after successfully hatching a plot to eliminate Bhua's old gang led by Ashok Joshi. At this point, Maya and Bhua are at the top of Mumbai's underworld, reporting directly to the big boss in Dubai.  Things heat up when Khan recognises, through his network of spies and informers, that Maya is responsible for several criminal and possibly terrorist activities. Around this time, Maya's ambitions, fuelled by his Aai's ([[Amrita Singh]]) insistence, grow to the point where he wishes to assert his independence from Dubai and take over Mumbai himself.  Khan's ATS now focuses on eliminating Maya and Bhua, and begins a dangerous cat-and-mouse game where neither side shows any overt aggression but tries to disable the adversary by tactical manoeuvre. Khan launches "visits" to the criminals' families to try to "persuade" them to counsel the criminals to surrender. In turn, Maya and his men return the "visit" by approaching the cops at social situations. Maya visits Khan at a restaurant where Khan is having dinner with his family. Maya quietly tells Khan: "This is between your men and mine. Leave the families out of it." Khan retorts: "I did this to give you an opportunity to come clean. But now it appears that any resolution hangs off the barrel of a gun."  Maya's rage intensifies when he gets thrown out by prominent city builder Wadhwani (based on real life builder and politician [[Gopal Rajwani]], owner of the building that the movie was set in). Maya had demanded 4&nbsp;million protection money; Wadhwani claimed to deal directly with Dubai. Maya kidnaps Wadhwani's snivelling, overweight kid. When Wadhwani complains, the big boss asks Maya to cut it out and return the child immediately. Maya quietly informs the boss that he has upped his demands and that he wants to reign supreme in Mumbai.  The film also explores the personal lives of the protagonists. Khan's wife Rohini played by ([[Neha Dhupia]]) is unable to bear his constant neglect of his family life. She files for divorce. Patil's divorce is nearly upon him, too. In the enemy camp, Buwa has shacked up with a bar dancer Tanu ([[Aarti Chhabria]]) and is unable to spend any quality time with her. Fellow criminals Phatu (estranged from his parents) and RC ([[Shabbir Ahluwalia]]) (plagued by ghost-like visions of an innocent family he gunned down) have similar troubles.  It all comes to a head in November 1991. The five criminals including Maya and Buwa secure themselves, while holding Wadhwani's kid, in a flat at Swati building in Lokhandwala. Khan is tipped off of the location by an informant. (In Dhingra's questioning, Khan allegedly also received a call from the big boss in Dubai. Khan vehemently denies this.) Khan assembles a large squad of cops and lays siege to the location. He announces over the bullhorn that residents are advised to stay indoors and bolt their windows.  A long and devastating gun battle begins. The criminals launch rocket propelled grenades from their flat and try to escape. But they are overwhelmed by police fire, and all five criminals are eventually slain. The battle lays waste to the building: Film shots show the staircases, hallways and several civilian flats completely pulverised by gunfire. Reporter Meeta Matu covers the action live.  Up to this point, Dhingra has been negative and denigrating of Khan and his efforts with the ATS. He cites press reports and civilian complaints that condemn Khan (and the ATS) of unilateral and unwarranted excessive force in a residential locality. Charges are brought against Khan and the ATS. But when Dhingra rises to defend them as their appointed counsel, he, in a surprising twist, presents an unconventional argument as defence.  The film ends with Khan and the ATS being acquitted.  
Shoot 'Em Up (film)
 At a bus stop in a rough part of town, a [[Drifter (person)|drifter]] named Smith sees a pregnant woman on the verge of giving birth while fleeing a [[hitman]]. Following them into a warehouse, Smith kills the hitman by stabbing him in the face with a carrot and retrieves the woman's pistol. As more thugs arrive the woman goes into labor, and Smith delivers her baby boy during a shootout. Pursued by head assassin Hertz, the woman is shot and killed; Smith narrowly escapes with the newborn.  Leaving the baby in a park, Smith hopes someone will adopt the child but a passing woman is killed with a shot from Hertz's sniper rifle. Realizing that Hertz is trying to kill the baby, Smith saves him and tries unsuccessfully to leave him with a prostitute named Donna Quintano. Hertz soon arrives at the brothel and tortures Donna for information; Smith returns and kills his henchmen. After a brief confrontation in the hallway, Smith shoots Hertz and leaves with Donna and the baby. Having secretly worn a [[bulletproof vest]], though, Hertz is alive albeit wounded.  Taking Donna to his hideout, Smith realizes that the baby (whom he names Oliver) stops crying when he hears heavy-metal music; he concludes that his mother lived near a heavy-metal club. Pursued by Hertz, Smith shoots his way out of the hideout and he and Donna head to a nearby club. Above the club they discover an apartment with medical equipment and two dead, pregnant women; Smith concludes that the women were all impregnated with one man's sperm so they could give birth to matching [[bone marrow]] donors.  While they are having sex in a motel room, Smith and Donna are attacked by masked men; Smith notices that his assailants' weapons are Hammerson models, unavailable to the public. He brings Donna and Oliver to a war museum and hides them in a [[M24 Chaffee]] tank for safekeeping. Smith infiltrates the Hammerson factory, seeing Hertz and Hammerson saying that they do not want the [[Right to keep and bear arms in the United States|right to bear arms]] in accordance with the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] repealed by the next President, and notices that Hammerson owns a [[German Shepherd]] named Duchess. Smith booby-traps the facility with an array of firearms, allowing him to kill the thugs and escape.  He sees an article about Senator Rutledge, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential candidate who favors stricter gun laws. Smith deduces that Rutledge has [[cancer]] and requires a bone-marrow transplant, which is why he had surrogates impregnated with his sperm (and why Hertz and Hammerson want Oliver dead). If the infants die, the senator would not receive a transplant and would be unable to run for president. Smith tells Donna to leave town and contacts one of Rutledge's henchmen to request an appointment. Meeting on a plane, the senator confirms Smith's suspicions and Smith notices dog hair on Rutledge's trousers.  Deducing that the hair belongs to Duchess and the senator made a deal with Hammerson, Smith takes Rutledge hostage. Hertz emerges from the aircraft cabin and divulges that he and Rutledge had reached a mutual agreement to push gun ownership rights when the senator is elected president before dying from cancer. To reverse the deal, Smith kills the senator, and parachutes from the plane to escape from Hertz. He kills several pursuing henchmen, is himself shot and collapses after he lands. Smith awakens in Hammerson's mansion; Hertz tortures him, breaking his fingers to learn where he sent Donna and Oliver. As Hertz prepares to cut Smith's eyes, Smith breaks free and kills Hammerson and several thugs. Cornered and struggling to use his gun, Smith places live bullets between his broken fingers and detonates them with a fireplace, critically wounding Hertz. As Smith and Hertz grab pistols and struggle to kill each other, Smith fires first and kills Hertz.  He boards a bus with Duchess, and stops at an ice-cream parlor where Donna works as a waitress while watching Oliver. A group of amateur armed robbers enters the parlor; his hands in bandages, Smith shoots them by using a carrot to pull the trigger.  
Shortcut to Happiness
 Jabez Stone ([[Alec Baldwin]]) is a desperate, down on his luck writer who hits rock bottom when his close friend, Julius Jensen ([[Dan Aykroyd]]), finds success. In his attempts to get his work published, he meets a beautiful stranger ([[Jennifer Love Hewitt]]) who offers him a chance at fame and fortune in exchange for his [[soul]].

A book deal, money, women, notoriety, Stone now has it all. However, despite the success, he is losing the friendship, respect and trust of those around him. Coming to the realization that he didn't quite get everything he bargained for, Stone begs the Devil to release him from their deal. When the Devil scoffs he turns to famed orator Daniel Webster ([[Anthony Hopkins]]). The two conclude that they should take the battle to court with Webster defending Stone in an otherworldly trial against the Devil in the ultimate battle of wits in a fight over the fate of Stone's soul.  
Shooter (2007 film)
 Bob Lee Swagger reluctantly leaves a self-imposed exile at the request of Colonel Isaac Johnson, who appeals to him to help track down an assassin that is planning to shoot the president. Johnson gives him a list of three cities where the President is scheduled to visit, and Swagger assesses a site in [[Philadelphia]] as the most likely. This turns out to be a set-up; while Swagger is working with Johnson's agents to find the rumored assassin, the [[Ethiopia]]n [[archbishop]] is shot instead while standing next to the president. Swagger is then shot by a police officer but manages to escape. The agents tell the police that Swagger is the shooter, and a [[Manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] ensues. He encounters a rookie FBI [[special agent]], Nick Memphis, disarms him, and steals his car.  After his escape, Swagger takes refuge with Sarah Fenn, widow of his late [[Spotter (sniping)|spotter]] and close friend, killed years before in a mission in Africa. He later convinces her to help him contact Memphis with information on the conspiracy. Memphis is blamed for Swagger's escape and is informed that he will face disciplinary review but argues that, given Swagger's training and experience, it is surprising that the president survived and the archbishop standing several feet away was killed. He independently learns that Swagger may have been framed for the assassination and is further made suspicious when he learns that the officer that shot Swagger was himself shot dead just hours later in a mugging.  When the agents realize their secret is compromised, they kidnap Memphis and attempt to stage his suicide. Swagger tails them and kills the captors. The two then join forces and visit a firearms expert who provides information on the FBI's ballistics report and a short list of people capable of taking a shot from a distance of one mile or more. Armed with this, they plot to capture the ex-sniper who they think is the real assassin. Once they find him, he commits suicide after revealing that the archbishop was actually the real target and was murdered to prevent him revealing U.S. involvement in the massacre of an Eritrean village. The massacre was carried out on behalf of a consortium of American corporate oil interests headed by corrupt [[United States Senate|Senator]] Charles Meachum. Swagger records the ex-sniper's confession of his involvement in the African massacre and then, with Memphis' assistance, escapes from an ambush by mercenaries.  Meanwhile, other rogue mercenaries have kidnapped Sarah to lure Swagger out of hiding. With his new evidence and [[cat and mouse]] strategy, Swagger and Memphis are able to rescue her when Colonel Johnson and Senator Meachum arrange a meeting to exchange their hostage for the evidence of their wrongdoing. The Senator is allowed to escape, while Swagger and Memphis surrender to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].  Later, Swagger is brought before U.S. Attorney General Russert and the FBI director in a closed-door meeting with Colonel Johnson, Memphis, and Sarah also present. Swagger quickly clears his name by loading a round into his rifle (which is there as evidence since it was supposedly used in the killing), aims it at the Colonel and pulls the trigger—which fails to fire. Swagger explains that every time he leaves his house, he removes the [[firing pin]]s from all his guns, replacing them with slightly shorter ones, thus rendering them inoperable until he returns. Although Swagger is exonerated, Colonel Johnson cannot be charged with his crime as the Eritrean massacre was outside American legal jurisdiction. The attorney general tells Swagger that he himself must abide by the law: "It's not the [[Wild West]] where you can clean up the streets with a gun, even though sometimes that's exactly what's needed." Russert then orders Swagger released and exonerates him of all charges.   Afterwards, as Johnson and Senator Meachum plan their next move, Swagger breaks in and kills both conspirators, arranging for the house to blow up as if by accident. In a final scene, he drives away with Sarah.  
Shoot on Sight
 Tariq Ali (played by [[Naseeruddin Shah]]), a Muslim police commander of Scotland Yard, is asked to hunt down suspected [[Suicide attack|suicide-bombers]] against the backdrop of the 7 July bombings in London. Ali's task becomes more  complicated as an innocent Muslim is killed by armed police on the [[London Underground|Underground]]. Ali ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]), a Lahore-born British citizen married to an English woman with two children, is himself distrusted by his colleagues, despite his long service in the Metropolitan Police.  
Shotgun Stories
 Son Hayes ([[Michael Shannon]]) wakes up and gets dressed, revealing that he has scars from a shotgun blast on his back. He meets his younger brothers, Boy (Douglas Ligon) and Kid (Barlow Jacobs), who live in a van and a tent respectively, saying that his wife Annie has left him over his gambling habit and inviting them to live in his house. Son and Kid earn meager livings at a fish farm, where workers take bets on how Son received his scars; Boy is an unsuccessful basketball coach at the local middle school. One night, while Son is researching his gambling system, the boys' estranged mother arrives to announce that their estranged father (from whom she has long been divorced) has just died.  The brothers crash the funeral, where their father's second family is mourning. Son delivers a scathing commentary on their father, especially for callously abandoning them to be raised by their hateful mother, while going off to lovingly raise a second set of sons meanwhile forgetting, for the most part, his first set of sons.  In the process, Son nearly starts a brawl with his four half-brothers. The eldest half-brother, Mark (Travis Smith), vows revenge and starts a chain of violent confrontations. Meanwhile, Annie returns and tries to salvage her relationship with Son, but Son is unwilling to give up gambling. Kid plans on marrying his girlfriend, Cheryl, should he get an expected raise, but worries about providing for her and staying faithful. After Mark kills Boy's dog by leaving a poisonous snake in its water bowl, Kid attacks and kills Mark, but is himself severely injured in the fight and dies in the hospital. Son and Boy are unaware that Mark's brothers Stephen and John were involved in the fight until after Kid's funeral, when an acquaintance named Shampoo tells them.  Son then goes to their mother, who is coldly indifferent to everything that is happening, to inform her that Kid has just died, while condemning her for raising her sons to be full of hate toward their half-brothers, before leaving her for the last time.  The confrontations between the remaining brothers escalate, with Son on one side and John and Stephen Hayes on the other side unwilling to let the matter rest, despite their brother Cleaman's attempts to stop the feud. Son and Boy invade their half-brothers' farm and attack Stephen, but are interrupted and hospitalized by the remaining family and other farm workers. Annie and Cheryl are left grieving and bewildered by the continued fighting. Boy purchases a shotgun and holds Cleaman at gunpoint, but hesitates after seeing the man's sons, and leaves. Boy expresses worry that Son will kill himself trying to protect him from the half-brothers. He recalls how Son received his scars while protecting him and Kid.  The second family arms themselves with shotguns on their farm, bracing for a shootout. Boy arrives at the farm unarmed and states that he is done fighting, offering a truce. The less combative half-brothers force Stephen to accept the truce, but he worries that Son will not hold to the agreement. Afterwards, Son awakens from his coma. Boy returns to Son, who recuperates from his injuries. The movie ends with the beginning of fall, with Cleaman seeing his youngest brother John off to college, Boy coaching again, and Son living at home with Annie and their son, Carter. The final scene of the movie shows Son and Boy enjoying a peaceful afternoon on the porch with Carter.

Shrooms (film)
 American student Tara and her college friends visit Ireland to meet with local resident and friend Jake, and go camping in woodlands surrounding a long-disused children's home. While collecting psilocybin mushrooms for later consumption, Tara eats a [[Amanita phalloides|deathcap mushroom]] and suffers a seizure after which she experiences dream-like trances in which she begins having premonitions of future events.  Around the evening camp fire, with Tara resting in her tent, Jake tells a ghost story of the empty children's home nearby, and of a violent sadistic monk who survived an assault by one of his charges, as revenge for killing his twin brother. Overhearing this causes Tara to have premonitions of the murders of her friends.  After a deathly row with his girlfriend and the others, aggressive [[jock (athlete)|jock]] Bluto drinks some of the hallucinogenic tea (supposedly for all to share in the morning) and experiences a [[psychedelic experience|trip]] which culminates in his murder, seemingly at the hands of the rogue monk from the children's home.  The following morning, unconcerned by Bluto's disappearance&nbsp;– the others consume the mushroom tea, only to become separated from one another in the woods while under its effects. The three women, arguing and squabbling, get lost until they themselves are split, and Holly and Lisa are violently murdered&nbsp;– in accordance with Tara's continuing visions&nbsp;– after an encounter with local woodsmen Ernie and Bernie.  Jake and Troy find Tara on the bank of a river, and tell her to meet them in the abandoned home to summon help. Upon investigating the property, Troy is apparently killed by the monk, and Jake escapes by jumping from a high window, breaking his leg as he lands.  Tara finds him and the two flee the [[Haunted House|haunted]] scene. Then, while resting his leg, he is murdered.  Tara awakes as a [[Garda Síochána|Garda]] helicopter hovers over the camp, and is dispatched into an ambulance as the sole survivor.  As her mobile phone rings, she experiences a rapid flashback and realizes that the deathcap mushroom caused ''her'' to murder all of her friends. She asks the paramedic for help. Everything becomes quiet until we see her bloody hands holding a pair of bloody scissors which suggests that she has killed the paramedic. The film ends with Tara running in the woods.  
Shrek the Third
  [[Prince Charming (Shrek)|Prince Charming]] vows that he will become King of Far, Far Away and avenge the death of his mother, the [[Fairy Godmother (Shrek)|Fairy Godmother]]. Meanwhile, King Harold is dying and his ogre son-in-law [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] and daughter [[Princess Fiona]] are to succeed him. Shrek's attempts at trying to serve as the Regent during the King's medical leave end in disaster, and he insists that an ogre as king is a bad idea and that there must be someone else to rule the kingdom. Before he dies, Harold tells Shrek of another heir: his nephew, [[Arthur Pendragon (Shrek)|Arthur "Artie" Pendragon]]. Prince Charming goes to the Poison Apple tavern and persuades fairy tale villains to fight for their "happily ever after" by appealing to the defeats given in their stories.  Shrek, [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] and [[Puss in Boots]] set out to retrieve Artie; as they are sailing away, Fiona reveals to Shrek that she is pregnant, much to Shrek's horror, as he believes he isn't capable of raising children. The trio journey to Worcestershire Academy, an elite magical boarding school, where they discover Artie is a scrawny 16-year-old underachiever picked on by everyone. At the school [[pep rally]], Shrek tells Artie he is going to be king of Far Far Away. Artie is excited until Donkey and Puss inadvertently frighten him by discussing the responsibilities of being king. As a result, Artie becomes afraid of being king and tries taking control of the ship to go back to Worcestershire and as he and Shrek fight over the wheel, it breaks causing the ship to crash on a remote island, where they meet Artie's retired wizard teacher, [[Merlin (Shrek)|Merlin]].  Meanwhile, Charming and the other villains attack the castle, but Wolfie, Pinocchio, Gingy, the Three Little Pigs and the Blind Mice stall them long enough for Fiona and her mother Queen Lillian to escape along with [[Snow White]], [[Rapunzel]], [[Cinderella (Shrek)|Cinderella]], [[Sleeping Beauty]], and Doris the Ugly Stepsister. One of the Pigs accidentally blurts out that Shrek has gone to retrieve Arthur, and Prince Charming sends Captain Hook and his pirates to track down Shrek. The ladies are put in a tower after Rapunzel betrays them when she falls in love with Charming.  Captain Hook and his pirates track Shrek and his friends to Merlin's island, where they attempt to capture Shrek alive and defeat the others. Shrek and Artie defeat the villains, and Hook mentions Charming and the takeover of Far Far Away. Concerned for his wife and future child, Shrek urges Artie to return to Worcestershire. Instead, Artie cons Merlin into using his magic to send them to Far Far Away. The spell works, but causes Puss and Donkey to accidentally switch bodies. They find Pinocchio and learn that Charming plans to kill Shrek as part of a play. Charming's men arrive, but Artie tricks the knights into not taking them into custody and they break into the castle during rehearsals for the play. Caught in Charming's dressing room, the four are taken captive.  Charming prepares to kill Artie, believing he is the next king. To save Artie's life, Shrek tells Charming that Artie was a pawn to take his place as King of Far Far Away. Charming believes Shrek and allows an angry Artie to leave. Donkey and Puss are imprisoned with Fiona and the ladies, where Fiona grows frustrated with their lack of initiative. Fiona's mom, Queen Lillian, expertly smashes an opening in the stone wall of the prison with a [[headbutt]]. While the princesses launch a rescue mission for Shrek, Donkey and Puss free Gingy, Pinocchio, the wolf and pigs, and [[Dragon (Shrek)|Dragon]] and Donkey's children. They encounter Artie, still angry, but Puss and Donkey mollify him by explaining that Shrek lied to Charming to save Artie's life.  By nightfall, Charming stages a [[Musical theatre|musical]] in front of the kingdom. Just as Charming is about to kill Shrek, Fiona, along with Puss, Donkey, the princesses and the fairy tale characters confront the villains. Artie shows up and convinces the villains that just because they are being treated like losers does not mean that they have to be losers. Touched by Artie's speech, all the villains agree to give up their evil ways. An infuriated Charming refuses to listen, and lunges at Artie with his sword, but Shrek blocks the blow, so Charming attacks him instead. Shrek, who seems fatally injured, informs Charming that he needs to work on his aim and that the Prince needs to keep looking for his own happily ever after. As Shrek pushes Prince Charming aside, Dragon deliberately knocks over Rapunzel's tower, which crushes him to death.  Artie is then crowned king, and takes the throne. While the kingdom celebrates, Merlin restores Puss and Donkey to their correct bodies, accidentally switching their tails temporarily. Shrek and Fiona finally return to the swamp, becoming the parents of [[List of Shrek characters#Farkle, Fergus, & Felicia|ogre triplets]], and quickly coping with the help of Puss, Lillian, Donkey and Dragon.  
Sick Nurses
 In a run-down, suburban [[Bangkok]] hospital, young Dr. Tar (Wichan Jarujinda) and seven nurses have been running a scheme to sell dead bodies on the black market. However, one nurse, Tahwaan (Chol Wachananont), has found out that her boyfriend, Dr. Tar, has been having an affair with her sister, Nook (Chidjun Rujiphan). Growing tired of the body-selling scam and enraged by her sister and boyfriend's betrayal, Tahwaan threatens to call the police.  However, before Tahwaan can take action, the doctor and six resident nurses at the hospital strap Tahwaan to an operating table, kill her, and then wrap her in a black plastic garbage bag. They then dump her in the trunk of the doctor’s car, where her corpse will be kept on dry ice until it can be sold.  All the women have their own obsessions and weaknesses. The spirit of Tahwaan uses these obsessions to torment and ultimately kill the other six nurses. Scenes shown toward the end of the film indicate that many of these obsessions were in part encouraged by Dr. Tar, or in some cases, used by him to seduce some of the women. For example, Aeh ([[Kanya Rattanapetch]]) seems unhealthily attracted to material possession such as jewelry, dresses, and handbags. One brief scene shows Dr. Tar giving Aeh a handbag that was shown sewn to her head and neck earlier in such a manner that when Nook tries to undo the stitching, Aeh is left decapitated.  It is eventually revealed that Tahwaan was once a homosexual male who had undergone a sex change so that he could marry Dr. Tar. She finally kills her own sister by being literally reborn through her and as she stares at Tar, she mutters "marry me" and the screen goes black  
Sick Girl
  ''Sick Girl'' is the story of Izzy Shea ([[Leslie Andrews]]), a girl who wants to protect her younger brother, have sex with her older brother and [[torture]] everyone else out in the barn.  Izzy is raising her younger brother, Kevin, by herself. Their parents are deceased and her older brother, Rusty, is away in the [[U.S. Marine Corps|Marines]]. When Izzy learns that her little brother is being bullied at school, she does what any unstable, [[psychopath]]ic, homicidal sister would do.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002A00IXW Sick Girl (Special Edition DVD) (2007)]</ref>  The movie starts out with Izzy waiting for the school bus.  In the back are two popular girls who make several snide remarks about her.  One of the girl's boyfriend is following the bus route in his car with his friend.  The girls drop a pair of panties out the window, and if her boyfriend finds them, he'll be rewarded.  After Izzy attacks one of the nuns on the bus for seemingly no reason, she's kicked off and begins to walk back along the road.  She runs into the two boys, and lures the friend out of the car.  She kills him, and the other boy quickly discovers the scene.  Izzy chases him across a field and tackles him.  The scene ends, and now we see Izzy cleaning herself up in a bathroom.  She is covered in blood and is completely unfazed by this.  Clips are shown of Izzy finding a gun in the boys' car, and her holding the school bus hostage, seemingly killing everyone.  She chases the two popular girls off the bus, and with the gun and a can of gasoline, she quickly catches one of the girls.  The other watches in horror as Izzy kills her friend.  Izzy returns home, and we see a flashback sequence of Rusty training Izzy how to fight in their garage.  The two share a moment of sibling fondness, but it is cut short by the arrival of Rusty's girlfriend.  The flashback sequence ends, and Izzy finds their family friend, Barnie, teaching Kevin how to throw a punch.  Izzy soon learns the motives behind the lesson: Barn saw some school bullies hassling Kevin after school.  Izzy decides she'll try to help defend her brother, but Kevin brushes her off, saying he can handle it himself.  He then asks why Rusty hasn't called, pointing out that another kid's father is stationed where Rusty is, and he calls all the time.  Izzy gets really mad and screams at Kevin, saying that Rusty is the greatest Marine to ever live.  Kevin is shocked by her reaction, but quickly recovers.  With another flashback, we see Rusty informing Izzy he's joining the Marines, leaving her to watch Kevin.  Izzy kisses him, and Rusty walks away, shocked.  Back in present times, she opens the trunk of the car she stole from the two boys.  In the back are the boyfriend and the other school girl.  Both are bound and gagged (and the girl with her panties that she had dropped from the bus), but the boy looks unconscious or dead.  The girl begs for release, but Izzy only taunts her, showing no remorse.  Kevin and Barn talk in a restaurant, and Kevin reveals that his teacher's rat, Edward, has gone missing.  The teacher asks his students to please return the rat, no questions asked.  After school, Tommy—the bully—and his two minions corner Kevin.  They have been starving Edward, and plan on letting Edward feed on Kevin—whether their motives are real or not is interrupted by Izzy.  The three bullies run off, and Izzy promises to take Edward back to the teacher.  Kevin thanks her, and hurries off to his ride home with Barn.  Izzy does not return the rat, but goes to the teacher anyway.  There, she threatens him, saying that he better take better care of Kevin than he did the rat.  As one of Tommy's friends is walking home, Izzy drives up alongside him and begins to question him.  It is revealed that Tommy is in the trunk of the car, and Izzy kidnaps Rudi after her interrogation.  The other friend, Corey, is kidnapped by Izzy from his house, and the three are taken to the shore of a nearby lake.  She torments Tommy, saying that he'll only beat up those who are weaker than he is, which is only okay if you also take on things bigger than you.  That being said, Tommy drowns Rudi in the lake after Izzy's encouragement.  After Rudi dies, Tommy is then told to kill Corey by slitting his throat.  Corey protests, and Tommy stabs him in the back.  Izzy is holding her three hostages—the school girl and her boyfriend, and Tommy—in the barn, as well as Edward the rat.  After toying with them a little, Izzy puts a sack over Tommy’s head, knocks him out with a shovel, and lets Edward feast on him.  Later, she leaves Edward on the teacher’s porch.  Because Kevin has a passion for Bonsai trees, Izzy breaks several of Tommy’s limbs with a hammer, and using Christmas lights, ties him up in a gruesome fashion.  Kevin, Barnie, and Izzy open their Christmas presents.  Kevin opens a package from Izzy and finds the gun that she had stolen from the two boys.  Barnie thinks it’s fake, but Izzy tells him it’s real.  Barnie questions her motives, angry that she’d give a young kid such a gift. On the evening news, Izzy discovers that the police think that the boyfriend, Michael, along with the other schoolgirl, were involved in the ‘school bus massacre’, and the disappearance of the school bullies.  The police disclose information about the last sightings of them, which includes a description of Michael’s car.  Izzy burns it, and as she walks back along the road, and a guy driving by gives her a lift.  Izzy remains wary of him, but he doesn’t try to harm her.  The subject of family comes up, and Izzy tells him she’s already married—to a Marine—and has one child, but wants another one when her husband returns from the war.  Back at home, Izzy is tormented by a flashback of Rusty just before he left kissing his girlfriend goodbye.  The flashback enrages her, and she quickly goes to the girlfriend’s house and suffocates her.  The following morning, Izzy goes to the barn to her two remaining hostages.  She cuts off the penis of Michael, and puts together a makeshift strap-on with a large spike attached to a piece of wood.  Meanwhile, Barnie and Kevin return home from grocery shopping.  As Izzy begins to rape Stephanie with the strap-on, Barnie enters the barn, and is shocked to find Izzy’s sick experiments.  She impales him with an axe, and as Barnie falls to the ground, Kevin is revealed standing behind him, and he too sees the torture.  He runs inside the house, and Izzy follows him.  She tries to calm him, but he takes the gun and shoots himself in the head before her eyes.  She becomes hysterical, and burns down the barn.  In a flashback to an undetermined previous time, two Marines go to her house.  Although there is no sound in this scene, it’s obvious they are there to tell her that Rusty died in the war.  She lashes out at them, and the movie ends.  
The Simpsons Movie
 While performing on [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Geography, climate, and environment|Lake Springfield]], the band [[Green Day]] perishes when the lake's pollution dissolves their barge, following an audience revolt after frontman [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] proposes an environmental discussion. At their memorial, [[Grampa Simpson|Grampa]] foresees the destruction of the town, but only [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] takes this seriously. Later that day, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] dares [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] to skateboard naked to [[Krusty Burger]] and Bart is arrested by [[Chief Wiggum]]. Bart considers their neighbor [[Ned Flanders]] a better father figure after Homer refuses to take responsibility for the incident. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and a new Irish friend named [[Colin (The Simpsons Movie)|Colin]] convince the entire town to clean their lake.  Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger and names it "[[Spider-Man|Spider Pig]]" (later "[[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Plopper]]", and simply "Plopper"), and stores the pig's [[feces]] (and some of his own) in a [[silo]], until Marge tells him to safely dispose of the waste. Homer initially intends to take his silo to the waste management plant, but after [[Lenny Leonard|Lenny]] calls to tell him that [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Lard Lad Donuts|Lard Lad Donuts]] has been shut down due to health violations and is giving away free donuts, Homer impatiently dumps the silo straight into the lake, polluting it much worse than before. Moments later, a squirrel jumps into the lake and becomes severely mutated; Flanders and Bart (who bond after Homer humiliates Bart) discover the creature before the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] captures it. [[Russ Cargill]], head of the EPA, presents five "unthinkable" options to [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] to keep the town's pollution contained. The slow-witted president picks option 3 without reading it, and Springfield is enclosed in a [[Domed city|large glass dome]]. When the police discover Homer's silo in the lake, and his responsibility for sealing Springfield in the dome, the townspeople of Springfield except for the Flanders family form an angry mob and advance on the Simpsons' home to kill Homer, but the family escapes the town through a [[sinkhole]], which then destroys their house. With the EPA on their trail, the Simpsons flee to [[Alaska]]. On the way, Homer tries to make some money at a carnival by riding a motorcycle around the inside of a metal cage, which he accomplishes with the aid of Lisa.  After three months of futile escape attempts, Springfield's residents finally make a crack in the dome; pointing out the damage, Cargill manipulates Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's destruction. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring [[Tom Hanks]] for a new [[Grand Canyon]] on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children want to go back to save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Meanwhile, Marge and the children are captured by the EPA after a conversation of theirs is overheard by the [[National Security Agency|NSA]]. After a mysterious [[Inuit]] shaman saves him from a [[polar bear]], Homer has an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] and decides to return to Springfield to save the town from danger.  As Homer arrives, a helicopter lowers a small but powerful bomb down a rope through a hole in the dome. While Homer climbs to the top of the dome, the townspeople attempt to climb the rope to escape through the still-opened hole, but Homer slides down the rope and knocks them off along with the bomb. After reconciling with Bart, Homer drives a motorcycle along the dome, inspired by the earlier carnival attraction. As a passenger of the motorcycle, Bart throws the bomb through the hole; seconds later it detonates, shattering the dome and freeing the town. Cargill arrives personally and prepares to kill Homer with a shotgun, but [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]] knocks him out with a boulder. The town finally praises and forgives Homer, who rides into the sun rise with Marge and Maggie, whereupon the townspeople restore Springfield to normal. As a symbol of their gratitude, the Simpsons and their friends begin to rebuild [[The Simpsons house|the family's house]].  
Silk (2007 film)
 The film opens showing an unidentified woman bathing in a [[hot spring]] as an unidentified man describes a woman's skin.  Hervé ([[Michael Pitt]]), in 19th century France, is a military officer, because that is what his father wants. He is happy when he gets the opportunity to change his profession to that of trader of [[silkworm]] eggs. Because in Europe [[History of silk#Decline in the European silk industry|silkworms are affected by a disease]] ([[pébrine]]), he is sent to Africa to get healthy eggs. (The film shows only a brief desert scene.)  Since the African silkworms are affected too, he is sent to Japan, even though at that time (the [[Bakumatsu]] period) almost all of Japan was off-limits to foreigners. The journey is by [[carriage]] and [[train]], a [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] of horses through Asia, the boat trip from the Asian continent to Japan, and guided, blindfolded, on horseback to the Japanese village where he can buy the eggs from a local baron, Hara Jubei ([[Kōji Yakusho]]).  During his stay in the village he becomes obsessed with Jubei's unnamed [[concubine]] ([[Sei Ashina]]). On his second journey there, she gives him a note in Japanese, and he has sex with another girl handed to him by her. Having traded more eggs than on his first trip, Hervé delays his departure by two days in the hope of seeing the girl again. At home Hervé's love remains secret, and though he seems happy with his wife, Hélène, they remain childless. Hervé seeks out a French-Japanese [[brothel]] owner in Lyon, Madame Blanche ([[Miki Nakatani]]), known for giving the small blue flowers that she wears to her clients, who translates the note for him as: "Come back or I shall die". Madame Blanche advises Hervé to "forget about her, she won't die".  The third time, Baldabiou ([[Alfred Molina]]) wants to send him to China, since [[Meiji Restoration|Japan is no longer safe]], and good eggs are now available in China. Regardless of the politics in Japan, Hervé insists on going there anyway. When he arrives in Japan, however, war has broken out and the village is abandoned; Jubei and the girl are not there. Jubei's young servant boy ([[Kanata Hongō]]), whom Hervé has met before, shows Hervé where Jubei and his household have gone. When Jubei sees Hervé he becomes hostile and tells Hervé to go home. Before he leaves, Hervé discovers that Jubei had the boy executed (by hanging) for showing Hervé where to find them. Without seeing the girl, Hervé leaves Japan, managing to buy some eggs in [[Sakata, Yamagata|Sakata]], and returns home. Unfortunately his side trip has delayed his departure until too late in the season, and before reaching France Hervé discovers that the eggs have hatched and the caterpillars have died. Three of the silk mills are forced to close down.  To employ the village, Hervé decides to build Hélène's garden instead.  Months later, Hervé receives a long letter from the mysterious concubine, written in Japanese. He again takes the letter to Madame Blanche for translation, who agrees, providing Hervé never comes to see her again. The letter is a deeply moving declaration of love.  Hélène becomes ill and eventually dies. After her death, Hervé finds a tribute of small, blue flowers on her grave. He seeks out Madame Blanche once more, believing her to have written the letter, but Madame Blanche reveals to him that Hélène had written the letter. Hélène had asked Madame Blanche to translate the letter into Japanese, knowing that her husband was in love with a Japanese woman, and wanting him to be happy. Madame Blanche tells Hervé that, more than anything, his wife wanted to be that woman. Too late, Hervé finally realizes that it was Hélène who was his true love after all.  The film ends with Hervé, fated to remain childless, recounting his story to Ludovic ([[Mark Rendall]]) – a young protégé since childhood and now Hélène's gardener – on a bench in Hélène's garden. Henceforth, Ludovic can now appreciate the real story behind Hélène's garden.

The story explodes into a web of intrigue and danger as Kingdom's role in the doctor's death is brought into question. This, and a continent in the grips of a heartless pandemic, provide the dramatic backdrop against which heroine Dr. Thandie Khumalo's personal journey unfolds. She struggles to come to terms with her beloved colleague's murder and the loss of her friends and family to the pandemic which she has dedicated her life to fighting. Vying for her heart and mind as she searches for the truth are Lucas De Villiers, the charming yet ruthless CEO of Kingdom, and handsome fellow doctor Josh Kingsley.  
The Signal (2007 film)
 The film opens, showing that Mya is cheating on her husband Lewis with a man named Ben. Ben attempts to convince Mya to leave the city with him, but she remains noncommittal. As Mya exits, Ben turns the television on and watches a bizarre, [[psychedelia|psychedelic]] sequence of images. Mya begins to listen to a compact disc given to her by Ben, but she is menaced by men who are acting strangely in a parking garage. When she reaches her apartment building, she finds more people behaving strangely. Unknown to Mya, the Signal, a [[TV static|static]]-like interference that is coming through the television, radio and telephone amplifies each person's negative emotional traits, causing them to act irrationally and, in most cases, violently.   ===Transmission 1: Crazy in Love=== Written and directed by [[David Bruckner]].  Once inside her apartment, Lewis and two friends, Jerry and Rod attempt to fix the TV, but Lewis, the first to react to the Signal, beats Jerry to death with a baseball bat over a minor argument. Mya flees in panic, leaving Rod and Lewis in a struggle, but finds the whole building in chaos with people killing each other. Mya hides out in the nearby apartment until morning. When she decides to leave and re-enter her home, she finds an unconscious Lewis, bound to a chair with duct-tape. He awakens only to see her leave him behind and exit into the hall listening to Ben's compact disc, but encounters Rod who drags her into a janitor's closet. He then tells her of the night he spent trying to survive in the apartment complex. It becomes evident that the Signal affects each person differently, and that there is the possibility that Rod is also crazy, though he seems to largely have control of his own judgment. Together, they escape, and attempt to drive to safety. But after being shot by a policewoman and almost left behind by Mya, Rod becomes even more violent and attacks Mya, who crashes the car. Rod is incapacitated and trapped in the vehicle, while Mya flees, telling a stranger named Clark that she is going to the train station.  ===Transmission 2: The Jealousy Monster=== Written and directed by [[Jacob Gentry]].  The story turns to Ben, who finds the duct-taped Lewis and loosens his bonds. Lewis knocks Ben unconscious and puts him in the back of a pest control van. At a nearby apartment, a woman named Anna is setting up for a New Year party. The Signal has affected her so that her dutifulness as a homemaker is amplified (though she is also quite possibly made psychologically unstable from being forced to kill her own husband), and despite having killed her crazed husband in self-defense, she has continued planning for the party as if nothing has happened. Clark, who is her neighbor, and a conspiracy theorist, soon arrives. The two begin attempting to figure out what is happening, and Clark also admits that he has decapitated Rod with a shovel, when Rod attacked him after being freed from the car wreck. Eventually Lewis makes his way to the apartment, under the mistaken belief that Mya has been there, because her car is crashed outside. At first, Lewis befriends Anna and Clark, and they convince themselves that none of them have been affected by the Signal, and that they have to band together in order to survive. Lewis, whose violent and paranoid tendencies are clearly amplified by the Signal, kills Anna's niece, Laura, who arrives at the door seeking help, under the mistaken belief that she is attacking Anna with a knife. He dismisses the act as defense on the part of Anna, but Clark convinces him not to attack the next arrival, Jim, who is apparently oblivious of the situation. While Anna hallucinates that Clark is her husband, Lewis hallucinates that Jim is Ben, taunting him. He beats Jim to death, restrains Clark in a chair by staking his arms to the chair with kitchen knives, then attacks Anna, spraying her with insecticide until she is blind. Once he realizes she knows nothing about Mya's whereabouts, Lewis forces her to ingest the poison, apparently killing her. He then exposes Clark to the Signal in order to convince him to tell him where Mya had gone. Ben, having woken up and freed himself from Lewis's van, enters the apartment and attacks Lewis with the pesticide canister, knocking him out.  ===Transmission 3: Escape from Terminus=== Written and directed by [[Dan Bush]].  Lewis wakes up and follows Ben and Clark. He attempts to kill them in a tool shed, but they fight him off and escape. After Ben convinces Clark that the Signal is a lie, thus breaking its effect on him, Clark informs Ben where Mya was headed. Ben and Clark make a run through the now mostly-dead city and arrive at the train station. There, they find Mya tied to a chair, being forced to watch the Signal by Lewis, who attacks them and strangles Clark until he is unconscious. Ben then resorts to using Lewis's own paranoia against him, eventually tricking Lewis into believing that their roles are reversed, and that Lewis is the one man he hates most: Mya's lover. Lewis punches a signal-broadcasting TV, in a frustrated rage, electrocuting himself.   The story ends ambiguously. A series of scenes showing Ben and Mya with Clark, stocking up on supplies, then Ben and Mya going separate ways from Clark, suggesting they have succeeded.  However, the next scene reveals Mya still tied to the chair, seemingly catatonic due to her prolonged exposure to the Signal. Ben places Mya's headphones on her, and she closes her eyes, a tear rolling down her cheek, before the credits appear.  Whether this is the final reality, or a flashback before Ben and Mya's escape from the city, is left for the viewer to decide.

Johan's affair with Marianne continues; they have sex in a local hotel while Johan's children wait in a van with a stranger - someone whom Marianne seems to know and trust. As Johan is driving in his car with Esther, she confronts him about the affair. She says she is going to vomit and forces him to stop the car. She runs off taking a blue umbrella, telling him not to follow. She breaks down crying along the side of a field, has what the doctor later describes as "coronary trauma," and dies.   At her wake, friends and family are there to provide comfort. Johan visits the body, says his goodbyes, and goes outside for air. Marianne suddenly shows up at the wake and asks if she can spend a moment with Esther's body, which Johan allows. Marianne enters the room, slowly kisses Esther's body on the lips, and drops a tear on her cheek. Esther appears to return to life as Johan's father sets the clock on a nearby wall. Johan breaks down again, before one of his daughters says that "Mum wants to see him." Marianne leaves silently as Johan prepares to enter the room in which Esther waits. The final few minutes of ''Silent Light'' are another tracking shot, with the sun setting.

His hopes are renewed when Christine moves into the ward, and they fall in love; [[love at first sight]] in Dalen's case.  Christine's parents are very wealthy non-members who have each been married a few times.  Trouble arises when they tell Christine's parents about their marriage plans because Christine's parents can't understand why they're not permitted to attend their daughter's wedding in the [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS Temple]].  Dalen actually withdraws his proposal to Christine in order to avoid causing a rift in her family. Later, however, Dalen visits Christine's father and explains to him the importance of [[temple marriage]], and he gives Dalen his [[Blessing#Other uses|blessing]]. Christine and Dalen's wedding goes as planned.  During the film, Jonathan ([[Will Swenson (actor)|Will Swenson]]) is making a film based on their experience in ''[[The Singles Ward]]''.  When Jonathan's friends visit the set, they each see the actor playing them; Dalen is played by "some guy who's been in every [[Mormon cinema|LDS movie]] ever made," who looks exactly like Dalen (also played by Heyborne).  While discussing making a movie about Dalen's experience in getting married, Jonathan says that [[Media franchise|franchises]] must be made in trilogies, but with everyone married the next one would have to be ''The Family Ward''.  Dalen even mentioned a dream that he had that he was a [[The R.M.|return missionary]], full of the problems he and Jonathan had encountered.  During the course of the movie, Christine narrates to the audience in much the same way Jonathan narrated the first movie.  In a scene at the end of the movie with the two of them, Christine expresses surprise that Jonathan "knows" the audience, to which he replies that he knew them before she did.

 Sivaji, an Indian [[software architect]], returns to India from the United States. He aims to establish a non-profit trust called ''Sivaji Foundation'', which includes a network of hospitals and educational institutions that serve the poor free of charge. An influential businessman, Adiseshan, sees Sivaji as his competitor because he runs profit-making educational institutions and hospitals. Sivaji is forced to bribe the corrupt [[Civil Services of India|civil service]], but eventually, the bribes demanded become so high that he has to mortgage his house and sell his car to pay them. When Sivaji goes to court, he loses the case filed against him by Adiseshan regarding the methods Sivaji had used to open his foundation as a result of bribing numerous government officials. Simultaneously, Sivaji falls in love with a girl named Tamizhselvi. However, upon asking for his horoscope, an astrologer warns that their union will result in Sivaji's death. When Tamizhselvi refuses the proposal due to her concern for Sivaji, he calms her fears and convinces her to marry him.  Following the loss in the court case, Tamizhselvi requests Sivaji out of fear not to come for her again. Sivaji is reduced to utter poverty. Realising that the methods he used are unlikely to work again, he decides to play the game his own way. Sivaji, with the help of his uncle Arivu, acquires evidence of 2&nbsp;billion worth of illegal earnings in Adiseshan's possession and uses the documents to blackmail Adiseshan into giving him half the money. He further obtains details on people who have illegal earnings across Tamil Nadu and blackmails them to give him half of their illegal wealth. He then transfers the money to the bank accounts of his friends around the world by "[[hawala]]" forgery. They then deposit the money as donations to ''Sivaji Foundation'', making the money usable and legitimate.  Sivaji informs the [[Income tax in India|Income Tax Investigation and Vigilance Department]] about the details of the illegal money held by the tax evaders (including Adiseshan) and gets them arrested. He reopens the foundation and soon is able to provide free, good quality education, infrastructure, services and employment to people in every district of Tamil Nadu. Led by Adiseshan, those who were blackmailed by Sivaji exploit Tamizhselvi's innocence to silence him. Fearing for Sivaji's life, she hands over Sivaji's laptop to the [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] and Income Tax officers hired by Adiseshan with all the information regarding the illegal money transactions. With presentable evidence, Sivaji is arrested.  Adiseshan and the police order Sivaji to unlock his laptop. When Sivaji refuses, Adiseshan tortures him, leaving him for dead. To cover this up, Adiseshan and the police organise for thugs to shoot at the police van that will carry Sivaji's body, making it look like a murder by a third party. Sivaji, however, is faking; he was informed of the plans to kill him by a sympathetic police constable prior to the interrogation. Left alone in the room, he electrifies himself. Sivaji's friend Dr. Chezhian, Tamizhselvi and Arivu intercept the police van after being informed by Sivaji through a [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] and replace Sivaji's body with a dummy before the thugs open fire. While everyone thinks that Sivaji is dead, Chezhian revives him using a [[Defibrillation|defibrillator]]. Following Sivaji's "death", Adiseshan and the CBI still try to open Sivaji's laptop by trying to fool the [[Voice activity detection|voice-detection]] program; they fail and all the data in the laptop is erased.  A few days later, while everyone wonders about the future of ''Sivaji Foundation'', the revived Sivaji returns to take control of the foundation in the guise of an NRI friend, M. G. Ravichandran. Though Adiseshan immediately realises that Ravichandran is actually Sivaji, he is unable to prove this to the police due to the proof of Sivaji's "death" and Ravichandran's identity. Later, Sivaji confronts Adiseshan and the two fight atop the terrace of Adiseshan's medical college. During the fight, Adiseshan inadvertently strikes the campus's terrace roof causing money hidden in it to fly around the campus. The students spot the money and go after it, causing a stampede in which Adiseshan is killed. ''Sivaji Foundation'' soon becomes a frontier for India's economic and industrial rise.

Small Town Rivals
 Cho Chun-sam and Noh Dae-gyu, now both in their thirties, are old friends who went to the same elementary school. In their school days, Chun-sam was always the ambitious class president, while Dae-gyu had to settle for a role as vice president. Twenty years later their roles are reversed: Chun-sam is now a humble farmer who has assumed the post of village chief in his hometown, while Dae-gyu is the newly elected county magistrate. At first, Chun-sam asks his old friend for favours regarding the development of his village, but these requests are turned down. Later, when Dae-gyu proposes building a nuclear waste disposal facility in the county, Chun-sam leads demonstrations against the plan, turning old friends into bitter rivals.  
Slasher (2007 film)
  After opening with a picnicking couple being murdered by a disfigured man in the woods, the film shows Erin in a college psychology class, where a lecturer mentions Mike Corman, a local serial killer who murdered at least four girls. Mike's crimes were discovered when his house caught fire, though Mike himself was never found. As Erin, her boyfriend Danny, and their friends (Julie, Chris, Tom, and Maya) head to a campsite where they will spend their school break, the deformed man (revealed to be Mike) butchers another couple at a lake.  Getting lost on the way to the campgrounds, the students are given directions by a leprous and lecherous farmer, and reach their destination. That night, the farmer's son peeps on Tom and Maya having sex in their tent, and is killed by Mike (who has adorned a white mask one of the students had brought along). The next day, Mike murders the farmer's daughter and captures Tom and Maya when they find his cabin. Tom has his head crushed in a [[vise]], and Maya is tortured. When Tom and Maya do not return after several hours, Erin becomes worried and goes looking for them with Danny. When those two leave, the camp generator stops working, and Chris is knifed when he goes to see what is wrong with it. After Erin and Danny discover the remains of some of Mike's earlier victims, Danny is axed by Mike, and Erin is punched out by Julie.  Erin awakens in the cabin, and is taunted by Julie, who is Mike's older sister and lover. It is revealed that Erin had previously encountered Mike, and was the one who set the fire that caused his disfigurement and brain damage. Erin escapes her shackles and runs outside, followed by Julie, who catches up with Erin at a stream. Julie tries to drown Erin, but is killed when Erin bludgeons her with a discarded pipe. Erin returns to the campsite, finds the wounded Danny there, and tries to drive away with him, only for the car to run out of gas. Mike appears, and he chases Erin through the woods. Erin reaches the farmhouse, and tries to get help from the farmer, but he is drunk and tries to rape her. Mike impales the farmer with a chainsaw, which runs out of gas, so he attacks Erin with a knife, and drags her into the barn. As Mike strangles Erin, she grabs a pair of [[pruning shears]], gouges out one of his eyes, and jams her thumb into the wound. The incapacitated Mike is stabbed repeatedly by Erin, who ties a rope around his neck, attaches the other end to a tractor, and drives the vehicle until Mike's neck snaps.  Erin stumbles outside, and discovers Danny, who is barely alive. The two reach help, and while in the back of an ambulance, Erin has a series of flashbacks which indicate she was the one who tortured and killed the four girls that Mike was thought to have murdered. Erin suffocates Danny, exits the ambulance, and walks away grinning madly.  
Smokin' Aces
 Las Vegas magician and wannabe gangster, Buddy "Aces" Israel ([[Jeremy Piven]]) is hiding out in a Lake Tahoe hotel penthouse with his entourage. His agent, Morris Mecklen ([[Curtis Armstrong]]), discusses a potential immunity deal with [[FBI]] Deputy Director Stanley Locke ([[Andy Garcia]]). [[Special agent|Agents]] Richard Messner ([[Ryan Reynolds]]) and Donald Carruthers ([[Ray Liotta]]) learn that ailing Las Vegas mob boss Primo Sparazza ([[Joseph Ruskin]]) has issued a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] on Israel worth one million dollars, and involving a mysterious assassin known only as The Swede, stipulating that he will bring Sparazza Israel's heart. A number of assassins also seek the reward, including Lazlo Soot ([[Tommy Flanagan (actor)|Tommy Flanagan]]), who specializes in disguises and impersonations; Sharice Watters ([[Taraji P. Henson]]) and Georgia Sykes ([[Alicia Keys]]), two hitwomen hired by Sparazza's underboss; Pasquale Acosta ([[Nestor Carbonell]]), a calm torture expert and mercenary; and the psychotic [[neo-Nazi]] Tremor brothers, Darwin ([[Chris Pine]]), Jeeves ([[Kevin Durand]]), and Lester ([[Maury Sterling]]).   Locke dispatches Messner and Carruthers to take Israel into custody when the deal is struck. Meanwhile, a team of bail bondsmen, Jack Dupree ([[Ben Affleck]]) and his partners, "Pistol" Pete Deeks ([[Peter Berg]]) and Hollis Elmore ([[Martin Henderson]]) have been hired by the firm that posted Israel's bail to bring him into custody. The bondsmen are attacked by the Tremors, and only Elmore escapes alive. Messner is dispatched to the murder scene while Carruthers proceeds to Israel. At the same time, each of the assassins gain access to the hotel in their own various ways.  Carruthers encounters Acosta, disguised as a security officer, in an elevator at the hotel. Carruthers senses something is wrong and both are mortally wounded in a gunfight. Meanwhile, Soot gains access to the penthouse by posing as one of Israel's henchmen. Israel's second-in-command, Sir Ivy ([[Common (artist)|Common]]), learns that Israel agreed to inform upon Ivy as part of the plea deal and attempts to kill him, but Israel injures Ivy long enough for the hotel security team to restrain Ivy. Georgia finds Carruthers and Acosta in the elevator, but assumes Acosta is Soot. In Los Angeles, Locke abruptly withdraws from the deal with Israel and orders that Messner and Carruthers are not told. The Tremor brothers reach the penthouse floor, where they engage in a shootout with the security team and Ivy, who manages to kill Jeeves and Lester. Israel, learning of the FBI's new position, attempts [[suicide]].   Messner arrives at the hotel and sets up a position around Georgia's elevator. Sharice provides cover from another hotel with a .50-caliber, [[Barrett M82|M82]] sniper rifle, outgunning the FBI agents. Acosta, still alive, shoots Georgia, but is shot by Carruthers. Sharice, thinking Georgia is dead, refuses to escape and keeps shooting at the FBI team. Georgia escapes to the penthouse, where she stops Darwin Tremor before he can kill Ivy. Tremor escapes, and Messner, distraught over the death of Carruthers, stops Ivy and Georgia on the stairwell, but lets them escape. Sharice, after seeing the pair alive and free through her rifle scope, is gunned down by the FBI.   Locke and a team of FBI agents descend on the penthouse and take Israel to the hospital, while Soot escapes by tearing off his disguise & dressing as a member of hotel security. Acosta, carted away on a gurney, is also shown to be alive. Darwin Tremor tries to escape, but is gunned down by Hollis Elmore.   Messner arrives at the hospital and learns the truth about the day's events from Locke. It transpires that the mysterious Swede is a prominent heart surgeon and that Soot was hired by Sparazza to get Israel's heart so it could be transplanted into the body of Sparazza. Sparazza is further revealed to be Freeman Heller (Mike Falkow), an FBI agent who went undercover and was thought to have been killed by the mob. The FBI had attempted to kill Heller, after they thought his assignment had blurred the lines between being a mobster or an FBI agent. But Heller survived and ended up taking on the role as Sparazza full-time. The mobster has agreed to expose the mob's operations in exchange for Israel's heart as he is Sparazza's love child and, thus, the most compatible donor.  Messner, furious over the unnecessary deaths, especially Carruthers', protests and is ordered by Locke to leave the hospital and go home to Washington, D.C, as he is no longer on the case. Realizing that the FBI will never admit what they did, he walks into the emergency room, locks the door and pulls the plug on both Israel and Sparazza, killing them both. He then lays his gun and badge on the floor while Locke and his men desperately try to break in, apparently resigning as an FBI agent.

After meeting him, Bill realizes he has the same craving. Craig introduces him to an underground group of people who all share this addiction. Bill then uses his surgical knowledge to come up with a method of inserting electric sockets and prongs into the members' wrists so they can "juice up". But after Bill accidentally discovers that he can mainline electricity from living people, he becomes hooked on absorbing this particular kind of power.  
Snow Angels (film)
 On a cold afternoon, with snow on the ground, a high school band is practicing for the last football game, when they hear gunshots. The film abruptly flashes back to a few weeks before, to a Chinese restaurant where a high school boy named Arthur buses tables, and his ex-babysitter, Annie, and her best friend, Barb, are waitresses. Arthur, who's a bit of a misfit, has a troubled home life caused by his constantly clashing parents, both of whom often forget about him. Annie's life isn't faring much better: she's now a single mother with an ill mother, separated from her husband, Glenn, who's on the wagon and becoming a born-again Christian in order to prove that he is responsible enough to spend time with their young daughter, Tara. Depressed and lonely, Annie is having an affair with Barb's husband, Nate, which eventually serves to only make her unhappier, as she feels great guilt over betraying her best friend. Desperate to prove himself and still harboring feelings for his estranged wife (whom he suspects is seeing someone), Glenn gets a new job and spends as much time as possible with Tara. Meanwhile, Arthur finds himself growing close to Lila, a new student at the high school who has a knack for photography.   The film focuses heavily on how people's lives can cross in a small town, especially when Tara wanders out of the house and goes missing while Annie, having just lost her best friend over the affair, is sleeping. The whole town spends hours desperately searching for Tara, before Arthur finds her body while smoking pot with his friend. To Annie's horror, Tara fell into the lake while playing and drowned when the water froze over. This turn of events leads to Glenn and Annie having complete breakdowns, which results in her going with him into the snow-covered woods, where she placidly kneels before his shotgun, ending with their murder-suicide.  
Snuff 102
  Animal experimentation footage is shown, followed by a video of a man dismembering a female body in a bathtub. It is implied that the man masturbates after the corpse has been sufficiently mutilated. Next, someone browses and clicks on the link for "Snuff Fantasy". Images of animals and people (mostly women) being tortured and killed clutter the screen, followed by a real life video of a pig being stabbed in the throat, sqealing and bleeding out. A critic asks "Until what point are you willing to watch? In other words, what do you want to watch?" A wrists-bound-behind-her-back, tightly [[Gag_(BDSM)#Cleave|cleave-gagged]], [[barefoot]] and crying woman in her bra and panties (Victim 102) is shown in a bathroom. She manages to force the gag out of her mouth, gets up and moves the shower's curtain. She then screams at what she sees.  The film now goes back one week (in black and white footage), and shows a female journalist (aka Victim 102, portrayed by Yamila Greco) doing her morning routines and watching a newscast about a recently captured serial killer of prostitutes. This inspires the journalist to write about violence itself. The reporter accesses the pornographic and [[Shock site|shock websites]] frequented by the killer (being greatly disturbed by their content) and interviews a film critic and author (Eduardo Poli), who discusses topics such as misogyny, fetishes, [[new media]], morality, pornography, snuff, and the value of human life. Intercut with the reporter's research are scenes of her and two other women (a pregnant prostitute and a porn star) being filmed as they are tortured by a masked man (portrayed by Rodrigo Bianco) who labels his captives Victim 100, Victim 101, and Victim 102.  The pregnant woman (Victim 100, portrayed by Andrea Alfonso) is the first to be brutalized. All the while, Victims' 101 and 102 are screaming and moaning through their tightly gagged mouths. Accompanying their gagged moaning is an industrial music score by El Hemisferio Derecho. Victim 100 is beaten, several of her fingers are cut off and a bag is pulled over her head, which is stomped and kicked repeatedly. The masked killer gropes Victim 100, stomps her stomach, bites one of her nipples off, mutilates her genitals with a chef knife, and proceeds to cut her open with the knife. Before moving on, the masked killer then removes the gag of Victim 102 and orally rapes her with the same chef knife while also masturbating. He then reapplies her gag and drags Victim 100 to the bathroom. With the killer now out of sight, Victim 102 flings from the trash-laden floor a shard of glass, held by her toes, to her hands bound behind her to start cutting the rope that binds her wrists to the back of the chair. Coming out of the bathroom, the killer now goes to work on the porn star (Victim 101, portrayed by Silvia Paz). He beats her with a hammer, rips one of her eyes out, asphyxiates her with a bag, knocks her front teeth out with a chisel, and urinates on and rapes her.  While the masked killer is taking Victim 101 apart with a hacksaw, the journalist is desperately trying to free her bare feet from the legs of the chair with her still-bound-behind her-hands. A flashback reveals that she was taken when she found hidden photographs depicting the film critic engaging in [[necrophilia]]. (The film critic and the masked killer are discovered to be partners in their sick fantasies.) Now freed from the chair, the still wrists bound-behind-her and gagged journalist escapes from the masked killer to the bathroom and manages to lock the door. Now... returning to the bathroom sequence from the beginning of the film, it is shown that the journalist discovered Victim 100 in the shower. The woman is still alive; something the masked killer rectifies when he breaks into the room, and at first bludgeons Victim 102 with a hammer (temporarily stunning her) but then bludgeons Victim 100 to death. The masked killer then drags the journalist out of the room with a hook impaling her belly, and as he prepares to kill her, she breaks the ropes binding her hands with another shard of glass on the floor, grabs a cellphone, and runs off.  The cellphone will not work, so the journalist tries to find a way out as the masked killer searches for her, machete in hand. The journalist squeezes out a barred window, and is chased into the woods by the masked killer, who catches her. As he strangles her, the journalist grabs a rock, beats the masked killer with it, and then finishes him off with his discarded machete. The journalist stumbles away, and is picked up by a passing motorist.

Son of Rambow
 Will Proudfoot ([[Bill Milner]]) is a quiet and shy 11-year-old boy, and comes from a family that belongs to the strict [[Plymouth Brethren]] church. Will is forbidden from watching films or television and is made to leave his classroom when the teacher puts on a documentary. In the corridor, he meets Lee Carter ([[Will Poulter]]), the 13-year old worst-behaved boy in school, thrown out of another class for bad behaviour. They accidentally break a fish bowl in the corridor; Lee volunteers to take the blame, pretending that the punishment is torture, in exchange for Will's watch, which belonged to his dead father. Moreover, Lee demands that Will performs the [[stunt]]s in a film Lee is making with [[home video]] equipment owned by his bullying older brother, Lawrence, which Lawrence uses in his video bootlegging enterprise. He intends to enter the ''[[Screen Test]]'' Young Film-Makers' Competition.  Will accepts, after accidentally seeing the film ''[[First Blood]]'' at Lee's house while hiding from Lawrence. He becomes very enthusiastic, and plays several dangerous action scenes, culminating in the two boys becoming 'blood brothers' after Lee saves Will from drowning. Lee finds Will's sketch book, full of colourful and glorious ideas, and starts to incorporate some of them into his film script. The two become best friends, but Will has to keep it secret from his family and the increasingly interfering Brother Joshua of the Brethren, who clearly has designs on his mother.  French exchange students arrive, of whom the suave Didier Revol becomes very popular. After finding Will's sketch book, he asks Will if he and his acolytes can play in the film, and Will agrees. Didier reveals that he has always wanted to be an actor. This mushrooms into the whole school being part of the production, and Will being included with the cool sixth-formers. Lee does not like this, as he is no longer in control, and finally quits after a fight with Will during filming of the last sequence, which takes place at a disused power station. After Will becomes trapped when part of the unstable structure collapses due to Didier's carelessness, and the entire school/crew run away, Lee returns to rescue his friend, but uses the excuse that he has come to collect his brother's camera. He too gets hurt, and has to go to hospital. Lawrence visits him, but is angry about the fact that the camera is broken.  Will's mother, from whom he has struggled to hide his activities, finally realises that her son must be allowed to be himself and her family leaves the Brethren. The film is never submitted to the competition as they miss the deadline. The French students leave, and while Didier was popular and worshipped in Britain, his own school-mates mock him, and he is actually lonely and isolated. When Lawrence looks at Lee's footage he is impressed, and he sees Lee's rant at Will defending Lawrence's neglect and bullying, which was accidentally filmed. With Will's help, he adds a part in which he acts himself — including a reply message for his brother. When Lee leaves the hospital, he is brought to a cinema by surprise. His film is shown before the main feature (much to the enjoyment of the audience) and the two boys reunite.

Special People (film)
 Enlisted to teach a class of wheelchair-users about filmmaking, the neurotic Jasper gets a little more than he bargained for. His charges seem to know more than he does about his subject; they're not impressed by his own heartfelt social realist oeuvre; and they meet his every suggestion with the blank indifference peculiar to the streetwise adolescent. Questions condescending outreach projects, self-defeating attitudes within the disabled community, and the vacuity of the film business - all with a sly wink and a healthy helping of self-parody

Spider-Man 3
  One year after the events of the second film, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] plans to propose to [[Mary Jane Watson]], who has just made her [[Broadway musical]] debut. Later, a meteorite lands at [[Central Park]], and an extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] follows Peter to his apartment. [[Harry Osborn]], seeking vengeance after his father's death, attacks Peter with weapons based on his father's [[Green Goblin]] technology. The battle ends with Harry crashing out and developing [[amnesia]], wiping out his memory of Peter as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped convict Flint Marko, who visits his wife and dying daughter before fleeing again, and falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his body with the surrounding sand, transforming him into the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].  During a festival honoring Spider-Man, Peter kisses [[Gwen Stacy]], infuriating Mary Jane. The super-powered Marko robs an armored car, and Peter confronts him. Marko easily subdues Peter, and escapes. [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]] informs Peter and Aunt May that Marko was Uncle Ben's true killer; the deceased [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]] was Marko's accomplice. As Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man suit, the symbiote assimilates his suit. Peter later awakens and discovers his costume changed and his powers enhanced; however, the symbiote also brings out Peter's dark side. Wearing the new suit, Peter locates Marko and battles him in a subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's weakness, Peter breaks a water pipe, causing water to reduce Marko into mud and washing him away.  Peter's changed personality alienates Mary Jane, whose career is floundering, and she finds solace with Harry, but leaves afterwards in regret. Harry recovers from his amnesia and, urged by a hallucination of his father, blackmails Mary Jane into breaking up with Peter. After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves "somebody else", Harry meets with Peter and claims to be "the other guy". Peter confronts Harry about forcing Mary Jane to end her relationship with him and spitefully tells Harry that his father never loved him. Another fight ensues, in which Harry throws a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.  Meanwhile, Peter exposes rival photographer [[Eddie Brock]], whose fake photos depict Spider-Man as a criminal. This plagiarism results in their boss, [[J. Jonah Jameson]], firing Brock. Later, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Gwen to a nightclub, where Mary Jane now works. Realizing this, Gwen leaves the nightclub, and, after he accidentally attacks Mary Jane, he realizes how the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a bell tower of a church, Peter rings the bell to weaken and remove the symbiote, which falls below to the lower tower and bonds with Brock, who in turn, praying for Peter's death, is transformed into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. Brock locates Marko and convinces him to join forces to defeat Peter.  Posing as a taxi driver, Brock kidnaps Mary Jane, and holds her as bait from a web high above a construction site, while Marko keeps the police at bay. Seeking help, Peter goes to Harry, who rejects him. While Peter battles Brock and Marko, Harry learns the truth about his father's death from his butler, and goes to the construction site to help Peter, resulting in a battle between the four. Harry subdues the Sandman before assisting Peter against Brock. In the ensuing battle, Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry's glider, but Harry steps in, and is impaled himself. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it, and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote. Peter activates a pumpkin bomb from Harry's glider and throws it at the symbiote, but Brock, attempting to become Venom again, dives in and is killed along with the symbiote.  After the battle, Marko explains that Uncle Ben's death was an accident, and that Uncle Ben was trying to help him, and his death has haunted him ever since. Peter forgives Marko, who then leaves. Peter and Mary Jane stand beside Harry, who dies from his injuries. Peter, Mary Jane, and Aunt May attend Harry's funeral. Later, at the nightclub, Peter and Mary Jane reconcile.

The gem hits a star, they fall together, and the remaining sons, Primus and Septimus, independently search for the gem.  In Wall, Tristan sees the star fall and vows to retrieve it for the object of his infatuation, Victoria, in return for her hand in marriage. Tristan learns that his mother is from beyond the wall, and receives a Babylon candle that she had left for him, which instantly takes the user to any desired location. Tristan lights it and is transported to the fallen star, personified as a beautiful woman named Yvaine. He promptly chains her to take her home to Victoria.  Three ancient witch sisters in Stormhold resolve to eat the fallen star's heart to recover their youth and replenish their powers. Their leader, [[Lamia]], eats the remnants of an earlier star's heart, and sets off to find Yvaine. She conjures up a wayside inn as a trap.

Yvaine finds Tristan gone, and starts walking towards the wall, thinking he has abandoned her for Victoria.

SpongeBob's Atlantis SquarePantis
  ===Patchy the Pirate subplot===  [[Patchy the Pirate]] is stuck in traffic on [[US 101]] near Encino and gets cross that he is going to miss the new SpongeBob episode, and his super rare eight track also breaks down.  His cell phone rings, and Potty tells him to hurry because the episode is about to start.  Patchy tells Potty to record the episode, but Potty tells him that he threw the Betamax machine in the trash, making him more mad.  The traffic lines moves, but suddenly, he finds himself nowhere, and finds out that "[[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino]] is gone", and then he cries that this is not the only time a Lost-City had occurred. He tells us that the episode is what we should watch instead of watching him suffer. Patchy gets his eight track fixed, but not for long when it explodes again and produces smoke.  Later on, Patchy gets hallucinations and he finds a man dressed in a tall SpongeBob outfit (who is actually [[Tom Kenny]], Patchy the Pirate's actor and the voice of SpongeBob himself), who tells him that he is SpongeBob SquarePants in real-life form. The Spongebob then tells him that he will be back in Encino if he "believes". Then, Potty wakes him up after he thought he is back in Encino, which is all just a dream. Patchy begins to eat a sandwich, which Potty brings to him, but he finds mayonnaise on it. He tries to give it to a vulture.  After the end of the SpongeBob special, Patchy finds Encino shrunk to a very small size, and then, he finds three aliens, which explain that their son, Norbluck 5, was playing with his Shrink-A-Tron again. Patchy yells at them that he wants his town back in full size, and he keeps saying, “There’s no place like home." (Obviously parodying the scene from ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'') Sympathetic by Patchy's misery that he wants to go home because he missed it the entire story, Norbluck 5's mother gets the Shrink-A-Tron given from her son, and she presses the big red button control, making a tornado disaster to fix it up. Then, Patchy is glad to be back in Encino, but soon, a giant Potty the Parrot crushes him into the house (presumably showing that Norbluck 5 had once again used his Shrink-A-Tron to make Potty huge).  ===SpongeBob plot===  [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob]] and [[Patrick Star|Patrick]] find a piece of a medallion to the lost city of [[Atlantis]], but have no idea what it is. They take it to the [[Bikini Bottom]] [[Museum]] to see if the staff there know what it is. SpongeBob and Patrick run into [[Squidward Tentacles|Squidward]], who thinks they stole the missing half of the medallion. He soon matches it to the displayed other half of the medallion and tells them it was the key to Atlantis. After hearing the story of Atlantis, the only thing SpongeBob and Patrick want to see is the "World's Oldest Bubble." Squidward then proceeds to reconnect the two halves of the medallion, opening the "path to Atlantis", which is a bus that runs on "song fuel". When the characters run out of "song fuel", the bus then crash-lands into the city of Atlantis. The group is unknowingly followed by [[Plankton (character)|Plankton]].  At Atlantis, they meet the Atlantean [[Emperor]], Lord Royal Highness who shows them a grand tour of the fortress. During the tour, Mr. Krabs, Sandy, and Squidward each get distracted by places in Atlantis; Mr. Krabs (unsurprisingly) by the treasury room, Sandy by the [[laboratory|science laboratory]], and Squidward by the [[Art museum|art gallery]].  Meanwhile, Plankton checks out the armory vault, intent on using the city's lost weapons (the Atlanteans had abandoned the idea of warfare long ago) for his own ends. He then chooses his weapon, a tank. Finally, SpongeBob and Patrick get to see the world's oldest living bubble. Patrick takes a picture of it, which causes the bubble to pop. They are afraid to speak, saying they have to go back to Bikini Bottom. Then, Patrick shouts out the "truth."  Lord Royal Highness is not enraged at SpongeBob and Patrick for popping the bubble, telling him that the one they popped was just a prop for the tourists. He then shows them the real oldest living bubble, which Patrick then takes a picture of, causing it to pop. Angered, Lord Royal Highness summons the Atlantean Royal Guards to attack, but the gang manage to escape. Just when they escape outside, Plankton comes in and tries to destroy them with the tank he found, but much to his dismay, it showers the group with [[ice cream]]. Lord Royal Highness captures Plankton, and says that "a talking speck" would be a fantastic replacement for the bubble. SpongeBob and friends go home, but Patrick, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward are all sad because they want to stay in Atlantis, even though SpongeBob does not.

Rapidly approaching forty, Ariel has stopped using birth control with her boyfriend Victor without telling him about her determination to have a baby. When he learns about her plan, she ends their relationship, coincidentally at the same time Ariel's former lover Casey Davis returns to [[New York City]] after a five-year absence. He and Ariel had reached an impasse in their relationship because of his refusal to have a child, and as they begin to see each other again, he is quick to let her know his position hasn't changed.

Starrbooty
 The film's plot combines several elements from these original films. Starrbooty (RuPaul) is in the middle of a major karate fight when she receives a phone call informing her that her adopted niece Cornisha has been kidnapped. With the help of fellow crime fighter Agent Page Turner, Starrbooty learns that her nemesis Annaka Manners is using her billion-dollar cosmetics company as a front for kidnapping prostitutes and selling their organs on the black market. Starrbooty also discovers that Annaka is actually her long-lost sister, making Cornisha Annaka's daughter.  Page and Starrbooty go undercover as prostitutes (as Pepper and Cupcake, respectively) and in order to be convincing enough to infiltrate Annaka's inner sanctum, they go "all the way" (this includes numerous sex scenes with explicit male nudity, generally designed for laughs). When Starrbooty finally confronts Annaka she discovers that Cornisha was in on the plot all along, and has become Annaka's lover. Informing them that they are actually mother and daughter, Starrbooty reveals Annaka's plans to double-cross Cornisha by selling her [[clitoris]] to a wealthy socialite (in one of the more memorable jokes, Annaka is also planning to sell Starrbooty's long legs to a "famous female rapper," quipping, "I guess they won't call her 'Lil' anymore!").  A final showdown between Starrbooty and Annaka leaves Annaka dead, and they are able to salvage Cornisha's genitals by taking Annaka's (a perfect biological match). Thus everyone who deserves to lives happily ever after.

Two weeks later, Ted wakes up and gets to return home to his wife Molly ([[Marnie McPhail]]) and teenage son Max ([[Ben Lewis (actor)|Ben Lewis]]) in Chicago, but he is suffering from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] complicated by the extreme guilt he feels about the Iraqi family's deaths.

Ted wants to go to the police because it's morally right, but Molly reminds him of the innocent people he killed as a soldier, leading to an impasse.

Molly races to get a doctor for Ted, but returns to find him possessed as the spirit and holding a loaded gun to Max's head. A nurse runs for help while Ted and Molly fight over the weapon. Ted, still under the control of the angry spirit, asks Molly to kill him and turns the gun on himself. In the struggle, Ted accidentally shoots Molly and she dies in his arms. As she takes her last breath, she begs him to not harm her son by turning him in.  After a lot of thought, a heartbroken Ted turns Max in, against Molly's wishes.

  DJ Williams is a young man in inner-city [[Los Angeles]]. He and his younger brother Duron compete in local dance competitions as members of a crew known as the "Goon Squad". During the battle there are backs and forths, but in the end of the battle the Goon Squad win a cash-prize, and the leader of the rival crew goes all in for a double or nothing battle, which DJ accepts much to the dismay of his brother who knows that if the opposing crew leader thinks he got hustled the crew won't be able to spend the money they win, the Goon Squad wins the second battle and the losing home crew responds by ambushing DJ and his crewmates after the show. A fight breaks out, and the leader of the rival crew starts beating up DJ. Duron pushes him away and starts fighting him, leading the rival to pull out a gun and shoot Duron, killing him.  Arrested for assault, DJ is subsequently sent by his mother to live with his aunt Jackie and uncle Nate in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, where he is to attend [[HBCU|historically black]] Truth University. Nate, the [[physical plant]] director at Truth, aims to teach DJ responsibility and puts him to work doing maintenance as part of a [[Cooperative education|work-study]] program.  DJ sees April Palmer, to whom he is immediately attracted. After registration, he moves into his dorm room, where he meets his new roommate Rich Brown. Rich meets DJ at a [[Stepping (African-American)|stepping]] competition on the green between the Truth chapters of rival [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternities]] Theta Nu Theta and Mu Gamma Xi. The Mu Gamma Xi crew, seven-time national stepping champions, easily steals the show until DJ sees April across the way and runs right through their step line in an attempt to speak to her.  That night, Rich and his friends go out to a local club called the Phoenix and invite DJ along. Hoping to impress April and upstage Grant and the Gammas (all of whom are also in attendance), DJ takes to the floor. Despite the animosity between DJ and Grant, the Gammas recognize his skills as a dancer and their chapter president Zeke invites him to pledge for Mu Gamma Xi. DJ turns down both Zeke's offer as well as an offer from the Theta Nu Theta chapter's leader Sylvester.  After learning that April is a student history tutor, DJ signs himself up for tutoring so that he can spend time with her. The two slowly begin a friendship and DJ takes April out to dinner. During their date, April discusses the importance of [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|black fraternities and sororities]] with DJ, and tells him to visit Heritage Hall on the campus' Greek Row.  The next day, DJ learns about the significant number of African-American historical figures and celebrities who were members of various Greek-letter organizations, and decides to pledge for the Theta chapter along with Rich and their friend Noel. After "crossing over" to become official Theta members, DJ, Rich, and Noel join the Thetas' step crew.  While having dinner, April breaks up with Grant due to his chauvinistic attitude and his failure to know anything about her, particularly that green is her favorite color. She grows closer to DJ and they eventually become a couple. While at practice, DJ, Rich, Noel and other new members realize the step dance moves are old fashion and aren't good enough to win the stepping competition. So they decide to take the time to learn fresher moves. Sly then gathers his older member and challenges DJ and the rest to an old school vs. new school stepping contest. DJ blows the contest due to his showboating. They remind DJ, much like Duron did earlier in the film, that it is about the team and not about him. DJ apologizes to the entire fraternity and is quickly forgiven. Sly also requests DJ to show the team some of his moves.  A few days before the competition, Grant stumbles upon DJ's file and discovers his assault record and presents it to the board. The board then decide to suspend DJ for not disclosing his criminal record. Dr. Palmer, who is April's father, calls in DJ to his office. He was willing to uplift his suspension on the condition that he is to no longer date April. DJ declines the ultimatum and walks away. DJ then tells Nate and Jackie about the suspension. They then reveal that Jackie dated Dr. Palmer until she met Nate and there has been some animosity between Nate and Palmer ever since. Jackie confronts Dr. Palmer about DJ's suspension and Palmer claims he was only protecting April. April then confronted her father about the situation. Palmer then overturned the board's decision deciding that he would rather deal with DJ in April's life than lose his daughter in his.  DJ's suspension was finally uplifted and he rejoins the Thetas to compete alongside them against the Gammas in the stepping competition. Both teams were tied at the end and it was brought into sudden death rules to determine a winner. Unknown to DJ and the Thetas, the Gammas had recorded DJ practicing his moves prior to the competition. Going first, Grant does DJ's exact routine from the videotape. After he finishes, DJ matches Grant move for move, but tosses in something the Gammas didn't get on tape. The Thetas finally defeats the Gammas. April goes on stage to hug and kiss DJ and while celebrating their victory DJ still wearing Duron's gloves kisses his fist and throws it in the air in Honor of his brother. The Thetas then do their new cheer and have their picture taken where its hung in the Heritage Hall.

Straightheads
 Adam, a 23-year-old self-employed security technician, is hired by a businesswoman, Alice Comfort, to set up a security system in her flat.  After finishing the work, Adam falls asleep on a lawnchair on her roof-garden.  When Alice arrives home and finds him there, she impulsively asks him to accompany her to a housewarming party for her boss. He is unsure, but eventually agrees.  On the way home from the party, Alice and Adam are caught behind a slow-moving vehicle, which Alice frustratedly overtakes whilst Adam shouts out an obscenity at the driver. Shortly thereafter, Alice is distracted from driving and accidentally hits a stag. She brings the car to a stop, and they drag the stag off the road. While they are moving it, the car that Alice had earlier overtaken pulls up behind Alice's car. Three men get out, badly beat Adam and then rape Alice.  A month passes, during which Adam and Alice physically heal but both remain emotionally wounded. Upon returning to work, Alice receives notification that, while she was hospitalized following her rape, her father died. Alice drives out to his country estate to put his affairs in order, where she discovers a locked chest that she recognizes from her childhood. On the way home, she passes by a group of riders on horseback, one of whom she recognizes as having raped her. She gets his name - Heffer - from one of the other riders.  Alice then contacts Adam, and he makes his way to Alice's father's house where she tells him that she's found one of the men responsible for attacking them. Alice shows Adam the contents of her father's locked chest: a sniper rifle and silencer that her father apparently smuggled home after being discharged from the army. Alice then tells Adam that she intends to avenge herself against Heffer.  Adam and Alice go to Heffer's home with the intent to kill him.  As Alice is preparing to shoot him, a young woman (later identified as Heffer's daughter, Sophie) comes out of the house. Alice and Adam, disturbed by seeing their attacker as a human being, return home.  Over the next several days Alice and Adam try to determine if they should follow through with their plan. Adam, who has been impotent since the attack, steadily becomes more aggressive and committed to the idea of murdering Heffer. Alice, however, has grown reluctant to kill Heffer now that she has seen him in a human context; instead, she sends Adam to set up security equipment in Heffer's house in an attempt to determine the identities and locations of his friends who participated in the gang-rape.  Adam succeeds in breaking into Heffer's house and ends up in Sophie's room; initially, he merely attempts to keep her quiet so that he can get out of the house, but he has a sudden fit of rage and begins raping her. In the middle of the attack, she escapes from his grasp, and Adam returns home, able to maintain an erection for the first time since the attack.  The next day, Alice uses a laptop computer that controls the security cameras and watches Heffer in his house. She realizes his intention is to kill himself and after grabbing the rifle she rushes to his house. Alice  finds Heffer in his garage, sitting in his running car, attempting to kill himself with carbon monoxide poisoning. Alice gets Heffer out of the car and into fresh air, saving his life. In the midst of a delirium from the carbon monoxide, Heffer—who doesn't recognize Alice—confesses that, a month ago, his friends voiced their intentions to rape his daughter, but that he convinced them to rape and beat a woman and her friend in the middle of the road instead.  Just then, Alice and Heffer hear Adam calling from outside, and Heffer suddenly turns violent, grabbing her roughly but Alice hits him and frees herself. Adam then bursts into the house, beats Heffer, duct-tapes him to the kitchen table, and holds him down while Alice sodomizes him with the barrel of the rifle that she has fetched from her car; once she is finished, she prepares to kill him, but now feeling pity for him because of the circumstances surrounding the rape, she decides not to pull the trigger. Adam, infuriated, takes out a hunting knife and carves out Heffer's eye. Horrified, Alice runs away; driving back to her father's home, Alice spots Sophie hitch-hiking, and invites her into her car. When Sophie realizes she isn't being taken home, she asks Alice where they're headed; Alice replies, "Somewhere safe."  Back at Heffer's house, Adam taunts Heffer until he hears a car pulling up; as one of the attackers approaches the house, Adam fatally shoots him in the head before pursuing the remaining attacker through the grounds of Heffer's house. Adam shoots him in the leg as he flees, causing him to fall to the ground. Adam then approaches the wounded man and bludgeons him to death with the butt of the rifle. In the final shot of the film, Adam walks away from his final victim and approaches the screen for a close up shot. He effectively [[Fourth wall|breaks the fourth wall]] by glancing at the audience - leaving the viewer to reflect on the violent act of revenge Adam has committed.

He's been dead to the outside world for 10 months and his family is being pressured to remove all artificial means of [[life support]].  Meanwhile, back inside his own mind, George Grieves is in a desperate losing battle with his own manifested fears and decides that the only way out is to commit suicide in this dream-like state hoping that it will cause his real body to expire and free him from the interminable torment he's had to endure. He manages to leap from a 7th-floor window onto the concrete below, and the final shot is of his real-world body lying in an empty hospital room where it flatlines, closing its eyelids in physical death.

He comes accompanied by his trusty servant, Longinus, and his three sons, who assault the couple. Urbano is tied up to a tree and beaten, while Estrella is brutally raped. However the whole assault is politically motivated as the boss says to his servant when he was denied the chance to do what have his three sons did to the girl, "is political, not vice." At another point the mayor is extending its personal view of what happened: "Women and the laws are to be violated, provided that cause us problems."  Bewildered, Urbano's response is visceral but rational, without resorting to wash his honor and take immediate revenge, as would be more suitable to the melodrama of the time. Thinking in what is best for Estrella and in the future, the family does not report or talk about the rape, and the betrothed marry. What happened serves no other purpose than to sadden the happiness of the bride and relatives.

However vengeance occurs after some time, but in a way that gives it a certain beauty to the outcome of a sad story. Eventually the couple, along with the child, moved to live in New York, which represents in the film that ideal world, very missed by his grandfather, that rural life amid beautiful scenery could not provide for the ambitions of a local chief .  
Surf's Up (film)
 A documentary crew follows the misadventures of Cody Maverick, a 17-year-old [[northern rockhopper penguin]] who lives in Shiverpool, [[Antarctica]] with his mother Edna and his older brother Glen. Cody has wanted to be a professional [[surfer]] ever since a visit from legendary surfer Ezekiel "Big Z" Topanga several years ago. When a talent scout shorebird named Mikey arrives to find entrants for the "Big Z Memorial" surfing contest, Cody jumps at the chance despite the lack of support from his family. En route to the contest, Cody befriends another entrant, Chicken Joe.  The entrants arrive at Pen Gu Island, the site of the contest, where Cody meets and immediately falls in love with Lani, a female [[gentoo penguin]] who is a [[lifeguard]]. He also meets Tank "The Shredder" Evans, an arrogant penguin who has won the Big Z Memorial nine times since it was first held after Z's alleged death during a previous match ten years ago. Cody sees him vandalizing Big Z's [[memorial]] and immediately challenges Tank to a surfing duel. Tank easily wins the duel while Cody nearly drowns. Lani rescues him and takes him to her uncle, the "Geek", to help Cody recover from his injuries. Cody wakes up and panics when he can't find the souvenir necklace he got as a kid from Big Z. Geek criticizes the necklace, but decides to return it when he later finds it in his hut.  While returning the necklace, Geek finds Cody sitting on a [[Acacia koa|koa]] log and offers to help him make a perfect surfboard. They attempt to take the log back to Geek's house, only to lose control of it and end up on a [[beach]] far away from the contest. When Cody gets to the beach, he discovers a shack full of old trophies and surfboards, which are actually Z's belongings. After observing Geek sadly looking in the shack, he realizes that Geek is actually Z and asks him to teach him how to surf. Reluctantly, Z agrees, but says that Cody has to make his own board first. The attempt doesn't go well, however, as an impatient Cody doesn't listen to Z's advice and makes an unstable board that shatters as soon as he tries to enter the water. Angry, he storms off, running into Lani, who eventually persuades him to return. That night, a happier, more patient Cody works on a new board, finishing it by morning, and falls asleep.  Z compliments Cody on his board, but when Cody is eager to start training, he instead has him do seemingly menial tasks unrelated to surfing. Losing his patience with Z, he places him on the board and pushes him into the water while he is asleep as a prank. Z asks him if he had fun, and when Cody says "yes", Z takes him to the water and begins teaching him how to surf the waves, both being joined by Lani. Afterwards, Cody asks Z if he'll come watch the contest, but Z refuses, saying he faked his death because he realized he couldn't compete with his then-new rival Tank, and that he was disillusioned. Not impressed that Z just gave up, Cody morosely throws the necklace Z gave him to the sea and leaves, meets up with Joe, and gets back to the contest just as it begins.  Tank easily makes it to the finals, as do Cody and Joe. In the semifinals, Tank battles with Cody, with Tank trying to throw him off his board, but Tank falls off his own board and loses. During the finals, however, Tank bursts in and tries to hit Joe off his board. Cody intervenes at the last minute, sending him and Tank out of bounds and into a surfing obstacle known as the Boneyard, which has killed surfers who have ventured there. Tank punches Cody off his board before crashing, and is rescued by Lani. Z, who had been secretly watching Cody's performance, rescues Cody from a gigantic wave and helps him get back to the beach safely.  Z and Cody find out that Joe won by default since Tank and Cody were disqualified. However, Cody accepts the loss, having decided he'd rather just have fun instead. Z reveals himself to the spectators and invites all of them to surf at his beach. Cody finishes his interview with a reflection of the past events and then joins the rest of his friends in the water.  
Sunshine (2007 film)
 In 2057, the sun is dying and the Earth is freezing. A crew of eight pilot a colossal nuclear bomb aboard the spaceship ''Icarus II'', with the intent to jump start the sun, and return to Earth. As they slingshot past Mercury, ''Icarus II'' discovers the distress beacon of ''Icarus I'', the first ship to attempt a similar mission, which disappeared seven years earlier. Reasoning that two bombs have a better chance of success than one, physicist Capa recommends Captain Kaneda change course and commandeer ''Icarus I''. Mace, the ship's engineer, opposes the deviation as risky. Navigator Trey calculates and implements a trajectory to intercept ''Icarus I'', but forgets to realign the shields that protect the ship from the sun, causing damage to four shield panels.  Kaneda and Capa embark on a spacewalk to make repairs, assisted by pilot Cassie, who angles the damaged portion of the shield away from the sun. As expected, this allows the sun to destroy the protruding communications tower; however, reflected light also destroys the ship's oxygen garden and oxygen reserves. As ''Icarus II''s autopilot returns the shield to its original alignment, Kaneda orders Capa to safety, and Kaneda repairs the last panel, moments before he's immolated. Trey blames himself for the loss of Kaneda, and psychiatrist Searle assesses him as a suicide risk, sedating him.  ''Icarus II'' docks with ''Icarus I''. Capa, Searle, Mace, and former communications officer now-Captain Harvey search the vessel, leaving Cassie and botanist Corazon on board ''Icarus II''. They discover ''Icarus I''s mainframe has been sabotaged, making its bomb delivery impossible. In the ship's log is a rambling message from Captain Pinbacker, who abandoned his mission. The crew of ''Icarus I'' is found charred to death in the solar observation room, where they were long ago exposed to the unshielded sun. Suddenly, the two ships explosively decouple, destroying ''Icarus I''s outer airlock, stranding the four crew members on it. Mace suggests one crew member stay behind to manually operate the airlock while the other three jettison between airlocks, using the vacuum release for propulsion. Searle volunteers to stay behind. Capa is sealed in the only space suit, while Harvey and Mace wrap themselves in salvaged insulation material. Searle releases the airlock and the three crew members rocket into space. Harvey misses the airlock and freezes to death, while Capa and Mace make it back to ''Icarus II''. Searle, having spent the mission obsessed with looking into the shielded sun, voluntarily exposes himself to its full, deadly force in the observation room.  Corazon calculates that there is enough oxygen left for four of the five survivors to reach the sun. After a contentious vote, Mace decides to kill Trey, but discovers Trey has already committed suicide. With the remaining crew somewhat relieved that they will now at least make the trip to the sun, Capa is informed by ''Icarus'' that there is still not enough oxygen to complete the mission, because an unknown fifth person is onboard the ship. When Capa investigates, he discovers an insane and disfigured Pinbacker. Pinbacker attacks and wounds Capa and locks him in an airlock. He then kills Corazon and removes the mainframe from its coolant bath, shutting down the computer. He then pursues Cassie.  Mace attempts to manually lower the computer back into the freezing coolant, but when his leg catches on the descending computer he becomes trapped, and the computer is disabled. As he freezes to death, he radios Capa to escape the airlock, decouple the bomb from the ship, and activate it as it plummets into the sun, delivering the payload to its destination. Capa blows the airlock, separates the bomb from the ship, which explodes, and enters the payload, where he finds Cassie. Pinbacker ambushes them, telling them God ordered him to send all humanity to [[Heaven]]. As they hurtle into the sun, Capa escapes Pinbacker, reaching the bomb controls. Unsure if it will work under these extreme conditions, he watches as the bomb begins to successfully ignite at the edge of the sun itself.  Back on the frozen [[Sydney Harbour]], Capa's sister witnesses the sun returning to its full power.  
Superbad (film)
 Seth ([[Jonah Hill]]) and Evan ([[Michael Cera]]) are two high school seniors who lament their virginity and poor social standing. Best friends since childhood, the two are about to go off to different colleges, as Seth did not get accepted into [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] like Evan. After Seth is paired with Jules ([[Emma Stone]]) during [[Home economics|Home-Ec]] class, she invites him to a party at her house later that night. Later, their friend Fogell ([[Christopher Mintz-Plasse]]) comes up to the two and reveals his plans to obtain a [[Identity document forgery|fake ID]] during lunch. Seth uses this to his advantage and promises to bring alcohol to Jules' party. Meanwhile, Evan runs into his crush Becca ([[Martha MacIsaac]]) and he offers to get her some [[vodka]] for the party. Fogell's fake ID is met with derision by Seth and Evan, as it states that Fogell's name is simply "McLovin". After contemplating their options, Seth decides they have no choice but to have Fogell buy the alcohol with his fake ID. Fogell goes in and successfully buys the alcohol, but is interrupted when a robber enters the store, punches him in the face, and takes money from the cash register.  When police officers Slater ([[Bill Hader]]) and Michaels ([[Seth Rogen]]) arrive to investigate the robbery, Seth and Evan believe that Fogell will be arrested for possessing a fake ID. Inside the store, Slater and Michaels are apparently fooled by Fogell's ID and give him a ride to the party. While arguing over what to do, Seth is hit by a car being driven by Francis ([[Joe Lo Truglio]]), who promises to take them to a party he is attending in exchange for them not telling the police. During Fogell's time with the police, they exhibit very irresponsible behavior such as drinking on the job, shooting their firearms at a stop sign, and improper use of their sirens to run red lights. All the while, the three develop a strong friendship. When Seth and Evan arrive at the party, they quickly discover that Francis is not welcome there. Francis is brutally beaten by Mark ([[Kevin Corrigan]]), the party host, while Seth fills detergent bottles from the basement with alcohol he finds in the fridge. Just as he is about to leave, Mark angrily confronts him for dancing with his fiancée earlier, who was on her period. Mark also questions Seth as to why he is holding detergent bottles. Mark throws an empty beer bottle at Seth, but it misses and hits someone else, starting a fight between Mark and a few other people. Mark's fiancée is angry at Seth for embarrassing her and calls the police. Seth and Evan escape with the alcohol.  After running away, Evan and Seth begin to argue, with Seth angrily asking why Evan is going to Dartmouth when he knew Seth would not get accepted. Evan angrily responds that Seth has been holding him back for years and he does not want to miss out because of him. During the argument, Evan pushes Seth in front of the police cruiser driven by Slater and Michaels. Afraid of losing their jobs, the cops decide to frame Seth and Evan by arresting them, but when Fogell comes out of the car, Evan makes a run for it, and Seth and Fogell escape with the alcohol. While on a bus, a drifter attempts to steal the vodka Becca wanted, causing it to fall out of Evan's hand and break on the floor, after which the trio is kicked off. They run to the party, but on the way, Fogell accidentally clues Seth in on his plans to room with Evan the next year. Hurt, Seth angrily takes the alcohol into the party by himself. At the party, Seth becomes popular and Evan tries to [[Casual sex|hook up]] with Becca, but he changes his mind after realizing she is too drunk.  Becca drags Evan upstairs to have sex with him, but he refuses and leaves after she vomits next to him on the bed. Back downstairs, Evan gets drunk with a classmate while ranting angrily about girls, and passes out on a couch. Meanwhile, Fogell impresses Nicola ([[Aviva Baumann]]) and plans to have sex with her upstairs as well. Seth drunkenly attempts to kiss Jules, but she turns him down because she neither drinks nor wants anything to do with Seth while he is drunk. Seth then confesses to Jules his plan to hook up with her while they were both intoxicated and become her boyfriend over the summer before they both departed for college and that he has effectively ruined any chance of that happening. Jules tries to reassure him otherwise, but before she can continue, Seth passes out and accidentally headbutts her, leaving her with a black eye. Slater and Michaels bust the party, quickly shocking Seth awake again, and Seth saves an intoxicated Evan by carrying him out. Fogell's lovemaking only lasts for a moment, before he is interrupted by Slater, who scares Nicola away. Michaels calms down Slater, who is angry at Fogell for ditching them.  After they apologize for "cock-blocking" him, they reconcile and reveal they knew Fogell was not 25 the whole timethey played along, wanting to prove cops can have fun as well. To make it up to Fogell, they pretend to arrest him to boost his social standing, then proceed to drive recklessly and destroy their car with a [[Molotov cocktail]] while Fogell shoots it with the cop's firearm. At Evan's house, Seth reveals to Evan that he knew all along that Fogell was Evan's roommate in college after looking at papers Evan had lying around with that information. Evan reveals he did not want to room with Fogell and only did it because he did not want to live with strangers. He then confesses his true brotherly love feelings to Seth who in return shows the same feelings. Seth and Evan patch things up and declare their love for each other. The next morning, they go to the mall to buy stuff for college, where they run into Jules and Becca, and they all reconcile. In the end, Seth takes the escalator downstairs with Jules to buy [[concealer]] for her bruise, while Evan and Becca leave to go buy a new comforter to replace the one that Becca accidentally vomited on; signifying that the two will go their separate ways.  
Superman: Doomsday
 Superman has become an icon of virtue to the citizens of [[Metropolis]], a notion that angers billionaire philanthropist and Superman's primary archenemy [[Lex Luthor]], who is still plotting Superman's downfall. Meanwhile, Superman and [[Lois Lane]] have become romantically involved, and take time off together at the [[Fortress of Solitude]]. However, Lois is unsatisfied with keeping their relationship secretive and not being able to know Superman's real name. While digging for a project that Lex Luthor claims will better his chances of defeating Superman, workers from [[LexCorp]] unearth a spacecraft containing [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]], a genetically engineered super-soldier created by an alien race. The creature is highly hostile toward anything that moves; it kills the digging crew and begins a violent rampage towards [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], killing any living creature it sees.  Doomsday reaches Metropolis and decimates the Armed Forces mobilized to defend Metropolis, when Superman arrives. The two titans engage in a heated battle, and although Superman fights valiantly, Doomsday attacks him brutally and pounds him to where the Man of Steel bleeds. But before Doomsday can land another blow, a little girl approaches them in tears. Doomsday releases Superman and prepares to kill the girl, only for Superman to grapple him from behind and fly into space with him. Superman reenters the atmosphere and upon landing, effectively breaks Doomsday and defeats the monster once and for all. Despite his victory, Superman succumbs to his wounds in Lois' arms and apparently dies.  After knowledge of LexCorp's involvement with Doomsday's rampage is eliminated, Luthor kills his personal assistant [[Mercy Graves]] to ensure no one else knows of LexCorp's involvement. Meanwhile, the world mourns the loss of Superman and Metropolis honors him with a memorial park. Superman's friends cope with his death in various ways: [[Jimmy Olsen]] takes a job at a tabloid newspaper called the ''National Voyeur'', [[Perry White]] becomes an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], and Lois, who realizes that Clark was Superman, visits [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|Martha Kent]] for counsel.  In Superman's absence, Metropolis is overwhelmed by a rise of criminal activity. [[Toyman]] uses a giant mechanical spider to hold several children hostage in a school bus while robbing a federal reserve. Lois decides to save them herself, but when all but one little girl are out of the bus, Toyman tries to kill them. However, Lois and the girl are saved by none other than Superman, who then captures Toyman and receives applause. However, he doesn't seem quite the same, but Lois dismisses it as shock. She becomes suspicious, however, when Martha tells her that Clark has not called home.  The resurrected Superman is revealed to be a [[cloning|clone]] created by Luthor from a blood sample retrieved after his battle with Doomsday. Luthor is keeping the real Superman's body preserved in a tube, unaware that Superman is still barely alive. He periodically tortures the clone Superman in a special lead-lined room containing a red-sun filter with Kryptonite gauntlets. A [[Superman robots|robot]] from the Fortress of Solitude recovers Superman's body after detecting he was still alive and begins restoring Superman to health. Meanwhile, the clone's attitude darkens when he hears that Toyman killed a little girl after holding several children at a daycare hostage. In retaliation, the fake Superman drops him from a distance so that he falls to his death in front of the police station. The city is stunned and the clone threatens the populace into abiding by the law, convinced that the terror is preventative. This convinces Lois and Martha that this is not the real Superman.  Luthor berates the clone for his behavior, orders him to find Superman's corpse, and threatens to kill him if he misbehaves again. The clone deduces that a lead-shielded [[kryptonite]] pellet is in his brain, and removes it utilizing his heat vision and a mirror at a hair salon. Lois discovers the truth after tranquilizing Luthor and searching his files with Jimmy. They discover that Luthor is cloning an army of Supermen. Luthor awakens armed with a gun, but the original clone saves Lois and Jimmy. He also destroys the cloning facility including the yet-to-be-awakened clones. Luthor hides in the special room, hoping to kill the clone with the Kryptonite gauntlets, but the clone locks him inside and hurls the entire room into the street. This latest presumed murder triggers military action which fails.  At the Fortress of Solitude, Superman is revived and undergoes intensive rehabilitation exercises under solar energy to his powers. He resolves to confront the clone, even though his powers are not fully restored. To improve his odds, he dons a black sunlight-absorption suit and brings Luthor's original Kryptonite gun. The two engage in a heated battle, culminating at Superman's memorial. After the Kryptonite gun originally fails, Lois manages to hit the clone with a Kryptonite blast. He destroys the gun, leaving only the Kryptonite canister. The canister sticks to the clone's chest and Superman vaporizes it with heat vision. Before dying, the clone tells Superman to protect the people. Lois is sure of the real Superman once he kisses her, and the crowd is similarly happy now that they know that the real Superman is alive. At Lois' apartment, Superman reveals himself to be Clark Kent. Lois is caught off guard, but embraces Superman with elation.  At LexCorp, Lex Luthor is revealed to be critically injured and in a wheelchair, but still alive. He smiles, musing that there may still be a way for him to destroy Superman.

Anand establishes intelligence and wisdom at an early age and the couple is delighted at the intelligence of their young son. As time passes, the couple realises the importance of studies and come to know that a person can earn a good living in America, but proper education is required to go to America. Radha wants her son, Anand, to fulfill this dream for her. The couple tries to get Anand admitted to one of the best schools in town, where Anand is initially denied admission, as Swami and Radha are not very highly educated. Young Anand then himself speaks with the Principal and reveals the dream of his parents and requests her to give admission to him. The principal, moved by Anand's innocence, gives him admission.  Swami notices a rocking chair in an antique furniture shop and finds it very attractive. However, the chair is too expensive for him, costing 13 000 rupees. Radha notices it and wishes that she could buy that chair for Swami. While sending Anand to school, Radha has stomach pain. Swami takes her to a doctor, where she is diagnosed with a renal ailment which can be successfully treated by a simple operation. The couple inquires about the cost of the operation which is 25 000 rupees. Swami does not lose hope and starts saving money for Radha's operation. He saves the money in a box. One day, Swami reaches home and finds the same antique chair at home. He quickly figures out that Radha had taken the savings and immediately checks the box in which he used to save money and finds it empty. He is upset over Radha's behaviour but is moved by the love she establishes for her. He again starts working for the money so that he can get Radha treated for her ailment.  A few days later, Radha experiences a huge pain in her stomach. Swami, upon reaching home in the evening, finds Radha in a bad state and inquires about her help. Radha asks Swami to sit on the chair she bought for him and discloses her great desire and her dream of Anand to settle in America and while talking to Swami, she passes away. Swami takes the wish as her last wish.  In due course of time, Anand grows up into a handsome young lad and is working in a multinational bank and is also looking forward to settle in U.S. He is in love with Pooja and wishes to marry her and keeps his proposal in front of Swami who agrees for their marriage. In some time, Pooja gives birth to a beautiful baby boy, named Adarsh. Swami is delighted and spends more time with his grandson.  After playing cricket outside, Adarsh comes home, and starts running around in the house. He accidentally trips over Swami's rocking chair, and his forehead starts bleeding. Pooja is very angry and shouts at Swami. Due to this anger, she sells the rocking chair to a second hand shop. Swami returns home to find the chair missing, and is upset but is quiet about it. His son Anand comes home form work to find the chair is missing. Pooja realises what she did was wrong and asks for forgiveness and rushes out to get the chair back form the shop owner, but finds out later that the chair has already been sold. Swami forgives Pooja, but that night he cannot go to sleep.  Anand finally gets the opportunity to go to America, which delights his father and they make preparations to go there. When Anand goes to his boss, he finds out that his father doesn't get a pass to go to America. He decides that since his father cannot go, he will not go. Pooja firmly agrees with him. Swami overhears this, and decides he will live in a care home and gets a place for one but Anand doesn't want to leave him. However, Swami tries to tell him that this was what his mother wanted.  In the end, Swami is shown waving goodbye to his son and daughter-in-law tearfully. He goes inside a room and finds his rocking chair, and at this point he realises that Radha knew it belonged to him when she was on her deathbed. The film ends with Swami crying and hugging the chair  
Sword of the Stranger
  During the [[Sengoku period]] in Mount Corel, a young boy named Kotaro escapes from mysterious pursuers with his dog, Tobimaru. The monk guarding Kotaro, Shouan, asks him to seek help from Master Zekkai at Mangaku Temple, Akaike Corel Province. Meanwhile, a group of [[Ming dynasty]] warriors under the command of the elderly Lord Bai-Luan is escorted by Akaike by local soldiers. They are ambushed by bandits, but the attackers are slaughtered by the Ming's expert swordsman, Luo-Lang.  Kotaro and Tobimaru cross the earth, hiding briefly in a decaying temple, where they find Nanashi, a wandering swordsman. While Kotaro cooks a meal, the smoke of his fire alerts his pursuers, who are the foreign Ming, accompanied by Akaike's soldiers. Nanashi involuntarily gets involved in the fight and is able to kill the men, but Tobimaru is struck by a poisonous dagger. Before Nanashi decides to leave, Kotaro offers to hire him as bodyguard in order to save the life of Tobimaru and take them to their destination safely.  The trio is able to find a pharmacist who is able to help Tobimaru recover in a few days. While shopping in the city, Nanashi meets the other Ming warriors and Luo-Lang begins to quarrel with him for fun, but is interrupted by news of the deaths of his companions. Following the investigation, the Mings begin to suspect that Akaike's soldiers are responsible because one of the corpses was staged to appear as Tu-Si, one of the Ming warriors who had previously disappeared.  Lord Akaike, who hosts the Ming, is helping them build a large altar in exchange for large quantities of gold. It is revealed that he kidnapped the lost Ming to discover his true purpose of being in nibelheim. Under torture, Tu-Si reveals that they are on a mission to the Emperor of Mount Corel to find a prophesied child, Kotaro, whose blood can be drained at a certain time once a year, in order to create an elixir of immortality known as to Xian Remedy. Lord Akaike changes his plans to capture the child first and hold him for a high ransom. Meanwhile, Nanashi explains a few details about his past: he has western heritage, as evidenced by his [[red hair]], but was trained as a [[Samurai]] before deserting his former masters.  Nanashi arrives successfully at the temple with Kotaro and leaves him in the care of the monks of Mount Corel. However, it is revealed that they have already betrayed Kotaro to the Ming in order to save their own lives. A fight happens when the Akaike also arrives to take the boy. With Lord Akaike's betrayal discovered, the Ming arrest him and fortify himself on the altar to await the prophesied time. Realizing that something went wrong, Nanashi comes back and releases Tobimaru, and they track down Kotaro and his captors. The sole remaining commander of the Akaike, Itadori, is given the command of his forces by the princess and charged with rescuing the captured Lord. However, when he and his men arrive at the fortress, Itadori, seeing Lord Akaike in a compromising position, kills him and seizes the opportunity to realize his own ambitions. The troops, now under his command, begin a siege and attack the fortress.  During the ensuing battle, many of the Ming and Akaike soldiers were killed, including Itadori. Nanashi finally arrives to save Kotaro and successfully interrupts the ritual before it can be completed. Lord Bai-Luan orders the remaining Ming to capture the boy so they can experience the ritual again the following year. Nanashi kills two of the Ming fighters without his sword and gains the admiration of Luo-Lang, who has been searching for a worthy opponent. Luo-Lang knocks down his own commander, Bai-Luan, in order to save Nanashi from being shot. With the other Ming and Akaike forces totally destroyed, Luo-Lang and Nanashi have a final duel. After suffering many injuries, Nanashi wins and Luo-Lang dies, shocked but at peace.  Nanashi, Kotaro and Tobimaru set out on horseback to a town to treat Nanashi's wounds. They talk about putting together enough money to go abroad and start a new life back in the city where he was born nibelheim.

Taare Zameen Par
   Eight-year old Ishaan Nandkishore Awasthi dislikes school and fails every test or exam. He finds all subjects difficult, and is belittled and berated by his teachers and classmates. However, Ishaan's internal world is full of wonders that he is unable to convey to others, magical lands filled with colour and animated animals. He is also an artist whose talent is unrecognised.  Ishaan's father, Nandkishore Awasthi, is a successful executive who expects his children to excel. Ishaan's mother, housewife Maya Awasthi, is frustrated by her inability to educate her son. Ishaan's elder brother, Yohaan, is an exemplary scholar and athlete, which Ishaan is frequently reminded of.  After receiving a particularly poor academic report, Ishaan's parents send him to a boarding school. There he sinks into a state of fear and depression, despite being befriended by Rajan Damodharan, a [[disability|physically disabled]] boy and one of the top students in the class. He even contemplates suicide by climbing up the fence in a terrace, which Rajan manages to save him from.  Ishaan's situation changes when a new art teacher, Ram Shankar Nikumbh, joins the school's faculty. An instructor at the Tulips School for young children with [[Developmental disability|developmental disabilities]], Nikumbh's teaching style is markedly different from that of his strict predecessor, and he quickly observes that Ishaan is unhappy and contributes little to class activities. He reviews Ishaan's work and concludes that his academic shortcomings are indicative of dyslexia.  On his day off, Nikumbh sets off to Mumbai, to visit Ishaan's parents. Nikumbh is surprised to learn that Ishaan is passionate about painting, and shows great talent in art. Nikumbh then asks Awasthi as to why he sent Ishaan to a boarding school. Awasthi replies that Ishaan was an ill-mannered boy and was a poor student. Nikumbh shows Ishaan's mother her son's notebooks and gives an analysis of the script. Nikumbh deduces that Ishaan has severe difficulty in understanding letters and words. Awasthi tries to dismiss it as a mere excuse for Ishaan's laziness. Nikumbh demonstrates what Ishaan experiences every day at school. He states that Ishaan has dyslexia as well as he may be having other conditions, which make him a difficult child.  Still unsatisfied with Nikumbh's interpretation, Awasthi bluntly dismisses Ishaan's disability as mental retardation, which frustrates Nikumbh, who criticises Awasthi for his crude and inaccurate explanation of Ishaan's condition. Nikumbh argues that Ishaan is an above-average child whose condition suppresses his artistic and mental talent, leading Awasthi to feel regret for his treatment of Ishaan.  Nikumbh returns, and subsequently brings up the topic of dyslexia in class, and offers a [[List of people diagnosed with dyslexia|list of famous people who were dyslexic]]. Later, Nikumbh reveals to Ishaan, that he too is a dyslexic and faced problems similar to Ishaan. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's tutor. He attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using [[Dyslexia#Management|remedial techniques]] developed by dyslexia specialists; Ishaan soon develops an interest in language and mathematics, and his grades improve.  Towards the end of the school year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The competition is judged by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year.  
Sydney White
 Sydney White ([[Amanda Bynes]]) is the daughter of a plumber, Paul White ([[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]]). Her mother, a Kappa Sorority member, died when Sydney was still young. She sets off to attend college at SAU and pledge to her mother's once dignified sorority. There she meets Demetria Rosemead Hotchkiss ([[Crystal Hunt]]), known as Dinky, also an upcoming member of the Kappa Sorority, and the two quickly become friends. While on their way to their dorm, she meets Tyler Prince ([[Matt Long]]), the president of a popular fraternity, who is also the on-off boyfriend of the extremely tyrannical, manipulative, and most hated president of the student council and the head of the Kappa Sorority, Rachel Witchburn ([[Sara Paxton]]). Rachel checks out her university's website that ranks the "hottest" in the school several times a day, and is always number one on the list. Tyler meets Sydney and is immediately smitten, while Rachel watches from her window, with an immediate dislike towards Sydney. When she first meets Sydney she believes that she's not "Kappa material" and doesn't care that she's a legacy.  Since Sydney and Dinky's mothers were Kappas, they survived the rush and were accepted as legacies. However, they need to survive the pledging. Sydney's tomboyish upbringing proves to be an asset as she stands out among the other girls and manages to overcome the difficult initiation tasks. She also unintentionally inspires the other girls to innocently defy shallow things that Rachel teaches them. This unique personality gradually propels Sydney's popularity as seen on the university website. Rachel gets extremely jealous of her because of this. As one of the Kappa Sorority's traditional rituals, the freshmen need to find a date late at midnight. Sydney finds Lenny ([[Jack Carpenter (actor)|Jack Carpenter]]), one of the seven dorks who live in a run-down house known as the Vortex. Sydney is then picked by Rachel to ditch her date, which ended in Lenny paying.  Sydney fails to become a member of Kappa when Rachel humiliates her in the pledge gala and lies that she has disobeyed the rules: lying about her background and cheating on a Kappa quiz. Sydney leaves that night in the rain, unintentionally sitting in front of the Vortex. She is welcomed by the seven dorks: Lenny, the one with high maintenance health; Terrence ([[Jeremy Howard (actor)|Jeremy Howard]]), a genius and post-grad, despite the fact that he still attends classes; Jeremy ([[Adam Hendershott]]), who is very shy and only uses his puppet to talk; Gurkin ([[Danny Strong]]), a hot-tempered blogger; Spanky ([[Samm Levine]]), who has no experience with girls; George ([[Arnie Pantoja]]), the childlike freshman who still believes in Santa Claus and doesn't know how to tie a knot; and Embelakbo Akapaktumbe– also known as "Embele"– (Donté Bonner), a [[Nigeria]]n interchange student who is highly intelligent but has [[Jet lag]]. The Vortex is coincidentally the target of Rachel's plan to open a luxury center that will benefit only the top Greek sororities and fraternities. She plans to subject it to a planned demolition, which is something Tyler is opposed to after he gets to know Sydney and her housemates better.  Sydney, together with the seven dorks, tries to bring Rachel down from her student council position by running Terrence for president. He is soon disqualified because he had already graduated six years prior, as revealed when Rachel humiliated the group at a party. Sydney replaces him as a presidential candidate and starts her campaign. Unlike Rachel's views that promote elitism and exclusivism based solely on popularity and appearances, something that everyone on campus dislikes about her, Sydney and the dorks believe in accepting diversity and equality. This earns Sydney respect from different cliques, and she gets the number one rank on the school's "hottest" website, which infuriates Rachel more than ever. The day before the debate and election, Rachel hires a hacker to destroy Sydney's files using a virus called 'The Poison Apple.' Sydney is then forced to stay up all night in the library doing her work on Gurkin's laptop. When Sydney finishes her work, she accidentally falls asleep and is almost disqualified for not showing up, but Tyler wakes her with a kiss just in time. After Rachel answers the question posed by Professor Carleton ([[Brian Patrick Clarke]]), Sydney's supporters arrive, led by a [[Goth subculture|goth]] girl (Kierstin Koppel) whose group is devoted to Gurkin's blog and becomes his girlfriend. Sydney's speech defends the underrated people, including dorks, and concludes by stating that she herself is a dork. This incites a number of students to also admit dork status including Tyler, Jeremy, Spanky and Dinky. Sydney wins the debate and the election, becoming the new president, while Rachel is stripped of her Kappa sisterhood privileges by her sisters because of the years of cruelty she bestowed on both her Kappa sister's and the students at the University as well as lying and cheating during the election.  The film ends with Sydney's father and other construction workers fixing the Vortex. New relationships have formed as well—Dinky and Lenny are now a couple (who bonded because of their sensitive digestive system), Spanky is finally getting some girls, the Goth girl and Gurkin are dating, and Sydney and Tyler are together. George has learned how to tie a knot, Jeremy is finally coming out of his shell, and Terrence has become a millionaire because of his theory (He sold his theory {the predictive analytic probability theory that he finally perfected and can predict anything from the behavior of amino acids in a stable isotope peptide bond to the outcome of sporting events} to ibet.com for $10 million). And, according to Sydney's narration, they all lived "dorkily ever after".

Tamagotchi: The Movie
  The movie starts off with [[Mametchi]] finishing his new "Transporter Machine". At the same time, Tanpopo goes off to deliver a forgotten item to her mother. Tanpopo and Mametchi are both about to become older siblings. Memetchi and Kuchipatchi arrive at Mametchi's house just in time to see Mametchi try out his invention. Several events result in the aim of the Forwarding Machine to go off course, and Tanpopo is brought to Tamagotchi Planet.  The next day, Tanpopo goes to school to learn with the Tamagotchi children. During science class, an explosion kisses the room into smoke and darkness. Almost everyone is fine, but Mametchi crouches on the floor in fear. Later, Mametchi explains that he has been afraid of the dark ever since he got trapped in a hole one time. He fears he will be an embarrassment to his little sibling. Mametchi built the Transporter Machine to bring himself his own private sun to give him light. Mametchi vows to begin experiments to make a little sun for himself.  One day, Mametchi and Tanpopo stay home. Papamametchi gives Tanpopo a key that will take her back to the time when she was forwarded to Tamagotchi Planet. After several more events, the egg bounds out the window, rolls down the street, and eventually falls into a bundle of balloons that end up caught on the top of One Tower. Soon all of Tamagotchi Planet is watching Mametchi try to save the egg. Mametchi, Tanpopo, and Memetchi are all trying to save Mametchi's younger sibling, and Kuromametchi saves all three of them, using Kuchipatchi as a trampoline.  Soon, the egg hatches into Mametchi's sister, Chamametchi. A montage of events follow, as Chamametchi grows to [[kindergarten]] age, while Mametchi finally succeeds in creating "Mamesunnitchi", a little sun that will follow Mametchi everywhere and always provide him with light. The real Tamagotchi Planet sun, Sunnitchi, witnesses this. Soon after, the rocket for Tanpopo is complete. Mametchi says he wants Tanpopo to stay for the birthday celebrations for the King, and both Tanpopo and Mametchi's parents agree.  The next morning, it is dark outside. Sunnitchi is nowhere to be found, and thus Tamagotchi Planet has no light. Mametchi and the others find this odd, but go to school anyway. During more preparations, a sneezing sound is heard, and the Tamagotchi Planet inhabitants are violently thrown into the air. It is soon discovered that Tamagotchi Planet caught a cold due to having no heat. Mametchi and Tanpopo overhear Principal Mimizu explaining that Sunnitchi left a goodbye note, apparently because Mametchi created a new sun. Mametchi takes this to mean that the whole situation was his fault.  That night, Mametchi sneaks out of the house with Mamesunnitchi and enters the completed rocket. Suddenly, Tanpopo, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi appear, eager to help. They give Mametchi the manual, and he is able to start up the rocket. Chamametchi sneaks aboard at the last minute, and they are forced to take her with them.  As the passengers enter space, Papamametchi and the other scientists appear suddenly on the video screen and demand that they return. When Mametchi tells Papamametchi about how he is taking responsibility for his mistakes (just like with the egg incident), Papamametchi reluctantly agrees. The scientists had developed medicine for the Tamagotchi Planet, and the pill was mounted on top of the rocket. They have only one medicine capsule, and only one chance of administering it. Before Mametchi can fire the pill, Chamametchi jumps into his lap at the last moment, dislocating the rocket's trajectory. Though it appears they have failed at curing Tamagotchi planet, Tamagotchi World is able to absorb it with its runny nose.  At this point, Mametchi is about to go in search of Sunnitchi, but the rocket is sent spiraling away, and outside of radio contact. Mametchi finally reaches the breaking point and rails against Chamametchi when she asks to talk to Papamametchi and Mamametchi, yelling at her to be quiet, and that she is to blame for always following him around and not listening to him. Tanpopo tells Mametchi he said too much, and takes Chamametchi into another room to comfort her. Mametchi and the others join Tanpopo and Chamametchi for several minutes, where Mametchi and Chamametchi make up, and Tanpopo now knows what's in store for her when her younger sibling is born and is no longer afraid of that responsibility. Suddenly, however, the ship shakes violently, and they return to the command center to find that there are all sorts of objects flying towards them. They suddenly realize that they are drifting towards a black hole, and Mametchi is stricken with fear.  Mametchi attempts to fire the rocket, but the ship can't escape the pull of the black hole. Suddenly, communications with the Tamagotchi Planet are restored. One of the scientists (Professor Mametchi) notices that the black hole is actually a sleeping Blackholetchi. The only way to save the passengers is to wake Blackholetchi up. Mametchi activates the loudspeaker and everyone on the ship screams out, trying and awaken Blackholetchi. A meteoroid slams into the ship and blocks the loudspeaker so that no sound can come out. In desperation, Mametchi and Tanpopo put on spacesuits and try to dislodge the meteoroid. With the meteroid dislodged, Memetchi, Kuchipatchi, and Chamametchi started shouting at Blackholetchi again. Soon, all of the people on Tamagotchi Planet join in. Mametchi is finally able to overcome his fear of the dark, and joins in the call to awaken Blackholetchi.  Chamametchi starts screaming for Blackholetchi to wake up once more, and soon Tamagotchi World himself makes a loud cry. This finally reaches Blackholetchi, who awakes from his slumber. Mametchi is heard calling out from within Blackholetchi, and the universe's largest Tamagotchi apologizes and returns them to the ship. Communications are once again cut off; the inhabitants on Tamagotchi World note that the rocket has used up all of its fuel, and there is no way for the rocket's passengers to return. Mametchi's connection is restored, and the passengers have returned home. Sunnitchi, brought them all back to Tamagotchi Planet. Sunnitchi explains that he just left to go on a hot springs tour.  The celebration for the King's birthday begins, and there is a parade through Tamatown. Halfway through, Papamametchi and Mamametchi find Tanpopo and tell her that Cometchi is about to fly by Tamagotchi World, willing to take Tanpopo back to Earth. Hastily Tanpopo, Mametchi and his family, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi go to the meadow to meet Cometchi. Tanpopo finally opens up the bag that she was supposed to be taking to her mother, and sees it is the dress that she had worn when she was a newborn. Chamametchi cries that she doesn't want Tanpopo to go, and a tearful farewell follows, with the Tamagotchis promising to never forget her.  Tanpopo is back at her desk in her room, at the exact time before she was forwarded to Tamagotchi Planet. She wonders if it was all a dream, until she sees the key she was given. Just then, her mother calls, and Tanpopo tells her she's about to deliver her bag.

A Tale of Mari and Three Puppies
 On the way back home, Ryota and his sister Aya met an abandoned [[Shiba Inu]]. At first reluctant to adopt it because their father hates dogs, they eventually brought it home secretly because the dog kept on following them home. In order to officially keep the dog at home, Aya told her grandfather that she wanted that dog for her birthday present. Since he promised to give her anything she wants for her birthday, he reluctantly agreed. This initially led to a quarrel between him and his son. Meanwhile, his son, is considering moving to [[Nagaoka, Niigata|Nagaoka city]] from Yamakoshi, their village, reduce the time needed for his father to reach the hospital and for the children to live near their school, despite opposition from his father. Aya subsequently names the dog Mari, and it becomes a part of the family.  A year later, Mari gave birth to three puppies. That spring, animals behaved strangely, foreshadowing something major to come. On 23 October 2004, a major earthquake, which later became known as the [[2004 Chūetsu earthquake|Chūetsu earthquake]] struck and devastated the whole village. At that time, only grandfather and Aya were at home, and they were pinned down by a wardrobe that collapsed onto them. Mari quickly moved her puppies to a safe place before trying to help the two of them in the house.  Meanwhile, Ryota, who was in school, and his father were safe. They immediately went to the emergency shelter, where they heard that Yamakoshi became isolated after the earthquake, thereby making it hard for rescuers. Subsequently, rescuers from the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] started combing the village and evacuating people by helicopter. Mari noticed two such rescuers and eventually led them to Aya and her grandfather. Thanks to Mari, the two of them were successfully extracted from the wreckage. Her grandfather had lost a lot of blood, and therefore the pair was evacuated by air. However, just when Aya was about to be evacuated, she asked that Mari be evacuated along as well. Her rescuer reluctantly refuses this request, and seeing her pain at being separated from the dog, he felt extremely bad. He even apologizes to her when they met again at the emergency shelter. Without its owner, Mari tries all ways and means to protect her puppies and feed them properly. It also waited patiently for the return of its owner.  One day, Aya read in a newspaper that torrential rain would soon flood Yamakoshi and became worried about Mari. She convinces Ryota to sneak into the disaster zone in order to rescue Mari. Together they sneaked off into the devastated village, but they have difficulties navigating through the debris there. To make things worse, they also had to contend with aftershocks and the heavy rain. In this treacherous terrain, Aya cuts her foot, making it painful for her to carry on. She later runs a high fever, and Ryota panics, unsure of what to do in this situation. Luckily, someone who had seen them leaving the shelter had told their father of their whereabouts, and their father managed to find them after a long search.  After this incident, Aya did not mention about Mari anymore. When the aftershocks subsided, each family was able to send one representative to go into the village to survey the damage and to collect personal items. Since everyone at the shelter had heard the story of Mari, some people forgo their places to let Ryota and Aya search for Mari again. After a long search, there was no sign that Mari or its three puppies were alive. Just when they were about to give up, a puppy appears, followed by the rest of the dogs. The family happily took back the dogs to the shelter amid applause from the villagers.  In 2005, the family moved into a temporary shelter and life for them more or less returns to normal. Mari also lives there with her three puppies.

Taxi to the Dark Side
 The documentary background to the death of Dilawar, an Afghan peanut farmer, who gave up farming to become a taxi driver, and who died after several days of beating at [[Parwan Detention Facility|Bagram detention center]].  Dilawar left his home of [[Yakubi]] in eastern [[Afghanistan]] in the autumn of 2002, investing his family money in a new taxi to make money in a larger city. On 1 December 2002 he and three passengers were handed over to US military officials by a local Afghan warlord, accused of organising an attack on [[Camp Salerno]]. The warlord was later found guilty of the attack himself, but had been ingratiating himself (for $1000 per person) by handing over alleged terrorists.  Dilawar was held at the prison at [[Bagram Airfield|Bagram Air Base]], and given the prisoner number BT421. Chained from the ceiling, he received multiple attacks on his thighs, a standard technique viewed as "permissible" and non-life-threatening. It is likely that the severe attack caused a blood clot which then killed him. His official death certificate created by the US military to pass to his family, with his body, was marked "[[homicide]]". Medical conclusion stated that Dilawar's legs were "pulpified" and, had he lived, would have required amputation.  The film explores the background of increasingly sanctioned "torture" since [[9/11]] in contravention of the [[Geneva Convention]] and looks at the exposures of [[Abu Graib]].  Interviews include [[Tim Golden (journalist)|Tim Golden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' who brought the case into the international spotlight, and [[Moazzam Begg]], a British citizen imprisoned at the same time, and witness to the events. Military interviewees include [[Damien Corsetti]] the main interrogator, and Sgt [[Anthony Morden]]. Cpt [[Christopher Beiring]] explains how he was the only person charged (charged with derliction of duty).  The documentary claims that of the over 83,000 people incarcerated by US forces in Afghanistan up to 2007, 93 percent were captured  by local militiamen and exchanged for US bounty payments. Also that 105 detainees had died in captivity and that 37 of these deaths had been officially classified as homicides up to 2007.<ref name="wsws"></ref>  The film also looks at [[Guantánamo Bay]] and how the same techniques were implemented there.  
The Ten Commandments (2007 film)
 The Pharaoh is a nervous man, outnumbered by his Hebrew slaves; he orders them to be worked harder, that doesn't break their spirits, so he has all the newborn male babies killed; Moses' parents are not keen on a dead baby, and put him in a basket and send him down the river, where the Pharaoh's daughter adopts and raises him as her own; his playmate is Ramses, the Pharaoh's son. As teens, they wrestle, but Ramses does not like Moses much, and Moses is exiled from town after Moses comes to the aid of a slave being beaten, and the beater is killed.  They all grow up, Ramses is now Pharaoh, God speaks to Moses, telling him to get the Hebrews from Egypt into the promised land. Ramses says no, the ten plagues come, and Ramses gives in only when his son is killed (as God's spirit kills all the first-born Egyptian sons). Moses leads the people from Egypt, ditches Ramses and his army at the parting of the Red Sea, and Moses receives the Ten Commandments and delivers them to the Hebrews. Moses puts Joshua in charge of leading the people the rest of the way.  
Teeth (film)
 Dawn O’Keefe ([[Jess Weixler]]) is a teenage spokesperson for a Christian abstinence group called the Promise. She attends groups with her two friends, Alisha (Julia Garro) and Phil (Adam Wagner). One evening after giving a speech about the [[purity ring]] worn by members of the group, she is introduced to Tobey ([[Hale Appleman]]) and finds him attractive. The four begin going out as a group. Dawn has fantasies about marrying Tobey, although after acknowledging the attraction, they agree that they cannot spend time together. Soon after they give in and meet at a local swimming hole. After swimming together, they go into a cave to get warm and begin kissing. Dawn gets uncomfortable and tries to get them to go back. Tobey then attempts to rape Dawn, who panics and tries to push him off. Tobey becomes aggressive and shakes Dawn, resulting in her smacking her head on the ground. While she is dazed, Tobey takes the opportunity to begin raping her. Dawn fights back and inadvertently bites off his penis with her vagina. A horrified Dawn stumbles away and she flees the scene. After a Promise meeting, she meets her classmate Ryan ([[Ashley Springer]]) at a dance; they talk, and he drops her off at her home.  Dawn drops her purity ring off a cliff and goes back to the swimming hole. She screams in horror when she sees a freshwater crab crawling on Tobey's penis. She then researches "[[vagina dentata]]" and realizes she may have it.  She visits a [[gynaecology|gynecologist]], Dr. Godfrey ([[Josh Pais]]), in an attempt to find out what is happening to her. When he assaults her in the guise of an examination, reaching up inside her without a glove, she panics and her vagina bites off all four fingers on his right hand. While biking home, she encounters a police officer driving Tobey's car and sees several police vehicles pass. She decides to go back to visit the pool to investigate. When she arrives, she sees the police bringing up Tobey's body - he presumably died of shock in the water. Meanwhile, back at home, her ill mother Kim O'Keefe (Vivienne Benesch) collapses. Dawn's stepbrother Brad ([[John Hensley]]) and his girlfriend Melanie (Nicole Swahn) hear her collapse but ignore her, continuing to have sex while she lies on the floor. Dawn's mother is taken to the hospital.  Dawn goes to Ryan seeking help, hysterical about her encounter with the doctor and her mother. Ryan gives her a sedative and masturbates her with a vibrator. Though initially afraid she will hurt him, she finds that when she is relaxed and is consenting to the sexual activity taking place, her "teeth" do not engage. The following morning they have sex again, but mid-coitus Ryan’s friend calls. Ryan smugly boasts that he and the friend had bet on whether he could score with Dawn. In her anger, her vagina bites off his penis, and she leaves him to call his mother for help. Dawn learns her mother has died, leading her stepfather Bill ([[Lenny Von Dohlen]]) to attempt to throw Brad out, but Brad sets his dog on Bill, during which Brad confesses his love for Dawn. Dawn meets her stepfather and Melanie at the hospital and seeing her stepfather hurt and hearing from Melanie how Brad told her to ignore her mother's cries for help earlier, she becomes emboldened by her power and goes back home to seek revenge. Dawn puts on make-up and goes to seduce her stepbrother. In the midst of the act, Brad recalls that, while still kids, Dawn bit his finger, but it was not her mouth that bit him. As he realizes this, Dawn’s vagina bites off his penis. She releases it on the ground and Brad’s dog eats it, spitting out the [[Prince Albert (genital piercing)|genital pierced]] [[Glans penis|glans]]. Dawn leaves him and he presumably bleeds to death.  Dawn cycles away from home, but her bike tire sustains a puncture, so she begins hitchhiking. She gets a lift from an old man ([[Doyle Carter]]), but falls asleep and rides for several hours, waking up after nightfall. When she tries to get out, he repeatedly locks the doors. He licks his lips as if to ask for a sexual favor to release her; Dawn hesitates, and then looks towards the camera—and the old man—with a seductive smile.

Ten Inch Hero
 The story revolves around a group of people who work at a sandwich shop (that sells ten inch heroes/the sandwiches). The main cast of characters are:  * '''Piper''', a young art student who has just moved to [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]]. She has a secret: 8 years earlier she gave up her daughter for an open adoption, and all she knew was that the mother planned to name the child Julia and the father's name was Noah. The adoptive parents cut off contact with Piper when Julia was two, leaving a hole in Piper's life. When she read in an art newsletter about an 8 year old talented art student named Julia who bore a slight resemblance to Piper, she moved to Santa Cruz to see if she could meet Julia to see if she was OK.  She gets a job in the sandwich shop.  * '''Jen''', a shy, plain-looking, kind-hearted girl who is a tech nerd at the sandwich shop and runs their website. She has an email romance with a stranger known to her only as ''Fuzzy22''. She is afraid to meet him in person and is a late bloomer who has never dated. * '''Tish''' is a bold, outspoken woman who works at the sandwich shop. She is very beautiful and uses manipulative techniques to attract men, leading to brief, emotion-free flings with many of them&mdash;she cuts off contact if she feels they're getting emotionally involved.  * '''Priestly''' is the cook at the sandwich shop. He is a free-spirited punk who uses humor, as well as numerous body modifications, to create a barrier between himself and others, and to hide his own emotions, thoughts, and true self. He wears T-shirts with hilariously inappropriate sayings, has numerous piercings, wears thick eye makeup, dyes his hair in bright colors and styles it into mohawks, has elaborate facial hair, and many tattoos.  * '''Trucker''', the restaurant owner, who is a laid back surfer child and hippie of the '60s. He's secretly in love with Zo, a spiritual woman who owns a shop across the street. * '''Tadd''', an arrogant, wealthy, superficial but handsome man who dates Tish.  Shortly after Piper begins her job, she sees 8 year-old Julia with her father Noah at the beach. The three meet and Piper introduces herself as "Anna", in case Noah remembers her distinctive name from the adoption process. She quickly bonds with Julia over their shared love of art and drawing, leading to Julia asking Piper to become her art tutor. Piper also immediately hits it off with Noah, and she learns that Julia's mother is not in their lives anymore, though Noah is vague about the circumstances. Meanwhile, Tish has met Tadd, and greatly enjoys her time with him, though she thinks it odd that he is almost inseparable from his friend Brad.  Fuzzy22 has asked Jen to meet him in person, to which she reluctantly agrees, though Jen is very nervous&mdash;she and Fuzzy22 had agreed to not exchange any identifying information, so she has no idea how old he is, what he looks like, or if he is male or female.  Before the trip, Noah asks Piper out on a date, to which she agrees, although she says she has some things to tell him first. Piper, Tish and Jen go on their trip to meet up with Fuzzy22, but after they finally arrive at the meeting point, Jen sees that Fuzzy22 is an extremely handsome young man. She balks and runs away without meeting him, and she confesses to Piper and Tish that someone like Fuzzy22 could never like someone like her, because she is according to herself not very attractive. She asserts that the very conventionally attractive Tish and Piper don't know what it feels like to always be ignored and pushed aside because she's not pretty. She cares a great deal about Fuzzy22, and feels that a man as attractive as he is would, upon seeing her, become disappointed and uninterested and she could not bear that from him. Although the two friends try to convince Jen to go back and meet with him, she refuses, so they drive back to Santa Cruz.  Piper goes out on a date with Noah, and she prepares to tell him the truth about herself, but he first wants to share something: the reason he has been reluctant to talk about Julia's mother is that she lives on the east coast and severely abused Julia, leading to divorce and a court order that the mother is not allowed to contact Julia until her 18th birthday. During this conversation, Piper finds out that Julia is ''not'' adopted, and that Noah and his ex-wife are Julia's birth-parents. Realizing that Julia isn't the daughter she gave up, she runs away, upset, leaving behind a very confused Noah.  Tish and Tadd are in bed together, when Brad shows up and attempts to turn the coupling into a threesome. Tish becomes very upset and Tadd speaks of her contemptuously. The two men try to coerce her into having sex with them, and a now frightened Tish tries to run away but is held back by Tadd. They scuffle, and this leads to Tish hitting her head on a dresser. She runs away and appears the next day at work with a bandaid on her forehead to conceal the bruise. Tadd shows up to take her out, and she confronts him about what he did to her, but he is scornful and unrepentant. Tish asserts that he and Brad are gay, but will not admit it to themselves so they use the pretense of a threesome to have sex with each other. This infuriates the homophobic Tadd, and he hits her. Priestly attacks Tadd and is injured. The normally laid-back Trucker then arrives and subdues Tadd with heretofore undisplayed advanced fighting techniques, contradicting Trucker's surfer hippie laid-back persona.  Trucker takes everyone back to his home and admits that he was never a surf child who went to Woodstock, but that actually he was a very macho guy who served three tours in Vietnam, where he killed more people than he could count and learned deadly fighting skills. He then returned to the United States and was lost and traumatized, until he met surfers and decided to live a peaceful lifestyle. He vowed never to commit any violence against a human being again. He shows Piper, Jen, Tish, and Priestly his high school yearbook, demonstrating that he was captain of the football team and class president. When he's talking with Tish, he asks her to start dating nice guys, but Tish, quickly glancing at Priestly, says that good guys don't ask girls like her out. Jen, leafing through Trucker's yearbook, excitedly calls everyone's attention to a photo of Zo. Trucker realizes he doesn't have to hide his past from Zo because she already knows who he really is. He finally works up the courage to ask her out, to which she happily agrees. She has had a crush on him since high school, when she was a shy freshman, and even though it is decades later, she says that many still carry high school within themselves, so she could never show Trucker how she felt despite now being a confident and secure woman.  Piper and Noah have another talk, and he forgives her for lying and asks her if she still wants to be a part of the family. She happily agrees. At the shop, a homeless man comes in and tells Jen that he thinks she's really pretty, and that she's exactly who he had hoped she'd be. He then removes his homeless disguise and reveals himself to be Fuzzy22.  He introduces himself to Jen and they happily hug. Priestly reveals that when Jen forgot to log off the computer one night, he talked to Fuzzy22 and told him the situation and how to meet Jen.  The next day, Priestly comes to the shop and is almost unrecognizable, dressed in [[Banana Republic (clothing retailer)|Banana Republic]] khakis and an Oxford shirt, piercings removed, his hair parted down the middle with bright colors washed out, tattoos mostly hidden, and no punk makeup, and finally asks Tish out. He had been  hinting throughout the movie that he was interested in her, but was frustrated because she seemed to never notice him and she was wasting her time with shallow relationships with guys she could manipulate, rather than seeking emotional intimacy. She agrees to go out on a date with him but only on the condition that he tell her his first name, which turns out to be Boaz. She then reveals that her first name is actually Platisha. The movie ends with all the new couples at the beach for Zo and Trucker's commitment ceremony to each other, at which they arrive riding horses, naked.

Héctor scans the forest behind their house with binoculars and sees a young woman take off her T-shirt, exposing her breasts. When his wife goes shopping, he investigates and finds the woman on the ground, naked and unconscious. He is then stabbed in the arm by a mysterious man with pink bandages on his face. Fleeing and breaking into a mysterious nearby building, Héctor contacts a scientist ([[Nacho Vigalondo]]) by [[walkie-talkie]], who warns him of the bandaged man and guides him to his location, promising safety. The scientist convinces Héctor to hide from the bandaged man, who is just outside, in a large mechanical device. However, when he leaves the machine, Héctor discovers that he has traveled approximately an hour back in time.  The scientist explains that the machine is an experimental time travel device, and refers to Héctor as "Héctor 2". The scientist tells him that they need to stay where they are and let events unfold. Despite the scientist's warning, Héctor 2 drives off in a car, passing a cyclist, only to be run off the road by a van, cutting his head, which he wraps using the bandage from his arm wound. The bandage turns pink from absorbing the blood. The cyclist approaches to see if he is all right - it is the woman he earlier saw in the forest. He proceeds to replicate events by making her undress in view of Héctor 1. When she runs away, he catches her, inadvertently knocking her out. He lays her out naked on the ground and then stabs Hector 1 in the arm when he arrives. The woman escapes. Héctor 2 returns to his home, where he hears a scream and chases a woman through his house and onto the roof. When he attempts to grab her, she slips and falls to her death. Seeing the body from the roof, Héctor 2 is horrified, believing he has killed his own wife.  Héctor then contacts the scientist over a walkie-talkie and convinces him to lure Héctor's past self to the lab with warnings that he is being pursued. Driving to the lab, Héctor 2 insists that he must travel back one more time, despite the scientist revealing that there is a Héctor 3, who told him he must stop Héctor 2 from doing just that.  After removing his bandages, Héctor 2 convinces the scientist to send him back several seconds before he initially appears. He finds a van and runs Héctor 2 off the road, but crashes as well, knocking himself out. Upon waking, he informs the scientist he has failed and to stop Héctor 2 by any means. He encounters the woman again, startling her into screaming, though she does not recognize him as her assailant. Since Héctor 2 has heard her scream, Héctor 3 and the woman flee to Héctor's house. They become separated. Héctor 3 finds and hides his wife, then realizes what has to happen / will happen / has already happened. He finds the woman, cuts her ponytail off, gives her his wife's coat, and tells her to hide upstairs. Héctor 2 chases her onto the roof.

When Sarah reaches the edge of a cliff, with nowhere to run, she jumps off and dies as she hits the ground.  The following scene shows another couple—Sheryl (Brianna Brown) and Mike (Josh Randall)—going on a hiking trip for the week. The [[park ranger]] advises them to take Willow Creek or Donner trail, but when they're hesitating which way to go, they meet a seemingly friendly woman (Ida) who recommends them Timber Falls trail, and they decide to take that path. The two face a trio of unfriendly hunters while making love, who try to sell them their [[Moonshine|self-made alcohol]] and warn them to be careful about what they do in the woods. Disturbed by the hunters' attitude, Mike is about to pull out his gun, but Sheryl stops him from shooting them and the two leave. Sheryl convinces Mike to throw away his bullets. After meeting another park ranger (Clyde) and hiking down the trail, the couple sets up the camp. They have sex and go to sleep, unaware of a shadowy figure outside the tent that spies on them during the night.  In the morning, Sheryl goes to a lake to bathe. She then gets kidnapped by an unknown person. Mike wakes up and finds that Sheryl is missing. He tries to find her and sees two of the hunters he and Sheryl encountered the previous day. He sees one of them holding one of Sheryl's towel. Believing that they kidnapped her, he hits one of them on the head with a log, causing the other to run away. After taking the hunter's shotgun, Mike demands that the hunter tell him where Sheryl is. He tells Mike he hasn't seen her since the day before. He tries to attack Mike with a knife, but Mike knocks him out by hitting him with the stock of the shotgun.  Mike leaves the hunter there and continues his search for Sheryl. He then gets his foot caught in a bear trap. Ida appears as he slowly faints. As he wakes up, he finds himself in Ida's cabin. She tends his wound and assures Mike that she will contact the sheriff via the radio upstairs. Mike becomes suspicious because Ida calls him by his real name Michael. He claims that no one calls him Michael except for his dead grandmother and accuses Ida of stealing his wallet and I.D. She denies this, but he begins demanding that she let him use the radio. Ida and Mike engage in a fight, ending with the wounded Mike knocking out Ida.  Mike rushes upstairs to use the radio, only to find it out of order. While hobbling around, he accidentally discovers a secret basement and goes down. Mike spots a shelf full of prematurely born fetuses in glass jars. He finds Sheryl tied up and gagged in a room and frees her, but at that very moment, they confront Deacon - Ida's brother. Mike tells Sheryl to run away as Deacon attacks him. Sheryl runs away with Deacon hot on her heels and bumps into Clyde on the way. She frantically asks him for help, but as she realizes that he's in cahoots with Deacon, Clyde knocks her unconscious and recaptures her.  Sheryl wakes up to find herself strapped to a chair. The family turns out to be a group of insane [[Religious fanaticism|religious fanatics]]. After Ida describes having seen the couple having sex in their tent a few days previously, she and Clyde tell the couple that the punishment for their sins is to have a child for Ida and Clyde, due to Ida not being able to have a baby. Mike and Sheryl are forced to marry, and over the course of 3 days, Ida and Clyde force them to attempt to have a child and brutally torture them if they don't. Both Mike and Sheryl refuse to comply with their demand, for they know that if they have a baby, Ida and Clyde will kill them anyway.  During the couple's confinement, Deacon tries to rape Sheryl several times but fails due to Ida and Clyde's dissuasion. After a few days pass, Ida grows impatient and threatens Mike to torture Sheryl in front of him if he doesn’t obey them. Out of a sudden, Sheryl begins laughing hysterically. She tells Ida that she has already been two months pregnant with Mike before they went on the hiking trip and that the child was conceived in sin, leaving both Ida and Clyde in shock. Their evil plan now turns fruitless. Ida drops the scalpel she is going to mutilate Sheryl with, and Clyde consoles her.  Meanwhile, two of the hunters Mike and Sheryl met days before hear about the missing couple and presume that something strange is going on at Ida and Clyde's home (they saw Mike and Sheryl's car still in the parking lot, but when one of them talked to Clyde about it, he asserted that they already left). The two go there on the third night that Mike and Sheryl have been captured to investigate. They make a noise while breaking the glass on the front door. Ida and Clyde hear the glass tinkle and go to check it out, leaving Mike and Sheryl alone in the room. Mike tries to grab the scalpel and successfully cuts the rope holding his hands.  One hunter finds a secret door to the cabin's basement but is killed by Clyde, only after Mike manages to yell for help. The other goes down to the basement and gets shot dead by Ida. Ida and Clyde bury the dead hunters' bodies. Ida suggests [[Abortion|aborting Sheryl’s baby]] when Clyde suggests killing Mike and Sheryl and finding another couple. When Clyde gets back to the basement, Mike quickly stabs his neck and shoots Clyde in the head with his shotgun. Ida then gets to the basement and is shocked to find Clyde's corpse lying in a pool of blood. Mike attacks her, but she fights back and stabs his legs repeatedly. Sheryl knocks her unconscious with a shovel.  The couple exits the basement and prepares to leave the cabin. Mike tells Sheryl to run for help. She finds Clyde's walkie-talkie and tries to call the Rangers Post, but she faces Deacon again in the cabin and accidentally breaks the walkie-talkie during the chase. After a long struggle, she sets him on fire by throwing moonshine on him along with a lit match, burning him alive. She picks up his sickle and finds Mike in the cabin. Ida emerges out of the basement and stabs Mike with a knife, Sheryl quickly decapitates her with Deacon's sickle. She patches up Mike's wound and calls the Rangers Post with her cell phone, finally ending their sufferings.  One year has passed since Mike and Sheryl survived their ordeal. The couple put their baby to bed and leave the room. As the movie ends, the camera fades over to the window where Deacon's double blade sickle suddenly appears.

The two turtles chastise each other’s actions until their anger reaches a boiling point, resulting in a second fight. Raphael breaks Leonardo's swords, but flees in shame when his anger nearly drives him to kill Leonardo. The generals seize Leonardo, intending to substitute him for the 13th missing beast, and Raphael decides to make amends by rescuing Leonardo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his generals' treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight their way through the Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower. Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: he wants to be free of his curse of immortality. The generals reveal that they wish to preserve their immortality, but also to use the portal to bring in more monsters to conquer the world.  Having refused to betray Yaotl in exchange for serving the Generals, Karai and the Foot Clan work together with April and Casey to search for the final monster, the Sea Monster, while the Turtles fight the generals. Splinter and Yaotl fight off numerous monsters emerging from the portal. April, Casey, and Karai arrive at the tower with the [[Sea monster|Sea Monster]]. The Sea Monster crashes into the Generals, dragging them into the portal before it closes. Karai warns them to enjoy their victory while it lasts, claiming they will soon contend with faces from their past, which the Turtles suspect to be the Shredder. She and the rest of the Foot Clan depart. Yaotl, now mortal, honors the Turtles and Splinter, thanking them for fulfilling his wish before dissipating. Splinter places Yaotl's helmet among his trophy collection, as well as Raphael's "Nightwatcher" helmet and Michelangelo's "Cowabunga Carl" head.

Tom and Jerry: A Nutcracker Tale
 The movie begins with Jerry and his little nephew Tuffy watching the Christmas ballet in [[New York City]], while a group of cats, including Tom, in an alley overlooking the [[Empire State Building]], sing a song for the Cat King. Later, Jerry goes to the empty stage floor, where magic begins to happen. Toys come alive including Nelly the pony and Paulie the Christmas Ornament. The magic then makes a Music Box Ballerina come to life, and Jerry dances with her (the Miniature Overture plays through this scene).  The stage is transformed into a wintry wonderland, where the toys are enjoying a dinner. Tom, hears this, and, with the other cats, raid the feast, trapping the toys (the Nutcracker March plays through this scene). Jerry, Paulie, and Nelly try to stop this, but are stuffed into a can and shot out of a cannon, ending up worlds away (the Battle Scene play through this scene). Tom as the Captain of the Cat Guards traps the Ballerina in a cage, then brings her to the Cat King, who asks her to dance for him but is shot down.  The Cat King tells the Ballerina there is nothing she can do about it. Later on, Tom is called to gather other cats and stop Jerry, and sing a song (Mother Giongne with their own lyrics / The Old Lady plays through this scene) as they march away from the castle. Tuffy gives the Ballerina a string attached to a ring of keys. He then goes to warn Jerry and stop the cats. Meanwhile, Jerry, Paulie, and Nelly decide to follow a very bright star to a man called the Toy Maker. They stop in front of a frozen river (the Journey Through The Snow plays through this scene). All make it safely, except Jerry who falls from a frozen waterfall and through the ice, becomes tangled in a weed and seemingly drowns. He is revived and freed by the magic, and is pulled up by Nelly and Paulie. This makes Paulie unravel by melting the glue that keeps him together. Tuffy gets to Tom, and dresses up as an [[angel]], with a white dress, wings, a halo and a harp, and a [[devil]], with horns, a cape, a trident and a tail, to convince him not to harm Jerry. His cover is blown when he has his dress, wings, tail and trident at the same time, and ends up sticking the trident in Tom's eye, causing the tower of cats to fall off of a cliff (Tom screams the [[Wilhelm Scream]]). Tuffy continues on to Jerry, warning him of the cats. Tom and his friends, disguised as Christmas trees, surround Jerry, but Tom gets attacked by [[squirrels]], and shredded in a tree shredder (Toy Flutes plays through this scene). The cats attack, but the heroes escape, inside a tree. The cats beat up Tom by mistake.    The heroes then come to a hill, where Paulie's head is sent flying into another hole. They go into the hole, only to find a fiery world with lava pits and dragons (the Arabian Dance plays through this scene). A flame fairy gives Paulie his head back. A dragon wakes up, but is hypnotised by Jerry into lifting them out of the pit.   They launch a cannon, which blasts Jerry and his friends into a house with clocks (the Chinese Dance plays through this scene). Tom gives chase, but is crushed in the doors of an elevator (his midsection is now a metre long, just like the in end of [[Ah, Sweet Mouse-Story of Life]]) and pecked on by wooden birds. The mice and toys are chased by the cats again, and run into a fairground (the Russian Dance plays through this scene). Tom is virtually destroyed here, being thrown onto the merry-go-round and the swirling cups and crushed again and again on the roller-coaster - of course, this being a cartoon, he always revives - after Jerry pulls out the pin that couples two of the cars together. They make it to a ridge, and Jerry blows up [[balloons]] with which they make it off safely (the Waltz of The Flowers plays through this scene). Tom, though, is blasted by cannons. One cat shoots an arrow, bursting Nelly's balloon. Tuffy grabs on to her, and unravels more of Paulie. Nelly is let down, and chased by the cats. Jerry saves her, but his grip fails him and her string slips out of his hand. The cats pull her string, and she tells them where the others are headed. The remaining three make it to the Toy Maker (the Spanish Dance plays through this scene), and after initially looking like they have failed when Tom and the other Cat Guards cut them off at the door, only to be swiftly sent packing when the door smacks them away as the Toy Maker answers it, the Toy Maker fixes Paulie and gives them a key (the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy / Toy Flutes plays through this scene) which allows them to awaken an army of toy soldiers. The three depart with their newly attained army in order to take back their kingdom (Tarantella plays through this scene. Also, the scene hints at the Toy Maker being [[Santa Claus]] due to the calendar showing that it was December 24th).  Later, when the cats attempt to escape the army of toy soldiers, the Ballerina appears with the other toys, and she leads them in an army in rebellion against the Cat King (the Nutcracker March plays through this scene once again). One of the cats attempts to fire a cork at the toy soldiers, but instead throws himself backwards at the cannon, causing it to fire a ball into the air and back down again and destroy the cannon, and sending debris into a gunpowder store, which in turn causes it to explode, disfiguring Tom. Jerry and Tuffy are eaten by Tom, but Nelly returns, and throws a [[hammer]], smashing Tom's teeth. Tom vacuums up many of the soldiers, but the vacuum explodes and they are blown onto the cats. As the Cat King orders his followers to retreat, Jerry then activates a toy train that knocks all the cats on top of it as it crosses the stage and exits through the backstage door (which magically opens and then closes after the train passes through it), hitting the wall of the building next door to the theatre and falling into a dumpster in New York. The Ballerina hugs Jerry, telling him that she never doubted him. Suddenly, the wall next to them begins to crumble and collapses on Nelly as she shoves Jerry and the Ballerina out of the way, killing her. Seeing Nelly dead, Jerry, Tuffy and Paulie are in tears (the Journey Through The Snow plays through this scene once again). However, the magic revives her and removes her string, allowing her to talk without a string. Jerry and the Ballerina dance after receiving their crowns back. The Toy Maker and the ballerina from the Christmas play are shown to be watching from the audience; the real ballerina throws Jerry a rose and the curtain is let down, ending the show.

Tracey's journey leads into the dark underbelly of the city, into the emotional cesspool of her home, through the brutality of her high school, the clinical cat-and-mouse games with her [[Mental health professional|shrink]] and her soaring fantasies of Billy Zero ([[Slim Twig]]) - her [[rock and roll]] saviour. Her travels also put her in contact with the seedier inhabitants of the city, like Lance (Maxwell McCabe-Lokos), her would-be saviour who ultimately puts her life in jeopardy.  Tracey's stories begin to intertwine truth with lies, and hope with despair, as she moves closer to the truth of Sonny's disappearance.  
Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms
  ''Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms'' comprises two stories, "Town of Evening Calm" and "Country of Cherry Blossoms".  ===Town of Evening Calm (''Yūnagi no Machi'')===  Set in Hiroshima in 1955, ten years after the  [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb was dropped]], "Town of Evening Calm" is the story of a young woman, Minami Hirano, who [[Hibakusha|survived the bomb]] when she was in her early teens. She lives with her mother, Fujimi, in a shanty-town near downtown, having lost her father and two sisters to the bomb; her younger brother, Asahi, was evacuated to [[Mito, Ibaraki]], where he was adopted by his aunt. Fujimi is a seamstress while Minami, who is "all thumbs" as her mother puts it, works as a clerk in an office, and together they are saving money for the trip to Mito to visit Asahi.  One of her co-workers, Yutaka Uchikoshi, cares for Minami and visits her shanty when she misses work because her mother is sick. He later gives her a pair of sandals made by his mother and a handkerchief, but when he tries to kiss her, she has a [[Flashback (psychological phenomenon)|flashback]] where she sees the victims of the bombing where they now stand and pushes him away. She runs off, still reliving the horrors of the attack, including finding her little sister's blackened body and watching her older sister die of [[radiation poisoning]] two months later. The next day at the office, she apologizes to Uchikoshi, saying she wants to somehow put the past behind her. She spends the day exhausted, however, and the next day becomes bedridden from the long-term effects of radiation poisoning. As Minami's condition worsens, she is visited by Uchikoshi and other co-workers, and dies just as her brother and aunt arrive.  ===Country of Cherry Blossoms (''Sakura no Kuni'')===  "Country of Cherry Blossoms" is a story in two parts. Part one is set in 1987 in Tokyo. At the start of fifth grade, Nanami Ishikawa, the daughter of Minami's brother Asahi (and thus second-generation [[Hibakusha|atomic bomb victim]]), is a tomboy nicknamed "[[Ishikawa Goemon|Goemon]]" by her classmates, to her disgust. At baseball practice, she gets a bloody nose after being hit by a ball, after which she skips practice to visit her brother Nagio in the hospital, where he is being treated for asthma. On the way, she meets her best friend and next-door neighbor, a feminine girl named Toko Tone, who loans her subway fare and accompanies her. In Nagio's hospital room, they toss [[Sakura|cherry blossom petals]] that Nanami collected into the air, to give him the [[Hanami|experience of spring]] that he's missing. Nanami is scolded by her grandmother for visiting Nagio when she's not supposed to. That summer, her grandmother, Asahi's mother, Fujimi, dies, and that fall Nanami loses touch with Toko after her family moves closer to Nagio's hospital.  Part two takes place 17 years later, in 2004. Nanami, now working as an [[office lady]], lives with her recently retired father. One day Nagio, who recently graduated from [[medical school]], tells Nanami he ran into Toko as a nurse at the hospital where he is [[Internship (medicine)|interning]]. Nanami tells him she's worried their father's going [[senile]] because he has started wandering off for a couple days at time without explanation.   One evening, Nanami follows Asahi as he leaves the apartment, and while she tails him runs into Toko and together they follow him onto an overnight bus to Hiroshima. In the morning, they follow as he visits several people before Toko leaves to visit the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park|Peace Park]]. Asahi visits his [[Japanese funeral#Grave|family grave]], then sits by the riverside, and while waiting Nanami discovers in the jacket of Toko's borrowed jacket a letter from Nagio to Toko, saying that her family asked him to stop seeing her as they believe his asthma is a result of the atomic bomb.   In a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], Asahi recalls the riverbank as a shantytown, then remembers meeting Kyoka Ota, a neighborhood girl his mother hired to help her after Minami died, when he returns to Hiroshima to start college. Asahi begins tutoring Kyoka because her teachers believe she is stupid due to the atomic bomb. When Toko finds Nanami by the river, Toko is upset to the point of illness by what she saw at the [[Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum|Peace Memorial Museum]], and Nanami finds them a hotel room and cares for her, even though she has flashbacks to seeing her mother's last illness when she was a young child. In another flashback, Asahi proposes to a grown Kyoka, against his mother's wishes, as Kyoka was exposed to the bomb.   On the ride back to Tokyo, Nanami arranges for Nagio to meet her and Toko, then leaves them alone together. Asahi tells Nanami he visited Hiroshima for the 49th anniversary of Minami's death, and that Nanami resembles her.  
Towncraft (film)
 In the late 1980s a few kids in the small, sleepy Southern town of Little Rock, discovered [[punk rock]] and the DIY ethic that drove it.

Over the next decade, they would book their own shows, start [[record label]]s, open record stores, play with national acts and formulate a collective set of ideals. In 1992, they released ''[[Towncraft (album)|Towncraft]]'', a compilation album and zine that documented their scene.  ''Towncraft'' focuses on the roots of the Little Rock scene, how it changed the lives of those involved, the DIY ethos that has shaped the scene for the past 20 years and how the scene continues to thrive outside of the mainstream.

She first lives with her mother in [[Syracuse, New York]], but when her mother's live-in boyfriend helps Jasira shave her [[pubic hair]], her mother sends Jasira to live with her old-fashioned and domineering Lebanese father Rifat ([[Peter Macdissi]]) in suburban [[Houston, Texas]]. Jasira is treated as a second class citizen by her overprotective father. He is strict, does not allow her to use [[tampon]]s, and prefers spending time with his new girlfriend, Thena.  Even her mother refuses to support her when she calls and begs for help, forcing Jasira to comply with his rules. Her father acts very disrespectfully towards her and berates her for the slightest thing.   Jasira experiences a [[Child sexuality|sexual awakening]] at her neighbor's home, which is sparked in part by adult magazines she finds when baby-sitting the next-door neighbor boy Zack Vuoso ([[Chase Ellison]]), son of Travis Vuoso ([[Aaron Eckhart]]). While Jasira is home alone one night, Mr. Vuoso comes over to retrieve one of his magazines and he ends up sexually assaulting her. Jasira befriends a classmate, Thomas Bradley (Eugene Jones), eventually becoming sexually active with him. When Rifat finds out about her relationship with Thomas, he forbids her from ever seeing him, only because he is black.  Mr. Vuoso becomes jealous of Jasira's relationship with Thomas, and, pretending he has to go to [[Iraq War|Iraq]] the next morning, tricks Jasira into sleeping with him. When Rifat finds one of Mr. Vuoso's adult magazines at his house, he beats Jasira, and she seeks refuge at the home of Melina ([[Toni Collette]]) (who is pregnant) and her husband, Gil, neighbors who were aware of and concerned about Mr. Vuoso's inappropriate behavior towards Jasira from the beginning. While staying at their house, Gil notices bruises on Jasira's legs and Rifat angrily knocks on the door wanting to retrieve his daughter. When both Melina and Gil refuse to let Rifat in, he threatens to call the police and claim that they kidnapped his daughter, but Gil responds to Rifat that he will tell them about the bruises he left on Jasira. She goes to school the next day and Melina picks her up, along with Thomas. When they make it back home, they decide to have sex, but are almost caught by Melina.  Later, Rifat visits the couple along with Thena. He notices Thomas is in the house and angrily confronts him. He also reveals why he despises him. He then decides to check the house and discovers a condom in the trash. He assumes Thomas is responsible for taking his daughter's virginity and attempts to assault him. This forces Jasira to confess that she had sex with Mr. Vuoso, who is then arrested and bailed out the next day.  Thomas talks with Jasira about her abuse from Mr. Vuoso, and explains that he doesn't want to have sex with her anymore. She says she does not want to stop. One day after school, Jasira retrieves the corpse of Travis' cat, which ran off after she came by his house and was accidentally run over by Rifat on his way home. When Melina sees Jasira talking to Mr. Vuoso, she runs outside to stop the conversation, but trips and falls down on the ground, which causes her to bleed and go into labor. While at the hospital, Rifat is asked by Jasira to accompany Melina in the delivery room, since her husband won't make it in time. When Rifat refuses to stay, he finally decides to trust Jasira and let her stay and live with Melina, which makes her very happy. He leaves the delivery room and Jasira witnesses Melina giving birth to a baby girl.

Transformers (film)
  Several thousand years ago, the planet [[Cybertron]] was consumed by a [[civil war]] between the two [[Transformers|Transformer]] factions, the [[Autobot]]s led by [[Optimus Prime]] and the [[Decepticon]]s led by [[Megatron]]. Optimus jettisoned the [[Spark (Transformers)|AllSpark]], a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed onto [[Earth]], landing in the [[Arctic Circle]] and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky. Witwicky inadvertently activated Megatron’s navigational system, which etched the AllSpark’s coordinates into his glasses. The glasses end up in the possession of his great-great-grandson [[Sam Witwicky]]. In the present, Sam buys his first car, a rusting [[Chevrolet Camaro]], but discovers it has a life of its own.  In the present, [[Blackout (Transformers)|Blackout]] attacks and destroys a United States military base in a failed attempt to hack the military network to find information on Megatron and the AllSpark. A team of [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|Army Rangers]] led by Captain William Lennox escape across the desert, pursued by Blackout’s drone [[Scorponok]]. They fight Scorponok off, aided by aerial reinforcements, and travel home with Scorponok’s stinger, discovering [[sabot]] rounds damaged its armor. At [[the Pentagon]], [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] John Keller leads the investigation into the attack. Sound analyst Maggie Madsen catches another Decepticon, [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]], hacking into the U.S. military network while onboard [[Air Force One]]. While the hack is thwarted, Frenzy downloads files on Archibald’s glasses, tracking down Sam with [[Barricade (Transformers)|Barricade]], disguised as a police car.  Sam and his high school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued from Barricade and Frenzy by the Camaro who turns out to be Autobot scout [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], but he is mute and has to communicate through his car radio. Previously sending a beacon to his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee takes Sam and Mikaela to meet the new arrivals – Optimus, [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], [[Ironhide]], and [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]]. Optimus explains the details of their situation, revealing that if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earth’s machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots travel to Sam’s house to retrieve the glasses, but the teenagers are captured by agents of Sector Seven, a top secret government branch, led by Seymour Simmons. The Autobots stop the agents, but they call for backup, who take Sam, Mikaela, and Bumblebee into custody, while Optimus obtains the glasses, and uses them to locate the Allspark.  The respective groups connected to the Transformers are gathered together at [[Hoover Dam]] by Sector Seven’s director Tom Banachek, who reveals Megatron, still frozen, and the AllSpark. Frenzy, who smuggled away in Mikaela’s bag, summons the other Decepticons to attack and sabotages Megatron's cryonic system. Bumblebee is released to protect the AllSpark, shrinking it down to a handheld size so it can be transported to safety. Megatron escapes the dam after thawing out.  Frenzy attacks Secretary Keller, Madsen and Agent Simmons in the Dam's radio room, trying to prevent them from summoning the Air Force, but is decapitated by his own ricocheting [[shuriken]].

[[Starscream]] and Barricade are the only Decepticons to survive the battle and escape.  Optimus salvages a shard of the AllSpark from Megatron’s body. The United States government shuts down Sector Seven, disposing of the dead Decepticons in the [[Laurentian Abyss]].

Trade (film)
  In a poor family in [[Mexico City]], Adriana ([[Paulina Gaitán]]) celebrates her 13th birthday, and is happy about the bicycle her 17-year-old brother Jorge (Cesar Ramos) gives her. Their mother suspects Jorge has got the money for the present in a dishonest way, and forbids Adriana to ride it. Indeed, Jorge lures a tourist into a quiet street pretending to bring him to a prostitute, and with two friends rob the man by threatening him with guns. After the tourist complies, the three carry out a [[mock execution]], revealing that the guns are only [[water gun]]s.  About same time, Veronica ([[Alicja Bachleda]]), a young woman from [[Poland]], arrives at the airport together with a girlfriend, where they are met by a group who had promised to get them to [[Los Angeles]], but instead they're, in fact, being kidnapped, and when they realize this, in a struggle to get away, the friend is hit and killed by a car.  Against her mother's order, Adriana sneaks out to ride her new bike. When she notices a car following her, she tries to get away, but is captured and taken to the place where Veronica, several [[Latin America]]n women, and a young [[Thai people|Thai]] boy are also kept. The gang leader pushes Veronica to bed as his henchman begins to videotape. Veronica tries to fight back but is overpowered. As Veronica is being raped, she flashes back and realizes how the traders had conspired and arranged the entire trip, to sell her into sexual slavery.  Jorge sees a boy riding the bicycle he has given to Adriana, suspects that he has stolen it, and stops him. The boy says he has found the bike on the street, and shows the place he found it. Her things still on the street indicate that she was kidnapped. Jorge asks his friends to help him find her, but when an adult adviser tells the boys the kidnappers belong to a powerful globally operating [[Russia]]n gangster network, they refuse. Jorge finds out that the kidnappers "sell" their victims as sex slaves through a connection in [[New Jersey]].  While Jorge asks people if they have seen his sister, he sees her among the other victims as they are hurried into a truck by the kidnappers. He steals his friends' car and uses it to follow the kidnappers. As he approaches the border, he sees the truck. Two policemen approach the truck and allow them to cross, in exchange for cash and sex. One of the police is allowed to choose a victim to rape, and Veronica is chosen. The gangster evacuates everyone from the truck except for the policeman and Veronica as she is raped again. Jorge manages to follow the van to [[Ciudad Juárez|Juárez]], but then loses track of it.  Adriana, Veronica and the Thai boy are smuggled into the US, but the group is caught by the US Border Patrol. The gang members keep the kidnapped people from telling the police that they were kidnapped by threatening to harm their families. The kidnappers and victims are sent back to Mexico, after which they sneak into the US again.  When Jorge finally finds the house where the victims were kept, they are already gone. A car with Texas license plates arrives. While the driver Ray ([[Kevin Kline]]) looks through the house, Jorge manages to hide in the trunk of the car. He thereby illegally crosses the border into the USA. Jorge reveals himself and tells about the kidnapping, and Ray, a federal insurance fraud investigator, brings Jorge to a police station to report the kidnapping. However, Jorge, who came along reluctantly, flees, suspicious about police. Ray finds Jorge and decides to help him to rescue his sister, and slowly they become friends. It is learned that Ray was in Juárez to search for his extra-marital daughter, who was also probably sold.  Jorge and Ray travel to [[New Jersey]], where the victims are being taken and where an [[internet auction]] will be held to sell them to the highest bidder. The Thai boy is drugged by an injection in his neck and delivered to an elderly man who buys him. At a rest-stop diner with Ray, Jorge recognizes the little boy, and Ray frees him and forces the man to tell the password of the internet site of the auction.  Adriana is forced to have oral sex with a customer in a field; the gang members tell the customer that he cannot have intercourse with her, because at the auction she has to be sold as a virgin. At a stop, Adriana and Veronica manage to escape. Veronica sees a policeman and tells Adriana to tell him what is happening, while Veronica herself phones her parents in Poland to tell them, but learns that her little son has already been taken by the criminal organization. Adriana fails to tell the policeman, and during the phone call Adriana and Veronica are recaptured by the kidnappers. At another stop, Veronica commits suicide by jumping from a cliff, telling the kidnapper that he will pay for his sins. The kidnapper arrives with Adriana at a house where his female boss keeps more victims. She scolds him for losing Veronica.  Ray and Jorge ask the New Jersey police to free Adriana, but they refuse; it would disrupt their strategy against the larger criminal organization the gang is part of. Ray gets consent by phone from his wife to withdraw a large sum of money from their bank account for a purpose not told to her, and, assisted by Jorge, participates in the auction and buys the girl for $32,000, to free her. Ray visits the house where she is kept, bringing the money. However, he asks the female boss ([[Kate del Castillo]]) where she is from, making her suspicious. Due to the intense green eye colour and approximate age of the female boss, it is implied that she is Ray's long-lost daughter. He has to prove that he is not a cop by having sex with Adriana in a room in the house. He does not do that; instead Adriana on purpose goes in the washroom and comes back with blood on her hand and smears the bedsheet. The kidnapper comes in to check on them, and understands that in spite of the blood on the sheet they have not had sex. Adriana reminds him of what Veronica said before she died, and in his guilty conscience he cooperates and tells his female boss that the defilement did take place. As they leave, Jorge arrives and hits the man on the head with a tire iron, and the police, checking on the house after all, arrest the two kidnappers and free several children they find in the basement. The money Ray brought is returned to him. He gives it to Jorge, and recommends that he stays out of trouble back in Mexico. Jorge puts the money secretly back into Ray's car when they say goodbye. Jorge and Adriana are flown to Mexico. Adriana is worried that because she disappeared for so long, with no explanation, her mother will be mad, but the mother is just very happy that she is back. Jorge finds the leader of the kidnappers ([[Pasha D. Lychnikoff]]) and kills him, but then he is shocked to discover that the man had a young son.

Transmorphers
 In 2009, a race of aliens piloting giant robots have conquered Earth and forced humanity to live underground. They have done this by altering the environment, causing constant rainfall and darkness. Over 300 years later, after many generations of living underground, a small group of human rebels plan to finally take back their world from the mechanical invaders. They soon learn however that the aliens do not pilot the robots, but ''are'' the robots.  A patrol, led by Lt. Blackthorn ([[Thomas Downey]]), is sent out to capture one of the robots, a ''Z-bot'', so its operating ability can be studied. The patrol is suddenly ambushed by several robots, with some being able to reconfigure themselves, revealing different weapon systems. These units, the 'transmorphers', ambush humans by appearing as mundane features of the terrain, even fooling detection systems. The robots use "brain scans" to read the minds of humans to know their battle plans.  After Blackthorn's patrol is destroyed by the machines, a female lead officer of the human resistance group, General Van Ryberg ([[Eliza Swenson]]), argues with fellow officers of the Military and Science Guilds about how to fight the war. Despite some protests, Van Ryberg decides to reinstate a disgraced soldier named Warren Mitchell (Matthew Wolf), who was court-martialed along with his right-hand man, Itchy ([[Griff Furst]]), and cryogenically frozen for insubordination. They had killed their unit officer five years earlier. Mitchell is glad to be reinstated, but learns that his former lover, Karina Nadir ([[Amy Weber]]), a fighter pilot, is now married to General Van Ryberg.  Mitchell assembles a small military patrol with Itchy as his second-in-command, and Flight Commander Xandria Lux ([[Shaley Scott]]), as his military adviser. The patrol is sent out to capture a Z-bot, intact, so its fuel cells can be studied. They hope to shut the machines down by contaminating the fuel cell and placing it in a large radio tower which supposedly controls the machines.  Mitchell and his group ambush and destroy a group of patrol machines, and succeed in capturing one. During the battle, Karina and another female soldier named Blair (Sarah Hall) become stuck behind enemy lines right near the radio tower. They are forced to hide in the ruins around the tower while waiting for help to arrive.  Bringing the Z-bot back to their underground city, Mitchell realizes that the fuel cell has an implanted tracking device that leads the machines to the humans' underground city. Van Ryberg takes over as the field commander of the human army and leads them out in a last-ditch effort to defeat the robots, and to rescue her wife.  Mitchell then surprisingly learns from resident scientist Dr. Voloslov Alextzavich (Michael Tower), that he himself is an android constructed by Dr. Alextzavich, with human feelings and understandings. Mitchell realizes that he must get the Z-bot's fuel cell to the radio tower and implant it in the control computer in order to shut the robots down.  Supported by an aerial strike force led by Lux, Mitchell's team fly out and make it to the radio tower where they are able to rescue Karina and Blair. The group breaks into the building, but the anti-human counter-measures make all of them sick and they cannot make it to the main control room. The situation becomes more complicated when the tower reveals itself to be a giant robot.  Meanwhile, General Van Ryberg and her soldiers reach one of the terraforming stations and attempt to take it offline. They attempt to hold off a massive army of robots attacking the underground city. Lux then arrives with her fighter squadron to bomb the attacking robots.  Back at the radio station, Mitchell, using his android abilities, sacrifices himself and takes the tower out, buying enough time for the rest of his team to escape. Once the tower is destroyed, the robots all over the world shut down. With the battle won, Karina and Van Ryberg are reunited and the surviving humans see the sun shine through the clouds for the first time in centuries.  
Treasure Raiders
 A Russian [[street racing]] star named Wolf (Nevsky)---who also happens to be the leader of an anti-illegal drug [[vigilante group]]---meets his match in a sly American archeology professor named Michael Nazzaro (Brand) who has developed a liking for drag racing on [[Moscow]]'s streets in order to follow Wolf. The professor, a [[West Point]]er and the descendant of a [[Templar Knights|Templar knight]], is in possession of a 16th-century book passed on to him through generations in his family, and is now interested in the Templar medallion in Wolf's possession. The medallion is the professor's key to decoding a name in another Templar book he had come to Moscow to find, a copy of the [[Gospel]] of [[Jacques de Molay]]. Having made some wealth from an archeological find in Colombia prior to coming to Moscow, the professor offers to bet $50,000 for the medallion in a drag race with Wolf. It turns out Wolf is a likely Russian descendant of a Templar knight himself. Although the professor fails to win the medallion, Wolf joins him in his quest to find the book after a [[Colombian drug cartel]] and [[Russian mafia]] alliance goes after him. Meanwhile, a well-known historian (Carradine), a descendant of a Persecutor of the Knights, has also been following the professor in order to destroy his find. To make matters worse, the Moscow police suspect that the professor and Wolf are part of the developing Colombian drug trade in the city and order units to arrest the duo. With time, police, and the mafia against them, will they find the treasure before it is too late? <ref>[http://www.maverickentertainment.cc/movies/732/treasure-raiders Treasure Raiders on MEG]</ref>  
Trainwreck: My Life as an Idiot
 ''American Loser'' is a comedy-drama based upon the experiences of comedian Jeff Nichols; it follows Jeff as he encounters a remarkable variety of personal and emotional problems.  Edging closer to his thirties Jeff ([[Seann William Scott]]) has a heavy [[Alcoholism|drinking problem]] coupled with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[dyslexia]], and a mild case of [[Tourette syndrome]] as well as constant [[absent-mindedness]]. He spends most of his time attending [[Group psychotherapy|support meeting]]s including ones which have no connection to the problems he suffers.  Jeff's attempts to hold down a job end in disaster.  Jeff connects with Lynn ([[Gretchen Mol]]), a woman he met at a support group for people with relationship problems, but loses her when an expensive necklace he gives her as a gift is repossessed.  Jeff rents a garage from his step brother Bert, whom he knows as "Uncle Popcorn", only to fall behind on the rent.  His car is repeatedly ticketed.  Jeff's parents Cynthia ([[Deirdre O'Connell (actress)|Deirdre O'Connell]]) and Mike ([[Denis O'Hare]]) try to support him, but even the simple instructions they give him drive Jeff to distraction. Bert reproves Jeff, telling him that his behavior is childish.  After being evicted from Bert's garage, and with nowhere else to go, Jeff sneaks back into his parents' expensive home.  With no else at home, and not wanting to cause a spike in the heating bill, Jeff uses a space heater, and accidentally burns down the house.  The next morning, Jeff's parents stare at the charred wreckage of their home, baffled at the cause of the fire.  Jeff's parents guess that the cause was faulty wiring.  Jeff admits he burned the house down.  Jeff's mother, shocked, enters the scorched remains and recovers the remains of a striped bass that Jeff caught years ago.  The scene cuts to Jeff at a support group, where his tale of wrecked lives and repeated failures drives the others in the group to laughter.  The support group is replaced with an audience taking in Jeff's account as a stand-up act, and loving it.  Jeff tells his family that stand-up doesn't pay well, but that he has a new job.  In the final scene, a more mature Jeff is shown by a pier, getting ready to take a boat (presumably his own) out to fish.  There he is visited by Lynn, now pregnant.  Lynn, realizing that Jeff is improving, reconnects with him,  and they go fishing.  
Trapped in the Closet Chapters 13–22
 ;Chapter 13 The chapter initially starts with Sylvester and Twan in Sylvester's car though it is not clear at first where they are going. When Sylvester tells Twan to be on his best behavior and reminds Twan about how he got sent to jail, Twan says it "was because of Roxanne and that bitch Tina", which Sylvester remembers his wife mentioning their names on chapter five. The scene soon cuts to Rosie the nosy neighbor and her husband Randolph (played by R. Kelly), who argue over Rosie spying on other neighbors. The argument ends when the scene cuts back to Sylvester explaining to Twan that he has to collect money from someone, he tells Twan to leave the car in drive and be on the lookout and enters a restaurant. An hour goes by with no sign of Sylvester.  ;Chapter 14 In chapter fourteen, it is revealed that apparently Sylvester and Cathy, who shows up in a blond wig and black dress, had made a deal for Sylvester to get caught by her pastor husband Rufus but the deal had apparently backfired, not only by Cathy's realization that Sylvester and her best friend Gwendolyn were married but also due to Cathy not wanting to end her marriage to Rufus, with Cathy later admitting she had changed her mind on the deal. When Sylvester threatens to leave, Cathy tries to explain the reasons why. A waitress comes by and offers them drinks. Sylvester looks at the waitress thinking to himself that she looked familiar. Meanwhile outside at Sylvester's car, Twan gets a call from a friend (only shown by a close up of his mouth) about Tina, telling him Tina had stopped [[prostitution|prostituting]] and was working at a "legit" place. He later tells Twan that Tina was working at the same restaurant where Sylvester is at with Cathy. Back at the restaurant, Sylvester notices the waitress but can't think from where, until he sees her name tag which says "Tina". Sylvester then says he wants to talk to her but she gets scared and calls for her friend/co-worker Roxanne, who runs out with a frying pan. After Tina breaks a beer bottle and makes karate-styled moves saying to Sylvester that she and Roxanne take [[Tae Bo]], Cathy and the rest of the patrons leave quickly, leaving Sylvester alone with Tina and Roxanne. Just as Tina and Roxanne are about to attack, Twan comes busting through the door threatening them.  ;Chapter 15 With Twan, Sylvester, Tina and Roxanne in the now-empty restaurant, Twan seeks revenge on Tina and Roxanne on his arrest three years ago. Sylvester tries calming Twan down reminding him he's on [[house arrest]] and that a violent outburst would lead to a more serious time in prison. After convincing Twan to let him talk to them, Sylvester approaches the two ladies and ask them what had happened on the day of his arrest. Tina and Roxanne explain that they were on a "simple operation" describing a "[[drug trafficking|trip]]" to [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Roxanne tells Sylvester that a [[substance intoxication|high]] Twan was swerving on the road and cutting up on the both of them, even turning his music loud playing "[[Mary Jane (Rick James song)|Mary Jane]]" and screaming "I'm Rick James, bitch!" Tina explains that as soon as that happened, they heard not only police squad cars but also a helicopter. Twan's car breaks down and all three are eventually arrested. In the interrogation room, the police tell the women that Twan blamed the drug deal on them in order to save his own skin. It is then when Roxanne tells Twan she turned him in. Roxanne says Tina protected him because Tina was pregnant with Twan's baby at the time.  ;Chapter 16 Sylvester, stunned at first at the news of Tina having Twan's child, congratulates Twan on the news but Twan is not convinced, accusing Tina of lying on him, which causes Tina's eye to twitch, which had started when Sylvester had first approached her near the end of chapter 14. When Sylvester asks Roxanne about it, Roxanne explains a [[pimp]] had hit Tina in the eye a year ago and that she's had bad nerves ever since. Twan then pulls Sylvester to the side and begins wondering if he is really the father of Tina's child, Sylvester convinces him that a child would calm him down. When Twan tells Tina that he wants to make this work, Roxanne kisses Tina and reveals they are lovers.  ;Chapter 17 Stunned at the news of Roxanne and Tina being lovers, a frustrated Sylvester points his gun at the both of them, but soon stops because of his tolerance to [[lesbian]]ism, while Twan kept egging him to shoot them. Sylvester tries to get Twan to leave the restaurant. It's only after Twan threatens Tina and Roxanne that he will buy a gun and come back for them later that Sylvester finally convinces Twan to leave.  ;Chapter 18 Back at the car as they drive away, Twan is still angry over seeing Roxanne and Tina together, despite Sylvester's efforts to calm him down. Around this time, Sylvester gets a phone call from Gwendolyn, who tells him that his parents, O'Dale and Myrna, got into it and Myrna had O'Dale put in jail. The scene then shifts to Rufus' church where he is leading the worship song, "Jesus Will Work It Out", with Reverend Mosley James Evans and the Peace Within Choir. When the song reaches a climax, Rufus gets a phone call and excuses himself to his office. It's Chuck, who's crying and upset over not seeing Rufus since the incident in the earlier chapters. Rufus and Chuck argue when Cathy walks in Rufus' office. When Cathy asks Rufus who was on the phone, Chuck, who can be heard accidentally on speaker phone, cries out for Rufus, which angers Cathy and the two argue before Rufus sends Cathy out to deal with the situation. Rufus then tries to let Chuck come see him so they can talk but Chuck refuses. Rufus then tells Chuck that because he loves his wife and is a pastor, he doesn't want to see Chuck anymore, which angers Chuck, who threatens to reveal their relationship. When Rufus again tries to get Chuck to come see him, Chuck reveals he is recovering at a hospital.  ;Chapter 19 Reverend Mosley James Evans and the Peace Within Choir attempt to persuade Pimp Lucius, a [[pimp]] with a severe stuttering problem, to stop pimping and to turn his life around. As the choir sings "you can do it Pimp Lucius," Lucius pretends to accept the offer and leaves the church.  However, he then tells his pimpin' partner, Bishop Craig, that he is never going to "s-s-s-s-s-stop p-p-p-pimpin," because "p-p-p-pimpin's for life." Then he tells Bishop Craig "now let's get this mmm-mmmmm money."  ;Chapter 20 This chapter shows Rosie the Nosy Neighbor's house where Rosie is seen in her chair reading the [[Bible]] when her husband Randolph comes in shouting, "he's got [[Aids|the package]]!" to Rosie. Unwilling to listen at first, when Randolph tells her he has news on the pastor (Rufus), she demands what was going on with him. After a few bickers, Randolph tells Rosie the story: while working as a janitor for the church, Randolph hears Rufus coming into the office. Randolph hid in the closet and unintentionally overheard the conversation seen in chapter eighteen among Chuck, Rufus and Cathy. After relaying the story, Rosie asks Randolph why he had said the pastor had "the package", Randolph says that Chuck told him he was at the hospital. Rosie immediately decides to inform the masses, despite Randolph's protests. The chapter ends with Randolph sitting on the couch, falling asleep.  ;Chapter 21 Sylvester and Twan go to visit an apparent [[mobster]] named Joey. Sylvester informs Joey of some job that could get them a lot of money. While there, Joey accuses Twan of being a cop, as well as calling him "[[LL Cool J|LL Fool J]]," deeply offending Twan. Sylvester, trying to defuse the situation, asks Twan to wait outside the office while he and Joey discuss business. As Twan leaves the room, he remarks, "I'll be listening from the outside." Joey replies, "Yeah, yeah, whatever. [[Mama Said Knock You Out (song)|Mama said knock you out]], fuck outta here." While waiting outside, Twan has a nightmare of Sylvester and him in the same situation, being pointed at with guns. In the end, Sylvester wakes Twan up, then Joey and Sylvester say their goodbyes, and Joey asks Sylvester to tell Gwendolyn he says hello, as their deal is sealed.  ;Chapter 22 The scene opens to the voicemail of Dale and Myrna, Sylvester's parents, and eventually fades into the middle of the voicemail box, where the narrator (Kelly) says, "and now the rumor." Throughout a series of phone conversations among all of the original characters from Chapters 1-12 and those introduced in Chapter 13-22, rumors of "The Package" circulate. Because Chuck has it, it has possibly been passed to Rufus, to his wife Cathy, to Sylvester, and to Gwendolyn. In addition, Bridget realizes that James knows both Chuck and Rufus, though he tried to hide it from her earlier, suggesting he may be on the "[[Down-low (MSM)|down-low]]" with Chuck as well. Gwendolyn also cheated on Sylvester with James however she used a condom as revealed in Chapter 4. This would put Bridget, Big Man, and James at serious risk. Lastly, Pimp Lucius gets a similar concerned call from an unidentified woman (who may have gotten "The Package" from Big Man, and subsequently passed it to Pimp Lucius).

Trick 'r Treat
   The film takes place over the course of [[Halloween]] in the fictional town of Warren Valley, [[Ohio]]. Its story is told in a [[nonlinear narrative]], with characters crossing paths with each other throughout the film. At the centre of the story is [[Samhain|Sam]], a peculiar trick-or-treater dressed in pyjamas and a burlap sack, and appears to enforce the “[[Trick-or-treating|rules]]” of Halloween.  In the opening scene, Emma and husband Henry return home after a disastrous night. Emma tears down the seasonal decorations before the night’s end, and is murdered by an unseen assailant. Henry later discovers her mutilated corpse on display.  Charlie, an obese, [[Diabetes|diabetic]] [[Vandalism|vandal]] who smashes [[jack-o'-lantern]]s, encounters his school principal, Steven Wilkins. Wilkins lectures Charlie on how the rules and traditions of Halloween must be obeyed. Charlie suddenly vomits up poisoned [[candy]], Wilkins’ chocolate spiked with [[cyanide]]. Wilkins tries burying Charlie and another child in his backyard, but is repeatedly interrupted by his son Billy, and neighbour, Mr. Kreeg, an elderly, scarred recluse. Wilkins later takes Charlie’s head indoors so he and Billy can carve a jack o’lantern out of it.  Elsewhere, a group of trick-or-treaters – Macy, Sara, Chip, and Schrader – meet Rhonda, an enthusiastic Halloween fanatic, said to be a [[Savant syndrome|savant]]. The group travel to a local [[quarry]] where Macy recalls the [[urban legend]] of the “Halloween School Bus Massacre”. The legend is depicted in flashback, Macy explaining that eight mentally challenged children died in a [[school bus]] on Halloween. The driver had been paid by their parents to dispose of them, and was the only survivor of the crash.  The trick-or-treaters offer eight jack o’lanterns as tribute to the dead children. They pull a prank on Rhonda, posing as [[zombie]]s, but only terrify her. An annoyed Macy kicks one of the lanterns in the quarry’s lake, causing the dead children to rise themselves as zombies. The group flee, but Rhonda reaches the elevator first and leaves them to die. She briefly encounters Sam whilst leaving.  Laurie, a self-conscious young woman, arrives in town with her sister Danielle, and friends Maria and Janet. They pick up dates, save Laurie, who wants her “first time” to be special. Laurie eventually encounters a hooded [[sexual predator]], dressed as a [[vampire]], who attacks her. At a bonfire, Laurie’s friends witness the man falling out of a tree and unmask him, revealed to be Wilkins. Laurie appears, and the girls transform into [[werewolf|werewolves]], devouring Wilkins and their dates. Sam witnesses the feast.  During the same time Wilkins is harvesting Charlie, Kreeg scares away children to steal their candy, aided by his dog Spite. Sam breaks into his house, decorating it with Halloween memorabilia. Sam, unmasked as a demonic, pumpkin-headed child, attacks Kreeg. However, when Sam tries to kill Kreeg, he instead eats a chocolate bar that landed on Kreeg’s lap. Satisfied that Kreeg offered him candy, Sam leaves. Photographs in the fireplace reveal Kreeg to be the bus driver.  Later, Kreeg begins giving out candy to children. He observes Sam watching Emma and Henry, going to exact revenge when Emma blows out a jack o’lantern. Kreeg returns inside, only to receive a knock on the door. He opens it, revealing the undead children waiting for him. The final, comic book-like shots of the film show Kreeg being dismembered.

Tribu (film)

He describes the poverty and crime in the city and explains how children have an opportunity to make a name for themselves in such an environment. After witnessing his mother having sex with a man during the [[Tondo, Manila#Lakbayaw Festival|Lakbayaw festival]], he leaves the house and follows three adolescents: Memey and brothers Pongke and Dennis. Dennis expresses his desire to join the Thugz Angels, a gang centered around [[freestyle rap]]ping, but is warned by his brother, who is concerned for his safety. While out tagging [[graffiti]] later that night, the gang comes across Totoy Turat, a member of the Sacred Brown Tribe who had been murdered on the street. [[Plainclothes law enforcement|Plainclothes police officers]] promptly arrive and arrest Memey while the rest of the gang flees, believing him to be responsible for the murder.  Makoy, a prominent member of the Sacred Brown Tribe, is awoken the next morning by his father, who laments the recent killing and expresses concern over his son being in a gang. Makoy is later accompanied by his friend Ghe-Ghe, and together they meet up with Mogs, also of the same gang, who brings along Ebet as a witness to confirm Memey's innocence. The three agree to meet up at Mogs' place later that night, while Ebet is instructed to spy on the Diablos, the rival gang suspected of killing Turat. Dennis, who is in a relationship with Katherine, Makoy's sister, arrives; Makoy asks him for a meeting with Pongke, seeking an alliance with Thugz Angels in order to exact revenge on the Diablos.  Ebet arrives at the Diablos' hangout after sundown, taking note of those who are present, before returning to Makoy with the news. Makoy returns home, smuggles a bag of weapons out of the house, and brings it to the Sacred Brown Tribe, hoping to gather more members for the attack. Thugz Angels arrive, led by Pongke, who offers the S.B.T. some weapons but explains that they cannot fight alongside the gang, fearing Memey's incarceration if they do. The two gangs gather by Turat's coffin and freestyle together. Katherine arrives to console Turat's mother, who is still mourning her son's death; Makoy instructs Dennis to care for his sister, and together they leave.  The S.B.T. meet up at Mogs' house, where they agree to fight the Diablos to the death. They arm themselves and directly attack the Diablos at their hangout. The fight goes awry for the S.B.T., and Mogs, Ghe-Ghe, and Makoy are killed while the surviving gang members retreat. Ebet, who remained an unseen observant of the fight, picks up Makoy's gun and runs off. Meanwhile, Dennis, who had been flirting with Katherine, bids her farewell as she boards a [[jeepney]] on the way to work. The remaining Diablos, finding Dennis alone, stab him on the street and flee. Pongke is enraged upon receiving news of his brother's death and hunts down the Diablos, killing them in the process.  Ebet returns home to hide from the police, where he spots his mother having sex in her bedroom with another man. He brandishes Makoy's gun and enters his mother's bedroom.  
Trivial (film)
 Lt. Jacques Renard ([[Christopher Lambert]]) is struggling with depression following the untimely death of his beloved wife, Chloé. After six months in a mental hospital following a suicide attempt, the disheveled and lonely [[Le Havre]] police lieutenant is still haunted by visions of his wife. One day, Renard finds a mysterious woman ([[Sophie Marceau]]) waiting for him in his car. She implores him to visit the manager of the Hotel Normandy, Antoine Bérangère ([[Robert Hossein]]), in nearby [[Deauville]] in Room 401. She insists that only Renard can help her, and then leaves.  Renard drives to Deauville to the luxury hotel where he meets Bérangère's thirty-nine-year-old son, Camille (Nicolas Briancon), and learns that Bérangère, who worked as manager of the Hotel Normandy for nearly four decades, vanished forty-eight hours earlier under suspicious circumstances. Without identification or money, he took his Mercedes, which he hadn't driven in years, and simply vanished, leaving everything behind except his hunting rifle. When Renard asks about Room 401, Camille insists there is no such room at the hotel.  While searching Bérangère's room, Renard discovers a key to Room 401. After a quick search, he finds the room which is decorated with old framed photographs, portraits, and mementos of Bérangère's deceased first wife—a film actress who looks like the mysterious woman he met in his car. Old newspaper clippings reveal that the actress, Victoria Benutti (Sophie Marceau), died in a car accident in 1970, exactly 36 years ago to the day of Bérangère's disappearance. Camille is annoyed by Renard's presence and inquiry, and Renard's partner Pierre ([[Simon Abkarian]]) is convinced that this is a simple suicide case. Renard, however, believes that something far more sinister is happening, and the suspicious actions of Antoine's wheelchair-bound second wife, Mélanie ([[Marie-Christine Barrault]]), convinces Renard that foul play has occurred.  At the hotel, Renard meets a Duchess ([[Judith Magre]]) who tells him how the "ghost of Victoria" still haunts the hotel after all these years. Soon after, he sees the mysterious woman and chases her through the hotel and onto the roof, but she eludes him. Shortly after the police discover Bérangère's car abandoned on the cliffs at Deauville, a body presumed to be that of Antoine Bérangère turns up in the city morgue, the skull and face obliterated by a gunshot blast from Bérangère's rifle. While investigating the crime scene at the foot of the cliffs, Renard spots the mysterious woman watching from a distance, and chases after her following her Volvo. After losing her trail, he stops at a gas station inquiring about her car, and by chance learns that shortly after Victoria's car accident in 1970, a man in a Mercedes stopped at the station and called for an ambulance. Renard suspects it was Bérangère.  Renard drives to the cemetery where Victoria (and his wife) are buried and finds the mysterious woman's Volvo with a DVD inside labeled "Lucie 1982". Later he watches the DVD of home movies of a teenager—scenes of her undressing and being molested—taken by Bérangère. In search of Lucie's identity, Renard goes back to the mental hospital where he is still being treated and the head nurse confirms that Lucie was indeed treated at the hospital while he was there following her own attempted suicide. Initially Renard has no memory of her, but later he remembers her and understands that the mysterious woman he's been pursuing is Lucie, the daughter of Victoria. Looking for Lucie's address, Renard steals the hospital computer containing patient records and goes out searching for her, with his partner Pierre in hot pursuit. Renard is eventually captured and taken to jail. Pierre and his colleagues believe he is mentally unstable.  Camille visits Renard in jail and tells him about his nanny, Evelyne (Brigitte Damiens), who disappeared after the crash. Camille remembers being in the car with his mother Victoria and her new lover, Albert, when Bérangère ran them off the road in 1970. Later at the hotel, Camille confronts his stepmother, Mélanie, who reveals that Victoria and her new lover were taking Camille away from Bérangère. Camille then remembers that at the crash site, Bérangère left Camille in the car while taking the baby Lucie with him. Bérangère later entrusted the baby's care and upbringing to Camille's former nanny, Evelyne. Camille eventually finds Evelyne's apartment where he discovers a DVD of home movies showing her being molested by Bérangère.  Meanwhile, Lucie visits Bérangère who was wounded by the tramp he killed—the same tramp his family was planning to cremate. Obsessed with the memory of Victoria, and after years of molesting Lucie, Bérangère staged his own death so that he and Lucie could run away together. Traumatized by years of abuse, Lucie tried but was unable to kill Bérangère.  After Pierre bails him out of jail, Renard goes back to the morgue convinced that the body belongs to some tramp, not Bérangère whom he now knows has been molesting Lucie and controlling her for years. Renard learns from Mélanie that Bérangère might be hiding on the family yacht, ''Victoria''. At the yacht, Renard discovers Bérangère preparing to escape with a bag full of money. As Renard is about to arrest him, Lucie steps forward with a gun and ties up the surprised lieutenant. Once out to sea, Bérangère prepares to kill Renard, but Lucie lets go of the mast which knocks Bérangère into the ocean where he perishes. She unties Renard and they return to Deauville. Sometime later, Lucie meets Renard on the cliffs at Deauville, and they embrace and kiss.

Bitter his proposal for genetic experimentation was declined, Simon plans to prove the mayor wrong by testing his new serum on the beagle. The beagle escapes and runs amok in the lab, causing a fire and becoming exposed to various chemicals, which modify his DNA and give him superpowers.  After his escape, the beagle avoids an encounter with a [[Rottweiler]] named Riff Raff and his lackeys. Dan Unger strikes the beagle with his car, but, thanks to the serum, the beagle is unharmed. Dan takes him home and names him Shoeshine after the dog licks his shoes. Dan's son, Jack, becomes jealous of Shoeshine's attention. Dan retired from the police to spend more time with Jack after his wife's death but still seems busy. Jack leaves for school and Dan for work, leaving Shoeshine at the house alone, where he, still unaware of his new powers, accidentally makes a very large mess. After coming home, Jack complains as he cleans up, and Shoeshine shocks both of them by claiming it was an accident. Jack initially runs away, but after they reach a park, Jack and Shoeshine talk and bond over their respective attraction to Molly and Polly, Jack's friend and her dog. After the girls leave, Jack and Shoeshine test Shoeshine´s powers. Shoeshine has super speed, strength, hearing, and smell.  When Molly and Polly are mugged, Shoeshine rushes to their aid, discovering he can fly. After discreetly rescuing them, Shoeshine returns home with Jack, making Jack promise to never reveal his powers. Cad shows up at the door with posters of Shoeshine, but Jack fools him into leaving just before Dan comes home to discover the mess. Meanwhile, Simon and Cad find a new lair beneath the city, then plan a robbery to fund rebuilding Simon's lab. Seeing Cad's heist on the news, Jack convinces Shoeshine to intervene. Shoeshine disguises himself and saves the hostages, but Cad escapes. Shoeshine adopts the alias Underdog and becomes the city's resident superhero, donning a red sweater and blue cape as his disguise.  Simon repeatedly fails to recreate his serum and sends Cad to obtain a sample of Underdog's DNA. Shoeshine is rebuffed by Polly but gets a date with her as Underdog. Cad fails to capture Underdog but obtains his collar, which contains Underdog's name and address. Barsinister and Cad kidnap Dan and force him to call Shoeshine for help. Shoeshine and Jack attempt a rescue, but Barsinister uses both Jack and Dan as hostages to convince Shoeshine to give up his DNA. Barsinister synthesizes Underdog's superpowers into pills, injects Shoeshine with a antidote to the serum, and feeds the super pills to three trained German Shepherds. He and Cad leave the family trapped in the sewers, but Dan's police experience allows him to free everyone. They pursue Barsinister with a hypodermic needle filled with the antidote.  At the city hall, Barsinister takes the mayor hostage and instructs Cad to attach a bomb rigged with a mind control serum to the roof; Molly and Polly follow Cad. Shoeshine smells the bomb and, conquering his self-doubt, enters the building despite having lost his powers. During a scuffle with Barsinister, Shoeshine accidentally rips open Barsinister's pocket and swallows a super pill, restoring his powers. Shoeshine temporarily incapacitates the German Shepherds after he hears Molly and Polly cry for help, but Barsinister eats a pill and distracts Shoeshine by tossing a shield like a Frisbee. When the German Shepherds recover, Shoeshine convinces them to turn on Barsinister, who has not treated them well. While they restrain Barsinister, Underdog shows up at the bomb location,  removes the mind-control serum from the bomb, and the bomb itself,  saving Molly and Polly, who take the mind-control serum to the police. Dan arrives and injects Barsinister with the antidote, and Shoeshine, dressed now as Underdog, buries the bomb in a tunnel at the park as it explodes. Underdog tries to escape, but is caught in the explosion, launched into space, and thought dead, but a mournful crowd is overjoyed when he revives. Dan is reinstated as a police officer, Barsinister and Cad are arrested, and Shoeshine returns to protecting Capital City as Underdog.  
Unearthed (film)
 After a sinister crash on the highway in a small New Mexican town, people start disappearing and animals begin dying. The cause of the crash is later revealed to be a 900-year-old creature which was unearthed during an archaeological dig in the area.  Meanwhile, a gas station owner informs a group of people that the gas tank never arrived, which meant that the small group needed to spend the night at the gas station. Sheriff Annie is called to investigate the crash, and finds a strange piece of evidence.  Annie then takes it to the gas station, where Nodin investigates it. It is clearly not human, and has many elements of DNA in it. It is later explained the creature is an alien weapon, devised by an extremely ancient civilization to collect DNA like some kind of probe or exploration device created using bio-technology, however it tends to do so in a decidedly lethal manner.  At the bar, Carla finds male customers dead in the back lot. She runs back into the bar, and the creature then breaks in. It first injures her arm (and also causes her to shoot herself in the foot), and then it eventually butchers her.  Back at the gas station, Caya and Charlie are flirting inside the motel room. Ally goes outside to throw out some garbage, and encounters Grandpa, thinking Ally was a coyote rustling through the trash. Ally then returns to the motel, but before she can enter, the creature rips its claw into her torso.  Ally's dead body is thrown back into the room and onto the stove. Her dead body burns, causing a fire, and a gas leak. Annie, Nodin, and Grandpa go into the room where the creature is outside banging on the walls. Grandpa is then killed, and Nodin begins to panic.  Annie then knocks her unconscious and they go out to the truck, after the room explodes into flames.  After battling the monster countlessly, most of the group is killed. At the end, Annie confronts the monster, and believes she kills it by smashing it against a water tank with her car but the monster was only made unconscious for a while. Annie injects herself with the poison containing uranium (the only substance that makes the poison work against the monster) that was prepared by Nodin in order to kill the monster. The monster kills Annie and dies itself as soon as it comes in contact with the uranium in the poison. The remaining survivors, Caya and Nodin, place Annie's body in the back of their truck. They then drive off, leaving the monster in the dirt, where it is most likely going to become buried again.

The two take a bus ride and make it to LA.   Carlitos and Enrique arrive in LA at the address to realize that is just a PO box and not his mom's physical address.  Carlitos gets the idea to search the city for the pay-phone that his mother calls him from every Sunday.

Later, on the night of her wedding, Rosario admits to Paco that she can't marry him, as she wants to marry for love. Rosario tells him that she is going to move back to Mexico so she can be with her son.

The two fall asleep on the park bench. As Rosario is about to depart on the bus ride, seeing a pay-phone by the bus reminds her of Carlitos and she gathers her thoughts to make a decision.  As the sun rises, Carlitos is still sleeping on the park bench. Enrique leaves to buy food and Carlitos is spotted by the police. Carlitos is questioned by the police and almost caught, but Enrique throws a cup of coffee at the officers, provoking the officers to chase him instead, yelling at Carlitos to run. Carlitos manages to escape, but Enrique is caught and handcuffed. After running for a bit Carlitos finds himself in a familiar place that matches all of his mother's descriptions and sees her across the street waiting at a payphone.

However, he lies claiming he was at home ill, prompting Jhansi to end their relationship. At the end of the flashback, Vaidyanathan suggests to Karthik that it's more important to move on than think regretfully, and Karthik gets over his relationship with Jhansi. However, finding out about Deepika's love towards Karthik, Jhansi becomes jealous and reinstates her love for Karthik.

Vexille
 By the 2060s, [[robotics]] technology has become extremely advanced, including [[cybernetics]]. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the [[United Nations|U.N.]] declaring a unilateral ban on further research in 2067. [[Japan]], being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All [[gaijin|foreigners]] are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructed&nbsp;— 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. [[International trade|Trade]] and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene.  Ten years later, the [[United States Navy]] special warfare unit "SWORD" is trying to trap a Japanese informant for Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes by cutting off his own leg. Analysis shows the leg is made of bio-metal. SWORD suspects that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies. They embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and to find out the frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] on the country. Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit their data. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters. Vexille awakens to find [[Tokyo]] is now a [[shanty town]] ruled by Daiwa. A small [[resistance movement]] opposes the company, and uses Vexille's transmitter to successfully transmit the distortion frequency.  Maria, the head of the resistance, details the 10 years of secrecy while SWORD studies Japan in shocked horror — the islands are a lifeless wasteland. In 2067, an unknown disease struck Japan and was countered by an experimental [[vaccine]]. In actuality, the disease was created by Daiwa and the "vaccine" was used as an excuse for Daiwa to begin testing experimental [[nanotechnology]]. Every Japanese citizen was converted into a form of [[synthetic life]]. But there were unforeseen side effects; the conversion was imperfect, resulting in the infected humans losing their [[free will]] and becoming just lifelike machines. Some of the nanotech went amok, creating the "Jags", giant whirling constructs of semisentient metal that prowl the wilderness. The Jags destroyed all of Japan, save Tokyo which is protected by an inedible wall of [[ceramic]].  The Resistance plans to draw the Jags along a service bridge to Daiwa's corporate headquarters, which now stands in the middle of [[Tokyo Bay]]. Vexille volunteers her assistance (and that of her flight-capable armor). However, though Vexille and Maria succeed in drawing the Jags to the end of the service bridge, the bridge has been detached from the headquarters, the Jags fall into the sea, and Vexille and Maria are captured. They are taken to Kisaragi, the master of Daiwa, who boasts that his research is nearly complete. And as he needs more test subjects, he is going to invade America. Vexille attacks him with a hidden knife, revealing that his blood is still human&nbsp;— he has not used the process himself. Saito, then strangles him. The town council forces the ceramic gates open, destroying Tokyo and enabling the Jags to enter Daiwa's headquarters. Kisaragi, having somehow survived, shoots Saito and escapes with his research. The underling then releases Vexille and Maria before succumbing to his wounds.  Vexille pursues Kisaragi while Maria frees Leon, who shows concern for Vexille, angering Maria. Thus when Vexille prevents Kisaragi's escape in a helicopter, Maria grabs him and holds them together as a Jag devours them. Vexille and Leon are rescued by a SWORD helicopter just as Daiwa headquarters collapses into the bay, along with every Jag in Japan. As Vexille and Leon are flown from a now completely lifeless Japan, Vexille comments that humanity's spirit can never be taken away.

  The film is structured as a largely non-linear series of key events from the life of [[Édith Piaf]]. <ref group="note">The audience ultimately learns that the events from the film are [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] from within Édith's own memory as she dies.</ref> The film begins with elements from her childhood, and at the end with the events prior to and surrounding her death, poignantly juxtaposed by a performance of her song, "[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]".  The film opens with Édith as a small child in 1918, crying after being teased by other children. Her mother stands across the alley singing, [[street performance|busking]] for change. Édith's mother writes to her child's father, the [[Acrobatics|acrobat]], who is fighting in the trenches of [[World War I]] battlefields, informing him that she is leaving Édith with her mother so she can pursue the life of the artist. Her father returns to Paris and scoops up a sick Édith, then in turn leaves the child with his own mother, who is a madam of a [[brothel]] in [[Normandy]]. Now living as a child in a brothel, surrounded by the often brutal and demeaning business of prostitution, Édith is taken under the wing of the women there, especially Titine, a young troubled redhead who becomes emotionally attached to the little girl. Titine sings to, plays with, and tenderly cares for Édith through travails including an episode of [[keratitis]]-induced blindness.  Years later, Édith's father returns for her. Despite anguished protests from both Titine and Édith, he takes the child away to join him as he works as a circus acrobat. As Édith is outside cleaning up after dinner one night, she watches a fire eater practicing, and in the flames sees an apparition of [[St Thérèse]], who assures her that she will always be with her—a belief that she carries with her for the rest of her life.  When Édith is nine years old, her father leaves the circus after an argument with the manager and begins performing on the streets of Paris. During a lackluster performance of her father's contortionist skills while Édith holds a hat for coins, a passerby asks if Édith is part of the show and, with prompting by her father to "do something" so the half-interested audience doesn't leave, she spontaneously sings "[[La Marseillaise]]" with raw emotion, mesmerizing the street crowd.  Years later, a nightclub owner named [[Louis Leplée]] approaches Édith while she sings (and drinks) on the streets of  [[Montmartre]] for supper money with her friend Mômone. He invites her to his club for an informal audition. Impressed, he hires her, after creating for diminutive Édith (1.47m in height) a stage surname of Piaf, a colloquialism for sparrow.  Soon, Leplée is shot dead, suspected by the police to be due to Édith's connections to the mafia through the pimp who has demanded a large portion of her street singing earnings. When Édith next attempts a show at a low grade cabaret, she is jeered and shouted off the stage by a hostile crowd. Things go from bad to worse when Mômone is forcibly taken away to a convent for girls on orders from her mother. Desperate, Édith turns to [[Raymond Asso]], a songwriter and accompanist. Through harsh means, he enlivens her performances by teaching her to gesture with her "great hands" while singing, and works with her on enunciation and other aspects of stage presence, including how to battle her initial fierce bouts of stage fright that almost prevent her from taking the stage for her first music hall performance.  While performing in [[New York City]], Édith meets [[Marcel Cerdan]], a fellow French national who is a boxer competing for the World Champion title. Though she quickly learns from him that he has a wife, who runs their pig farm while he's away, Édith tells Mômone that she is falling in love with Marcel. The affair that ensues (it begins shortly after he beats Tony Zale and becomes World Middleweight Champion), while supposedly secret, results in  "La Vie En Rose" being played for Marcel wherever he goes. The morning after Édith has persuaded Marcel to fly from Paris and join her in New York, she wakes up to his kiss. She joyfully hurries to get him coffee and her gift to him of a watch, while she mocks and exasperatedly shouts at her oddly subdued entourage as they listlessly stand around her apartment. They finally break the news to her that Marcel's plane crashed. Édith hysterically searches for the ghost of Marcel that was lounging on her bed just a few moments before, crying out the name of her lost lover.  The narrative bookends these scenes from Édith's middle life with repeated vignettes of an aged-looking Édith with frizzy red hair, being nursed and tended to. She spends much of her time sitting in a chair by the lakeside, and when she stands, she has the stooped posture and slowness of a much older person. Another set of fractured memories shows Édith with short curly hair, plastered to her face as though she is feverish, singing on stage and collapsing while she tries to sing, a moment when Édith herself realizes that her body is betraying her, when she is hosting a party at a Parisian bistro, and topples a bottle of champagne because of her developing [[arthritis]], and to the morphine addiction that ultimately plays a large role in her demise, as she injects the drug with a young lover in her bedroom.  After her husband, [[Jacques Pills]], persuades her to enter rehabilitation for her addiction, she travels to California with him, and the audience sees the sober but manic-by-nature Édith being driven around in a convertible, laughing, joking, teasing her compatriots and generally being the life of the party, until she takes the wheel and promptly drives into a [[Joshua tree]]. The hilarity is uninterrupted as Édith gets out and pretends to hitchhike—the whole episode appearing to be a metaphor for her lifelong frantic efforts to be happy and distracted by entertaining others, through all manner of disasters.  Years later, Piaf, now frail and hunched, squabbles with her entourage about whether or not she will be able to perform at the [[Paris Olympia|Olympia]]. No one but Édith thinks that she will be ready to attempt the feat, but she ultimately faces this reality herself. Then, a new songwriter and arranger shows up with a song, "[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]", and Édith exclaims: "You're marvelous! Exactly what I've been waiting for. It's incredible. It's me! That's my life, it's me." She announces that she will indeed perform it at the Olympia.  Memories from prior to and during her last performance, when she collapses onstage, are interwoven through the film, foreshadowing the tragic end to a stellar but prematurely ended stage life. The memories appear to almost haunt Piaf. In one series, prior to what turns out to be her last performance, Édith is finally ready to go onstage after a series of delays, when she asks for the [[cross necklace]] that she always wears. As her staff rush away to get it, she sits and, in her quiet solitude, experiences more memories of her past, and after Édith puts on the retrieved cross and shuffles out onto the stage, the film presents more flashbacks as she is singing one of her signature songs, "Je ne regrette rien."  She relives a sunny day on a beach with her [[knitting]], when an older Édith with an obvious stoop graciously answers the simple and polite questions of an interviewer: what is her favorite color? (blue), her favorite food? (pot roast), and then more poignant questions that she also answers without hesitation, again showing the longings of her life. If you were to give advice to a woman, what would it be? "Love." To a young girl? "Love." To a child? "Love."  As though he is carrying a swaddled infant, Louis easily carries Édith, tiny and wasted away at the age of 47, into her bedroom and tucks her into bed, while the subtitle removes any illusions that this is other than the last day of her life. She is afraid. She says she cannot remember things, but has a disjointed series of memories of the kind of small moments that somehow define all our lives more than the "big moments" do—scrambled and fragmentary as a dying person might experience—her mother commenting on her "wild eyes," her father giving her a gift of a doll, and thoughts of her own dead child, Marcelle.  The film ends with Édith performing "Non, je ne regrette rien" at the Olympia.

The Visitor (2007 drama film)
 Walter Vale ([[Richard Jenkins]]) is a widowed [[Connecticut College]] economics professor who lives a fairly solitary existence. He fills his days by sometimes taking piano lessons in an effort to emulate his late wife, a classical concert pianist, and infrequently works on a new book. When he is asked to present a paper at an [[academic conference]] at [[New York University]], he is not enthusiastic to make the trip, given he is only the nominal co-author and has never even read the complete work. Charles ([[Michael Cumpsty]]), his department head, insists and Walter is forced to attend.  When he arrives in his old apartment in [[Manhattan]], Walter is startled to find a young unmarried couple living there, having rented it from a swindler who claimed it was his. Tarek is an immigrant from Syria ([[Haaz Sleiman]]), a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]]-[[Syria]]n<ref></ref> [[djembe]] player, and Zainab ([[Danai Gurira]]) is a [[Senegal]]ese designer of ethnic jewelry. He later discovers both are [[illegal immigrants]]. Although they have no place to go, they hastily pack and leave, but Walter decides to let them stay. Over the next few days, a friendship slowly develops. Tarek teaches Walter to play the drum, and the two men join a group of others at a regular [[drum circle]] in [[Central Park]].  On the way home, Tarek is mistakenly charged with [[New York City Subway|subway]] [[turnstile]] jumping, arrested for "failing" to pay his fare (although he actually had), and taken to a [[Immigration detention#United States|detention center]] for illegal immigrants in [[Queens]]. In order to prevent Tarek's [[deportation]] from the United States, Walter hires an immigration lawyer. Feeling uncomfortable about remaining in the apartment with Walter, Zainab moves out to live with relatives in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]].  Tarek's mother, Mouna ([[Hiam Abbass]]), unexpectedly arrives from her home in [[Michigan]] when she is unable to contact her son. Because she is also illegally in the States, she is unable to visit her son. Hesitating, she accepts Walter's offer to stay in the apartment, and the two develop a friendship. Walter confesses his life is unfullfilling; he dislikes the single course he has taught for twenty years, and the book he is allegedly writing is nowhere near completion. It is revealed that Mouna's journalist husband died following a lengthy politically motivated imprisonment in Syria, and she is concerned about her son's future prospects if he is deported. The two begin to share a simple domestic existence, with Mouna preparing meals and Walter treating her to ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' when she mentions her love for the original cast recording Tarek sent her as a gift.  Without warning, Tarek is summarily deported back to Syria. Mouna, left with no one in the States, decides to follow him and to return to live there. On their final night, Mouna joins Walter for a comforting embrace in bed, blaming herself for all that has gone wrong. Walter sees her off at the airport the next day. Alone once again, Walter plays his drum on a subway platform, as Tarek once told him he himself would like to do some time.

Virgin Territory
 The film is set in [[Florence]] ([[Republic of Florence]]) during the [[Black Death]]. As in the ''Decameron'', ten young [[Florence|Florentines]] take refuge from the plague. But instead of telling stories, they have lusty adventures, bawdy exchanges, romance and swordplay. There are randy nuns, [[Saracen]] pirates, and a sexy cow.  Pampinea is the daughter of a wealthy merchant who has died moments before the start of the movie. Lorenzo is a young man in town who is exceptionally good at gambling and is charmed by her beauty.

Count Dzerzhinsky, from the city of [[Novgorod]] in [[Novgorod Republic]] now in modern [[Russia]], is Pampinea's fiancé who she has never met. Their fate intertwines after Pampinea's father died and Gerbino robs Pampinea of her fortune, saying her father was in debt. The only way for the merchant's daughter to save her life was to marry him, according to Gerbino himself.  Lorenzo was being chased by Gerbino after he bested him at a gambling table, then took refuge in a convent by posing as a "deaf & dumb" gardener. At this convent, he has sex with all of the horny nuns, but only until Pampinea's arrival. Pampinea&mdash;trying to escape from Gerbino's grasp&mdash;ran to the convent for shelter. There she witnesses Lorenzo, whom she'd long had feelings for, having sex with the nuns and get jealous. She blindfolds Lorenzo and kisses him passionately out of love. But then, out of jealousy, informs the convent's Holy Mother of his deception, that he is actually neither deaf nor dumb.  The Count arrives in Florence only to be ambushed by Gerbino's men. All of his companions are killed, but he survives. Receiving a message from Pampinea's servant, Count Dzerzhinsky rides to Pampinea's father's mansion for the wedding, for he has been promised her hand in marriage. On the way, the young Count meets a [[skinny dipping]] Melissa&mdash;Pampinea's best friend, who is on her way to attend the wedding&mdash;and the two subsequently fall in love. The Count is led to believe Melissa is Pampinea.  Chased out of the convent, Lorenzo follows Pampinea to her father's mansion. There he confesses to her that he's fallen in love with the nun who kissed him whilst blindfolded, the woman whose face he never got to see. Later, Gerbino and his men arrive at the mansion and imprison Lorenzo. Pampinea agrees to marry Gerbino right that day to save Lorenzo, and thus Lorenzo is banished to the woods. There he meets Dzerzhinsky who is on his way to the mansion to be married to 'Pampinea' (actually Melissa) and the two team up to take out Gerbino's men. Gerbino himself dies falling into a large deep well inside the mansion.  Pampinea, in love with Lorenzo, refuses to get married to Count Dzerzhinsky, only to realise moments later that the Count himself is actually in love with Melissa who has been posing as her. She happily then runs after Lorenzo and kisses him. Lorenzo realises that she is in fact the nun he's in love with and they hold their wedding that very day, with all of their friends attending.

 During a shootout against Chinese [[Triad society|Triads]] at a San Francisco dock warehouse, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents John Crawford ([[Jason Statham]]) and Tom Lone ([[Terry Chen]]) stumble across the notorious assassin Rogue ([[Jet Li]]), a former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] assassin who now works for the Japanese [[Yakuza]]. Rogue ambushes Crawford and is about to execute him when Lone appears and shoots Rogue in the face, causing him to fall into the water. Rogue's body was never found and he is presumed dead. However, Rogue survives and retaliates against Lone, his wife and his daughter. He kills them, burns down the house, and leaves their three corpses in the ashes of their home.  Three years later, Rogue re-appears, working under Chinese Triad boss Li Chang ([[John Lone]]). While working with Chang, Rogue secretly instigates a war between the Triads and the Yakuza, led by Shiro Yanagawa ([[Ryo Ishibashi]]). Rogue first attacks a club run by the Yakuza by killing the gangsters and later on the runners in order to recover a pair of antique gold horses, family heirlooms of Chang.  Now the head agent of the FBI's Asian Crime Task Force, Crawford is determined to hunt Rogue down and exact revenge for Lone's death. Crawford's obsessive pursuit of Rogue has taken a toll on his personal life causing him to be estranged from his family. Crawford comes close to catching Rogue in the wake of Rogue's various killing sprees against the Triads and Yakuza, but Rogue always manages to stay one step ahead.  Ultimately, Rogue's actions have gained the trust of both Chang and Yanagawa. Rogue succeeds in killing Chang, but spares Chang's wife and child, turning on the Yakuza.  With Chang dead, Yanagawa appears in America, intending to expand Yakuza business operations. However, he is confronted by Crawford and the FBI; Crawford presents Yanagawa with proof that Rogue has betrayed him and spared Chang's family, but Yanagawa refuses to assist Crawford in locating Rogue.  Later, Rogue delivers the horses to Yanagawa personally. Knowing of Rogue's betrayal, Yanagawa captures Rogue and demands the location of Chang's family. Rogue turns the tables on Yanagawa's men and kills them all, and engages in a sword fight against Yanagawa himself. Yanagawa discovers that the real Rogue was killed when attempting to assassinate Lone.  Lone in turn surgically altered himself to assume the assassin's identity. Lone reveals that his actions have all been designed to bring him face-to-face with Yanagawa, so he could kill the man who ordered the death of his family. Yanagawa reveals that Crawford was in his pocket that whole time and responsible for leaking Tom Lone's identity and home address to the real Rogue. Angered, Lone disarms and decapitates Yanagawa.  Meanwhile, Chang's wife receives a package from Lone, containing one of the two golden horses that belongs to Chang's family and a message reading, "Make a new life". Yanagawa's daughter also receives a package with the same message and inside the box is her father's head. Lone then calls Crawford as he is packing up his office, asking him to meet him at the dock warehouse where they last made their investigation. Before going to the warehouse, Crawford enlists the help of Goi ([[Sung Kang]]), an FBI sniper that aided Crawford throughout the investigation.  At the warehouse, Crawford and Lone battle each other in an intense hand-to-hand fight in which Lone reveals his true identity to Crawford.  When Lone reveals his true identity, a devastated Crawford reveals that it was true that he was working for Yanagawa at the time but had no idea that Rogue was still alive. He was then blackmailed into giving Yanagawa Lone's address thinking that Yanagawa's men were only going there to "rough him up a bit". Ever since, Crawford was angry at himself and wanted revenge against Rogue and everyone else involved in what he thought was his partner's death.  Crawford sacrifices himself by jumping in front of an FBI snipers bullet to protect Lone. The next day, Lone later drives out of town to start a new life.  
Waitress (film)
 Jenna Hunterson is a [[waitress]] living in the [[Southern United States|American South]], trapped in an unhappy marriage with her controlling and abusive husband, Earl. She works in Joe's Pie Diner, where her job includes creating inventive pies with unusual titles inspired by her life, such as the "Bad Baby Pie" she invents after her unwanted pregnancy is confirmed. While a receptionist at the doctor’s office notices her disappointment, and even mentions to her that she can have the pregnancy "[[Abortion|taken care of]]"  in a city about 2 hours away, she decides to keep the baby nonetheless. Jenna longs to run away from her dismal marriage and is slowly accumulating money to do so. She pins her hopes for escape on a pie contest in a nearby town, which offers a $25,000 grand prize, but her husband won't let her go. Her only friends are her co-workers, Becky and Dawn, and regular customer, Joe, the curmudgeonly owner of the diner and several other local businesses, who encourages her to begin a new life elsewhere.  Jenna's life changes after she meets her new [[Primary care physician|physician]], Jim Pomatter. He has moved to the small town to accommodate his wife, who is completing her [[Residency (medicine)|residency]], at the local hospital, and is filling in for the woman who has been Jenna's doctor since childhood. The two are attracted to each other, and over the course of several pre-natal appointments the attraction grows. After Dr. Pomatter invites her into the office under a quickly exposed pretext, she impulsively initiates a passionate affair. Prompted by the gift of a baby journal, Jenna begins to keep a diary, ostensibly for her unborn child, revealing her thoughts about that future child, and her own plans.   After giving birth, Jenna bonds immediately with the baby girl, and names her Lulu. Earl, clearly disappointed that it's a girl, reminds Jenna of a promise he had forced her to make earlier, not to love the baby more than she does him. She bluntly tells him that she hasn't loved him in years, will no longer put up with his possessiveness and abuse, and will not let Lulu grow up with him mistreating her, and wants a divorce. Enraged, Earl attempts to [[assault]] Jenna, but is escorted out of the hospital by [[security]] staff.  Later, while Becky and Dawn are helping Jenna prepare to leave the hospital, and letting her know that Joe had collapsed and gone into a coma, Jenna remembers an envelope Joe brought to her before the birth, when she finds out he was admitted as a patient in the same hospital. In the envelope she finds a handmade card with a sketch of her, a check for $270,450, and a message of friendship that urges her to start her life anew. While leaving the hospital, Dr. Pomatter wants to have a word with her in private regarding their affair and what is to happen now. She promptly breaks it off, handing him a chocolate [[Moon Pie]] and asks her friends to wheel her out.   An epilogue depicts Jenna winning the pie contest, and becoming the new owner of the diner where she worked, now called Lulu's Pies, serving brightly colored pies to her customers and friends. The final shot shows her happily walking home hand-in-hand with her toddler, Lulu.  
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story
 Dewey Cox begins his quest for stardom in Springberry, Alabama in 1946. While playing with his brother Nate, Dewey accidentally cuts his brother in half at the waist with a machete. The trauma of the incident causes Dewey to lose his sense of smell. After his brother's death is announced by a physician making a house call, Dewey's mother sends him to the local store to buy some butter and a candle. There, he meets a blues guitarist, who lets Dewey play his guitar. Dewey is a natural.  In 1953, after a successful and controversial talent show performance, then 14-year-old Dewey decides to leave Springberry with his 12-year-old girlfriend, Edith. They soon marry, have sex, and have a baby after 8.7 months. While working at an all-[[African American]] nightclub, Dewey gets a break when he replaces singer Bobby Shad at the last minute and impresses the Hasidic Jewish record executives attending the show that evening.  Dewey then is brought to the studio where he is interrupted while recording a rockabilly rendition of "That's Amore". The recording executive berates Dewey as talentless. Backed into a corner, Dewey makes the first recording of "Walk Hard", the song inspired by a speech Dewey gave to Edith.  Within 35 minutes, the song becomes a hit, and Dewey begins to get caught up in the fame of rock and roll. When Dewey stumbles upon a room of groupies smoking with drummer Sam, Sam introduces Dewey to marijuana. Sam tells Dewey to leave because he "don't want no part of this shit" (a running gag throughout the film) but Dewey eventually tries it and continues to do so every time he finds Sam with a new drug. His attitude and drug problems cause him to become unfaithful to Edith. Dewey's father then returns to inform Dewey that Dewey's mother has died while dancing to Dewey's song on the radio. Pa manages to make Dewey feel responsible for her death, contributing to an already high level of inner turmoil. Dewey is then introduced to cocaine, which leads to a change in his music to a louder, "Punk rock" type. With the addition of backup singer Darlene Madison, Dewey produces several more hit records. However, they become attracted to each other, and Dewey weds Darlene while still married to Edith, which leads to both women leaving him. He then snaps at his chimpanzee companion, who is "only concerned with fruit and touching himself". Dewey is eventually busted after purchasing drugs from an undercover cop, serves time in jail, and spends time in rehab before Darlene returns.  They move to Berkeley, California in 1966 at the beginning of the '60s counterculture movement. Dewey writes protest songs for midgets. His singing style is then compared by a reporter to that of Bob Dylan, which Dewey angrily denies.   During a band visit to India, Dewey takes LSD with [[The Beatles]], which causes Dewey to lose touch with reality yet again and have a ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]''-esque hallucination. Dewey becomes obsessed with every aspect of the recording process and is consumed with creating his masterpiece entitled ''Black Sheep'' (a homage to [[Brian Wilson]]'s ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''). The band does not appreciate his insane style of music and his continuous abuse of the others in the group. As a result, the band breaks up; Darlene is also unable to deal with Dewey's insanity and drug problems and leaves him. Dewey goes through another stay in rehab, where he is visited by Nate's ghost. Nate ridicules Dewey's self-pity and tells him to start writing songs again.  Dewey is next seen jogging into the 1970s, and hosting a CBS variety television show. But his song-block prevents him from writing a masterpiece for his brother. (In the director's cut, Dewey remarries again, this time to Cheryl Tiegs.) Nate appears again and tells Dewey that he needs to tell Pa that he loves him. Although Dewey's father appreciates his courage, he challenges Dewey to a fight to the death with machetes. However, Pa accidentally cuts himself in half. Just before he dies, the senior Cox forgives Dewey and tells him to be a better father than he was. His death causes Dewey to have an emotional breakdown and he destroys almost everything in his home.  Dewey accepts that it is time to focus on spending time with his numerous children. Darlene returns to him in 1992, divorced and single. Dewey talks to Darlene about what he has done since they last met. After finally understanding what is most important to him, Dewey regains his sense of smell and they get remarried.  In the present day, L'Chaim's son Dreidel pays a visit to Dewey's estate. He informs Dewey that he has become popular with younger listeners through rapper Lil' Nutzzak's sampling of "Walk Hard". Dewey is upset about this at first, but pays it little mind when he is informed that he is to receive the lifetime achievement award. Dewey is reluctant to play a song at first, fearing the temptations he once succumbed to, but his wife, children and grandchildren put their full support behind him.

Walking Tall: Lone Justice
 It's been a year since Nick Prescott ([[Kevin Sorbo]]) became the sheriff of Boone, Texas, and cleaned up the town. Now, he's moving to [[Dallas]] so he can be with his FBI agent fiancee Kate Jensen ([[Yvette Nipar]]) and her 12-year-old daughter Samantha ([[Haley Ramm]]).  Currently, Kate is one of the many people working to put away Octavio Perez ([[Rodrigo De la Rosa]]), the biggest drug kingpin in the central states. When the two main witnesses against Perez are killed by his men in a safe-house, the testimony of Kate and three other investigators, including Lt. Doug Maxwell ([[Mark W. Johnson]]), becomes the only way to put Perez away.  They're lodged in another safe-house to wait for the trial, but the place is invaded by Perez's men, and two of the agents are executed, leaving Kate and Maxwell alive, but Kate is in critical condition.  Nick believes that there is a traitor who is leaking the safe house locations to Perez's men. Nick saves Kate from an attempt on her life at the hospital, and takes Kate and Samantha to his ranch in Boone, where Kate can continue to recover, with Nick's mother Emma ([[Gail Cronauer]]) helping to watch over her. And Nick has some of his friends watching over the ranch to make sure no one gets to Kate, Emma, and Samantha.  After Kate wakes up and is up to walking around, she looks back on when she was shot, and she remembers something that leads her to realize that Maxwell is the traitor. After Maxwell and some of Perez's men kidnap Nick, along with Kate's boss, Marcia Tunney (Elizabeth Barondes), Perez and his men get the location of the ranch, and leave to go after Kate.  Perez's girlfriend Ramona (Christina Hearn), who has cut off two of Tunney's fingers in order to get information from her, is left behind, and after Nick frees himself, he distracts Ramona long enough for Tunney to kill her.  Nick tells Tunney that he'll send her some help, and then he races to the ranch, and he gets there before Perez and his men do. Perez and his men arrive, and gunfire erupts. All of Perez's men are killed, and Kate fatally shoots Perez.  Maxwell chases Samantha into the woods, and grabs her. Nick chases Maxwell, and he finds Maxwell holding his gun to Samantha's head.

The Warlords
  The film is set in China in the 1860s, during the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. It is based on the [[Ma Xinyi#Assassination|assassination of Ma Xinyi]] in 1870. In the beginning, there is a battle between loyalists and rebels, during which all of the loyalists are killed except Qingyun, the general. Qingyun goes to a village nearby where the inhabitants engage in banditry, being led by two men, Erhu and Wuyang. He offers his assistance in executing a raid against a rebel convoy. However, a loyalist army assaults the village shortly afterward and seizes the spoils for themselves. Around this time, Qingyun begins an affair with Erhu's wife.  Since the villagers are poor and starving, Qingyun convinces them to fight the rebels as an independent loyalist war-band. Erhu and Wuyang are distrustful of Qingyun, so the three of them perform a [[Blood brother|blood oath]] where, under the pain of death, they promise to care for each other like brothers. The war-band wins a series of victories. Qingyun becomes ambitious and prepares to attack [[Suzhou]] and [[Nanjing]]. However, the government becomes fearful of Qingyun's growing influence, and decides to deny reinforcements and provisions. As a result, the attack on Suzhou becomes a year-long siege.  Erhu attempts to kill the enemy commander by sneaking into the city in disguise. He is quickly captured, but to his surprise, the enemy commander was already planning on surrendering, and allows Erhu to kill him in exchange for sparing his troops from execution. However, Qingyun refuses to honor the deal due to a lack of food and manpower to keep them prisoner. Qingyun temporarily detains Erhu to keep him from interfering. Afterwards, he has the prisoners locked in the palace courtyard and massacred with arrows from atop the walls. Embittered, Erhu considers desertion, but Qingyun convinces him that the attack on Nanjing will liberate millions of innocent lives.  Nanjing is easily taken, and Qingyun, in return for his grand success, is awarded the position of Nanjing's governor. As Qingyun waits for his inauguration, he tries to make friends with other upper-class people. Erhu, however, has been jaded by the war, and does improper things such as handing out bonus pay without permission. Qingyun responds by arranging for Erhu's assassination, fearing a loss of reputation with the upper-class. Erhu, as he dies, curses the name of a rival, not realizing that he was betrayed by his own brother.  Wuyang, having discovered Qingyun's betrayal and Qingyun's affair with Erhu's wife, reacts by killing Erhu's wife. On the day of the inauguration, Wuyang jumps out to kill Qingyun, but is unable to defeat him. It is then revealed, through a flash-back, that Qingyun's promotion was fake, and that the government's real desire was to murder Qingyun for gaining too much influence. At this point, a government soldier appears behind Qingyun on a rooftop and shoots him in the back. Realizing he has been betrayed, a mortally wounded Qingyun allows Wuyang to fulfill their blood oath by killing him. The government then frames Wuyang for the murder and gets ready to execute him. The film closes with Wuyang observing that "Dying is easy. Living is harder."

Wasting Away
 In a recording, a military experiment tests Serum XT1258 on a soldier, only to have him turn into a zombie and attack the surgeons. The remainder of the serum is transported away for disposal. However, the soldiers become lost and while they fight over the map, they accidentally run over somebody that had been following them. One of the serum barrels falls out, rolls away, and leaks behind a bowling arcade, contaminating ice cream. Tim, an employee, eats it with his friends: Mike, his girlfriend Cindy, and Vanessa, Mike's ex-girlfriend. All pass out and reanimate into zombies; however they still see themselves as humans. Cindy gets a stomachache, and Vanessa and Tim are unable to call an ambulance because the phone operator speaks and hangs up too fast – everything in the normal world is sped up to zombies – but they simply dismiss it as faulty connections.  When they go outside to look for help, they bump into Nick, a military private who joins them to look for a working phone. When they stumble into a bar and are attacked by its patrons, they exhibit abnormal symptoms, such as increased strength and endurance. Nick then tells them about the serum, and he reveals he was also exposed to it. Nick suspects it has infected most of the population and the five of them are immune because all of them were infected while consuming dairy products, which might have neutralized the serum's toxins. Convinced the military will hunt them down to cover up the incident, Nick proposes they stay together to ensure their safety.   Nick unsuccessfully spies on Colonel South and Dr. Richter, the people responsible for the experiment, and later goes off to steal information about the serum. Cindy and Tim check on Cindy's family while Vanessa and Mike hurry for Vanessa's job interview. Tim accidentally kills Cindy's parents when they throw dynamite at him while he asks for their permission to marry her, only for him to throw it back before it explodes. Vanessa presumably kills her would-be employer when she unintentionally scares him into his bedroom and catches him hiding under the bed. Meanwhile, Nick is captured and has his brain waves sped up to understand humans again. Colonel South then reveals the military is planning to eradicate the infected people. After he shows Nick his zombie self, Nick becomes enraged and escapes.  Tim, Cindy, Mike, and Vanessa reunite at the bowling arcade, only to be challenged to a bowling match by Tim's rival Danny and his team, who are all drunk; only drunken people see zombies as humans. Mike and Tim compete against them while Cindy and Vanessa keep them drunk to disorient them. All is well until they run out of beer and Danny's team sees they are truly zombies. A fight breaks out, and Mike is decapitated in the chaos, but his head remains alive. They kill Danny and his teammates when Nick shows up and assists them.   He then reveals the truth to them, and Mike comes up with a plan to defeat the military by infecting most of the soldiers at the headquarters. They gain extra allies by resurrecting the dead bowling teammates with the contaminated ice cream and pose as corpses in a disposal truck on its way to the headquarters. They are almost caught by Colonel South's containment unit, but Mike sacrifices himself to kill them by activating a grenade with his mouth. Once the zombies reach the headquarters, Nick offers himself to Colonel South as a diversion while the others infect the rest of the soldiers present. Furious, Colonel South has Nick taken in alive.   Tim, Cindy, Vanessa and the other zombies populate "Zombie Town", which is erected in memory of Mike and Nick. Colonel South and Dr. Richter plan to torture Nick for treason as a soldier, which he responds to by saying, "I'm not a soldier. I'm a zombie."  
We Own the Night (film)
 [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], 1988. Bobby Green ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]) is the manager of the El Caribe [[nightclub]] in [[Brighton Beach]], which is frequented by Russian mobster and drug lord Vadim Nezhinski ([[Alex Veadov]]) and owned by Vadim's uncle Marat Buzhayev ([[Moni Moshonov]]).  Bobby has distanced himself from his father, [[NYPD]] Deputy Chief Burt Grusinsky ([[Robert Duvall]]), and his brother, Captain Joseph Grusinsky ([[Mark Wahlberg]]). Bobby uses his mother's maiden name, Green, as his last name and stays on the sidelines enjoying a [[hedonistic]] life with his girlfriend Amada Juarez ([[Eva Mendes]]) and best friend Louis "Jumbo" Falsetti ([[Danny Hoch]]).  When brother Joseph leads a police raid on El Caribe in hope of arresting Vadim, Bobby refuses to cooperate. The incident strains Bobby's relationship with his father and brother even more and Bobby and Joseph come to blows.  The police are unsuccessful in making a case against Vadim, who decides to retaliate. The next evening, Joseph is shot by a masked assailant and his unmarked police cruiser is firebombed. Joseph survives the ambush and is hospitalized for four months. Vadim, unaware of Bobby's family ties, confides that the Chief will be the next victim. Bobby resolves to help the police and without his father's knowledge goes undercover inside Vadim's cocaine-smuggling operation with a police [[Covert listening device|listening device]] hidden in a cigarette lighter.  The device is discovered and Bobby narrowly escapes being murdered as the police raid the operation and arrest Vadim.  Bobby and Amada are placed in protective police custody and their relationship begins to deteriorate.  Vadim escapes custody while being transported to a hospital. Burt and the police prepare to move Bobby and Amada to a new location. During a torrential rainstorm the police convoy is intercepted by Vadim's men and during a chaotic car chase Burt is fatally shot.  When he sees his father's body, Bobby blacks out in the rain.  The police take Bobby and Amada back to their motel near Kennedy Airport. Bobby wakes up a few hours later and finds Joseph in the motel room. Joseph tells him that their father has been shot and killed. At the funeral, a colleague of Joseph's, Captain Jack Shapiro ([[Tony Musante]]), gives him Burt's Korean War medal. Bobby is told that a Russian shipment of cocaine is arriving sometime in the coming week.  To avenge his father, Bobby decides to officially join the police force without the consent of Amada, who leaves him. After he is sworn into the [[NYPD]], Bobby learns the true involvement of Jumbo, his friend, and Marat, Vadim's uncle. He and Joseph organize a final sting operation, set for April 4, 1989. During the raid, Joseph is emotionally incapacitated by the memory of his shooting and cannot continue. Vadim flees into the reed beds, and the police toss in flares to smoke him out. As the beds are engulfed in flame and smoke, Bobby runs in to find Vadim himself, ignoring the other officers' pleas that he wait. Bobby shoots Vadim in the chest, mortally wounding him.  Nearly a year after the raid on El Caribe, Bobby, now in uniform, graduates from the [[NYPD]] Police Academy to become a full-time police officer. Before the ceremony, Joseph reveals to Bobby that he has decided to switch to a job in the administration sector, since the shooting led him to realize that he needs to spend more time with his children. As the chaplain announces that Bobby is to give the valedictorian address, Bobby thinks he sees Amada in the audience, but it turns out to be an illusion. Bobby and Joseph express their brotherly love.  
Watching the Detectives (film)
 The film opens on a dark film noir black and white scene where a 1940s style detective shoots a villain—for trying to return a late video. The lights come up, revealing that we are watching a commercial for Gumshoe Video, and the detective is Neil ([[Cillian Murphy]]), the store's owner, who is premiering the ad for friends at a party at his modest cinephile video store. His girlfriend Denise ([[Heather Burns]]), who appears in the commercial, does not show up at the celebration.  The next day, Neil meets Denise at a restaurant, but before he goes to the table, he gets a waiter ([[Steve Lemme]]) to spill a glass of water on her, just to watch her overreact. She is not amused by the prank, and tells him he needs to get his life together instead of just watching movies and playing immature games. He casually breaks up with her, telling her she is not enough like [[Katharine Ross]] in ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]''.  Back at the store, Neil is watching a film with his friend/employee Jonathan ([[Jason Sudeikis]]), when femme fatale Violet ([[Lucy Liu]]) makes her entrance, turning his head. Violet has no identification or credit card for her rental deposit, so she persuades him to take $50 cash, which he puts in an envelope under his antique cash register. When she returns, she surreptitiously steals back the deposit, making him think he lost it, but she says he can take her out for a $50 dinner to make it up to her.  At the date, Violet arrives first and pretends that she has already gotten really drunk. When Neil does not try to take advantage of the situation, she reveals her joke and they proceed with dinner. At her urging, they go to a Media Giant store – his corporate competitor – and hide in a closet until after the employees lock up for the night, then they switch a bunch of DVDs into the wrong cases and knock over some displays while fleeing. The next day, they spy on the Media Giant and see an employee talking to a police officer. Later, police detectives drop by Gumshoe Video to question Neil about the Media Giant break-in. Once they have completely scared him, Violet appears and she and the "cops" begin laughing hysterically at the ruse. A flummoxed Neil secretly trails Violet back to her house, where they end up in bed, falling in love. The following morning, they go for a romantic swim.  Sometime later, Neil is leaving to meet Violet at the park when he runs into friends ([[Callie Thorne]] and Michael Yurchak) who beg to come along and meet his new girlfriend. Violet feeds them another party's picnic meal and leaves them to answer for it. Neil tries to make their next date quieter, by watching a basketball game, but a bored Violet then does not want to stay the night. Later, he goes to see a band play at Jonathan's bar and spies her flirting with a musician. Jealous, he stages a rock guitar scene for her at their next date. After they have [[sexual intercourse|sex]], she reveals that she just staged the club scene and, before going to sleep, tells him about all the musicians she has dated, including a bald, Polish, avant garde musician (Richard Waddingham) who stalks her from city to city. Paranoid, Neil imagines that every bald white guy he sees is the stalker until Violet stages a scene where she has been tied to a chair by her ex, the Bald Giant, who turns out to be her friend Denis (Richard Waddingham). Frustrated by Violet's tomfoolery, Neil breaks up with her.  Neil runs into Denise and realizes that he treated her somewhat like Violet has treated him, and that he misses Violet and the excitement she created. So when she calls and tells him to come to her workplace, he does. She tricks him into stealing money from her job at an illegal casino, thinking it is another one of her fake scenes. He is shot at and chased. Neil is exhilarated by the crime, but Violet takes the money and lets him know he has been used. Neil is very distraught at another breakup, but Violet returns to say that the breakup was a joke, too. Neil is initially infuriated, but Violet convinces him that his life is more interesting and adventurous with her in it. They make up and drive off in the new car Violet bought with some of the robbery money.

Weirdsville
  Nothing much happens in the lives of 20-something pals Dexter and Royce except for getting high and hanging out with Royce’s girlfriend, Matilda ("Mattie"). This all changes one evening in Northern Ontario town Weedsville when Mattie overdoses on a stash of Dexter and Royce’s drugs — drugs fronted by local drug kingpin and tough-guy Omar to sell in order to cover their previous drug debt. Thinking her dead and knowing that calling the cops would only land them in jail the pair decide to bury her in the boiler room of the closed [[drive-in theater]] where Royce used to work. The two set off to deal with Mattie’s dead body.  While the boys begin to dig a grave downstairs, a Satanic cult led by another former employee and (former classmate of Dexter and Royce) Abel enters the supposedly abandoned drive-in and begins a ritual involving pentagrams and human bloodletting in the upstairs concession stand. Their plan is to resurrect Jason Taylor (hippie turned reluctant but rich Internet entrepreneur and Abel’s unwitting hero) out of his coma. However, when Dexter walks in mid-sacrifice, everything goes awry.  Dexter and Royce are captured, gagged and duct-taped and Mattie’s corpse is discovered. But when some of the sacrificed follower’s blood unexpectedly "awakens" Matilda an all out chase ensues. Royce and Dexter get to her first, and the trio escapes. After safely stowing Mattie in Dexter’s apartment, the boys run into Omar and his beefy sidekick Garry, who deliver a few swings of a curling stone and an ultimatum — debt (plus interest) paid by [[last call (bar term)|last call]] or he will severely injure the pair. Knowing that millionaire Jason Taylor has a safe full of money at his place, Dexter and Royce take off to break in and steal it, a plan previously mentioned by Mattie, who knows the combination to Taylor's safe.  With a few unexpected bumps along the way, such as running into, accidentally knocking out and then getting high the nephew of Taylor, who was [[housesitting]], Dexter and Royce successfully manage to steal the safe. En route back to Dexter’s apartment to grab Mattie, they run into Abel. A classic car chase causes our boys to seek refuge in a mall where they encounter a [[midget]] security guard named Martin. After winning his trust (Martin has unresolved issues with cults himself) he lets them leave without further trouble.  Meanwhile at the New Age Resource Centre, Mattie (having been kidnapped by Abel) has been tied to an upside-down cross along with an unconscious Jason Taylor. Abel's plan is to offer Lucifer Mattie’s life in exchange for Jason’s. Dexter and Royce arrive to try and stop the ritual and rescue Mattie. Omar shows up looking to collect his debt and he brought Gary — and his gun — with him. In hot pursuit of Abel and his cult, Martin and his (physically) diminutive friends arrive only to crash into Dex's car, propelling the safe from the trunk into the New Age Centre, crushing Abel.  With Abel plan’s ruined and his life saved, Taylor gives Dexter and Royce the okay to hand off the safe with all of his money to clear their debt to Omar. They happily flee the scene with Mattie in tow.<ref>[http://www.magpictures.com/films/weirdsville/weirdsvillepressnotesfinal.doc MagPictures.com] Retrieved 2009-11-04</ref>  
Water Lilies (film)
 The film tracks the sexual awakenings of three 15-year-old female friends in a middle class suburb of [[Paris]] over the course of a single summer. Finding privacy in the solitude of the swimming pool locker room, blossoming teens Marie ([[Pauline Acquart]]), Anne ([[Louise Blachère]]) and Floriane ([[Adèle Haenel]]) come to learn the true meaning of arousal and the power of sexual attraction.  Marie seems to be physically and emotionally attracted to Floriane. Both Floriane and Anne are members of a [[synchronised swimming]] team, The Stade Franas Swimmers. Marie expresses an interest in joining the team in order to become closer to Floriane, whom the other girls regard as a "slut". Floriane exhibits her protectiveness for and caring attitude towards Marie when the former gives the latter a medal she was awarded.  When Marie sees Anne at a later point in time, Anne is resentful towards Marie for ignoring her. Marie tells Anne that she was just spending time at her cousin's. Anne accepts this explanation. The next day, Anne speaks to a young man upon whom she has a crush, François. Meanwhile, Floriane confesses to Marie that she has not yet had sex, despite what everyone else on the swim team seems to think. Floriane tells Marie that the rest of the young women on the team make up rumours because they do not like her. In fact, Floriane does not have many female friends.  Floriane tells Marie that one day, she was practicing in the water and the swimming instructor showed her his penis under the water. When Floriane asks Marie if she has any similar stories to tell, Marie is quiet and Floriane tells her that she is very lucky. When they go to Floriane's place, they spend time together lying on Floriane's bed holding hands. After a swim practice, Marie feels affronted when she sees Floriane kissing François. Floriane tells Marie that she is afraid of what will happen if Francois discovers that she is really not a slut and is hesitant about the prospect of having sex.  Floriane and Marie spends the night at a [[nightclub]], where Floriane attempts to find an older man in order to lose her virginity before François discovers that she's  a virgin. Floriane then finds a man and kisses him in his car, but is interrupted by  Marie. Floriane thanks Marie for the interruption, and later tells Marie that she wants Marie to be her 'first', but Marie rejects Floriane. Later that day, Marie meets Anne at a shopping mall, where Anne [[shoplift]]s a necklace. When the two eat lunch at McDonald's, Marie tells Anne that she is immature, then leaves the eating establishment. When Anne enters the male swimming pool locker room after her confrontation with Marie, she gives François the necklace, which he then gives to Floriane. She confesses to Marie that François wants to see her tonight when her parents are not at home. Marie then states that she will do what Floriane had asked her to do earlier. In bed, it seems as if Marie accomplished the goal.  François and Anne later have sex at Anne's house. When Anne sees Marie the next day, she tells Marie that Floriane actually did not have sex with François. After Marie and Anne share a kiss, Marie tells Anne that she likes somebody. Anne assumes that Marie has a heterosexual crush. At the swimming party, Anne spits into François's mouth when he attempts to have sex with her for a second time.  In the locker room, Marie and Floriane finally share a passionate kiss. Floriane indicates that she is going back to the party. Floriane tells Marie to 'save her' if the guy she talked to earlier at the party turns out to be 'an ass.' Marie and Anne jump into the pool fully clothed. They float on their backs in the pool together, while Floriane dances alone at the party, oblivious to the effect that her actions have had upon Marie and Anne.

The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep
  In present-day [[Scotland]], an American tourist couple go into a bar where they meet an old man who, per their request, tells them a story about the [[Loch Ness Monster]].  In 1942 Scotland, a boy named Angus MacMorrow lives in the large manor house of Lord Killin on the shores of [[Loch Ness]] with his mother Anne MacMorrow (the housekeeper), his sister, a cook, a maid and an old gamekeeper. Later, they are joined by Lewis Mowbray, who comes to work as a handyman in the manor. Angus' father Charlie —Killin's former handyman— is now a sailor in the [[Royal Navy]] and has been missing since his ship was sunk in [[World War II|the war]] almost a year ago; Angus is unable to accept that it is unlikely he will ever come home.  One day, while collecting [[seashells]], he discovers what appears to be a large mysterious [[egg]] in the [[sand]], which he leaves it in his father's [[shed]]. When he returns later, an unknown creature hatches (which he calls 'Crusoe' after [[Robinson Crusoe]]).  Angus decides to keep the creature a secret, but eventually tells his sister and (reluctantly) Lewis about it. Lewis explains to Angus that it is a [[parthenogenesis|genderless]] "[[Water Horse]]" that lays one egg, then dies before it hatches.  The next day, troops of the 12th Medium Regiment Royal Artillery arrive at the house, commanded by Captain Thomas Hamilton – a friend of Lord Killin, who is serving with the [[Royal Air Force]].  An artillery battery is set up near the lake as defence against possible attacking or hiding German [[U-boats]] and the troops set up camp on the grounds of the house.  An [[anti-submarine net]] is also raised at the mouth of the lake to trap the German U-boats in the lake so the artillery can destroy them.  One night, when the men are invited into the house for dinner, Crusoe breaks free, and roams the house, running into Sergeant Strunk's [[bulldog]] "Churchill" which chases him into the dining room. With Crusoe unnoticed, Churchill is blamed for the mess. Meanwhile, Crusoe spends the night in a [[fountain]] feeding on the fish, where the next day, Lewis finds he has grown so big that he and Angus have no choice but to let him roam wild in the loch, which they promptly take him to.  Captain Hamilton proclaims Lewis to be a bad influence, and manipulates Angus' mother to allow him to teach Angus some discipline and make a soldier out of him. However, after a few days of training, Angus escapes and returns to the lake, where Crusoe, now a full-grown adult, encourages Angus to ride on its back. After some time, it begins to dive underwater, coming to the surface from time to time for breathing. Angus, having [[aquaphobia]], protests diving, but later enjoys himself (finally overcoming his phobia of the sea).  Captain Hamilton takes the MacMorrow family to Loch Ness to impress Anne; Crusoe suffers from shock after almost getting hit by an exploding shot from a [[cannon]] ("Victoria") shot on the lake during a firing demonstration. Angus interrupts to save Crusoe from injury or death, but enrages Hamilton and irates his mother in the process. Angus is confined to his room for a month as punishment for acting out for his apparent [[imaginary companion]] and interrupting the demo.  Two old fishermen who previously saw Crusoe, attempt to take a photo of the creature for fame and fortune. When they realize that they won't be able to photograph the real thing thanks to the firing of the cannon called Victoria by the soldiers, they decide to create an imitation. (The result is the real-life faked picture of The Loch Ness Monster known as "[[The Loch Ness Monster#"Surgeon's Photograph" (1934)|The Surgeon's Photo]]".) The photo piques the interest of a few soldiers, who venture out on the lake at night to hunt it.  Kirstie, Angus's sister lets him sneak out of his room and to the lake. When Angus calls for Crusoe, he rises but is still in shock from the earlier bombardment, out of fear and rage, he nearly bites off Angus's hand before sinking back into the loch. Angus blames this on Lewis for letting him free. Churchill, having caught Crusoe's scent at the shore where he tried to reconcile with Angus, alerts the soldiers of its presence; Crusoe surfaces, only this time he has the advantage in size. Sergeant Strunk notices that the barking suddenly stops where it is presumed that Crusoe devoured Churchill. The surprise attack proves futile for the soldiers, as Crusoe easily flips over and capsizes their boat. Angus attempts to calm Crusoe down and wades into the lake where he loses his footing and sinks. Crusoe comes to Angus' rescue and saves his life. When his mother arrives, she finally believes in her son when she sees Crusoe. However, guns from the nearby artillery battery open fire upon Crusoe, mistaking it for a German U-Boat. Angus, Captain Hamilton, Anne, and Lewis all lead Crusoe to safety at the net. Crusoe attempts to jump over the anti-submarine net but instead crushes it with its weight and escapes into the sea from the lake.  At sunrise with his mother, Angus finally accepts his father's death as they watch Crusoe's departure from afar in the open sea. It is implied that Anne is also ready to move on, having fallen in love with Lewis, himself an honorably discharged veteran (whom Hamilton earlier accused of being a spy, deserter, or coward, arrogantly considering himself a superior suitor and father figure).  Over the years after Crusoe's departure, several people claim to have seen it, but Angus never saw it again. The tourists thank the old storyteller and ask for his name, which he reveals to be Angus MacMorrow. Outside the pub, a mother calls out to her son, who is walking down the beach and spots a rock, which has an iridescent shell beneath just like Crusoe's, hinting that Crusoe has died, leaving a descendant behind to become the next Water Horse.

But when he is later told that Uday and Majnu are mobsters, he quickly takes his family and flees to Sun City, South Africa to escape. However, Majnu and Sanjana have come to Sun City as well. Rajiv meets Sanjana again and the two fall in love.  Dr. Ghunghroo reconciles with Uday and Majnu and finally agrees to the alliance. Uday and Majnu invite a powerful don of the underworld, RDX ([[Feroz Khan (actor, born 1939)|Feroz Khan]]) to the engagement. At the party, a girl named Ishika ([[Malika Sherawat]]) arrives, claiming to be Rajiv's childhood betrothed. Ishika is actually the sister-in-law of Dr.Ghunghroo whom Dr. Ghunghroo asked to come and try to break off the engagement. Ishika manages to do so, leaving Rajiv and Sanjana heartbroken. Dr. Ghunghroo reveals that he did this for Rajiv's mother, who had married into a crime family and was harassed and tortured, thus telling Dr. Ghunghroo to raise Rajiv away from crime when he was born. Dr. Ghunghroo decides he will agree to the marriage only if Uday and Majnu give up their life of crime. Rajiv and Sanjana do this by reawakening Uday's love for acting and encouraging Majnu to pursue his love for painting. With these things keeping them busy, Uday and Majnu have no time for crime any more.  Rajiv's actions anger RDX's son, Lucky, who attempts to shoot Rajiv. Sanjana gets hold of the gun and fires a shot that hits Lucky, causing him to go unconscious. RDX is informed of his son's death and comes to attend the cremation. However Lucky, who is still alive, escapes, trying to show his father that he's actually alive. RDX sets the pile of wood on fire, believing he is cremating his son's body. However Lucky, who had been hiding under the wood, jumps out upon realising the wood is on fire, and the truth is revealed to RDX. Rajiv, Ghunghroo, his wife, Ishika, Uday, Majnu and Sanjana are captured by RDX and brought to a cabin set next to a cliff. The frightened group is forced to play ''Passing the Parcel'' (Hot Potato) with a globe—but the one who ends up with the globe must jump off the cliff. When Rajiv refuses to pass the globe to Sanjana, Lucky angrily yanks it out of his hands, just as the music stops. Now that his son has the globe, RDX figures the only way he can maintain his image is by killing everyone. Before he can, several government brokers sneak up and cut the footings of the cabin, causing the house to start falling over the cliff, with everyone trapped inside. However, the cabin is suspended by only one column. Hilarious chaos ensues as the group tries to balance the cabin together and keep it from falling off the cliff. Rajiv finds a rope and the group uses it to get back onto stable ground. But to everyone's shock, the floor breaks and Lucky is found hanging on the edge of the cabin. While Rajiv is trying to rescue him, Sanjana reveals the truth to everyone that she was the one who shot Lucky, but Rajiv blamed himself so that Sanjana wouldn't get in trouble. After Rajiv rescues Lucky, the cabin he is standing on falls off into the cliff. Sanjana keeps crying for him thinking he is dead. However, Rajiv survives the event and is reunited with Sanjana and his family. Lucky and RDX are grateful to Rajiv for saving their lives and RDX gives up his life of crime, allowing Rajiv and Sanjana to finally get married. However, when they realise the that Ishika fooled them alongwith Rajiv, as a part of his plan to marry Sanjana, they decide to kill him. But Rajiv ends up running away with Sanjana and Ishika with Majnu and Uday on the run after him.

What We Do Is Secret (film)
 [[Darby Crash|Jan Paul Beahm]] ([[Shane West]]) grows up in [[Los Angeles]] through a troubled childhood; he does not know his biological father, his mother is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], and his older brother dies from a [[heroin]] overdose. He is an avid reader and develops into a "frighteningly intelligent" student at [[University High School (Los Angeles, California)|University High School]], where his [[antisocial behavior]] leads the administration to give him [[Academic grading in the United States|straight A’s]] if he agrees not to return. In December 1975, at age 17, he proposes to his friend [[Pat Smear |Georg Ruthenberg]] ([[Rick Gonzalez]]) that they start a band, showing him potential lyrics and claiming to have a "five-year plan" inspired by the [[David Bowie]] song "[[Five Years (David Bowie song)|Five Years]]". They recruit Terri Ryan ([[Bijou Phillips]]), [[Belinda Carlisle]] ([[Lauren German]]), and Becky Barton ([[Amy Halloran]]) for the group and [[confidence trick|con]] money for instruments. Jan Paul comes up with the name [[Germs (band)|Germs]], representing the [[germination]] of an idea. He sings while Georg plays [[guitar]], Terri plays [[bass guitar]], and Becky plays [[drum kit|drums]].  The Germs play their first gig on April 16, 1977. As they are heckling [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]] outside the [[Whisky a Go Go]], Claude "Kickboy Face" Bessy ([[Sebastian Roché]]) of ''[[Slash (fanzine)|Slash]]'' magazine suggests that they perform at an [[open mike|open mic]] across the street. the Germs give an impromptu performance of their song "Sex Boy", but do not know how to play their instruments and are heckled by the audience. Jan Paul responds by throwing [[flour]] at them and dipping the microphone in [[peanut butter]]; the band is thrown out but excited by the experience. Jan Paul comes up with [[pseudonym]]s for the members: Georg becomes Pat Smear, Terri becomes Lorna Doom, and Becky becomes Donna Rhia, while Belinda bows out of the band. Jan Paul renames himself Bobby Pyn, but soon changes this to Darby Crash. Becky is soon kicked out and the band goes through a series of replacements. Chris Ashford ([[Keir O'Donnell]]) becomes their manager and presses their "Forming" [[single (music)|single]], the first [[punk rock]] single from Los Angeles.  At [[The Masque]] the Germs meet Don Bolles ([[Noah Segan]]), who becomes their new drummer. Darby also meets Rob Henley ([[Ashton Holmes]]), and the two begin a [[homosexuality|homosexual]] relationship.

The Germs build an audience at The Masque and advance to larger venues, playing a chaotic show at the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Roosevelt Hotel]] on October 31, 1978. Tensions mount between Don and Rob over the band's direction, and Darby and Rob begin experimenting with heroin. The Germs appear on [[Rodney Bingenheimer]] ([[J. P. Manoux]])'s radio program and convince ''Slash'' to fund their album, ''[[(GI)]]''. Tensions rise as Rob convinces Darby that Don's drumming is not fast enough, and when a woman named Amber ([[Missy Doty]]) begins doting on Darby and declares herself his manager.  Darby's heroin use increases, as does violence at the Germs' shows, and they are banned from most clubs in Los Angeles. Darby is upset to learn that Don has started a [[side project]].

He enlists Pat for his [[Darby Crash Band]], then organizes a Germs "farwell show" at the [[Starwood (nightclub)|Starwood]] in December 1980 with Pat, Lorna, and Don. The show goes well, with Darby telling the crowd "This is for the people who wanted to know what it was like when we were around. But this is the only one; you're not gonna see this again".

Whatever Lola Wants (film)

After a friend encourages her to perform at a local restaurant, Lola captures the attentions of the handsome Zack ([[Assaad Bouab]]). Lola follows after him, but is crushed to find that Zack is to marry someone of his family's choosing.

As Lola's career takes off, she manages to help reunite the two former lovers before returning to New York in order to take the art she loves to her fellow Americans.  
When Nietzsche Wept
 The film opens with the Russian-born novelist—who eventually became a member of Freud's 'Vienna Circle'-- [[Lou Andreas-Salome]] ([[Katheryn Winnick]]) who had an unconsummated (Platonic) 'love affair' with German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche ([[Armand Assante]]), and to whom he allegedly proposed in 1882 (although whether her claims are true is very much up for debate) writing a letter to Dr [[Josef Breuer]] ([[Ben Cross]]), after hearing of his newly developed [[talking cure]] (Breuer was a friend of [[Sigmund Freud]] ([[Jamie Elman]]), who also appears in the story, and one of the influential fathers of [[psychoanalysis]].). The two meet, and a reluctant and troubled Breuer agrees to Salome's plan; to cure the intense [[migraine]] attacks that plague Nietzsche, and at the same time, without his knowing, cure the despair that her refusal of marriage has inflicted upon him.  Salome has persuaded [[Franz Overbeck]] (Nietzsche's friend) to send him to Breuer, however, Nietzsche offers no support to Breuer, so the course of treatment must end. In a chilling parallel, an encounter with a mistreated horse causes Nietzsche to redeem his appointment with Breuer (Nietzsche finally went mad after stopping a man from whipping a horse using his own body, before breaking down in tears and descending into [[insanity]]). Nietzsche later visits a [[whorehouse]], where he has another attack of migraine, exacerbated by the overuse of a [[narcotic|sleeping draught]]. Nietzsche decides that he will, instead of pursuing treatment, leave for [[Basel]]. Meanwhile, an up-and-coming psychologist Sigmund Freud, friend of Josef and [[Mathilde Breuer]], suggests that if Breuer was to make some confession to Nietzsche, he may stop seeing any positive sentiment shown as being a bid for power, and indulge in confessions of his own.  So, the next time they met, Breuer makes the suggestion that, while he treats Nietzsche's body, Nietzsche must "treat" Breuer of the despair that he feels after falling in love with one of his patients, [[Bertha Pappenheim]] (played by [[Michal Yannai]]), otherwise known as [[Anna O.]], a famous case which was discussed in a joint book by Breuer and Freud, later on.  The confessions lead to the two becoming open with each other, learning each other's way of life and finally the two becoming friends, but not before the film has explored a great deal of Nietzsche's philosophy and Breuer's psychoanalysis. Breuer's anguish over his supposed unhappiness is explored by means of his highly symbol-laden [[dream]]s, thus showing the importance of [[dream interpretation|interpretation]] as a stepping stone in what would constitute Freud's approach to psychoanalytic techniques.  The film is host to a variety of famous faces of the day; Josef and Mathilde Breuer, [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Lou Salome]], Sigmund Freud, [[Bertha Pappenheim]], [[Paul Rée]] as well as references to [[Franz Overbeck]], and the music of the composer, [[Richard Wagner]].  
White Noise: The Light
 After witnessing the murder of his wife and young son at the hands of Henry Caine ([[Craig Fairbrass]]), who then turned the gun on himself, Abe Dale ([[Nathan Fillion]]) is so distressed that he attempts to take his own life.  A [[near-death experience]] follows that leaves Abe with the ability to identify those who are about to die.  He acts on these [[premonition]]s to save three people from death, among them a nurse met during his recovery, Sherry Clarke ([[Katee Sackhoff]]).  Abe soon learns that Henry, before murdering Abe's wife and son, actually saved their lives.  Abe concludes that Henry also had the ability to see death.  Wanting to learn more about Henry, Abe visits his house only to learn that Henry survived his suicide.  Investigating further, Abe discovers the phenomenon of "Tria Mera", The Third Day, when Christ was resurrected.  Also on the third day the devil takes possession of the mortals who cheated death.  Abe concludes that three days after he saved their lives, those he saved will be [[demonic possession|possessed]] and compelled to take the lives of others.  Accepting this responsibility, Abe comes to terms with the horrible fact that he must consider killing those he had saved to prevent further tragedy.  Abe tries unsuccessfully to prevent the second man he saved from killing others, but arrives just a minute too late. Abe is able however to take the gun from the man before he kills himself. Abe tries to explain the situation to Sherry but she is at first non-receptive and he must follow her to the cafe where his wife and son were murdered. While driving he sees his own aura in the rear view mirror. This time,  Sherry listens but, just as Abe brings up the gun, police who are already in the cafe shoot him dead. Abe spends his last minutes trying to  convince Sherry she must kill herself before her own possession is complete. However, as she reaches for the gun the police pick it up and  she becomes hysterical and is put into an ambulance.  As the ambulance leaves, Sherry struggles against the demons inside her. Back at the cafe, Abe's life force leaves his body as a lightning  streak in pursuit of Sherry's ambulance vaulting from one utility post to the next. He reaches the ambulance and appears to Sherry as a  spectre of himself. He is able to comfort her before the demons possess her.  She acknowledges him and expires peacefully after he places  his hand over her heart.  Up ahead, the speeding ambulance is unaware of an accident blocking its path. An 18-wheel fuel tanker is disabled  and a commuter bus is stopped. Abe, still manifested as a ghostly spirit, appears on the street directly in front of the ambulance, causing  the driver to swerve, avoid the accident at the last minute and miss the tanker; thus, saving the people on the bus. Abe's mission  completed, he finally sees a bright white light in front of him with his family waiting in the distance and is able to move on. Back at  Blackmount County Asylum, Henry is tormented and driven further insane by the restless spirits of all the victims who died at the hands of  people he saved.

Where Are You Going Moshé?
 Mustapha is the manager of the only bar in the small town of Boujad, in Morocco. The Islamic authorities of the town are eager to close it because consumption of alcohol is prohibited to the Muslims, but they cannot do anything since the city is inhabited by a Jewish community. As long as there are customers who are allowed to consume alcohol, Mustapha is free to go on with his business. But when the Jews of Morocco are starting [[Aliyah|to immigrate to the new state of Israel]], and that the town is emptied of its Jewish community, Mustapha is terrorized about having to close his business.

Wind Chill (film)
 A female student ("the girl") at a Pennsylvania university uses the campus ride share board to find a ride home to [[Wilmington, Delaware]] for Christmas. She joins a male student ("the guy"), who is driving home to Wilmington. His older car is in poor condition, with the trunk full of his possessions as he has been kicked out of his apartment. It soon becomes apparent that she is arrogant and anti-social. He seems to know quite a lot about her, stating that they have a class together, although she has never noticed him.  They stop at an isolated gas station, where she hears him asking the clerk for directions, although he claimed to have driven the route many times. Setting off, he soon turns off the main highway down Route 606, a lonely snow-covered road through a wooded ravine which he claims is a short cut. She tells him to return to the main highway, but he refuses. Crosses, apparently on graves, can be seen on either side of the road.  As night falls, headlights come towards them in the middle of the road. The oncoming driver does not slow down, causing the guy to swerve, half burying their car in a snow drift. The guy observes that the oncoming car, which did not stop, has left no tire tracks in the snow.  While the guy walks back to the gas station, the girl sees a dark figure stagger past the car. She calls out, but it ignores her. The guy returns, saying the gas station is closed, but she does not think he has been gone long enough. Huddling in the car, the guy reveals that he had been watching her for some time. He lives ten minutes from campus, but saw her texting about the ride share in class, leading him to post the notice offering a ride to Wilmington.  They notice a number of black-clad figures walking past the car and call after them, but they do not stop. Their faces are white and dead-looking. The guy follows them up the slope into a ruined building where they disappear. He finds frozen corpses half buried in the snow inside and also a newspaper. Meanwhile, the girl sees the lone figure again and when she touches it, burning her hand, it turns round to reveal a bloated corpse.  They think help has arrived when a [[Pennsylvania Highway Patrol]] officer knocks on their window. He doesn't seem to understand their predicament, choosing instead to believe they were "parking". He takes the girl to the back of his patrol car, which is clearly not a modern vehicle. When he violently pushes her into the car, the guy hits the officer with a tire iron. They awaken, thinking it was all a dream, to find that the guy has the tire iron frozen to his frostbitten hands. The girl realizes that he was badly injured in the crash, and he admits that he did not reach the gas station because he started spitting up blood. The newspaper from the ruined building is dated 23 December 1953, telling of an accident in which a young couple and a police officer were killed when their cars crashed into a ravine on this road. Retired priests from a nearby home gave them the last rites. They realize that the officer is a ghost and the black-clad figures are the dead priests.  The officer keeps reappearing, always heralded by [[Brenda Lee|Brenda Lee's]] "[[Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree]]" on the car's radio. The girl drifts in and out of consciousness, becoming in her dreams the many other people the cop has killed. She uses the guy's telephone, from his trunk of belongings, to call for help from the junction box on a nearby telephone pole. She reaches 911, but is not sure they could hear her. Returning to the car, she finds that the guy has died.  A snow-plow driver knocks on the window. He puts her into his truck and the guy's body on the back. While driving he tells the girl that, in the early 1950s, a corrupt cop murdered people on this stretch of road and their bodies were never found. In 1953 he ran a young couple off the road, but lost control and also died in the ravine. Frequently, around this time of year, more people die on this road. In 1963, the priests were found frozen to death in their beds.  The plowman sees headlights and believes more help has arrivied. Instead, the ghostly cop runs them off the road. The truck is not stuck; but, despite the girl's pleas, the driver gets out to help the driver of the other car. The girl follows him and the pair see the two burning cars from 1953 down the ravine. They see the priests walk down to the trapped officer, but instead of helping him they pull the microphone from his police radio, leaving him to burn to death. His burned body crawls out and touches the plowman, who instantly freezes to death. She tries to start the truck, but the officer reappears. The ghost of the guy appears and hits him with a tire iron, saving her.  As dawn breaks, she awakes back in the car, with the guy's body next to her. There is no sign of the truck. The guy's ghost appears and leads her up the hill, through the ruined priests' home and to the gas station, where he disappears.  
Wild Hogs
 Doug Madsen ([[Tim Allen]]), Woody Stevens ([[John Travolta]]), Bobby Davis ([[Martin Lawrence]]) and Dudley Frank ([[William H. Macy]]) are four middle-aged [[Everyman|everymen]] living in a [[Cincinnati]] suburb who find themselves bored with the pace of daily life and lack of adventure. Doug is a [[dentist]] who has trouble impressing his son Billy ([[Dominic Janes]]); Dudley is a single [[computer programmer]] who is afraid to talk to women; Bobby is a henpecked plumber whose wife has made him return to work after having taken a year off to unsuccessfully write a book; and Woody is a [[wealth]]y [[lawyer]] married to a [[supermodel]]. They find escape from their daily routines on weekends by riding [[motorcycle]]s together posing as a [[biker gang]] called the "Wild Hogs".  One day, Woody finds out his wife is divorcing him thus leaving him [[bankrupt]]. He convinces his friends to go on a [[road trip]] on their bikes to [[California]]. After encountering several misadventures, they end up at a local bar, where they meet a much larger biker gang called the Del Fuegos, headed by Jack Blade ([[Ray Liotta]]). Jack calls the Wild Hogs "posers" and has his gang steal Dudley's bike after a bogus deal to exchange Dudley's bike for a new bike that is in fact used and derelict, forcing the men to leave with Dudley in a [[sidecar]] attached to Woody's bike.  Furious at their lack of respect, Woody returns to the Del Fuegos bar and retrieves Dudley's bike, cuts off their bikes' fuel lines in the process and fabricates a story to the other Wild Hogs of how he "negotiated" with them to return the bike. When the Del Fuegos hear the Wild Hogs riding back past the bar, they attempt to pursue them, only for the bikes to stall. Jack inadvertently drops his lit [[cigarette]] onto the ground, igniting the fuel leaking from the bikes which then causes the bar to explode. Woody, after witnessing the explosion from afar, convinces the others to keep riding. Eventually, the Wild Hogs run out of gas and end up stranded in the desert. They eventually push their bikes to [[Madrid, New Mexico]], where they stumble into a [[diner]] and help themselves to [[water]] and [[beer]] without paying. As a result, the townspeople first mistake them for Del Fuegos. When the Wild Hogs explain their actions, they learn that the Del Fuegos have been terrorizing the town frequently, while the local police force are unable to do anything to protect the town. Although Woody is still anxious about the Del Fuegos, the others convince him to stay in the town overnight. During their stay in the town, Dudley falls in love with Maggie ([[Marisa Tomei]]), the diner's owner. While out searching for the Wild Hogs, Jack's closest biker members Red and Murdock spot the group and report their location to Jack. Jack tells the pair not to hurt the Wild Hogs until he gets there, leaving them unable to fight back when Bobby spots and confronts the pair by splashing beer and spraying ketchup and mustard on their clothes before finally laying a low blow to Murdock, thus scaring off Red. The Wild Hogs are hailed as [[hero]]es amongst the town's residents and celebrate well into the night with the townspeople.  The next day, Woody persuades the others that they must leave, but their departure is ruined when the Del Fuegos arrive. Jack threatens to wreck the town unless the Wild Hogs pay for the damage done to their bar. Woody admits to the Wild Hogs what he really did to get Dudley's bike back as well as the real reason for the trip, angering the others. Jack and the rest of the Del Fuegos take over Maggie's diner, but when he threatens to burn it, Dudley confronts them and is captured and tied from a rope against a tree. The others attempt to rescue Dudley but fail. They then decide to fight  the Del Fuego gang letting Jack, Red, Murdock and a member trained in martial arts "Tiny" battle the group in a 4 on 4 fight but the Wild Hogs are repeatedly beaten up. The townspeople band together to battle the Del Fuegos, but just as Jack threatens to take on the rest of the town, Damien Blade ([[Peter Fonda]]), Jack's father and the founder of the Del Fuegos, arrives and stops the fight. Damien lectures Jack for letting four "posers" hold off an entire biker gang, questioning aloud just which side was the "posers". He also adds that the bar was merely an insurance scam and therefore was glad that the Wild Hogs destroyed it. Damien tells the Del Fuegos to leave town and ride the open road until they remember what riding is really about, mentioning as he leaves that Jack "takes after his mother". He then acknowledges the Wild Hogs by telling them his motto: "Ride hard, or stay home".  Doug and Bobby's wives arrive, and Doug reconciles with his son. Bobby's wife orders him to return with her, but he refuses and convinces her to let him finish the ride. The Wild Hogs leave and arrive in [[Southern California]], where everyone except for Dudley crashes into a surfboard while he laughs. During the credits, it is revealed that the Wild Hogs called ''[[Extreme Makeover: Home Edition]]'' to give the Del Fuegos a new bar. The Del Fuegos react in joy at their new bar while the Wild Hogs watch the event on TV.  
Why Did I Get Married?
  The four couples, who are also best friends, converge in a house in the mountains for a week-long retreat that has become their ritual of sorts to help work out their marital problems and ask the question "Why did I get married?". Though the couples have committed to being physically present for the week, some of them have not been emotionally present in their respective marriages for quite some time. The week is not planned out in a well-programmed sequence, so the events unfold somewhat spontaneously, beginning with their "adventures" in getting up to the mountain retreat.  * The first couple, over-worked Diane and ignored Terry, drive up together and argue most of the way because Dianne (a lawyer) refuses to stop working. She takes calls on her phone instead of talking to her husband Terry. * The second couple, over-the-top Angela and annoyed Marcus, take the train. Angela constantly argues with Marcus and anyone who dares to interrupt them. * The third couple is overweight Sheila and conceited Mike. Sheila has to get off the plane because of her weight and the requirement to purchase two seats so she drives the long distance in the snow, while her husband Mike continues flirting on the flight with Sheila's single friend, Trina. * The fourth couple is overly-perfect Patricia and depressed Gavin who arrive by limo cab. Their journey is not documented. However, right before they leave to go to the retreat, Gavin shows up to pick up Patricia at a lecture she was giving (she is the author of a book called "''Why Did I Get Married?''") and artlessly dodges a question about their own marriage.   Dianne falls asleep not long after arriving with her [[BlackBerry]]  close at hand and when her secretary calls while she is asleep, Terry tells the woman not to call them while they are on their vacation. When Patricia arrives, she goes up to wake Dianne while the men bond over the wine that Terry has poured for his wife. The sound of arguing signals the arrival of Angela and Marcus. When Mike arrives without Sheila, the other wives berate him and Trina for having left Shelia to drive alone. Sheila's husband shows clearly that he does not care for his wife at all. Her friends try to reach Sheila by phone but get her voice mail only.   Sheila is persistent to get to the retreat because she wants to make her marriage work. Providence leads her to Sheriff Troy Jackson's office. Due to the weather, the roads have been closed for the night and she has no choice but to spend the night in the office. That same night, Mike tiptoes, not unseen by Angela, to Trina's bedroom. Sheila arrives at the retreat house the following morning with Troy in tow. She introduces Troy to the others and tells them she has invited him to breakfast. Troy fast becomes a threat to Sheila's husband Mike, not because of Sheila, but because of Trina, with whom he is having an affair. Breakfast is a noisy affair with the arguing couples and Angela insulting Trina, the only single woman on the retreat, whom she instantly disliked.  Throughout the few days spent on retreat, there are spontaneous revelations. The infidelity of two of the husbands leads to a discussion by the men of the 80/20 rule.  This rule states that most men get 80% of what they need from a marriage yet they tend to go after the 20% that someone outside can provide for them because it appears to be more to them when it really isn't.   During a heated argument with Angela, Mike reveals several secrets the couples have been hiding from one another: Marcus had contracted an STD after he cheated on Angela with another woman, Dianne had her tubes tied after her daughter was born and didn't want a son and kept it a secret from Terry, and Gavin had criticized Patricia for not protecting their young son in a tragic car accident that killed him a year prior. Mike, whose secret was revealed that he cheated on Sheila with Trina, makes it clear he isn't attracted to his wife any longer. After all this, Angela reveals that she's the one who gave Marcus the STD after she slept with someone, then Marcus tries to choke Angela out of anger yelling how she's so evil. Mike then tells Sheila he wants a divorce, and she smashes a wine bottle over his head knocking him out.   All the couples suddenly decide they can't stay in the house any longer after all the secrets. Sheila checks into a local hotel to recover from the shock of her divorce and the realization that Mike has drained her bank account. She is in a depressed state when Troy goes to visit her. He takes her up to a mountain where she cries and mourns the loss of her love and the only life she knew.  The other couples head back home. Patricia and Gavin are barely speaking to each other because she was deemed "stupid" for not protecting their son in a tragic accident by Gavin; Patricia breaks down emotionally in his arms and eventually confesses that she was only trying to be perfect. They both agree to face the situation and soon reconcile. Angela and Marcus are still fighting, especially when Marcus' ex-girlfriend and baby mama, Keisha, shows up at Angela's salon, and disrespects her. Marcus finally stands up to both women, and manages to frighten Angela into realizing she is wrecking their life with her constant arguing by not showing up for a couple of days. Dianne and Terry fight again right before they leave the mountains because he had a paternity test done on their daughter, and later on Terry's birthday at their home; Terry moves out because Dianne forgot about his birthday and did not tell him about getting her tubes tied. Patricia meets up with Dianne and Angela, moping over their husbands, and gives them good counseling about the need to get back on track: making a list of both the good and bad things their husbands have done. The men drown all their sorrows in bottles.  In the mountains, Sheila settles into a new life at her new job at the general store owned by Troy's father and, while she realizes her own self-worth, the two bond. Angela cooks dinner for Marcus after finishing with her list, but he suspects she is trying to poison him. Eventually, they make up and set new conditions. Dianne goes to see Terry and begs him to come back after crying over her list. He plays with her head a little to get back at her, but they eventually reconcile as well.   Later, all the couples converge at a gala celebration for an award recently received by Patricia. Dianne, Patricia and Angela are shocked when Sheila arrives and introduces Troy as her husband and has successfully lost weight thanks to his help. Her very jealous ex-husband, Mike, although still with Trina, tries to weasel his way back into her good graces, but she tells him to go enjoy Trina as his "20", referring to the 80/20 rule. Patricia includes a confession of her love for Gavin, as well as a message of loving, respecting and trusting God in her acceptance speech.

Winx Club: The Secret of the Lost Kingdom
 The story begins on a snowy, foggy day. In the isolated snow peaks, a looming castle casts dark, imminent shadows on the ground.  Six cloaked figures appear, whom are none other than the Winx Club. Bloom and [[List of Winx Club characters#Protagonists|her friends]] are on a search for Bloom's birth parents, [[List of Winx Club characters#Planet of Domino|King Oritel]] and [[List of Winx Club characters#Planet of Domino|Queen Miriam]], with Bloom's belief that they are still alive. The girls are on their way to find Hagen, a blacksmith who forged the Sword of King Oritel, a magical sword with immense power that can never be separated from its rightful master, in hopes that he can sense the sword's power and trace it to Bloom's parents. The girls successfully sneak into Hagen's castle after an easy victory over his robot guards, and come face-to-face with Hagen, who believes they are intruders. [[List of Winx Club characters|Faragonda]] then arrives to ease Hagen, them being old friends. They return to Alfea to discuss the matter.  Bloom begs Hagen for his help in sensing the sword's power, but he admits that he is unfortunately unable to. Spirits plummeted, Bloom feels guilty for the effort her friends have put in when it had been hopeless the whole time, and runs off in [[crying|tears]] to avoid facing them out of shame and sadness. This is easy as most of the Alfea third-year fairies are graduating to become Guardian Fairies, after having earned their Enchantix powers. Due to Bloom's powers being incomplete, she is compelled to stay behind as she watches her friends graduate. Consoling herself with her pet rabbit Kiko and a new kitty friend named Purr, [[List of Winx Club characters#Specialists|Sky]]  comes to comfort her, encouraging her to continue her quest despite Hagen's words. They share a tender moment until a mysterious girl arrives, forcing Sky to leave in a hurry, although he promises Bloom that he will explain everything later.   The next morning, Bloom leaves for [[Earth]] to stay with her adoptive parents for the time-being. Though she seems happy, Mike can tell that Bloom is uncomfortable living on Earth, to which Vanessa agrees that she belongs more in the Magical Dimension. That night, Bloom has a [[Lucid dream|dream]] about [[List of Winx Club characters#Planet of Domino|Daphne]], who tells her that there is still hope; their parents are still alive and offers Bloom her strength. Daphne also informs her about the Book of Fate, a tome their father kept that tells the entire history of Domino, and its location.  In the morning, Bloom is surprised to see all of her friends, plus the boys, there to celebrate her 18th birthday. Not only are her spirits lifted, Bloom shares her plan and they all agree to help her, reminding her of their everlasting friendship. The restoration of Bloom's hope triggers the Sword of King Oritel, deep within the dark Obsidian Circle, the center of all Evil forces. Its glow troubles the spiritual forms of the [[List of Winx Club characters#Antagonists|three Ancestral Witches]], the culprits behind the destruction of Domino. They employ Obsidian's Keeper, [[List of Winx Club characters#Antagonists|Mandragora]], to root out the cause of the sword's reactivation and snuff it out like a candle, additionally imbuing Mandragora with a fraction of their dark powers.  Meanwhile, the team, lead by Bloom, head to Domino. Borrowing Daphne's mask, Bloom recalls Daphne's memories of when Domino was a paradise before it was covered with ice and snow. The group head towards the mountain where the book is hidden, but Tecna informs them of a mystical bird called the Roc that supposedly guards the library. The Specialists scale the mountain first but accidentally causes the Roc to awaken, who flies off with the boys hanging on for dear-life. The girls save the boys with Musa's harmonic spells and successfully allow the Roc to land. Inside the library, they meet [[List of Winx Club characters#Planet of Domino|Bartelby]], Oritel's deceased scribe in spiritual form, who shows them the Book of Fate. In it, they discover that Bloom's parents were part of a good warrior group known as the Company of Light, that served to eradicate Evil in the form of the three Ancestral Witches and that Oritel as well as all the people of Domino are currently trapped in the Obsidian Circle. However, the team finds the remaining pages empty after chronicling the Company of Light's battle with the Ancestral Witches, with no clue on the outcome. Bartelby then foretells a prophecy where six legendary warriors will save Domino, and that a king without a crown will free the Sword of King Oritel. As the team celebrates this new discovery, Riven is bitten by one of Mandragora's spy bugs and becomes her puppet.  Soon after, Alfea is attacked by Mandragora, who despite being defeated by Faragonda, Hagen, the teachers and the Winx, learns about Bloom and disappears, dutifully reporting about the second princess of Domino. Following Mandragora's defeat, the group begin searching for a way into the Obsidian Circle, which leads them to Pixie Village. With the help of Lockette, the team heads to the gateway to the Obsidian Circle. As the girls enter, Mandragora appears and forces Riven to battle Sky and retrieve the key, separating the girls and the boys. As he is about to stab Sky, Musa jumps in front of him and is injured.  The girls are forced to face their worst fears, and Bloom sees a vision of what happened to her birth parents: Oritel was pulled into the Obsidian Circle by the Ancestral Witches while Miriam absorbed herself into the sword in order to be with him. To Bloom's horror, sees her father frozen in stone, the same fate for all inhabitants of her planet. All the fairies then wakeup from their trances, only to come face-to-face with the Ancestral Witches, who severely weaken the Winx except Bloom. They force Bloom to make a choice between destroying the sword and saving her adoptive parents or taking the sword and letting Mandragora kill them, as seen in an image. Luckily, Bloom sees through the illusion and places her trust in the boys that they are still fighting Mandragora, unleashing her Dragon Fire. Outside, Riven recalls all what he and Musa have been through together. Regaining his sanity, he lifts her up and they kiss. Chasing after Mandragora, Sky then arrives moments later to aid her and takes the sword, but supposedly dies, as only a king can wield the sword.  Feeling all alone, Bloom is ready to give up when Daphne reminds her that she is not alone. Bloom wears the mask, and Daphne joins with her to destroy the Ancestral Witches. However, Mandragora returns and, using her body as a host, the Ancestral Witches begin to strangle Bloom to death. Sky reawakens and stabs Mandragora with Oritel's sword; with Bloom's Dragon Flame, destroying both her and the entire Obsidian Circle, freeing everyone. Sky explains he is now King of Eraklyon, and his coronation was the night he left Bloom at Alfea. With Domino restored to its former glory, Oritel is freed from stone, placing Miriam back in human form; Bloom's Enchantix is complete, and she is finally reunited with her birth parents.  There is a party afterwards where Oritel and Miriam promise Bloom that they will be around for the rest of her life. Mike and Vanessa are there too and Bloom hugs them affectionately. Oritel begins the traditional father-daughter dance, but lets Bloom dance with Sky, who proposes to her. Happier than ever, Bloom accepts and kiss him.  In the final scene before the credits, Bartelby appears by the Book of Fate, telling the audience that the prophecy has been fulfilled, Bloom is now a Guardian Fairy and there is a new Company of Light - the Winx. However, the Ancestral Witches have not been destroyed. Instead, they were freed with the destruction of the Obsidian Circle and are finding new hosts to take over and destroy the Winx. They are shown with their direct descendants, [[List of Winx Club characters#Antagonists|the Trix]], cackling madly. This is a cliffhanger leading to the [[Winx Club 3D: Magical Adventure|second movie]].  
The Witnesses
 It is the summer of 1984 in Paris. Sarah, a well-to-do writer of children’s books, and her working-class husband, Mehdi, an inspector of North African descent, are confronting some marital problems after the recent arrival of their first child. Sarah, stumbling over a bout of writer's block, has little maternal instinct towards their newborn baby, whose cries she tunes out with earplugs while she works. Her husband despairs when she neglects the child, does what he can to fill in, and sometimes parks the child with his parents. The couple have an open marriage and both are allowed to take outside lovers in a “don’t ask, don’t tell” arrangement that seems to work, although not without tensions.  Meanwhile, Sarah’s close friend Adrien, a middle-aged gay doctor, meets Manu, a carefree young man, at a cruising ground. Manu is not sexually attracted to Adrien and they do not have sex, but strike an emotional friendship. Manu is happy with the friendship and becomes Adrien’s companion and his student of life’s finer things. Wildly in love with his shallow, narcissistic protégé, Adrien is shrewd enough not to push too hard, but there is an element of masochism in his abject devotion.  Manu, who has recently arrived to Paris from a provincial town in the south of France, shares a space with his sister Julie, while she struggles to affirm herself as an opera singer. They live in a cheap hotel that is a center of prostitution. This does not bother Manu, and he has a friendly relationship with Sandra, a prostitute. The hotel is under scrutiny by Mehdi, who leads the police force’s vice division. Through Adrien, Manu meets Sarah and Mehdi. The group of friends get together at Sarah’s mother’ summerhouse in the Calanques of Marseille. One afternoon, when Mehdi and Manu go swimming in a remote cove, Mehdi saves Manu from drowning and, while tugging him to shore and administering mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, becomes aroused. Later, when Manu makes a pass at Mehdi, he responds, and they embark on a secret, no-strings-attached love affair. They meet at the holiday camping site outside Paris, where Manu now works as a cook.  When Manu confesses to Adrien that he has been having sex with Mehdi, Adrian is furious and hits Manu. After the fight, Adrian discovers spots on Manu's skin; it turns out that he has AIDS. Sarah tries to write a novel, and as a result Mehdi leaves temporarily to stay at his parents with the baby. Adrien becomes a leader in a medical crusade against AIDS, while meanwhile privately taking on Manu's treatment. Mehdi also does not shun his friend when he hears the news, although he is terrified that he has AIDS and cannot bring himself to tell his wife. He wants to see Manu, but Manu does not want to see him in the terrible state he is in. By contrast, Adrien is safe as his relationship with Manu was more companion-based than sexual.  Desperate to see his former lover, Mehdi forces his way into the camping site. Manu shows him his gun, with which he will commit suicide when his illness gets worse. Mehdi secretly takes it with him and throws it in the [[Seine]]. Mehdi is relieved that he has not been infected. Sarah has not been infected either and they reconcile. Manu’s health deteriorates and he commits suicide with pills supplied by Adrien for this purpose. Julie and Adrien take Manu's body to be buries in his native village to his grieving mother.  Before he passes away, Manu uses a tape recorder to dictate his life for others to hear of. Sarah is inspired by the events as they have transpired so far and, once he is gone, listens to the tapes and begins writing a tale (for grown-ups) of it. She is free of her writer's block. Medhi is a bit concerned his life will become gossip, but Sarah assures him she has changed the names in the story. Julie decides to move to Munich, Mehdi and Adrien make amends while Sandra is HIV positive.  The following summer, Sarah, Mehdi, Adrien and his new companion Steve, a young American, return to the summerhouse on the Riviera to celebrate Sarah and Medhi's child's birthday.

Wraiths of Roanoke
 The film opens with a 16th-century island colony in [[Virginia]]. A settler is running towards the colony, but is locked out and killed by a ghostly figure. The only other settler left in the colony, frightened, locks himself in one of the buildings and hangs himself. English settlers arrive by ship at [[Roanoke Island]] with an [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] escort. When the settlers arrive, they find the colony abandoned by the previous occupants, except for one body. They find a corpse hanging from a rope inside a small building, with the door bolted from the inside. The English governor sent with the settlers dismisses this as an intimidation tactic by the Spanish. The governor is forced to return to England to gather supplies, and names settler Ananias Dare ([[Adrian Paul]]) interim governor, backed with the strong arm of George Howe (Rhett Giles). That evening, Ananias's pregnant wife Eleanor Dare (Frida Show) is sleeping, when suddenly, she has a gruesome dream that her [[nightgown]] is covered in blood, with her baby taken from her womb. She runs out into the middle of the town square, and finds a ghost with her baby. She wakes up deeply shaken, and warns Ananias that it might be better for them to return to England. He dismisses this, but settlers begin dying in the woods one by one. Eleanor mysteriously gives birth prematurely, but the baby girl, whom they name Virginia, is thankfully born safely. Crops won't grow in the island's soil, and there are no animals in the forest. More settlers begin dying, and it soon becomes apparent that there is a supernatural presence on the island.  Eleanor continues to get disturbing dreams, and eventually the dreams reveal that the island was the location of a brutal execution of an innocent woman and a few other men by [[Viking]]s. Long before, a ship of Viking warriors suffered misfortune and blamed it on one of the women and a few of the men traveling on the ship with them. They took them to the island and tortured them to death, and because of this the souls of the evil Viking men and the other men and the single woman are still trapped on the island in a state between life and death. Ananias Dare must work with a local Indian chief and his own townspeople to find a way to send the evil wraiths out of this world and into hell where they belong.  In time, one of the colonists leads an attack on the Indian village, only to be repelled and most of the men killed; for ruining the English's chances of gaining the Indians' trust, he is put in the stocks. Later that night, the wraiths suck out his soul and begin an attack on the colonists; they are fought back, but many colonists are killed. It is soon revealed that these wraiths feed on the souls of the living and are trying to kill Virginia because they require an innocent soul to pass on to the afterlife; it is also learned that their weaknesses are fire and water (water being a symbol of life). They are soon forced to devise a plan to defeat the wraiths; they set up a raft with a pile of wood and hay on it and wait for the moon to come. The wraiths arrive at night and due to a colonist panicking, they begin attacking them. In time, only Eleanor, Ananias, Virginia, and Howe are the only survivors. Unfortunately, Eleanor attacks one of the wraiths in an attempt to save Ananias but is quickly killed. After a few minutes, Howe and Ananias are mortally wounded, with the latter luring the wraiths onto the raft with baby Virginia. As they close in on Ananias and Virginia, Howe launches a fire arrow onto the raft, setting it aflame; as the wraiths cannot cross water, they are forced to suffer. Ananias looks at Virginia one last time before setting her adrift and dying. Later on, Virginia is found by the Indians and is to be raised as one of their one; Manteo orders the tribe to bury the colonists and set their colony on fire.

  A [[Magician (illusion)|magician]] named Montag the Magnificent puts on elaborate magic shows in a dilapidated post-punk Los Angeles in which he seemingly kills, in brutal torturous fashions, beautiful young women who nevertheless appear alive and unharmed at the end of the trick. Later, however, the victims are found dead of the same wounds that Montag gave them. Ed Bigelow, a young [[Journalism|journalist]] with a [[trust fund]] and [[Vintage clothing|vintage]] style, tries to solve the mystery, but ends up discovering that he may be more involved than he first thought.  
World Builder (film)
 The film begins with the words "Program Start." In a [[green room]], a young man is lying on his back and looking at [[holographic]] pictures of himself and a young woman, presumably his wife (as we see a wedding ring on his hand). All of a sudden, a holographic timer appears on his arm, letting him know that something will happen in one hour. Closing the pictures, he stands up and gets to work.  Using a [[computer program]], he begins to make a row of tall [[box]]es. Once the first row is made, he makes a copy and puts the copy of the row of boxes across from the first. He then gets to work on adding details to each box. He adds columns, doors, and windows. Once done, he works on the appearances of the boxes to make them look like [[building]]s. He adds color and then some [[nature]]. He pays particular attention to a yellow [[flower]]. Soon, with time running out, he hastily finishes the details and hide in a doorway when the timer stops.  With time up, the boxes no longer look like [[computer model]]s but actual buildings. A door opens and the young woman from the pictures, dressed in a [[hospital gown]], emerges. She is astonished by what she sees. She walks down the [[street]], looking at the buildings and their details. Watching from his doorway, the man realizes that he forgot to do one building and it looks like a model from a computer program. He prays that she doesn't see the building. She comes his way and he hides, watching her look at the yellow flower and smile lovingly. She leaves the street with a final look back. Once she is gone, he emerges and watches his world that he created dematerialize into a new picture. It shows the woman smiling at the flower. Choking back tears, he kisses her picture. The screen goes dark, showing the words "Program Ends".  In a holographic recovery room, the young man enters. The young woman is lying on the bed, in a [[coma]] and hooked up to machines to monitor her progress. He kisses her forehead and drops into a glass of water the very flower she admired in the computer program.

XXY (film)
 Alex Kraken is a 15-year-old intersex person, born with both male and female genitals, who has been living and presenting herself as female and using medicines to suppress [[masculine]] features, such as a [[beard]], and to attempt to have more [[feminine]] features. At the time of the movie, Alex has recently stopped taking her medication without telling her parents, which will cause her masculine features to begin to develop more.  Alex's parents moved with her from [[Argentina]] to a village by the sea in [[Uruguay]], to avoid the society's discriminatory views and strict gender expectations. They wanted to help shelter her from bullying she was experiencing. Her father, Néstor Kraken, is a [[marine biologist]] who has written a book on sexuality and makes a living treating wounded animals found by fishermen. Her mother, Suli, invites friends from Argentina: a surgeon, his wife and teenage son Álvaro. The purpose, unknown to Néstor and Alex, is to discuss the possibilities of [[sex reassignment surgery]], with Suli quietly hoping that Alex will decide to be female and go through with a surgery in the beginning.  The introduction of the relationship between Alex and Álvaro further complicates the drama of the movie. When Alex asks Álvaro directly if he would like to have sex, she is initially denied, but Álvaro later follows her from the beach and she seduces him. She begins to have [[Anal intercourse#Homosexual|anal intercourse]] with him (with her as the penetrative partner), and while Álvaro is surprised he does not stop Alex. Nestor catches sight of them through the door and they stop, and Alvaro rushes out feeling conflicted and still in a panic at the unexpected reversal in sexual roles. When Alex later apologizes, Álvaro reveals that he liked it and has no bad feelings towards her.  This scene opens the dialogue for the audience about gender roles and allows both characters, Alex and Álvaro, a chance to question their own identities and desires. Álvaro is raised by fairly conservative parents, and towards the end of the movie his father even expresses the desire that he hoped his son was not gay. However, Álvaro begins to question himself because he enjoyed the sexual experience with Alex even though Alex was performing anal sex on him. He is exploring his own gender and sexual identity within the confines of his parent's expectations, which contrasts with Alex's character who receives her parent's support about her situation.  At the same time, Alex is questioning her own decisions about her identity and is confronted with frustration at her own body and the limitations placed on her by society. After her father walks in on the sexual experience between his daughter and Alvaro, he realizes his child is now old enough to make her own decision about her life and her sexual identity, and seeks advice from a transgender man that he had read about in newspapers years before. The man expresses his appreciation that Alex's parents chose not to make the decision for her at birth by "castrating" her, and allowed her to make her own decision now. Alex's father is comforted by this conversation and returns to Alex recognizing that she is older now and must make her own decision.  Later in the movie, three boys from the village sexually assault Alex by forcibly pulling down her pants to see her genitals. Alex is embarrassed and ashamed by this encounter, perpetrated by the friends of Vando, her ex-friend and likely former romantic partner. Néstor realizes that reporting this to the police would cause the whole village to know about Alex's condition. However, Alex decides that it does not matter. Alex also decides that she does not want to resume taking medicines or have an operation. When asked by her father whether she wanted to choose to be either male or female, Alex replies "What if there is nothing to choose?".  Throughout the film there are multiple acknowledgements of the audience's curiosity about Alex's genitals. This is seen through the actions of other characters on screen, most notably the group of boys who assault Alex while she is on the beach. At the end of the film, Álvaro and his family are getting ready to board the boat to take them back to Buenos Aires. There is still tension between them after their last encounter in the woods. Álvaro walks away from his family to go sit behind a sea wall on the beach with Alex for a few moments. He shows her that he has started wearing the turtle tag that she had given him previously. He asks if he will ever see her again, and she tells him that she does not think that he will. They each admit to having fallen in love with each other, but when Alvaro tries to kiss Alex she pushes him away. Scarred from her experience on the beach with the three boys, she asks him if he regrets not seeing her again or not getting to see "it" more. She pushes down her pants to show Álvaro her genitals, and the audience watches at Álvaro as he looks at Alex. The camera lingers on Álvaro's face as he looks at Alex's genitals and the audience is made aware that state of Alex's genitals will not be made known to them. Álvaro's father grabs him and Alex sits against the wall for a few moments crying before she returns to her family.  The ending shot is of Alex and her family leaving their guests at the boat and walking down the boardwalk. Alex grabs her father's hand and slings it across her shoulder before the camera pans to a shot of the ocean, focusing on the distant transitioning line between the sky and sea.  
Yaaruku Yaaro
 The story opens as Deepa (Varnika), a medical college student, sings a song during the cultural festival. She is being surrounded by lush green fields and mountains but the college, or even the stage for that matter, is nowhere in sight. The next scene shifts to three robbers, ogling at Deepa. She is on her way to sit for her college examinations. But while wheeling her punctured scooter (Scooty), the robbers snatch her chain and escape on a bike. In comes hero David (Sam Anderson) on a scooter (Kinetic Honda) who does a chase after them. He returns empty-handed and recognizes Deepa from the college function earlier. He praises her amazing vocal skills and gives his gold crucifix chain as a gift. Deepa refuses, but David then gives a sermon about [[Hindu]]-Christian difference. Yet, she still does not accept it. David also gives his 'stepnee' (spare) tyre to Deepa (God knows how a Kinetic Honda spare wheel could fit into a Scooty Pep's wheel drum). This incident is one of the most important scenes in the movie.  The next day, David goes to Deepa's house. He overhears Deepa singing a devotional song and stands mesmerized by her voice. He asks Deepa to return his tyre. Deepa informs him that her scooter has been sent for service. David also impresses her mother with his gentlemanly manners which clearly failed to impress the audiences. The scene then shifts to David's confrontation with the robbers who also happen to be the accomplices of his father's best friend ([[Venniradai Moorthy]]). David starts a sermon about the greatness of the [[crucifix]] and gives it to the robbers for cleansing their sins. The robbers have a dramatic change of heart and praise David as their savior. They also give back the chain they stole from Deepa during the beginning of the film.<ref></ref> Deepa learns that David is an automobile engineer and visits his workshop, and sees "high-end models" specifically designed by David. David then returns Deepa's chain that he had got from the robbers. He also presents the crucifix along with her chain. David and Deepa then fall in love. Deepa's mother is concerned that her daughter might be tricked into love by David. Deepa consoles her and praises David's manners.  Meanwhile, the robbers turn over a new leaf and begin to work in David's workshop. The mechanics then prod David to tell them about his affair with Deepa. David blushes. As luck would have it, Deepa's father is a car showroom owner. Deepa takes David to her father the next day. David then proposes his idea, but Deepa's father scoffs at it, leaving David heart-broken. David then requests for a car poster (which is of a [[Ferrari F50]]) that is posted on the office wall. Deepa's father tells him it is the new customer car that is to be sold in the (Hyundai?)showroom and refuses. David then leaves the office, dejected. Deepa gets at angry at her father for his treatment of David and rushes out to console him.  The next scene shows David back in his workshop with his mechanics. They console him and make a plan to ask for loan from the moneylender ([[Venniradai Moorthy]]). Meanwhile, Deepa's father expresses his fear to his wife about Deepa falling in love with David. The next day, David goes to the moneylender's house along with his faithful mechanics to ask for loan. Moorthy also promises to help him out by agreeing to fund for two of his model cars. David and Deepa then meet at a beach and break into a song (Raasathi)where David's luscious shoulder movements really captivated the audience. Deepa's looks were equally as good as David's dancing.  The next day, Moorthy visits David's workshop but upon seeing the reality, changes his mind and refuses to lend money to David. David is heart-broken but Deepa visits him and consoles him. She presents the Ferrari poster to him and asks him to marry her. She also plans to use her 500,000 rupees (that happens to be her inheritance) to help David out. Soon, David's birthday comes up and Deepa plans a big surprise for him. But everyone is in for a huge surprise as Manju (Jothi), comes from Canada to visit David. She sees David cutting the cake alone and joins him. David is happy to see her and says, "My God, how beautiful you are!". We learn that Manju was David's sweetheart during their college days but had a fall-out because Manju went to Canada to pursue her career. She also says that she came back to India to take David with her to Canada. David then has a duet sequence with Manju for some unexplained reasons. Deepa suddenly enters the room and gets angry at David for flirting with another woman. She leaves the room fuming. David tries to stop her but she doesn't listen. At this point of the movie, most of the audience would've concluded that both girls would've been wooed by David's talent in dancing.  Manju takes David out for lunch and learns about his life after college and his new love Deepa. She gets angry at him for not treating Deepa properly. But she also feels sorry for him and soon falls prey to his (charms?). The Raasathi song is shown again but this time with Manju instead of Deepa. Manju asks David to marry her and plans their migration to Canada. She then asks David to forget Deepa and give back her 500,000 rupees. David then asks for advice from his faithful sidekicks. He then visits Deepa surrounded by a stunning landscape and asks for her forgiveness. Deepa gets angry with his behavior and scorns at him. Wounded, David comes back to his sidekicks who advise him to jump for Manju instead. David then goes to Manju seeking refuge. Manju initially gets angry that David had not returned the check but then suddenly declares her love for him and starts yet another duet sequence. David and Manju stop their car in No-Man's Land and plan to go to the airport from there. Out of nowhere, Deepa suddenly appears there on her Scooty. This is the film's climax. Deepa accuses David that he used her just like the stepnee tyre that was shown in the beginning. David then explains that he never used her but always thought of her as his stepping stone to success (Vazhkaiyil Ovvoru Steppum Nee, Steppu Nee, Steppu Nee, Steppu Nee). Deepa refuses to be consoled and gives back the gold crucifix chain to David. She then leaves the place with sorrow. Manju gets angry with David again. She asks David to give the chain to whomever he likes. David then puts the chain around Manju's neck. Manju takes it as the holy 'mangalsutra', and says that she is now all his. David and Manju circle the car by which they came, three times. This scene symbolically indicates that the marriage of David and Manju has been made in heaven, marked by the circling of the holy fire thrice in actual marriages. The next scene shows a (Cargo) airplane taking off, presumably with David and Manju inside it, for Canada.

Year of the Dog (film)
 Shannon stars as Peggy, a forty-something administrative assistant whose social and love life are slim to nil. Her most intimate bond is with her dog, Pencil. One morning Pencil refuses to come in after being let out to do his business, and a half-awake Peggy lets him stay outside overnight. The next morning she finds him in the yard of her neighbor Al ([[John C. Reilly]]) whimpering in pain. She takes him to a vet but it is too late; Pencil dies of toxic poisoning.  The people in her life react with sympathy but mostly make her feel guilty for her grief. Best friend Layla ([[Regina King]]) tells Peggy her relationship with Pencil had held her back from finding romance. Her emotionally sterile sister-in-law ([[Laura Dern]]) and brother Pier ([[Tom McCarthy (director)|Thomas McCarthy]]) are too self-absorbed to sense how deeply hurt Peggy is.  Peggy's neighbor, Al, asks Peggy on a date. It starts out well until Al reveals that he lost his own pet dog by accidentally shooting it in a hunting accident. When the two return to his home he shows off his knife collection and hunting trophies. He is oblivious to Peggy's distaste for this. She asks to see his garage, suspicious that something inside poisoned Pencil. Al makes a pass which she rejects in disgust.  Peggy gets a call from Newt ([[Peter Sarsgaard]]), a volunteer at the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] who was present when Pencil died. He tells Peggy he has a new dog she may like to adopt: Valentine, a [[King Shepherd]] with behavioral problems. Newt agrees to help train Valentine, and he and Peggy begin to spend a lot of time together.  Through Newt, Peggy is exposed to [[veganism]] and to [[animal rights]] information. She becomes a vegan and begins helping Newt to adopt out various animals slated for euthanasia. Chastised by her boss Robin ([[Josh Pais]]) for her commitment, she retaliates by donating to various animal-related charities from his checkbook.  Peggy and Newt share a kiss, Newt declining to go any further, which she mistakes for chivalry. She confesses she has fallen in love; Newt reveals that he is celibate, implying he is [[asexuality|asexual]]. Peggy reacts badly, shutting out Newt and instead focusing on her new relationship with Valentine. Valentine's sporadically violent behavior worsens without Newt's instruction; he bites Peggy's hand. The dog also continually barks, causing Al to complain. Peggy responds rudely, insinuating that it is her revenge because she thinks something in his garage must have poisoned Pencil.  Peggy's interest in animal rights deepens, particularly the causes to stop animal testing and of farm communities for animals who were previously meant to die. Her new belief system is looked at flippantly by her brother and sister-in-law; when she announces she is a vegan, he responds: "It will be interesting to see how long this lasts."  On New Year's Eve weekend Peggy agrees to babysit her brother's children. She leaves Valentine in the care of Newt. She takes her young niece Lissie (Amy Schlagel, Zoe Schlagel) and nephew Benji to a farm for rescued animals to introduce them to an "adopted" chicken (a charity sponsorship) she got them for [[Christmas]]. Intensely moved by the experience, Peggy has a mini-breakdown in the car. She wants to show them a slaughterhouse, but the children freak out.  Peggy gets drunk and discovers a rack of furs in her sister-in-law's closet. She tries them on in a bathroom and ultimately passes out drunk. Furs she left in the bathtub are ruined from the faucet's drip. She goes to Newt's to pick up Valentine and finds Newt weeping. Valentine killed a crippled dog named Buttons, and Newt sent Valentine to be put down because he knew Peggy did not have the fortitude to do so.  She rushes to the dog pound but is too late; Valentine has been dead for two hours. Peggy suffers a mental break and adopts 15 dogs slated to die; she lies, saying she works with the SPCA and intends to find them all homes. Peggy at work is confronted by her boss. He has discovered the fraudulent checks and she is fired.  Peggy's life falls apart. She barely leaves her home, which is practically destroyed by her new pets. Al complains, saying if she does not find a way to control them he will. While she is out, Newt visits, confiscates the dogs and leaves a warning notice from the SPCA. Peggy erroneously blames Al.  She sneaks into Al's house and finds [[molluscicide]] with a hole chewed into the corner, confirming her suspicions about Pencil's death. Zombie-like, she drags the bag through the house, leaking poison pellets everywhere. She takes one of Al's hunting knives and hides. When Al and a girlfriend return home, Peggy attacks with the knife. Al wrestles it away from her and calls the police.  Peggy's brother and sister-in-law try to help. They say Peggy's boss has decided if she pays back everything and goes to counselling he will rehire her. They ask why Peggy attacked Al. She says she wanted him to know what it felt like to be hunted.  Peggy returns to work and is greeted warmly. But soon an internet search leads her to information about an upcoming animal rights protest. She sends an email to her coworkers (including Layla), boss, Newt, brother and  sister-in-law. She must follow her soul. She abandons her former life and heads off to the protest, content that fighting for animals is her greater reason for living (as opposed to child-rearing, career, or intimate human relationships).

Yella (film)
 A withdrawn accountant, Yella, ([[Nina Hoss]]) arrives by train in her hometown. Yella's estranged husband, Ben, ([[Hinnerk Schönemann]]) is stalking her and offers her a ride home. She coldly declines and walks away. Yella visits with her father and tells him that she has found a job in Hannover, beginning the following morning. Despite his apparent poverty, he gives her a significant amount of money to help her transition in a new city.  The next morning, Yella waits for a taxi to take her to the train station. Ben arrives, insisting that he give her a ride instead. She reluctantly agrees. He talks to her about their relationship and his failing business agreements for the duration of the ride. He becomes angry and aggressive when she refuses to return to him. Despite her pleas, he will not let her out of the car and instead drives the vehicle off a bridge and into the river below. Both Ben and Yella escape from the car, with Yella leaving an unconscious Ben on the river's shoreline. She catches her train to Hannover.  Arriving at her hotel, Yella discovers she has no deposit for her room. She gives the hotel manager the cash from her father. That evening, as she eats dinner alone, a man, Philipp ([[Devid Striesow]]), asks her if she's interested in data sheets for businesses. She cooly declares that she is.  The following morning, Yella arrives at her new job. Dr. Otto-Schmidt, the man who hired her, is standing outside, talking to someone on his phone. He sees Yella and asks her to enter the building and bring him a small pigskin portfolio from his desk. She readily agrees, but upon arriving in his office, is confronted by a man who says Dr. Otto-Schmidt is no longer allowed on the premises. Yella manages to secure the portfolio anyway and hide it under her coat. She goes back outside to question Dr. Otto-Schmidt.  The doctor is evasive about what is going on and asks for the portfolio. He vaguely promises Yella another job, this time in Hamburg. Yella gives him the portfolio back, only for the doctor to make a crude pass at her. She abruptly leaves the car and walks back to her hotel, resigned to returning to her father's home in Wittenberge.  A few hours later, Philipp finds her open hotel door and sees her asleep. He wakes her and invites her to help him with a business deal. She accompanies him to his meeting where she reviews documents and quickly discovers falsified information. Philipp believes they can use this to their advantage and rewards her with 1,000 euro.  When Yella returns to her hotel room, she sees that someone has been in it: eating, watching television and resting in the bed. Yella sees Ben standing outside her window and runs outside to confront him. Ben attempts to kidnap her but relents upon hearing a noise and quickly walks away. Returning to the hotel, Yella sees Philipp and the businessman from the meeting earlier that day making a deal in Philipp's parked car. Philipp follows her to her room and asks for her help on another deal. In their next meeting, Yella displays an instinct for manipulation that impresses Philipp.  On their drive home from this meeting, Philipp gives Yella an envelope with 75,000 euro and some deposit slips, asking her to deposit the money for him. After making the deposit, the bank teller tells her that she gave him 25,000 euro more than necessary. She takes the extra money, planning to mail it somewhere before rejoining Philipp. As she prepares to send the envelope off, Philipp interrupts her. She joins him, but does not reveal the extra money. Philipp casually mentions, as they drive, that he knows about the extra 25,000. She returns it to him and Philipp angrily storms away. That evening, Yella considers returning home but instead talks to Philipp in his hotel room. She explains that she stole the money to send to Ben, who claimed he needed financial help until an airport was built in their town. She had hoped that the money would keep him from stalking her. Philipp discloses that there is no airport being built, that Ben must be manipulating her, and that he would like to keep working with her.  Following another successful meeting, Philipp invites Yella to accompany him on his travels to another business. She accepts. As she calls her father from her hotel room to tell him the news, Ben emerges menacingly from a shadowy corner. He explains that their company ruined their love and that he will return to his job as an electrician to get her back. She tells him to leave and he hits her. She runs to Philipp's room for help, with Ben in hot pursuit. Hearing Yella's frantic knocking, Philipp opens his door and a frightened Yella throws herself into his arms and hugs him tightly. Ben is suddenly nowhere to be seen. Yella kisses Philipp and they retreat to his room for sex.  The following morning Yella drives Philipp's car and takes a detour to her hometown. He becomes angry, asking her to stop. She stops and he takes the driver's seat. Yella exits the car and walks to a field. Philipp catches up and apologizes. He explains that he was afraid of meeting her father and his expectations of domesticity. He tells her his own plans for designing a better safety system for oil rigs but that he still needs 200,000 euro to begin his enterprise. Yella says she will continue to help. Philipp stops at a motel and gives Yella some money to go shopping for clothes. Philipp reveals that their last meeting was his last customer. His organization is dumping him, presumably due to his unethical practices.  Yella drives away and stops at the home of a man from a previous meeting. She attempts to blackmail him with information she gained about a potential patent infringement and demands 200,000 euro. When he resists, she tells him he could lose everything if he is found out. Yella returns to Philipp at the motel and tells him she loves him.  The next morning, the two wait for the man she is blackmailing. He cannot be found but Yella experiences an odd vision of him which then vanishes. Alarmed, she drives to his home, asking his wife to help her look for him. Yella and the man's wife discover his body in a pond behind the house. As Yella stares in shock, Philipp suddenly appears, brushing past her to help the man's wife pull her husband's body out of the water. He looks accusingly back at Yella.  Yella is sitting dejectedly in the back of a police car as it travels back to the station. She begins sobbing. Suddenly, she is back in Ben's car, just as he steers it off the bridge. She makes no move to resist her fate.  Police remove Ben's car from the water using a crane. Divers deposit Ben and Yella's bodies on the shore, covering them both with a shroud.

You, the Living
 There is no central plot, but some of the vignettes connect loosely. All the stories show the essential humanity of the characters and address themes of life, existence and happiness.  The film makes repeated use of distinctive cinematic techniques. One of these is dreams and how they reflect the fears and desires of the characters. Another is the use of music, in conjunction with dialogues and editing, both as background music and as performed on camera. The film starts with a monologue which ends up being sung to [[Dixieland]] jazz music being played by lone musicians, each in a different room in a different part of the city.  Stories in the film include: * A middle-aged woman (Elisabeth Helander) laments her misfortunes while being completely self-absorbed. Her boyfriend ([[Jugge Nohall]]) tries to comfort her and invites her to dinner. The woman later rejects an admirer in a trenchcoat (Jan Wikbladh) who tries to give her a bouquet of flowers. * A carpenter (Leif Larsson) has a dream in which he is condemned and executed for breaking a 200-year-old china set while trying to perform the tablecloth trick. * A pickpocket (Waldemar Nowak) steals the wallet of a high roller (Gunnar Ivarsson) at an expensive restaurant before he has paid the bill. * A psychiatrist (Håkan Angser) has lost faith in people's ability to be happy because of their selfishness, and now only prescribes pills. * A business consultant (Olle Olson) gets his hair butchered by an angry barber (Kemal Sener) before attending a meeting where the CEO (Bengt C. W. Carlsson) dies of a stroke. * A sousaphone player (Björn Englund) earns money by playing in funerals, including the one of the CEO. * A girl (Jessika Lundberg) finds her musical idol Micke Larsson ([[Deathstars|Eric Bäckman]]) in a tavern. He invites her and her friend for a drink, but ditches her by giving her the wrong directions to his band rehearsal. A while later at the tavern, she tells the people at the bar of the dream she had about him. In the dream, they have just married, and their apartment building travels on a railway into a station where people cheer for the happy couple. * A husband and wife (Pär Fredriksson and Jessica Nilsson) have a fight and they both dwell on it, causing them to get into trouble at work.  The film ends with a montage of characters who stop in the middle of everyday chores to look up into the sky. Dixieland music is once again played as the camera is put on the wing of an airplane. A large formation of [[Boeing B-52|B-52]] bombers appears in front of the camera as they fly menacingly in over a large city. This bookends with the opening scene where a man wakes up and tells the audience that he had a nightmare about bombers coming.  
Yobi, the Five Tailed Fox
 One hundred years ago, aliens landed on a mountain near where a small, white five tailed fox lived. After being stranded on Earth for one hundred years, they are ready for a test flight to see if they can return home. The test fails as one of the aliens makes a mistake, and the other aliens tell him to leave.  The runaway alien finds itself taken in by a class of students at the foot of the mountain. There, a teacher named Kang trains students who do not fit in at a regular school. In order to save the alien, the five tailed fox takes on the form of a human girl, and joins the school under the name of Yobi.  Staying at the school, Yobi becomes friends with one of the students, a boy named Geum-ee. She grows more and more attached to humans and enjoys her time with them, until a fox hunter appears, as well as a shadow who gives Yobi a device which will allow her to become human by taking the soul from a human.  Yobi becomes exposed to the hunter, which makes her leave. With the fox hunter set upon hunting her down, Geum-ee tries to save her, but falls down in a lake which makes Geum-ee's soul trapped in a cage as a bird. Yobi tries to save him, but the shadow takes Geum-ee's soul. He states that his soul was taken from him long ago and that he needs one to become solid. Yobi defeats the shadow, only to be told by the soul lake's gatekeepers that the number of souls in the lake must remain the same and a soul can never go out unless another soul replaces it. Yobi then allows for Geum-ee's departure back to the human world by placing her own soul in the bird cage. Once he comes back to consciousness, Geum-ee tries to call for Yobi, but to no avail. He is last seen leaving with the teacher and the other students.  Some time later, Yobi's soul is released. Yobi becomes human and is most likely reincarnated to become human not too long after her soul had been exchanged. It is not known if Yobi and Geum-ee see each other or not, though many fans have their hopes.

Youth Without Youth (film)
 In 1938, Dominic Matei ([[Tim Roth]]), a 70-year-old professor of linguistics, pining after the love of his youth, Laura ([[Alexandra Maria Lara]]), travels to Bucharest, the city where he and she met at university. Feeling that his fruitless search for the origin of human language has condemned him to a solitary, wasted life, Dominic is intent on committing suicide after this one last journey. However, while crossing the street, he is abruptly yet non-lethally struck by lightning. In hospital, Professor Stanciulescu ([[Bruno Ganz]]) informs Dominic that, much to both their surprises, the lighting appears to have regenerated him into a much younger man. Soon after, while residing at the Professor's home, Dominic also discovers that he possesses strange, psychic capacities.  As Romania is invaded by Nazi Germany, Doktor Josef Rudolf ([[André Hennicke]]) begins to show an interest in Stanciulescu's miracle patient. Since Dominic's budding powers have blurred his perception of reality, he is bamboozled into mistaking a Nazi spy known only as the Woman in Room Six for an erotic fantasy, who discovers during their nights together that he has developed a talent for speaking in tongues. Meanwhile, an alternate persona, invisible to human eyes, presents itself to Dominic as his “Other” from outside space and time. When Dominic asks for proof, the “Other” obliges by bringing him two roses out of nowhere. Unbeknownst to Dominic, Stanciulescu has witnessed the event and overhears his friend ask himself, “Where do you want me to put the third rose?” Understanding the Nazis' designs, Stanciulescu persuades Dominic to escape from Romania.  Living like a spy, Dominic eventually winds up in Switzerland towards the end of the war, where he is confronted by Doktor Rudolf at gunpoint in an alleyway. Rudolf argues that Dominic’s existence supports the Nazis' ideal of the superman, and that the coming nuclear conflicts can only be survived by a superior species of man. In the background, the “Other” confirms this to be the case. However, in refusing to cooperate, Dominic manifests telekinetic powers which manipulate Rudolf into shooting himself. Subsequently, Dominic returns to a normal existence and resumes his linguistic research. Having realised that the lightning strike has partially lent him the capacities and knowledge of future humanity, he develops a secret language for his audio diary, to be deciphered long after the nuclear apocalypse.  Many years later, Dominic encounters a woman named Veronica ([[Alexandra Maria Lara]]) while hiking in the Alps. The “Other” reveals her to be the reincarnation of Laura. When the mountains are hit by a violent thunderstorm, Dominic rushes to her rescue and finds her chanting in Sanskrit, which he greets her with to gain her trust. During her stay in hospital, Veronica now identifies herself as “Rupini”, one of the first disciples of the [[Buddha]]. Suspecting she may now be afflicted with a condition similar to his own, Dominic calls the Roman College of Oriental Studies for aid, who inform him that Rupini's last act in life was to retire into a cave for meditation on Enlightenment. Since the cave’s location is unknown, the scholars, led by Professor [[Giuseppe Tucci]] ([[Marcel Iures]]), agree to fund an expedition to find it in India, hoping Veronica’s past self will guide them. The venture proves a success when a local Boddhisatva recognises “Rupini” and directs her to the place of meditation. Following this discovery, Veronica becomes herself again and falls for Dominic.  The couple elope to Malta, where for a time, they live happily together, until Dominic tells Veronica in her sleep that he has always loved her. This causes Veronica to writhe in bed as if possessed and begin chanting a language even he does not understand. The “Other” explains that she is speaking in ancient Egyptian, having travelled further back along the path of her past selves. For the next two weeks, Dominic learns how to control this state in Veronica, leading her to regress ever further in time and speak previously unknown tongues. However, Veronica's health begins to decline from exhaustion, and Dominic declares that he cannot continue these sessions, or even being close to Veronica, since his proximity to her is accelerating her age. Over the objections of both Veronica and the “Other”, he leaves.  Despairing, Dominic returns to the town where he taught as a professor. His alter ego appears to him in a miror and reveals the future of mankind; nuclear warfare will unleash an electromagnetic pulse, giving birth to a new, powerful human species, of which Dominic is but the first member. Veronica symbolised the dawn of man, and he stood for the dusk. Outraged at the idea of sacrificing millions of lives in the name of evolution, Dominic shatters the mirror, causing the “Other” to vanish, yelling incoherently in an unfamiliar language. In the morning, townsfolk find Dominic's body, lying dead at the bottom of a staircase. As Veronica’s voice is heard echoing “Where do you want me to put the third rose?”, the rose appears in Dominic’s lifeless grasp.  
Zibahkhana
   
Your Friend the Rat
 The short starts in with Remy introducing himself and Emile to the audience and speaking on behalf of oppressed rats everywhere. Emile starts frowning about having to speak out, while Remy pulls a scroll and a two dimensional animation starts by presenting the relation between a human and a rat in contrast with human dog and human cat relationships. Remy points out that humans regarded rats in former times as sacred and luck bringing.   He says that during [[the Roman Empire]] if a white rat crosses your path, it brought good luck, while if a black rat crosses your path, it brought bad luck. He moves on to discussing [[black rats]] (''Rattus rattus'') and their connection to the [[Black Death]], pointing out that it was caused by fleas not rats, resulting in the death of one third of Europe's population.  Remy further presents the [[brown rat]]'s (''Rattus norvegicus'') history, mentioning their part in ending the Black Death, their honorable [[Rat (zodiac)|position]] in the [[Chinese zodiac]] and their sacredness in [[India]] for being the transport vehicle of the Hindu god [[Ganesha|Ganesh]]. The [[symbiotic]] relationship between rats and humans is introduced before the second appearance of Remy and Emile in 3D animation. Emile pulls a scroll from the side and presents through 2D animation the benefits of rats for the human.   He says that [[Jack Black (rat catcher)|Jack Black]] was a rat catcher for [[Queen Victoria]] and that he kept the rats he captured as [[Fancy rat|pets]]. Their use for laboratory testing and as pets show that they can have a good relationship with humans. Concluding the presentation Emile and Remy sing a song about the relationship between rats and humans. At the film's end, a long and drawn out (mostly [[satirical]]) disclaimer is shown asking children to stay away from rats, while Remy and Emile stand in front of it and try to remove it, urging the audience to ignore the warning and complaining about freedom of speech and lack of food, respectively.  
Zen (2007 film)

Zodiac (film)
  On July 4, 1969, an unknown man attacks Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau with a handgun at a lovers' lane in [[Vallejo, California]]. Mageau survives.  One month later, the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' receives [[encrypted]] letters written by the killer calling himself the "[[Zodiac Killer|Zodiac]]" and taunting the police. Political cartoonist [[Robert Graysmith]] is not taken seriously by crime reporter [[Paul Avery]] or the editors and is excluded from the initial details about the killings. When the newspaper publishes the letters, a married couple deciphers one. In September, the killer attacks law student Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard at [[Lake Berryessa]] in [[Napa County]]; Shepard dies two days later.  At a bar, Avery makes fun of Graysmith before they discuss the coded letters. Graysmith interprets the letter, which Avery finds helpful, and Avery begins sharing information. One of Graysmith's insights about the letters is that the Zodiac's reference to man as "the most dangerous animal of them all" is a reference to the film ''[[The Most Dangerous Game]],'' which features General Zaroff as a man who hunts live human prey.  Two weeks later, San Francisco taxicab driver Paul Stine is shot and killed in the city's [[Presidio Heights]] district. The Zodiac killer mails pieces of Stine's bloodstained shirt to the ''Chronicle'' along with a taunting letter. San Francisco police detectives [[Dave Toschi]] and his partner Bill Armstrong are assigned to the case, and work closely with Vallejo's Jack Mulanax and Captain Ken Narlow in Napa. Someone claiming to be Zodiac continues to send taunting letters and speaks on the phone with lawyer [[Melvin Belli]] on a television talk show.  In 1971, Detectives Toschi, Armstrong, and Mulanax question Arthur Leigh Allen, a suspect in the Vallejo case. They notice that he wears a [[Zodiac Watches|Zodiac wristwatch]], with the same logo used by the killer. However, a [[Questioned document examination|handwriting expert]] insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters, even though Allen is said to be [[ambidextrous]]. Avery receives a letter threatening his life; becoming paranoid, he turns to drugs and alcohol. He shares information with the [[Riverside Police Department]], angering Toschi and Armstrong. The case's notoriety weighs on Toschi, who is unable to sit through a Hollywood film, ''[[Dirty Harry]]'', loosely based on the Zodiac case.  In 1978, Avery moves to the ''[[Sacramento Bee]]''. Graysmith persistently contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders, and eventually impresses him with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides names in other police departments where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the [[San Francisco Police Department|San Francisco Police]] homicide division and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter.  Graysmith continues his own investigation, profiled in the ''Chronicle'', and gives a television interview about the book he is writing about the case. He begins receiving phone calls with heavy breathing. As his obsession deepens, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children. Graysmith learns that Leigh lived close to Ferrin and probably knew her, and that his birthday matches the one Zodiac gave when he spoke to one of Belli's maids. While [[circumstantial evidence]] seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him. In December 1983, Graysmith tracks Allen to a Vallejo [[Ace Hardware]] store, where he is employed as a sales clerk; Graysmith stares at him. Eight years later, after Graysmith's book ''[[Zodiac (true crime book)|Zodiac]]'' has become a bestseller, Mageau identifies Allen from a [[Mug book|police mugshot]].
