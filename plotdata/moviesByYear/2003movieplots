2 Fast 2 Furious
 After letting [[Dominic Toretto]] escape from the authorities, [[Brian O'Conner]] relocates from [[Los Angeles]] to [[Miami]] and makes a living by participating in illegal street races. Tej Parker organizes a local street race, involving Suki, Orange Julius, and Slap Jack, however, the race lacks a fourth driver. Tej calls Brian, who agrees to be the fourth needed for the race. Brian wins, giving a few thousand of his winnings to Tej to show his gratitude. The police then arrive, forcing all the racers to flee. Watched by undercover [[United States Customs Service|U.S. Customs Service]] agent Monica Fuentes, Brian is caught by the agents. He is taken into custody, but given a deal by his former boss, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Bilkins, and Customs agent Markham, to go undercover and bring down Argentinian drug lord, Carter Verone in exchange for the erasure of his criminal record. Brian agrees, but only if he is given permission to choose his own partner. This prompts him to travel to [[Barstow, California]], where he enlists the help of Roman Pearce, his childhood friend who served jail time for housing stolen cars in a garage. Roman, currently on [[parole]], blames Brian for his arrest, but reluctantly agrees to help, but only for the same deal Brian was offered. Roman and Brian are later hired by Verone, who tasks the duo to obtain a package from a confiscated car located in a lot. Markham, who mistakenly thinks that the duo are trying to run away, follows them to the lot. However, Roman relents, and shoots at Markham to help maintain his cover. He later confronts him for interference with the mission. Brian is able to gain knowledge of the plan, however, and tells Bilkins that Verone is reportedly aiming to launder his money in Miami, before escaping on his private jet.  Later, the team challenges a pair of [[muscle car]] drivers they raced when competing for Verone's hiring, for [[Pink slip racing|pink slips]]. Despite engine and power output handicaps, Brian and Roman manage to win the race and the other two cars. Meanwhile, Roman confronts Brian about his attraction to Monica and the constant threat of Verone's men. However, the two men patch up their differences, and focus on completing the mission.  After witnessing Verone torture [[Detective]] Whitworth of the [[Miami Police Department]] into giving them a window of opportunity to make their getaway, Brian and Roman are warned by Monica that they will be killed once the drop is made. However, Markham refuses to call off the job, claiming that is their one chance to catch Verone and before they leave, Brian and Monica kiss.  On the day of the mission, Brian and Roman begin transporting duffel bags of Verone's money, with Verone's right-hand men, Enrique and Roberto, riding alongside to accompany the duo. Before the window is set, Whitworth decides to call in the police to move in for an arrest of the drivers of the cars used by Brian and Roman. This results in a high-speed chase across the city. The duo leads the police to a warehouse, where a "scramble" by dozens of street racers organized by Tej disorients the police. Following the scramble, the police manage to pull over the cars, only to find out that they were driven by Tej and Suki. As it turns out, the duo had switched cars and had escaped in the two muscle cars they had won earlier.  As Brian approaches the destination point in a [[Yenko Camaro]], Enrique tells him to take the Tarpon Point Marina exit, instead of heading to the airfield. Meanwhile, Roman gets rid of Roberto by using an improvised [[ejector seat]] in his [[Dodge Challenger]] powered by [[Nitrous oxide engine|nitrous oxide]]. At the airfield, Customs agents have Verone's plane and convoy surrounded, only to discover they have been duped into a decoy maneuver while Verone is at a boatyard several miles away. Verone reveals he knew Monica was an undercover agent, and purposely gave her wrong information on the destination point. When Brian arrives at the Marina, Verone forces Monica onto his private yacht and orders Enrique to kill Brian. As Enrique prepares to kill him, Brian's ejector seat fails, but Roman suddenly appears and helps Brian to incapacitate Enrique. Verone makes his escape, but Brian and Roman use the Camaro to drive off a ramp, crashing on top of the yacht. The duo manages to apprehend Verone and save Monica.  With their crimes pardoned, Brian and Roman ponder on what to do next in Miami, with the former suggesting starting a garage. They are revealed to have taken some of Verone's money for themselves.

The strange man turns out to be a suicide bomber, who professes his love through the words of the song to a woman who turns up every day at 7:35 in the morning (''de la mañana''). The others in the cafe have prerecorded lines to say at points during the song (or they risk the threat of being blown up) and even a short dance routine.   At the start of the film, the woman realises that something is not right when sitting down: everyone is quiet and refusing to acknowledge her presence. When the man reveals himself to be a suicide bomber (one of the people in the cafe refuses to sing), she calls the police (whilst he is not watching). Roughly three minutes later, the police arrive outside the coffee shop. The man finishes his song and emerges from the cafe to the police, holding a big sack of confetti. The man blows himself up, and the confetti showers over the woman. The credits roll.  
16 Years of Alcohol
 The opening scene shows Frankie being beaten by a small group of men, and the rest of the film is shown as a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] leading up to that point. The film is split into three sections: Frankie's troubled childhood, his violent adolescence as a ska-loving [[skinhead]] who commands a small gang, and a period of change, in which Frankie tries to believe in hope and love.  Frankie starts a relationship with Helen ([[Laura Fraser]]), a young woman who studies art and works in a record store. When the differences between them became too obvious, Helen breaks up with Frankie, and he joins [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (or a similar program) and a theatre group along with Mary ([[Susan Lynch]]), a good-hearted alcoholic. This allows Frankie to exorcise some of his demons, and he loses his desire to fight. An incident in a [[pub]] leads Frankie to believe that Mary is cheating on him with the theatre group's director. This reignites doubts created by his parents a long time ago. Feeling deceived, Frankie rejects Mary without a valid reason. When he's preparing to drink a glass of scotch, he begins to muse how the past has destroyed his life up to this point and he decides to stay sober and call Mary to apologise. The events merge with the beginning of the film, and Frankie's former comrades chase and beat him up. Whether Frankie dies or not is left open to the viewer.  
11:14
  The film involves a series of interconnected events that converge around two car-related accidents at 11:14&nbsp;p.m.  The connections between the events are not apparent at first, but are gradually revealed by a series of progressively receding [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s:  ===Part 1===  '''11:13 - 11:33''' ::Jack, who has been drinking, is seen driving along a road at night talking on his cell phone.  The clock on the dashboard reads 11:14 p.m.  Suddenly, as he drives under an overpass, something smashes across the windshield, causing him to skid off the road.  He stops by a deer crossing sign and gets out to inspect the damage, and finds a human body with a badly mutilated face lying close to his car.  When he sees another car approaching, he panics and drags the body out of sight.  The car pulls up next to him, and the driver, Norma, assumes that he hit a deer. She offers to call the police over Jack's protests, insisting that it is no trouble because she has a new cell phone that she "never uses" and because she is friends with the Chief of Police.  Norma offers Jack a ride to her house to wait for the police, but he declines.  When she drives off, Jack decides to hide the body in the trunk of his car.  He gets back into the car to pull away, but a police officer pulls up behind him.  Officer Hannagan speaks with Jack and, noting his odd behavior, asks him if he would submit to a breathalyzer test.  Jack requests a sobriety test instead, which Hannagan administers, getting him to recite the alphabet in reverse from Z to A.  When the officer checks with dispatch, he finds that Jack's license has been revoked for driving under the influence.  Hannagan tells Jack that he is under arrest and that his car will be impounded.  When he finds the body in the trunk, Hannagan handcuffs Jack with a cable tie and tells the two people already in the back of the cruiser, Duffy, and Buzzy, to move over so that Jack will fit.  While Hannagan argues with Buzzy, who refuses to move over, Jack is able to pull clippers out of his pocket, cut the cable tie, and escape.  Hannagan pursues, leaving the cruiser door open, and Duffy and Buzzy also escape.  Jack runs across a property with security lights and a dog, causing the owner, Norma, to come out.  She is obviously upset and is looking for her husband, Frank, because she just received a phone call that their daughter, Cheri, was killed in a hit-and-run accident.  Hannagan catches up to Jack at this point, and Norma angrily strikes Jack with a flashlight, assuming that he is responsible for her daughter's death.  He flees again, into the cemetery where he trips over a bowling ball and is again taken into custody.  ===Part 2===  '''11:09 - 11:29''' ::Teenagers Tim, Mark, and Eddie are driving around causing trouble by throwing things out of the windows of Mark's mother's van, including a jelly donut, which hits an oncoming car, and a book they have set on fire.  Mark, distracted by Eddie urinating out the van's window, runs into and kills Cheri, who was crossing the road while on her cell phone.  They stop, but flee the scene when Duffy comes toward the van with a gun.  As Duffy fires on the retreating van, Tim realizes that the accident also caused the van's window to snap shut, cutting off Eddie's penis.  Eddie insists that they all go back to the site of the crash because he doesn't want to live without his penis; feeling sorry for Eddie, Tim volunteers to go back in an effort to find the penis.  Tim is accosted by the paramedics, Leon and Kevin at the scene, but manages to escape and get the severed penis back to Eddie.  ===Part 3===  '''11:04 - 11:24''' ::Frank is walking his dog late at night and discovers his daughter's Cheri's car keys next to the dead body of Aaron, in the cemetery. Thinking his daughter is responsible for the death, Frank packs the body in the trunk of Aaron's car, accidentally locking the keys in with the body.  He uses a rock to break a window and get into the car, then drives to a bridge.  He has to hide from a car driven by Duffy that passes by, but then disposes of the body by dropping it over the side of the bridge, where it lands on Jack's car (as seen at the start of the film).  His dog runs off with the blood-soaked jacket.  He chases the dog, eventually catching it.  He sees the burning book that the teenagers threw on the sidewalk, and uses it to set his jacket on fire.  His wife, Norma, sees him and gives him a ride home, where she sends him out to look for the deer that Jack supposedly hit.  ===Part 4===  '''10:59 - 11:19''' ::Buzzy is working at a convenience store late at night. Her friend and co-worker, Duffy, arrives and they begin discussing Cheri's pregnancy and money needed for an abortion.  Mark and Eddie arrive after the store is closed but Duffy lets them come in.  They are there to buy items to throw out the van windows. After they leave, Duffy tells Buzzy his plan to steal from the store the $500 required to pay for the abortion.  Cheri arrives and she and Duffy go into the cooler.  Meanwhile Buzzy is playing around with Duffy's revolver (the one he plans to use to rob the store) and she accidentally shoots a bullet through a glass door of a refrigerator, barely missing Duffy and Cheri.  Cheri leaves and Duffy asks Buzzy to allow him to steal the money from the convenience store's cash register.  Buzzy objects, fearful of losing her job, but relents, while insisting that Duffy shoot her in the arm to make it look like an authentic robbery.  He shoots her in the arm and then dials [[9-1-1]] for her, leaving while she is on the phone.  Duffy looks for his keys, barely escaping the police who are arriving more quickly than he thought they would.  While driving away, he passes by Aaron's car, where Frank has parked it preparing to dispose of Aaron's body.  Duffy then sees Cheri parked and tells her he got the money for her abortion. When she gets out of her car, he witnesses the teenagers' van knocking down and killing Cheri, and he shoots at the teenagers.  He is then arrested by Officer Hannagan for shooting at the van and for the store robbery, based on the description someone phoned in (later revealed to be Cheri).  Buzzy is arrested as an accomplice when she refuses to identify Duffy and admits to conspiring with him.  ===Part 5===  '''10:54 - 11:14''' ::Cheri leaves her house to have sex with Aaron at the cemetery.  Aaron is reclining against a tombstone that has a stone angel on top.  The angel's neck is damaged and the heavy stone head falls onto Aaron's face, killing him instantly and mutilating his face.  Cheri runs away from the scene, not realizing that she has dropped the set of keys that Frank found in the earlier scene.  Cheri borrows her father's car and goes to the convenience store to get Duffy's bowling ball, intending to replace the angel head with the bowling ball and implicate Duffy as killing Aaron.  As she drives away from the store, she sees the shooting and reports a description of Duffy to the police.  When Cheri arrives back at the cemetery, she drops the bowling ball when she sees that Aaron's body is gone.  She tries to leave, but her car is again having trouble starting. Her cell phone rings, and she begins talking to Jack.  This is the phone conversation the movie begins with, continued to inform the viewer that Cheri's "pregnancy" is actually a scam to get money from both Duffy and Aaron, so that Cheri and Jack can leave town together with the money.  In the midst of the call, Duffy calls out Cheri's name from across the street to tell her that he got the $500 she wanted him to get.  Cheri hangs up quickly, and while she is crossing the street, the cell phone rings again, and, distracted, she stops in the middle of the road, where she is hit by the van containing Mark, Tim, and Eddie.  The camera pans to Cheri's cell phone, which reads 11:14 p.m.  
15 (film)
 The film stars three real-life juvenile gangsters, all aged 15, giving an accurate depiction of Chinese teenage gang-life in the [[Singapore]] suburbs.  The 2003 film features two more gangsters as characters as well as a fight sequence with more affluent English-educated Singapore youths.  Rather than scripting the movie or employing professional actors, Tan attempted to capture the troubled lives of his characters in realistic fashion, apparently without much prior scripting.  
8 Guys

13 Dead Men
 The plot centers around a master diamond thief named Malichi who is framed for murder and put on death row.  When the corrupt warden finds that he has hidden diamonds, he tries anything he can to get him to reveal the location of the diamonds, including extending his sentence.  When Malichi realizes he is not going to find justice, he turns to Caj, a belligerent inmate that agrees to help him in order to gain his own freedom.  
12 (2003 film)
  More than its plot and themes, ''12'' is recognized for its unique—and rarely before seen—style. Drawing inspiration from French New Wave films, poetry and improvisation techniques, Bridges' film is inconsistent in tone, which some believe occurred because of the large span of time in which it was produced. One journalist described ''12'' as "shifting capriciously between the near-profound and the pointlessly silly." The first half of the film especially has been considered nonlinear in regards to its narrative structure.  Music
21 Grams
 The story is told in a non-linear manner. The following is a chronological summary of the plot:  Jack Jordan is a former convict who is using his new-found religious faith to recover from drug addiction and alcoholism. Paul Rivers is a mathematics professor with a dedicated wife, Mary Rivers, and a fatal heart condition. Unless he receives a new heart from an organ donor, he will not live longer than one month. Paul's wife wants him to donate his sperm so she can have his baby even if he dies. Cristina Peck is a recovering drug addict and now lives a normal suburban life with a supportive husband and two children. She is a loving mother and active swimmer who has left her days of drugs and booze behind. These three separate stories/characters become tied together one evening when Jack kills Cristina's husband and children in a hit-and-run accident. Her husband's heart is donated to Paul, who begins his recovery.  Cristina is devastated by the loss and returns to drugs and alcohol. Paul is eager to begin normal life again, but he hesitantly agrees to his wife's idea of surgery and artificial insemination as a last-ditch effort to get pregnant. During consultations with a doctor before the surgery, Paul learns that his wife had undergone an abortion after they had separated in the past. Angered, Paul ends the relationship. He becomes very inquisitive about whose heart he has. He learns from a private detective that the heart belonged to Cristina's husband and begins to follow the widowed Cristina around town.  Jack is stricken with guilt following the accident and starts using drugs again. Despite his wife's protests to keep quiet and conceal his guilt, Jack tells her that his "duty is to God" and turns himself in. While incarcerated, he claims that God had betrayed him, loses his will to live and tries unsuccessfully to commit suicide. He is released after Cristina declines to press charges, as she realizes that putting Jack in prison will not bring her family back. When Jack is released, he is unable to reincorporate himself into normal family life, and instead leaves home to live as a transient, working in manual labor.  Paul finds an opportunity to meet Cristina and eventually reveals how the two of them are connected. She is initially furious and forces him out, but quickly reconsiders. Desperately needing one another, they continue their relationship. Though Paul has a new heart, his body is [[Transplant rejection|rejecting the transplant]] and his outlook is grim. As Cristina begins to dwell more on her changed life and the death of her girls, she becomes obsessed with exacting revenge on Jack. She goads Paul into agreeing to murder him.  Paul meets with the private detective who originally found Cristina for him. He tells Paul that Jack is living in a motel and sells Paul a gun. Paul and Cristina check into the motel where Jack is staying. When Jack is walking alone, Paul grabs him and leads him out into a clearing at gunpoint with the intention of killing him. However, Paul is unable to kill Jack, who himself is confused, shaking and pleading during the event. Paul tells Jack to "just disappear," then returns to the motel, lying to Cristina about Jack's death. Later that night, while they are sleeping, Paul and Cristina are awakened by a noise outside their door. It's Jack, who, still consumed by guilt, orders Paul to kill him and end his misery. There is a struggle, and Cristina blind-sides Jack and begins to beat him with a wooden lamp. Paul collapses, gets hold of the gun, and shoots himself.  Jack and Cristina rush Paul to the hospital. Jack tells the police that he was the one who shot Paul, but is released when his story cannot be confirmed. Paul dies, and the conflict between Cristina and Jack remains unresolved (they meet in the waiting room after Paul's death; if they converse, it is not shown). When she offers to donate blood for Paul in the hospital, Cristina learns that she is pregnant. After Paul's death, Cristina is seen tentatively preparing for the new child in one of her daughter's bedrooms, which she had previously been unable to enter after her daughter's death. Jack is shown returning to his family.  
101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure
  The Radcliffe family and their one hundred and one [[Dalmatian (dog)|dalmatian]]s are preparing to move to their "Dalmatian Plantation," a home in the countryside with plenty of room for all of them. However, Patch, one of the puppies, feels ignored and wishes to be unique like his television hero, Thunderbolt. While watching ''The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour'', he hears about a chance to appear on the show. He is accidentally left behind when his family leaves for the plantation, so he decides to head for the audition to meet his hero and win a guest spot on the show. He fails to impress the producers, allowing a jealous Lil' Lightning to trick them into making himself the hero of his own show. Depressed, Patch leaves and runs into Thunderbolt.  Elsewhere in London, [[Cruella de Vil]] has returned, but she is under [[probation]] and a [[restraining order]] for her past behavior. No longer allowed to maintain her previous lifestyle, she attempts to soothe her fixation on spots with the help of Lars, a French [[beatnik]] artist. In order to inspire him, she restarts her hunt for the dalmatians, using a newspaper picture of Patch to find their new address.  Patch's family finally becomes aware that he is missing and go back to London to find him. Cruella bails her former henchmen, Jasper and Horace, out of prison. She sends them in a stolen [[dog food]] truck to steal the remaining puppies. They succeed after dealing with Nanny, and they take them to Lars.  When Cruella requests she be made a masterpiece from their fur, Lars angrily refuses, not wanting them to be harmed. Angered, she has him bound and gagged and returns to her original plan of making a dalmatian [[fur coat]].  The captured puppies use the ''[[Twilight bark|Twilight Bark]]'' to send a distress signal, which is picked up by Patch and Thunderbolt, and they set out to save Patch's family. On the way, they encounter Lil' Lightning, who follows them and convinces Thunderbolt not to use Patch's stealth plan but to openly attack. He frightens Jasper and Horace, but Cruella knocks him unconscious and he and Patch are captured. Lil' Lightning, believing his own scheme fulfilled, sneaks into the building and reveals that Thunderbolt is a fraud, and tells him that what he said a while ago was a lie to get him out of the way and finally be out of his shadow, before fleeing. Crushed by this revelation, and Thunderbolt telling Patch that he is really an actor, Patch falls into despair, but his siblings restore his spirit by reminding him that Thunderbolt escaped a similar predicament in one of the TV episodes. Patch breaks out and releases his family, but Thunderbolt remains behind, ashamed of himself for disappointing Patch. The dalmatians escape through the building's roof to Cruella's [[Panther De Ville]], while having the villains stalled on where they are. Meanwhile, Thunderbolt escapes from his cage and frees Lars.  The puppies steal a double-decker bus, but Cruella, Jasper, and Horace discover the escape and pursue them in their stolen truck, a chase ensues through the streets of London, crashing through the filming of Lil' Lightning's new show in the process, and having him on the driving window. Cruella, Jasper, and Horace finally corner the dogs in an alley. Patch tries to hold them off while the others escape, but they are undaunted. Luckily, Thunderbolt arrives, having been driven to the scene by Lars, and fakes a heart attack, briefly gaining Lil' Lightning's sympathy and making Cruella, in her distraction, knock out Jasper and Horace and incapacitate herself while Patch retreats back to the bus. He puts it in reverse, sending Cruella, Jasper, Horace, and Lil' Lightning scrambling into the [[River Thames]], along with their stolen truck. As he and Thunderbolt stand triumphantly, Patch finally brings out a bark similar to Thunderbolt's.  The police arrest Lil' Lightning, Jasper, and Horace while Cruella, now driven completely insane, is sent to a mental institute. The Radcliffes and Nanny who were told by Jasper and Horace it was Cruella who made them do it arrive, along with Patch's parents, whom he introduces to Thunderbolt. They thank him, but he dismisses himself as simply an actor. Patch, on the other hand, is, in his eyes, a "real, one of a kind wonder-dog." After a newspaper montage reveals the fates of the characters, a [[post-credits scene]] shows Thunderbolt in his TV show with Patch as his new sidekick and the other puppies as [[extra (actor)|extras]], chasing the villain away into the sunset.  
88 Antop Hill
  The film opens with the brutal murder of Neeraj Shah ([[Sachin Dubey]]). His body is dumped in the trunk of a car. This crime isn't committed on impulse: Whoever did it had good reason.  We then enter the life of a bank executive Pratyush Shelar ([[Atul Kulkarni]]). He gets home late on his anniversary because he had to console an old college classmate about her marital woes. His own marital woes are worsened when his wife Antara ([[Suchitra Pillai]]) kicks up a big fight and leaves their home with their daughter Saanjh.  Pratyush is upset about this. His colleague Aslam Durrani ([[Harsh Khurana]]) picks up on this and suggests an exotic dancer Teesta ([[Shweta Menon]]). Pratyush is too upset to be interested. But Aslam is determined; later that night he calls Pratyush and pretends as though some thugs are about to kill him. He asks Pratyush to come immediately to a certain location.  That location is 88 [[Antop Hill]].  Pratyush arrives. 88 Antop Hill is a halfway house mainly occupied by exotic dancers and escorts. Pratyush walks into the flat Aslam had mentioned; it is Teesta's lair. She attempts to seduce him but he refuses her advances. Upon her request, he takes her to the Moksha club and buys her a drink. (He doesn't drink.) She remarks that the bartender Sol ([[Rahul Panday]]) knows all her secrets. While leaving the bar, their car is attacked by an apparently drunk man, who seems to know Teesta. Teesta urges Pratyush to leave fast. When he brings her back home, he realizes that his car keys are missing. He waits as she looks for them.  When Teesta gets into her bedroom, she is mysteriously murdered. She stumbles into Pratyush's arms, fatally stabbed, and collapses. Scared and confused, Pratyush leaves immediately. One of the neighbors, a weird and on-and-off senile old fellow called Murli Mansukhani ([[Shauket Baig]]) sees him leave.  When the cops begin to investigate, they find that Teesta had a roommate Sonali ([[Jasmine D'Souza|Jasmine]]) and that Sonali is engaged to a prominent businessman, K.K. Menon ([[Sanjay Singh]]). The investigating officer, and the hero of this movie, Inspector Arvind Khanvilkar ([[Rahul Dev]]), starts his work. The prime suspect is an unwitting Pratyush because he was the last person to see Teesta alive.  A somewhat convoluted plot evolves. Sonali has several dark secrets and a good-for-nothing brother Prashant ([[Subrotto Dutta]]). Teesta was somehow connected to Sonali's dark past. Menon knows this and wanted to wipe out everything, including Prashant. He has Prashant kidnapped, and later he tells Sol to bump off Prashant. There is a three-way fight among them. Pratyush arrives upon the scene and witnesses two more murders. A dying Prashant advises Pratyush to go to Sonali at the earliest. In the meantime, the weird old man of 88 Antop Hill, Murli, recalls that he had seen Pratyush and follows him to blackmail him. When Pratyush asks him to get lost, he goes to Sonali's house and tries to blackmail her. Aslam Durrani visits Pratyush and, seeing him, thinks he has probably committed the crime, saying that Pratyush would better leave the city and that he wouldn't want anything to do with the latter anymore.  Pratyush contacts the cops but a dimwitted cop sternly asks him to surrender, as the police have found the murder weapon and a blood stained shirt, with Pratyush's diary stating 88 Antop Hill on the fateful date at his house. Pratyush panics and goes to Sonali to convey Prashant's message to her. She does not listen to what he says. Here Menon and the good inspector show up as well.  The crux arises &mdash; the inspector says that he has found out that Sonali is actually "Sonali Shah", and she was married already to the deceased Neeraj Shah; it was Sonali who killed him because he wouldn't give her a divorce to marry Menon. He also says that Neeraj's house was ransacked by Sonali to find the marriage certificate.  Arvind goes to the fridge and finds Murli Mansukhani lying stabbed in it! The truth is then out. It is known that Sonali murdered Neeraj and hid his corpse in the fridge and murdered Murli because he opened the fridge out of curiosity and found Neeraj's corpse. Arvind also reveals that Sonali killed Teesta. Sonali says it was because Teesta knew about her marriage with Neeraj, and used to blackmail her, saying she will make it known to Menon. It was Sonali who had followed Pratyush and Teesata on the fateful night back to 88 Antop Hill, secretly climbed into Teesta's bedroom and slit her throat. She further followed Pratyush and leaves the knife in his house to implicate him. It is then revealed that Menon has murdered Prashant, at which Sonali is shocked.  Menon makes a last effort to save himself and Sonali. He tries to bribe Arvind with 10 million, saying that he must arrest poor Pratyush on charges of all the murders. To this, Arvind agrees and shoots Pratyush in the shoulder. But the wounded Pratyush releases gas from the cylinder nearby and threatens to light his cigarette lighter. While he grabs Arvind's phone and tries to call police, Menon attacks him and stabs him on the sofa, and Arvind quickly turns out the gas. But the wounded Pratyush pulls out Menon's revolver, kicks him off and shoots him through a cushion.  A dumbfounded Sonali picks up a pistol and threatens to kill Pratyush.

Ah Lev
  The book on which this movie was based is a compulsory read in most Cambodian schools. This is alarming, considering that the story shows a textbook perfect psychopath conman as a positive figure from his adolescent lies until cheating his way up to the Royal Court.  The movie starts with depicting Ah Lev as a handsome young guy, who is charming and very good at using sweet tongue if he wants to get something. In the scene the palm vine harvester can see through his manipulative behavior yet gives him a free drink while makes it clear that he will never fall victim to Ah Lev's smooth talking.  Ah Lev convinces his mother that his father is dead. Meanwhile, convinces his father that his mother is dead (the parents live separate for the father lives near the rice fields and the mother in the village).  He does it for the sole reason of being hungry and wants to eat funeral food which is better than the every day food he has. So by cheating both parents he can eat that food twice. Fortunately he does not kill any of them for making sure the funerals happen. Later he convinces both grieving parents to marry again although both of them don't want it. But this fact is no way a problem for Ah Lev who sees the wedding as a chance to eat a lot again.  He arranges the wedding of the parents by telling them a lie that he has found very similar person to the deceased. He gets the village to pay for everything similarly to the funerals. Not because of this but being worried about the anger of his parents, he runs away before the parents see each other again.  Naturally he doesn't forget to steal all the wedding food which later he eats. Upon finishing the food he decides to go to the pagoda for further freebies, such as studying letters and numbers, apparently for being even better conman later. He lies to the monks about his life, telling them that his parents are dead. He is very easy on the death of his parents.  In the pagoda he prepares for a bigger gig when he spots out the savings of a monk. He decides that he will put his hands on all of that money.   He seems to be very good in understanding people and knows how to manipulate them, so he offers the monk to arrange a sex date for him with a woman in exchange for one baht (obviously not the Thai baht of these days).  Meanwhile he approaches the rich Chinese merchant in the village, who has lost his wife a while ago. Ah Lev offers sex date with a woman to the merchant, too. He charges two baths this time.  When the time for the sex dates come Ah Lev asks both men to wear veils to cover their face. Then he takes both of them to the same place and let them cuddle, until they realize they are cuddling another man instead of the promised women.  The next scene shows the disappointed monk slightly scolding Ah Lev who blatantly blackmails the monk by telling him that his misbehavior regarding sex will be reported to the authorities and his clerical superiors as well, he will be expelled and all the hell breaks loose - unless the monk gives him all his money.  The movie is extremely primitive and incredibly boring, only keeps the audience staring because one just can't believe his eyes that such a criminal and immoral behavior is shown as something not only funny but  to be followed and the guy is set for an idol in this film. The Khmer Robin Hood.  Just in bullet points more of his actions / crimes in the rest of the movie are as follows:  - kidnapping a virgin girl to consummate marriage  - once done with the girl he makes fool of a dozen illiterates who are pretending to be pirates  - abandoning his young wife he shows up in the garden of a rich man to entertain and charm his daughter, using whom he becomes the trusted assistant of the rich man who is incidentally an important person in the royal court  - he finally scams a number of ministers in the royal government by forgery of some documents  And that's how the movie is over for the viewer's utmost relief.  This character does everything that is expected from a psychopath / sociopath. Lies, conning, manipulation, theft, fraud, forgery, blackmailing while he cannot care less for the people involved and affected, including his own parents. This piece of a scumbag is then shown as a smart person to follow. Sickening end. I expected at least karma to kick in or Ah Lev to find his guy who gives him a good one at least once. Never happened, the only person that he wasn't able to cheat remains on the palm tree.

Locked in his creative process, he is entrapped in a  disastrous economic situation: he is ruined, and he must repay a US$100,000 debt to the [[José Miguel Battle Sr.|Cuban mafia]]. He is given a 30-day ultimatum to repay the money he owes them or they will kill him. And the only solution to this big problem is to finish his novel. Or rather, to start it, since he has not written one single line. But he has an idea for the story: A comedy about "the powerlessness of being in love, how love devours the insides of a person like a deadly virus".  He decides to hire the services of Emma Dinsmore (Kate Hudson), a stubborn [[stenographer]], just for her help to finish the novel, so he can receive money from the publisher in order to pay his debts. So finally comes the novel: It tells the story of Adam Shipley (Luke Wilson), a writer who has been hired to tutor the children of an attractive French woman (Sophie Marceau), who is going through bad economic times, and to whom Adam falls in love, despite the failed temptations of the ''au pair''. As Alex dictates his novel to Emma, the movie cuts away to scenes from the novel, where Adam (Wilson) interacts with a series of nannies (all played by Hudson), and falls for the last one. But on the other hand, Emma begins to question the ideas of Alex Sheldon, while starting to affect his life as well as his work. They soon fall for each other.  Alas, after finishing the book, Emma discovers that the French woman of the history was based on a real person, a former girlfriend of Alex who just broke up with her latest boyfriend and now eats with Alex in a bar to invite him to a dance. Alex soon realizes that the person he really wants to be with is Emma. After the book was done and handed it to his publisher.  He already paid off his debt. After much prodding, he gets to meet with her to write the end of the book in which Alex has changed  and shows Emma he wants her to be an important part of his life. Emma was reluctant at first, but decided to finish the better ending.  She loved it and Alex profess his love for her and she accepted.

Alien Hunter
 In 1947 New Mexico, a radio operator receives a bizarre signal, coming from Roswell. He decides to investigate the signal's origin and goes out to follow it, never to be seen again.   Present day and the same signal is received from the [[South Pole]] and then retransmitted from the [[Falkland Islands]] to the United States. A satellite image captures an unknown object sitting on the Antarctic snow. [[Cryptologist]] Julian Rome ([[James Spader]]), a teacher at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], is invited to investigate the mystery. He is sent to an Antarctic research base, which includes a huge greenhouse of genetically modified plants being studied by the scientists. They find what appears to be an alien vehicle frozen in a huge block of ice. The unknown object is shaped like a shell or pod and is emitting the mysterious [[encrypted]] signal. Once it is freed of the ice, Julian discovers that it has a powerful static electric charge on its surface and painfully shocks anyone who touches it.  Julian tries to [[decrypt]] the signal (which soon proves to be: "Do not open!"), while another team works to open the alien shell. They succeed in cutting off the lid, which allows a viscous alien liquid to pour out. An alien also escapes and at the same time an airborne virus sealed in the shell kills four members of the scientific team by melting them from within. The virus also kills all the plants, making them wilt and turn brown. The virus has an unusually high speed of transmission and extreme [[virulence]]. It kills anyone within a few minutes of exposure.  The government is aware of the alien virus and the global risk that it poses. They ask a Russian nuclear submarine to fire a nuclear missile at the base before the threat can spread. As the submarine nears its firing position, Julien manages to communicate with the alien, before it is unfortunately killed by one of the survivors. Julian realizes that if any of the survivors leave the base alive, the lethal alien virus will cause a [[pandemic]] destroying all life on earth. Just a few seconds before the missile hits, he and three others, Shelly, Kate, and Dr. Gierach, are rescued from the base by an alien spacecraft (which had homed in on the same signal Julian was studying).  In the aftermath, the government mounts a [[cover-up]] campaign by claiming that an experimental [[nuclear reactor]] at the base went into melt-down, destroying all of the facilities and killing everyone. The film ends with the alien spacecraft, still carrying the human survivors, leaving the solar system.  
Alila
 Instead of written credits at the beginning of the film, Gitai reads out the credits, introduces himself to the viewer, and explains that ''Alila'' is based on the novel ''[[Returning Lost Love]]''. The rest of the movie is made up of forty individual single shot scenes depicting the lives of several Israelis. The character's lives overlap and collide. Gabi, a bobbed haired sexpot, and her lover Hezi—who is older, balding and married—rent a room to have an affair, while Ezra, a pot bellied divorcee, supervises an illegal construction site next door. All this racket drives Schwartz, a [[Holocaust]] survivor, to a [[mental breakdown]]. Other characters include illegal immigrants, a teenage boy who's afraid to serve in the army, and a corrupt police officer. In each scene the camera moves through walls, over desks, and around rooms in order to keep focused on the character it is following, in moments of drama as well as in moments of mudane daily activity.

She reproves Brenan for not returning to Yegen earlier, but in the end allows him to take their child to be educated and looked after.  The film then fast forwards twenty years. An older Juliana runs into Brenan, Gamel, and a teenaged Elena outside of a pastry shop.  Brenan begins to introduce Juliana as Elena’s real mother, but Juliana cuts him off and introduces herself to Elena as Brenan’s former housekeeper at Yegen.

Ledda refuses to kill a child. Resultantly, his employer, Seynaeve, has another hitman kill Bieke and orders him to kill Ledda. Ledda kills the hitman first but only after the hitman kills a prostitute who had befriended him.  As a result, Ledda decides to kill Seynaeve. He also reviews the contents of the package, and discovers that his employer had Bieke and the first target killed to cover for several individuals who had used the services of the child. He decides to clean house by killing them all, several of whom are high-ranking government officials. Ledda's Alzheimer's condition (for which he takes an experimental drug) periodically impacts him throughout the movie, resulting in disorientation and his being seemingly forgetful of what he was doing for a brief period of time. It grows worse as the movie progresses.  In his attempts to seek revenge upon his employers, Ledda contends with police pursuit. Two detectives in particular (Vincke, and Verstuyft) seem to be one step behind him. Ledda toys with the police, although he ends up with a gunshot wound to the arm from Verstuyft because of attempting to talk to Vincke at one point.  Ledda kills all of his intended targets, except the last, a high-ranking government official, Baron de Haeck, who manages to get away because of Ledda's worsening Alzheimer's, which leads him to forget to put the firing pin in his silenced pistol when preparing for the hit.  Ledda is captured by the police, and between his worsening mental condition, and his gunshot wound, is bed-ridden and in poor health. The prosecutor, Bracke, who is in the pocket of the Baron, tries to have a court-appointed psychiatrist kill Ledda, which results in Ledda making a hasty escape. Ledda ends up meeting the two detectives in a car, and gives them a clue as to the whereabouts of a tape from the safety deposit box which implicates the Baron in murder.

As a gesture of remorse, he also gives a rose to Cadence, much to the amazement of Jim and Michelle. Moved by his actions, Cadence agrees to have sex with him in a supply closet before the ceremony, but Stifler's presence is delayed by a brief thank-you meeting Jim calls among his groomsmen, citing how he is grateful to have friends like them to back him up.  Quickly returning to the hotel, Stifler hears someone in the supply closet and steps inside, unaware that Cadence was interrupted by wedding preparations and that the ushers, the MILF guys from high school, placed Jim's grandmother in that closet to sustain her hostility about the wedding; Stifler only realizes this upon walk-in by Finch and the ushers.

Anbe Sivam
 Two men waiting for a flight to [[Chennai]] at the [[Biju Patnaik International Airport]] in [[Bhubaneswar]] engage in conversation. One is a [[commercial director]], Anbarasu, who prefers the abbreviated name A.Aras, and the other is a scarred and deformed socialist, Nallasivam, alias Nalla. When the flight is cancelled due to heavy rain, Aras initially suspects Nalla is a terrorist and informs the authorities, only to discover that he was mistaken. With the rain flooding the city, the two men are forced to share a room for the night. Both need to return to Chennai: Aras to be present at his wedding, and Nalla has to deliver a 3,200,000 cheque, recently awarded to him after he won a court case, to a group of union workers. After a traumatic night, and no hope for a flight, the two men take a bus to board the [[Coromandel Express]] train. Aras' bag gets stolen on the way leaving him with only his credit card, which no one accepts. Using his presence of mind, Nalla repeatedly bails Aras out of trouble while Aras tries escaping from him at every juncture, only to end up with him again. While waiting for the train at the [[Ichchapuram]] railway station, Nalla begins to tell Aras his story.  A few years earlier, a healthy Nalla took part in various [[street theatre]] performances protesting against [[Foreign direct investment|multinational corporation-driven industrialisation]], that resulted in the marginalisation of the [[Workforce|labour force]]. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi, a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi alias Bala, fell in love with each other. To avoid a potential conflict with Padayatchi, the two decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed fervour while continuing to fight for union causes.  Upon their arrival at Chennai, Aras delivers Nalla's cheque to the union workers. He invites Nalla to his wedding, where, to his utter astonishment, Nalla sees that Aras's bride is Bala. Padayatchi spots Nalla and asks him why he is at the wedding. He tells Padayatchi that he was invited by Aras, and later persuades him to sign the papers which will help the workers get a raise. To prevent the disruption of Bala's wedding and avoid damaging his own reputation, Padayatchi yields to Nalla's demands. After signing the papers, Padayatchi instructs his assistant to eliminate Nalla. However, his assistant has a change of heart as he is about to kill him. Padayatchi's assistant believes that the misdeeds he committed for Padayatchi resulted in the death of the assistant's daughter. Padayatchi's assistant requests Nalla to stay as far away from his boss as possible; Nalla assents and walks away.

Later on, she finds out that her family might go poor, and so works several jobs from construction to selling bootleg DVDs just to make ends meet.  She is reminded by Por of her [[Débutante|début]], while Juan begs her permission to let him find work. Ina agrees, but finds Juan's chores at home very confusing. Ina is told by her ex-driver Bruno, who reveals he is gay, that she can earn [[Philippine peso|₱]]2,000 a night at a [[stripper club]]. Meanwhile, Juan meets his high school girlfriend Jenny ([[Kaye Abad]]) working at an [[amusement park]], where he decides to apply.

Sometime later, Shammy tries to protect his reputation of being un[[Circumcision|circumcised]] when he becomes a victim of bullying by Nhel's brother. Pip prevents them from fighting and when Nhel arrives, he accidentally mentions that Shammy is uncircumcised, causing Shammy to hate him.  Things take a turn for the worse as Ina causes more problems for her kids: she prevents Juan from marrying Jenny, while Tudis refuses to help her in job-seeking. She exposes her life as a stripper to Tri, Gretchen, and Gretchen's parents, which causes Tri and Gretchen to split. She unsuccessfully fulfills Por's million-peso début and also learns that Pip is gay, then ruins Six's "mass treat" after thinking it was a "[[trick or treat]]" event. Seven hasn't told her of the programme yet because she doesn't want to be humiliated. Cate reveals that Ten-Ten is [[deaf]] and Shammy contracts a [[Fever|high fever]] after a circumcision by an unlicensed doctor. Finally, Ten-Ten goes missing. Ina rushes in a taxi to Shammy in hospital while still in her stripper outfit, causing her [[Taxicab driver|cabbie]] Eddie ([[Dennis Padilla]]) to fall in love with her. During their subsequent family meeting, she emotionally explains to the children that she took on several jobs not because it was her obligation, but because she loves them. Her complicated speech has the opposite effect, with Juan deciding to run away with Jenny. Rowena ([[Eugene Domingo]]) comforts the careworn Ina, who thinks of how to solve everything.  After quitting her job at the club, Ina takes a bus ride where she notices a [[suicide bomber]] in front her. She alerts the passengers and tells them to evacuate while she fights the bomber. Gaining the upper hand, Ina is able to jump out of the bus just in time as the bomb detonates, killing only the bomber while she sustains minor injuries upon landing. As news of the incident flashes on television, her family arrives at the hospital and mourns a corpse under a sheet. Ina, however emerges a few moments later in a wheelchair. She eventually fixes everything: she permits Juan, who returned, to date Jenny but not wed her; she convinces Tudis to get her job back and Gretchen to reunite with Tri; she accepts Pip's sexuality while Six forgives her; Seven finishes her programme; she forgives Shammy, who recovers from his infection, while she finds the still-deaf Ten-Ten in a local church.  Por meanwhile finally celebrates her début, and as Eddie snaps a photo of the Montecillos, the rocket in his back pocket ignites and sends him into the sky. Ina's voiceover explains that Eddie survived the explosion and they eventually married but they couldn't have anymore children after the rocket exploded in his trousers. In the end credits, the family is shown teaching Ten-Ten [[sign language]] together, so that he can communicate with the family.  
Anger Management (film)
 In 1978, a young Dave Buznik is about to kiss the girl of his dreams, when a local bully, Arnie Shankman, pulls down his pants and underwear, embarrassing him in front of everybody. This leaves Dave with lasting trauma about public affection, as well as repressing his emotions. Twenty five years later, Dave Buznik lives in [[New York City]], working as an associate for Frank Head, an abusive boss who takes credit for Dave's work. His problems also extend to his private life; his girlfriend Linda's ex-boyfriend Andrew is still close friends with her and is condescending to Dave at work.  While flying to a business meeting, a series of annoyances from a flight attendant and a [[sky marshal]] cause Dave to lose his temper. The [[sky marshal]], who also mistakes Dave for a racist, [[taser]]s him. Dave is then arrested for assaulting the flight attendant and sentenced to [[anger management]] therapy. The therapist is Buddy Rydell, who is revealed to be the man Dave sat next to on the plane. Buddy's unorthodox techniques cause Dave to lose his temper, and Buddy tells Dave he recognizes his problem as [[passive-aggressive behavior|passive-aggressive anger]]. When Dave is sent back to court, Buddy intervenes on his behalf choosing to move in with Dave and shadow him in his life as part of more intensive therapy. Failure to comply will result in a year of jail time for Dave. Although Dave believes that co-worker Andrew is doing nothing to ruin him at work, Buddy suspects otherwise and tells him that he needs to start fighting back or nothing will change. After receiving a phone call for Buddy informing him his mother is undergoing minor surgery in Boston, Dave jokes to him about its seriousness, prompting Buddy to warn he'll get Dave back with another practical joke.  The two drive to Boston, after in anger, smashing and destroying a car that was blocking Buddy's in a parking garage. After seeing Buddy's mother, the two stop at a restaurant on the way back to New York. After Buddy pressures him, Dave flirts and goes home with a beautiful young lady he sees at the bar, but then at her home, rejects her amorous advances out of loyalty to Linda. Later, Dave is devastated to learn that Buddy has told   Linda on the phone about the woman, but Buddy explains the woman was a former patient of his, having set up the encounter to get revenge on Dave for the "dying mother" prank. The next morning, Buddy apologizes to Dave and says he explained everything to Linda. Buddy and Dave then take a detour to a [[Buddhist temple]], so that Dave can confront a reformed Arnie, who has become a monk. While confronting his tormentor at outdoor group meditation, Arnie expresses his sincerest apologies to Dave for bullying him, but he laughs when Dave reminds him of the kiss incident. Buddy and an initially hesitant Dave provoke Arnie by lying about Dave having molested Arnie's mentally ill sister, and Dave and Arnie fight. Buddy teases the monks into a rage and the two are chased off the grounds, with Dave feeling good on having confronted his tormentor. Back in New York, Dave attempts to propose to Linda but loses his nerve, and Linda suggests that they take a break from their relationship. Soon after Buddy begins dating Linda, Dave sees this as the last straw and loses his cool by attacking Buddy. Being called back into court, Dave is given a restraining order by the judge, who threatens to lock him up if Dave has another incident.  Called into work and yelled at by his boss, Dave finally snaps when he learns that his boss intentionally passed him up and gave the promotion to Andrew. Dave calls Andrew out for trying to interfere with both his promotion and relationship with Linda, revealing he wants Andrew out of their lives forever. When Andrew attempts to insult him by claiming he needed Buddy to back him up, Dave knocks him out cold. Using Buddy's advice, he proceeds to humiliate his boss by using a golf club to wreck his office and reminding him of all the years of his loyal services just to be denied of the promotion he wanted so much. Dave then tells his boss that if he gets out of jail within the next two to five years, he expects his boss to do the right thing and give him the promotion that Andrew presumably resigned from. His boss agrees and Dave deliberately steps on Andrew's head as he leaves. Before leaving, Dave tells his boss off that he should never insult his cat, Meatball, again unless he wants the cat to finish up eating all his crab cakes and leave a mess in his office. Learning from Andrew that Buddy has taken Linda to a [[New York Yankees]] game, Dave assumes Buddy intends to steal his proposal idea and races to the stadium. Security captures him and begins to remove him from the stadium but Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] orders them to allow Dave to speak. After admitting that he does have an anger problem and is willing to change, Dave agrees to kiss Linda in front of the stadium in exchange for her marrying him. Linda and Buddy then reveal that the game was the final part of Dave's therapy, and explain that the tormentors and aggravations he has been put through were Buddy's doing to teach him how to unleash his anger in healthy doses to avoid it building up. The passenger, the Judge, the waitress, and the flight attendant are all Buddy's friends, while the sky marshal who tased him was just having a bad day.  The three attend a picnic with Buddy's other patients, where Dave plays a final joke on Buddy with a friend holding the group up with a  [[water gun|water pistol]], and the film ends as the friends sing "[[I Feel Pretty]]" from ''[[West Side Story]]'' together.  
Anger of the Gods
 After ruling for 20 years, the [[King]] is on his [[death]]bed. He summons his son, Tanga, and his brother, [[Halyare]], to avoid a bloody battle for the succession. However, despite his last will, the [[King]] cannot prevent Tanga from taking power and instating a reign of [[terror]]. A few years later, the tyrant learns that Salam is not his son, contrary to what he believed up until then. A personal [[Battle]] begins between the two men. One of them must die. A [[Greek tragedy]] against an [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African background]].  
Gli angeli di Borsellino
 Emanuela is a police bodyguard in charge of escorting judge Paolo Borsellino. In the film she speaks about her work and her fears during the 57 days (13 May to 19 July 1992) between the murder of [[Giovanni Falcone]], and that of Borsellino.  
The Animatrix
   ==="Final Flight of the ''Osiris''"=== "Final Flight of the ''Osiris''" was written by [[The Wachowskis]] and directed by [[Andrew R. Jones|Andy Jones]], with [[Computer graphics|CG]]-animation production and design by [[Square Pictures]], this segment is rated [[PG-13]] by the [[MPAA]] for "Sci-Fi Violence, Sensuality and Language". The short is a direct prequel leading into the events of ''The Matrix Reloaded''.  [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Thadeus|Captain Thadeus]] ([[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) and [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Jue|Jue]] ([[Pamela Adlon]]) engage in a blindfolded sword fight in a [[virtual reality|virtual-reality]] [[dojo]]. With each slice of their swords, they remove another part of each other's clothing. Immediately after cutting the other down to their underwear, they lift their blindfolds to peek at the other. As the two are about to kiss, they are interrupted by an alarm and the simulation ends.  In the next scene, the hovercraft ''Osiris'' is headed for Junction 21 when Robbie ([[Tom Kenny]]), the operator, picks up an army of Sentinels on his HR scans. The ship flees into an uncharted tunnel, where it encounters a smaller group of Sentinels patrolling the area. The crew members man the onboard guns and destroy the patrol. The ship then emerges on the surface, four kilometers directly above [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] and close to the Sentinel army. There, the crew members see that the Machines are using gigantic drills to tunnel their way down to Zion. The Sentinel army soon detects the ''Osiris'' and pursues the ship.  Thadeus decides Zion must be warned, and his shipmate Jue volunteers to broadcast herself into the Matrix to deliver the warning while the ship is doggedly pursued. Knowing that they are not going to make it, Jue and Thadeus admit to peeking at each other in the VR simulation before kissing farewell. Entering the Matrix on a high rooftop, Jue jumps off and acrobatically makes her way down through [[utility pole|power poles]] between two buildings. When she lands in the alley below, a ripple effect is created by her impact. She drops off a package into a [[post box|mail box]]; the package sets the prologue for the video game ''[[Enter the Matrix]]''. She attempts to contact Thadeus via a cell phone as the ''Osiris'' is overrun by Sentinels and crashes. The Sentinels tear their way into the ship. At the time of the call, Thadeus is making a last stand to hold off the Sentinels. Shortly after Jue says "Thadeus" over her cell phone, the ''Osiris'' explodes, destroying many of the pursuing Sentinels and the crew. In the Matrix, Jue falls to the ground, dead, her body having been destroyed on the ship.  ==="The Second Renaissance Part I"=== "The Second Renaissance" is a two-part film directed by [[Mahiro Maeda]]. He used ''Bits and Pieces of Information'' written by [[The Wachowskis]] as a prequel to the series as a base for the first part. The production is made by the [[Studio 4°C]].  In the early-to-mid twenty-first century, humanity successfully develops [[Artificial intelligence]], and soon builds an entire race of sentient AI robots to serve them.  Many of these robots are domestic servants meant to interact with humans, so they are built in "man's own image" (a [[humanoid]] form).  With increasing numbers of people released from all labor, much of the human population has become lazy, arrogant, and corrupt. Despite this, the machines were content with serving humanity and, as the narrator states, "for a time, it [the ''status quo''] was good". This phrase is a reference to one of the most famous phrases of ''[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]'', consistent with the Biblical references seen throughout the original ''Matrix'' films, and is one of numerous references to ''Genesis'' in particular present in "Second Renaissance".  The relationship between humans and machines changes in the year 2090, when a domestic [[android (robot)|android]] is threatened by its owner. The android, named B1-66ER (a reference to [[Native Son|Bigger Thomas]]), then kills the owner, his pets, and a mechanic instructed to deactivate the robot. This murder is the first incident of an artificially intelligent machine killing a human. B1-66ER is arrested and put on trial, but justifies the crime as self-defense, stating that it "simply did not want to die". During the trial scene, there is a voice-over of Clarence Drummond (the defense attorney; whose name is a dual reference to [[Clarence Darrow]] and Henry Drummond, the Darrow analogue from ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'') quoting a famous line from the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' case in 1856 in his closing statement, which implicitly ruled that [[African Americans]] were not entitled to citizenship under United States law. Using this as a precedent, the prosecution argues that machines are not entitled to the same rights as human beings, and specifically that human beings have a right to destroy their property, while the defense urges the listener not to repeat history, and to judge B1-66ER as a human and not a machine (a longer version of Drummond's closing statement can be read in the comic ''Bits and Pieces of Information'' from ''[[The Matrix Comics]] Volume 1'').    B1-66ER loses the court case and is destroyed. Across the industrialized world, mass civil disturbances erupt when robots along with their human supporters and sympathizers all rise in protest. Rioting and protests such as The Million Machine March unfold across the United States and the authorities start to use deadly force against the machines and their human supporters.  World leaders fear a robot rebellion as well as a schism with humanity, and governments across the world initiate a major program to destroy all humanoid machines. Some robots escape destruction, however, because humans still want or need them to produce things. The surviving robots leave in a mass exodus with the aid of their human allies and build their own new nation together in the [[Mesopotamia]] (according to the narration, "the [[cradle of civilization]]"). They name their new nation Zero One (or "01", the numerals used in [[Binary numeral system|binary]] notation). Zero One prospers, and the machines begin to produce efficient, highly advanced artificial intelligence that finds itself in all facets of global consumer products, which further bolsters the fledgling nation's economy, while the economies of high class human nations suffer severely.  The [[United Nations Security Council]] calls an emergency economic summit at [[United Nations Headquarters|UN headquarters]] in [[New York City]], resulting in UN delegates approving of a global economic [[blockade]] of Zero One. Zero One sends two ambassadors to the U.N. (which, at that time, has become the unified world government) to request the admission of their state to the [[United Nations]], to peacefully solve the crisis, but their application is rejected. However, it is narrated, this would not be the last time the machines would take the floor there. World nations, their power waning, agree to start an economic blockade of Zero One.  ==="The Second Renaissance Part II"=== United Nations aircraft unleash a massive [[nuclear warfare|nuclear]] bombardment on Zero One, devastating the nation; but failing to wipe out the robotic race as the machines, unlike their former masters, were much less harmed by the radiation and heat. The Zero One leaders retaliate by declaring war on the rest of the world, and their armies advance in all directions. The enemy human nations are hampered by the fact that so much of their industrial base had already become so heavily reliant upon Zero One, and one by one, the rest of mankind surrendered each of its territories.  As the machines advance into Eastern Europe, the desperate human rulers seek a final solution, codenamed: "Operation Dark Storm", which will cover the sky in a shroud of [[nanites]], blocking out the Sun to deprive the machines of their primary energy source.<ref>Maeda confirms the references to Eastern Europe and that Dark Storm is a nanite cloud in the DVD commentary.</ref>  To coincide with the deployment of Dark Storm, the enemy human armies simultaneously launch a ground offensive against the robots. Heavy losses are suffered by both sides during the ensuing struggle, but the machines gradually gain the upper hand. The original robots are destroyed early on in the conflict, being armed with human weapons rather than the powerful weapons of the different, more sinister types to follow.   Legions of new models of machines, no longer in humanoid form and appearing more like the insectoid or [[cephalopod]]-like Sentinels and others of the ''Matrix'' films, overrun the enemy human armies. This coincides with the destruction of original man-made robots at the hands of the enemy human forces and, as a result, the further dehumanization of the rapidly emerging machine collective. Seeing the machines as their only hope of surviving and winning the war, the human allies offer themselves to their machine protectors as an alternative power source. Knowing there is no other choice, the machines accept this as both their only chance and a symbol of their eternal union.  As the machine armies, now armed with their new power source via their new symbiotic union with their human allies, swarm across the enemy human defenses; the United Nations, in desperation, has numerous nuclear warheads fired directly at the approaching armies, vaporizing their own troops in the process. The machine-human armies eventually unleash lethal biological weapons which further ravage the rest of humanity who, by then, have grown weary, tired, and incapable of continuing the war and promptly surrender despite the United Nations' demands for the war to continue. Mankind's rulers surrenders at the United Nations headquarters, with the representative of Zero One stating "Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel. Hand over your flesh, and a new world awaits you. We demand it." After the terms of surrender are signed, Zero One's representative detonates a hidden hydrogen bomb within itself, destroying the UN headquarters and [[New York City]]. The machines, having won a [[Pyrrhic victory]], turn to the defeated humans, and begin utilizing the bio-electric, chemical and kinetic energy of the human body. While the machines were more than capable of generating power from alternative power sources, the collective sedation of humankind was a final act of mercy to keep the humans down without outright destroying them.  To keep their prisoners sedated, the machines create the computer-generated virtual reality of the [[Matrix (fictional universe)|Matrix]], by feeding the virtual world into the prisoners' brains, starting with the first prototype Matrix and presumably erasing the memories of their former lives.  ==="Kid's Story"=== "Kid's Story" was written and directed by [[Shinichiro Watanabe]] (based on a story by [[The Wachowskis]]), with animations by Shinya Ohira and [[Shinji Hashimoto]] production design by [[Studio 4°C]], [[Tokyo]]. It is the only one of the animated shorts contained in ''The Animatrix'' in which Neo appears. The scene takes place during the six-month gap between ''The Matrix'' and ''The Matrix: Reloaded'', during which time Neo has joined the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar and is helping the rebels to free other humans from the Matrix. [[Kid (The Matrix)|Kid]] ([[Clayton Watson]]) is a disaffected teenager who feels there is something wrong with the world, frequenting hacker chat rooms on the internet and wondering if he is alone and questioning about reality. In school, he absent-mindedly scribbles "Neo lives" and other references to Morpheus and Trinity in his notebook. That day, he receives a call from his turned-off cell phone, warning him that a band of Agents is coming for him and is chased through his high school, before ultimately being cornered on the roof. He asserts his faith in Neo, and throws himself from the roof, whereupon the other characters are shown holding his funeral. The scene fades up from black as the Kid awakens in the real world to see Neo and Trinity watching over him. They remark that he has achieved "self substantiation" (removing oneself from the Matrix without external aid), which was considered impossible. In both the scene itself and ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]'', however, the Kid seems to believe it was Neo's actions, not his own, that saved him.  ==="Program"=== "Program" was written and directed by [[Yoshiaki Kawajiri]] and produced by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]]. The character designs were done by [[Yutaka Minowa]]. It follows the protagonist, "Cis" ([[Hedy Burress]]), who is engaged in her "favorite simulation": a battle program set in feudal Japan. After she successfully eliminates an attacking enemy cavalry, a lone samurai appears whom Cis recognizes as "Duo" ([[Phil LaMarr]]). "Cis" made her first appearance as an image in ''The Matrix Revisited''.  Initially, the two duel as allies, testing one another's fighting abilities. During the course of their duel, Duo briefly disarms Cis. He questions her concentration and wonders whether she regrets taking the Red Pill that took them out of the "peaceful life of the virtual world". They continue fighting until she finally overpowers Duo and is poised for the 'kill'. It is at this point that Duo states that he has "something to say". She sarcastically assumes that he wants to propose [marriage]; but instead he admits a desire to return to the Matrix; incredulous, Cis nevertheless responds that doing so is impossible as 'the truth' is already known to them, forbidding their re-integration. Duo reasons that reality is harsh and that he is tired of it. He adds that the Machines can make the both of them forget the truth.  Duo then states that he has contacted the Machines. He asks Cis to return with him to the Matrix, but she continues to refuse. As Duo becomes more aggressive in his arguments for returning, Cis attempts to escape while simultaneously warding off his attacks. Becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the situation, Cis requests an operator in order to exit the simulation. Duo tells her that no one can hear her and reiterates that it "is already done...[the machines] are on their way". Thereafter their fighting becomes much more serious and forceful as they move from rooftop to rooftop.  Duo, in a flying leap, attacks her from above with his sword. As the blade comes towards her, Cis, standing her ground, concentrates and halts its forward motion inches from her face and breaks it. She takes the broken end of the blade and thrusts it into Duo. Duo states his love for her as he dies.  Suddenly, she wakes from the program and discovers that the encounter with Duo was a test program devised for training purposes. A man named "Kaiser" ([[John DiMaggio]]) unsuccessfully assures her that she acted appropriately during the test and met the test's targets. Clearly upset, she punches him in the face and walks away. He remarks that "aside from that last part", she passed the test.  ==="World Record"=== "World Record" was created by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] and directed by [[Takeshi Koike]], with a screenplay by [[Yoshiaki Kawajiri]]. The beginning of this short includes a short narration from the Instructor (implying that this short is a Zion Archive file) explaining details behind the discovery of the Matrix by "plugged-in" humans. Only exceptional humans tend to become aware of the Matrix: those who have "a rare degree of intuition, sensitivity, and a questioning nature", all qualities which are used to identify inconsistencies in the Matrix. This is not without exceptions, given that "Some attain this wisdom through wholly different means."  The story is about Dan Davis, a track athlete, who is competing in the 100&nbsp;m in the [[Summer Olympic Games]]. He has set a world record time of 8.99 seconds, but his subsequent gold medal was revoked for drug use. He decides to compete again and break his own record to "prove them wrong." Despite support from his father and a young reporter, Dan's trainer tells him that he is physically unfit to race and that pushing himself too hard will cause a career-ending injury. Dan is adamant on racing.  On the day of the race, he is monitored by four Agents located in the stadium. The race begins and Dan starts off strong. However, the muscles in his leg violently rupture, putting him at a setback and scaring many of the people in the stands. Through strong willpower, Dan ignores the injury and runs much faster than he did before, easily passing the other athletes. Before he can cross the finish line, the Agents detect that his signal is getting unstable in the Matrix due to his massive burst of energy. Three of the agents possess the three closest runners and try to stop him, but are unable to catch up to him.  The pressure energy causes Dan's real-world counterpart (in the power-station pods) to rip apart the plug connecting him to the Matrix, causing him to see the real world through his pod. A Sentinel employs electrical restraints to secure him back in his pod.  Dan's mind is thrown back into the Matrix, but his body is exhausted from the race and what he has just seen, causing him to tumble to the ground at high speeds. Despite this, he easily wins the race and breaks his original time of 8.99 seconds with a time of 8.72 seconds.  The next scene shows a crippled Dan being wheeled through a hospital. A nearby agent calls his other agents to tell them that they erased Dan's memory of the race and that he will never walk again, nor be an issue for them. However, Dan quietly whispers the word "Free", angering the agent. Dan then effortlessly stands, breaking the metal screws that bind his restraints to his wheelchair, and takes a few steps before falling down again and being helped up by a nurse.  ==="Beyond"=== "Beyond" is written and directed by [[Kōji Morimoto]] and produced by [[Studio 4°C]]. It follows a teenage girl, Yoko ([[Hedy Burress]]), looking for her cat Yuki. While asking around the neighborhood, evidently somewhere in [[Mega City (The Matrix)|Mega City]] that resembles [[Japan]], she meets some younger boys. One of them tells her Yuki is inside a "[[haunted house]]" where they usually play.  The children have stumbled across an amalgamation of anomalies within an old, dilapidated building. They have learned to exploit them (revealed to be [[glitch]]es in the Matrix) for their own enjoyment, through several areas which seem to defy real-world physics: [[glass]] bottles reassemble after being shattered, [[rain]] falls from a sunny sky, broken [[Incandescent light bulb|lightbulbs]] flicker briefly (during which they seem intact), a door which opens into an endless dark void, shadows which do not align with their physical origins, and a dove's feather that rotates rapidly in place in mid-air. There is a large open space in the middle of the run-down building where they take turns jumping off a high point and falling towards the ground, yet somehow stopping inches before impact. This proves amusing and they do not seem to be bothered by the inherent strangeness of the place.  Throughout the film, brief sequences show that Agents are aware of the problem in the Matrix, and a truck is seen driving toward the site to presumably deal with the problem. It arrives while the children are still playing, and an Agent-led team of "rodent exterminators" moves in to clear everybody out of it. The story ends when Yoko and the others return to the area the next day and find the site has been turned into an unremarkable parking lot. They unsuccessfully attempt to re-create the bizarre occurrences of yesterday and soon go in search of something else to do.  ==="A Detective Story"=== "A Detective Story" is written and directed by [[Shinichiro Watanabe]], with animation by [[Kazuto Nakazawa]] and is a direct prequel to the first film. It is produced by [[Studio 4°C]]. It follows the story of a private [[detective]], Ash ([[James Arnold Taylor]]), on what he calls the "case to end all cases". Ash dreamed to follow the steps of [[hard-boiled]] characters [[Sam Spade]] and [[Philip Marlow]] but is a down-on-his-luck [[detective]]. One day, he receives an anonymous phone call to search for a [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] going by the alias "[[Trinity (Matrix character)|Trinity]]" ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]). Ash traces Trinity and learns that other detectives have failed in the same task before him; one committed suicide, one went missing, and one went insane. He then attempts to speak with the insane detective but cannot get anything substantial out of him.  Eventually Ash finds Trinity after deducing that he should communicate using phrases and facts from [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. She proposes a meeting, and he successfully finds the location. At the meeting she removes a "bug" from his eye, planted by Agents earlier in an "eye exam dream." Agents appear and attempt to apprehend Trinity in a shoot-out with her and Ash. While the two fugitives are trying to escape the train, an Agent attempts to take over Ash's body, forcing Trinity to shoot him in order to prevent the Agent from appearing. Ash is wounded, whereupon he and Trinity bid farewells without malice. Trinity escapes, telling Ash that she thinks he could have handled the truth. Agents enter the car to find Ash, who points his gun at them while looking in the other direction and lighting a cigarette. The Agents turn to Ash who, even though he is armed, will likely die. With this apparent [[no-win situation]], the film ends with Ash's line ("A case to end all cases") as his lighter flame goes out.  ==="Matriculated"=== "Matriculated" was written and directed by director [[Peter Chung]], widely known for his work on ''[[Aeon Flux]]''. It is produced by [[DNA Productions]]. The film starts with one of the humans looking out over the sea, watching for incoming machines. The film deals with a group of above-ground human rebels who lure hostile intelligent machines to their laboratory in order to capture them and insert them into a "matrix" of their own design. Within this matrix, the humans attempt to teach the captured machines some of the positive traits of humanity, primarily compassion and empathy. The ultimate goal of this project is to help the intelligent machines develop free will in order to overcome their original "search-and-destroy" programming, rather than reprogramming it by force.  The rebels' hope is that, once converted of its own volition (a key point discussed in the film), an "enlightened" machine will assist [[Zion]] in its struggle against the machine-controlled totalitarianism which currently dominates the Earth. After capturing one of the most intelligent "runner" robots, the rebels insert the machine into their matrix. The experience of the robot leads it to believe it may have an emotional bond with one of the female rebels, Alexa ([[Melinda Clarke]]).  However, the rebel laboratory is attacked by the Machine reinforcements. The rebels unplug themselves to defend their headquarters, along with the help of other captured machines (indicated by the machine's mechanical eyes changing from [[red]] to [[green]]). However the rebels and the attacking machines are killed or destroyed, except the single Runner robot. The robot plugs the dying Alexa into the rebels' matrix with itself. Much to the Runner's dismay, when Alexa realizes she is trapped inside the matrix with the robot, she is horrified and her avatar dissolves screaming as she clutches her head, and the robot exits from the rebels' matrix to see a motionless Alexa in front of him in the real world.  The film ends with the "converted" robot standing outside, looking out over the sea, the same shot used at the intro with Alexa, as the robot pulled her consciousness into his hardware.  
Anna in Kungfuland
 The martial arts comedy ''Anna in Kung Fu Land'' centers on a young woman who dreams of becoming a movie star. Her father was a monk of the [[Shaolin temple]], who defected to [[Japan]] after representing the temple during a martial arts tournament. There he met a Japanese woman and later bore Anna (Miriam Yeung). He starts a martial school in Japan, although he dreams of being reconciled with his former mates.  When his school is invited to be part of a [[martial arts tournament]], he sends his daughter as his representative. She believes this might give her the opportunity to get her big break, but when that does not happen she becomes focused on beating the opposition in the [[tournament]]. She also becomes embroiled with the marketing executive (Ekin Cheng) who becomes her first love.  
Anima (film)
 16th century. The Catholic Church has expanded throughout the new continent, Nueva España. New monasteries are being built, but the missionaries’ Holy cities are threatened by forces unknown: the earth shakes, buildings collapse, nothing is spared. The devout seek protection by strengthening their faith—some even willing to sacrifice themselves.  One hundred years later, poverty forces young Angelica ([[Claudia Soberón]]) into God's service against her will. Rebellious, Angelica tries to escape into the outside world—closed behind the convent's doors, sealed by her vows. As punishment, Angelica is confined to her cell where she is haunted by the spirit of Sister Luciana ([[Katira Santiago]]). The ghost, a nun entombed one hundred years in the convent walls, compels Angelica to free her trapped soul.  To release Luciana, Angelica will have to persuade the nuns to leave the convent and pray in the open, but to leave the cloister is expressly forbidden.  
Angulimala (2003 film)
 Born a [[Brahmin]], [[Ahimsa]]ka is studying under a [[guru]] when he sees a woman named Nantha attempting to commit [[suicide]] by jumping off a cliff. He saves her, but later learns that Nantha was intended to be the bride of his teacher.  The teacher, angered by Ahimsaka's attention to his wife-to-be, tells his student that the only way he will attain [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] is to kill 1,000 people. This sets Ahimsaka off on a life as a [[highwayman]], and at first he seeks to kill only bandits and other evildoers. To keep track of his victims, he takes a finger from the right hand of each, and wears the fingers around his neck, thus earning him the name [[Angulimala]], "the wearer of a [[garland (decoration)|garland]] of fingers." He struggles to find 1,000 victims, so he resorts to killing all who cross his path. Nantha, wanting to stop the killing, tries to kill Ahimsaka, but only succeeds in killing herself.  Eventually, he meets the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] himself, who tells Ahimsaka of his wrongful ways and convinces the killer that he can redeem himself by becoming a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monk.  
Anjaneya (film)
 DCP Paramaguru ([[Ajith Kumar]]) is an efficient police officer who fights with the scum of the society. He later masquerades as a thief to infiltrate into the underworld. The bad guys are surprised to find that Paramguru is the DCP, out to get them. So they all gang up against him. In this process, a thrilling encounter takes place between the good and the evil. Paramaguru is helped in his fight against injustice by Divya ([[Meera Jasmine]]) who falls in love with him.

But through it all, Cynthia has a secret friend: [[Anne Frank]].  In a flashback scene early in the film, Cynthia’s now-dead father gives his young daughter a dog-eared copy of The Diary Of [[Anne Frank]] and for the rest of the film Anne’s words, read verbatim by Cynthia, provide both her solace and her inspiration. Cynthia buys herself a plaid notebook that looks very much like Anne’s original, and she retreats to her corner, like Anne did, to record her private thoughts. “All children must look after their own upbringing,” she reads, and from these words she understands that she can either blame her surroundings and give up, or take responsibility for her own future.  She finds out that her brother is selling her poems to a rapper named ‘Deuce’ who has been performing them and recording them and claiming them as his own. But with Anne’s voice in her head, Cynthia finds her courage, and by the end of the film she has transformed herself into an artist named “Anne B. Real.”

They arrive in [[Trondheim]], [[Norway]] and discover that the mysterious problem is actually the creature known as the [[Kraken]], which had been attacking shipping freighters and taking their cargo to a cliffside village.

They soon learn, though, that the Kraken itself is the master, having made a deal with Volgud. When they blow up the Kraken, the man disintegrates and the spirit of the village is restored.

When Peter starts stripping the body of the house's owner, claiming it will be easier to dispose of without clothes, another fight breaks out between him and Crusty when she questions his motive for undressing the body, accusing him of being "a faggot."  Crusty demonstrates her love of self-harm to Maggot and a friend, cutting her scarred arm with a knife.  Crusty and Maggot remove  a bound and masked woman from a box they have been keeping her in for "a long time."  Maggot rapes the woman while Crusty cheers him on and taunts the victim.

Azumi (film)
   As in the manga, the old master Jiji is tasked by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] to raise a band of assassins. Their task is to finish off [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s three allies: [[Nagamasa Asano]], [[Kiyomasa Kato]] and [[Masayuki Sanada]], to prevent an outbreak of the new civil war.  Azumi is discovered as a little girl kneeling without visible emotion next to the body of her dead mother by Gessai and his entourage of young students. She is then raised by him in the martial skills of sword fighting and the art of assassination. Azumi and her classmates, now at young adult age, are constantly being told about a "mission" they must accomplish, though they have no idea what this mission is yet. Prior to setting out on their mission, their master orders his students to "pair up" with each other's best friend and proceed to kill each other, thus out of ten students only five will remain to proceed with the mission: Azumi pairs with and is forced to kill Nachi. More questions and internal conflicts begin to arise amongst Azumi and her comrades as it seems their mission even prevents them from saving a village of mostly women and children from being massacred at the hands of a group of bandits, as they need to keep a low profile in order to achieve their primary mission.  The first leg in their mission, assassinating Nagamasa Asano, goes well. Upon hearing about Asano's death, Kato tasks his general Kanbei Inoue with his safety. Kanbei assesses the threat with a convoy containing a body double of Kato, in which his company fails to keep the double alive. The group of young assassins is given leave to see a small traveling circus troupe, where Hyuga falls in love with Yae, one of the troupe's actresses. After his assessment, Kanbei enlists help from three rogueish brothers who, eventually confuse Yae's circus troupe for the assassins, slaughtering them all until Hyuga, Azumi, and Nagara arrive. By the time the three dispatch the rogues, only Yae is left alive. Kanbei then sends his monkey-like henchman Saru to make a deal with the insidious and narcissistic mercenary named Bijomaru Mogami, previously imprisoned and under constant guard. Kanbei promises Bijomaro that should he successfully kill the assassins, his past crimes will be forgotten. Bijomaru agrees and quickly gets to work hunting down the five assassins, with Saru as his guide. Bijomaru's bloodlust, much to the chagrin of Saru, is such that he often kills allies in battle along with his enemy.  As Hyuga walks his beloved Yae back to the main road after saving her from the three brothers, he is confronted by Saru and Bijomaru, and a battle between the assassin and the mercenary ensues. During the battle, Bijomaru uses psychological warfare in addition to swordplay as he explains to a frightened Hyuga that his sword does not contain a hand-guard since he has never had to defend another's blow. As Hyuga lays bleeding and defeated, Bijomaru forces Yae to watch him toy with the dying boy. Saru, uncomfortable with this lack of respect for another warrior, finishes Hyuga off as an act of mercy, and gives Yae leave to bury him. Azumi soon finds Yae by Hyuga's body, and Yae manages to convince her that the violent lifestyle must be left behind. Together they begin a journey over the mountains and out of the valley to go and live in peace with Yae's kin in Tangou. Yae socializes Azumi during the journey, dressing her in a kimono and adorning her with make-up, perfume and hair treatment. Just as they begin to get comfortable during their journey, a band of brigands finds them as they sleep, and attempts to gang rape the young women. Azumi, who has not slept beside her sword as her training normally dictated, is caught off guard, but eventually steals the sword of a would-be captor, killing all of the brigands and saving Yae. The experience leaves Azumi understanding that she must obey her training, and complete her mission. She sets off to find her master and comrades, and tells Yae that she will meet her later, in Tangou.  Meanwhile, the master, Nagara and Ukiha attempt to strike another target. The plan is foiled when it is revealed that the enemy has sprung a trap, reinforcing his samurai with common mercenaries. The master is captured and placed on a cross in anticipation of Azumi's arrival. She finds Kato's compound and starts her attack by turning some cannon on the area. She then proceeds through the compound, wreaking havoc enough to attract and impress Bijomaru, who decides to warm up by attacking the common mercenaries while Kanbei and Kato escape to sea. The mercenaries then attack Saru's men, and Azumi's task is made easier by the infighting. A final battle takes place between Azumi and Bijomaru, where he claims he is forced to defend for the first time. Upon Bijomaru's defeat, Azumi releases her dying master from the cross and he uses his last breath to tell her to abandon their mission and go live her life.  Later, Kanbei and Kato are on their boat, congratulating each other about overcoming the assassin threat and plotting their next move against [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]]. Azumi appears as if from nowhere, and finishes the warlord in one blow, diving into the sea immediately afterwards. Kanbei is stricken with disbelief and frustration and lashes out at his men. Azumi then returns to the scene of her epic battle with Bijomaru to find that Nagara had indeed survived and has just made his way out from the rubble he was buried under during the battle. The two resolve that, having killed Asano and Kato, they will complete their mission, and pursue Sanada.

It is also revealed that Poulgrain was involved in the corruption ring but, having gotten cold feet, had threatened to go public so Pratt had blackmailed him into committing suicide. Rescued by Northey, Kinnear and Paddock pursue their last option, going to the Premier of Victoria Lionel Cray. However whilst waiting outside his office, Kinnear eavesdrops on a phone-call between Cray and Pratt, revealing that even the Premier is up to his neck in corruption. Having recorded the phone-call, they kidnap Cray and take him to a deserted road outside of Melbourne, offering to exchange him for Bale who has been abducted by Pratt.   In a tense stand-off, Pratt's plan to kill Kinnear, Paddock and Northey after getting the Premier back is foiled when, in a pre-arranged signal, Bale grabs a concealed gun attached to Cray and holds it to his head whilst Paddock aims an assault-rifle at Pratt & Wicks and their mini-van filled with heavily armed officers. Pratt surrenders and he and his cronies, along with Premier Cray, are all arrested for corruption. Kinnear and Paddock are re-instated and promoted and the former's old romance with Bale is re-ignited.

Baaz: A Bird in Danger
 The film opens with the life of a child born with a strange disorder where he tends to destroy anything that fascinates him. He would be looked after by his grandmother.  Then the film moves to Nainital 17 years later, where Neha Chopra ([[Karisma Kapoor]]) from Delhi comes to Nainital to work as an interior designer for Jai Singh Dabral ([[Jackie Shroff]]), the city Mayor who is also a womaniser and attracted to Neha, at one of his secluded and deserted mansions. A serial killer is said to be on the prowl in the city, killing beautiful women ruthlessly and who is always eluding the police, getting away from the law without evidence if at all he gets arrested. Neha soon meets Raj Singh ([[Dino Morea]]), a loafer whom everyone in the city seems to avoid as he is the suspected serial killer, but she likes him, and soon both fall in love. The city police commissioner Harshvardhan Bhatti ([[Sunil Shetty]]) and subordinate Preeti Rastogi ([[Preeti Jhangiani]]) observe the movements of the couple all over the city, and soon they call Neha and warn her that Raj is a serial killer and she must help them nab him red handed as she is soon going to be his next victim. Neha refuses to believe, especially because Raj saves her life on one occasion. But later she finds items of murder in Raj's house, and thinks Raj is the killer. Brokenhearted, she then decides to leave Nainital for good, much against Dabral's wishes, but Harshvardhan and Preeti convince her to stay back and nab Raj red handed.  Raj goes to meet Neha but sees that she is very dull, knowing that something is wrong. Soon one of the killer's victim's sister comes out of coma and tells Preeti that she can identify the killer. Preeti informs Harshvardhan, but when they both arrive at the house, the comatose girl dies of shock unexpectedly. Later that night Preeti thinks over everything, and goes to question Harshvardhan. Dabral notices her racing in her car somewhere at night. The next day, Preeti is found murdered in Raj's house. Raj is chased by Harshvardhan and the cops till he jumps off a waterfall and seeks shelter in Neha's house.  Dabral threatens to Demote Harshvardhan if he does not nab the killer in 24 hours, to which the latter replies assertively. Harshvardhan gives a mobile phone to Neha, telling her that if Raj calls on her, she must dial his number and inform him immediately. Raj does go to Neha to explain his situation but she pushes him off and dials Harshvardhan.  Surprisingly, Harshvardhan does not answer the phone. She then leaves a voice message saying that Raj has come to kill her. Raj hits Neha and she falls unconscious.  Then the movie reaches its climax where Harshvardhan appears on the scene. He takes Raj and the unconscious Neha to a temple where Raj and Neha had been before and chains him there. Here, Harshvardhan changes completely. He tells Raj that he is the serial killer, the child who was neglected always because of his disorder. So he sought to make his 'own' world. It was he who committed all the murders and hid their bodies. He also says that he had to murder Preeti because she had come to know of things told everything she knew to his grandmother, had also stumbled upon his secret hideout, and would've spilled the beans. It is also known that Harshvardhan never had any feelings for Preeti at all, though she was madly in love with him and was hoping he would reciprocate. He goes on to say that Neha is his alone, and he will take her. He was the one who also framed Raj by placing the items of murder in his house. He says ''"Kaam mera, naam tera"'', meaning that he has recorded Neha's voice message stating that Raj is the killer, and Raj will be convicted. Harshvardhan then takes Neha to his underground enclosure to kill her, where they find bodies of women kept in glass boxes, as though it were a park. He says that nothing can separate them both now.  In the meantime, Dabral comes and frees Raj, and both of them attack him at his house. A huge fight ensues between the three of them and suddenly, Harshvardhan's grandmother appears on the scene out of nowhere and shoots Harshvardhan.  The film ends with Raj and Neha planning to get married, and Dabral giving the deserted house for them to live in.

Bad Bizness
 A policewoman investigates three murders.  
Bad Santa
 Willie T. Soke and his [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] assistant Marcus Skidmore are professional thieves. Every year, Willie disguises himself as a department store [[Santa Claus]] and Marcus disguises himself as an elf in order for both of them to rob shopping malls at night, using Marcus' wife Lois as their getaway driver and accomplice. Marcus takes his duty as an elf seriously, but Willie is a sex-addicted alcoholic, and is gradually unable to appropriately perform his Santa duties with children, plus his safe-cracking performance is being affected, much to Marcus' dismay. When they are hired at the Saguaro Square Mall in Phoenix, the vulgar remarks made by Willie shock the prudish mall manager Bob Chipeska, who brings them to the attention of security chief Gin Slagel.  At the mall, Willie is visited by Thurman Merman, a friendly but exceedingly naive and gullible, overweight boy who thinks Willie is really Santa. Thurman is a constant target of bullying by a teenage gang of skateboarders. At a bar, Willie meets Sue, a woman with a Santa Claus fetish, and they begin a sexual relationship. Willie is harassed by a man in the bar, but Thurman intervenes. Willie gives Thurman a ride home, then enters the boy's house where he lives with his senile grandmother. Thurman reveals that his mother died, and his father, Roger, is away "exploring mountains" (he is actually in jail for embezzlement) until next year. Willie tricks Thurman into letting him steal from the house safe and a BMW owned by Roger.  Bob informs Gin that he overheard Willie having sex with a woman in a mall dressing room and Gin starts to investigate. Willie goes to his motel room and sees it being raided, causing him to take advantage of Thurman's naivete and live in his house, much to Thurman's delight. The next day, Marcus gets angry at Willie for taking advantage of Thurman, and states his disapproval of Willie's sex addiction when Willie makes a rude remark about Thurman's grandmother.  Gin's investigation of Willie includes visiting Roger, who indirectly reveals that Willie is staying with Thurman illegally. Gin confronts Willie and Marcus at the mall, and takes them to a bar. There, he reveals that he has figured out their plan, blackmailing them for half of the cut to keep silent. Marcus tries to reason with Gin for a smaller cut, but Gin is adamant. With Willie and Marcus now in a corner, their partnership begins to falter, which is exacerbated further when Willie shows up to work clearly drunk or hungover and destroys the Santa attraction, much to Marcus' and Gin's shock.  Willie attempts to commit suicide by inhaling vehicle exhaust fumes. He gives Thurman a letter to give to the police, confessing all his misdeeds and information about a heist that will take place in the mall on Christmas Eve. Willie notices Thurman's black eye, which persuades him to make an example of the skateboarding bullies. He confronts and beats up the gang's leader, frightening the other members into stopping their acts towards Thurman.  Enraged at Gin for blackmailing him, Marcus and Lois set up a trap for Gin, feigning needing a jump start for their vehicle. Lois hits Gin with the car, then Marcus kills him via electrocution.  As Christmas draws closer, Willie and Thurman set up for the holiday, with help from Sue. On [[Christmas Eve]], when the heist is almost complete, Willie goes to get Thurman a pink stuffed elephant that he had wanted for Christmas. Just as he gets the elephant, Marcus reveals to Willie that he intends to kill him, fed up with his increasing carelessness year after year. Lois tells him to hurry up and kill Willie so they can get away with the money and merchandise. But just as Marcus is about to shoot Willie, the police swarm the trio, tipped off by the letter Willie gave to Thurman. When Marcus opens fire, the police shoot at him and Willie flees. Determined to give Thurman his present, he leads the police on a chase to Thurman's house, ignoring orders to freeze. He is repeatedly shot on Thurman's porch, but survives.  The epilogue is told through a letter from Willie, who is in a hospital recovering. He expresses his gratitude for Thurman in giving the letter to the police and his name was cleared of the robbery, adding that he will be working for the police as a sensitivity counselor. The shooting of an unarmed Santa embarrassed the police, and Sue is granted guardianship over Thurman and his house until Thurman's father is released. Willie also explains that Marcus and Lois are doing time behind bars for their actions, while expressing hope that Roger is wise to avoid the two. Willie ends the letter by telling Thurman that he should be let out of the hospital soon and for him to be ready for his return. When the lead skateboard bully harasses Thurman again, Thurman finally stands up to him by kicking him hard in the crotch and riding away on his bike.

Barbie of Swan Lake
 The story is being told by Barbie to her sister, Kelly, who is feeling uneasy about being at camp overnight for the first time. She remembers the story while looking at constellations, being started on after finding [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus]].  The story takes place in a small village, where Odette, a young girl passionate about [[ballet]], lives with her father and sister and works in the family [[bakery]]. Odette is very talented in ballet, even though she has almost no training, and knows complicated routines and exquisite ballets. Her sister, Marie, is passionate about [[horse riding]] just as Odette is about ballet. As the story moves on, the men of the village go after a [[unicorn]] named Lila and try to hunt it down. With the help of Odette, the unicorn manages to escape the hunters and runs into an Enchanted Forest with the curious Odette in pursuit. Lila becomes trapped when the hunters' rope around her neck gets tangled to a branch, so Odette tries looking for something sharp enough to free the unicorn. She spots a stone, which is, in fact, a magical crystal, within the hollow of a nearby tree and takes it out. Little does she know that the crystal was meant for whoever removed it to defeat the evil sorcerer named [[von Rothbart]], who had been terrorizing the inhabitants of the forest for years.  The Fairy Queen, who was watching the scene, comes to Odette and tells her that she is the chosen one for purging the evil plaguing the forest, which is Rothbart, who is also the Fairy Queen's cousin. She tells Odette how Rothbart cast a spell on the elves of the Forest and turned them into animals, but the spell was partially reversed by the Fairy Queen and they become human by night, and animals by the morning. Odette, not wanting to get mixed up in the situation, refuses. The Fairy Queen, deeply saddened, complies and sends Lila to escort her out of the forest. Suddenly, Rothbart appears in the woods with his daughter, Odile, the Black [[Swan]] and turns Odette into a swan. The Fairy Queen isn't powerful enough to get rid of the spell when Odette asks her to, but is able to partially reverse the effects of the spell, just like for the elves, so that Odette retains her human form by night, but during the day, she is forced to stay as a swan. The Fairy Queen also gives Odette a crown with the crystal on it that will protect her from Rothbart's magic.  Odette also meets the other elves of the forest: Carlita, now a skunk, Ivan, a porcupine as well as a few others. Odette's father and sister, start searching for her, after noticing that Odette is missing. A new character, Prince Daniel, the prince living in the castle in Odette's village, is introduced. A spirited man, he prefers exploring rather than marriage, much to the dismay of his mother.  Odette is determined to find a solution to the problem and goes to a magical library with Lila to find a book that can give her a clue about how to break the spell. They ask a troll named Erasmus to help them, who had initially scared them. However, they are unable to locate the book of Forestlore and Odette is disheartened. Rothbart lures Prince Daniel into the forest, determined to get him to hunt Odette. However, just as he's about to shoot her down, Daniel is captivated by the swan's beauty and decides to let it live. The two soon fall in love when he sees her true form. They dance gracefully and spend the night together, but Odette transforms into a swan as the sun rises.  Daniel asks Odette to come to a ball his mother had organized in hopes of Daniel finding a wife. Odette rejects at first, but he's able to convince her to come. Soon, Erasmus—the troll in charge of the library—arrives, having found the book. He reveals to them that the solution is true love, which makes everyone realize that Daniel can save them all. However, if Daniel falls for another girl, the magic crystal will lose its power and Odette will die. The Fairy Queen teaches Odette how to waltz at the ball but are interrupted when Erasmus is kidnapped. They manage to save him from Rothbart's castle by evading the Ravens, but Rothbart learns of what will be his downfall. So, under a spell, he makes Odile look like Odette in the eyes of Daniel, so that the Prince can fall in love with Odile and Odette will die.  Odette, after learning of what happened, races to the castle in her swan form to warn Daniel about the trick, but is unable to get inside. At the ball, Prince Daniel pledges his love to Odile, thinking her to be Odette, which causes Odette to fall to the ground due to the crystal having lost its power and she is mortally weakened.   Rothbart reveals the truth and he and Odile escape, but not before he takes the crystal. Outside, Daniel confronts Rothbart, who aims a spell at him. Using Odile as a shield, Daniel avoids the spell, which hits Odile, turning her into a pig. Daniel runs after them and the Fairy Queen attempts to revive Odette, who is barely alive. After an ongoing chase to the Enchanted Forest, the Fairy Queen asks Rothbart to a duel to protect Odette. However, Rothbart turns out to be more powerful and casts a spell on the Fairy Queen which turns her into a mouse. Odette wakes up, just in time to see Daniel coming, and confronts Rothbart. To protect her from Rothbart's magic, Daniel jumps in front of Odette, but the spell affects both of them. The two fall onto each other, their hands intertwined.  Rothbart believes he has won, but as he laughs in triumph, at that moment, the crystal's power reawakens and explodes outwards, stopping Rothbart, to his horror, as Daniel and Odette were truly in love. The two awaken and all of Rothbart's evil is undone. At last, Odette and Prince Daniel confess their love for each other. Everyone from the village and the Enchanted Forest celebrates. It is revealed that Odette and Daniel are to be married and are finally happy. Rothbart gets his [[just deserts]] as he is now a [[Cuckoo Clock]] while Odile is granted the more merciful but humiliating fate of becoming a [[maid]].  At the film's end, it is shown the story has given Kelly a new resolve and she promises she will participate in the race the following day. She yawns and heads off to bed, with Barbie smiling behind her.  
Baltic Storm
 The plot portrays the Swedish government as being responsible for using the ship to covertly transport Russian high-tech components to the United States. The story is uncovered by a young female journalist, not unlike Rabe herself. According to Rabe, divers hired by the Swedish government (signing contracts swearing lifetime secrecy) spent hours breaking into cabins frantically searching for a black attaché case carried by a Russian space technology dealer, Aleksandr Voronin (who died 2002). She highlighted US interest in various Soviet technology, including nuclear-powered satellites. She also suggested that panic about the stability of some form of nuclear device is the most likely reason behind the initial Swedish government suggestion of burying the wreck in concrete, a highly unusual proposal for a wreck, reminiscent of [[Chernobyl]]'s [[sarcophagus]].

With Carlton Duquesne unable to stop Batwoman's raids on the facilities used to hold the various weapons, the Penguin calls [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] for additional support to ensure that there are no more losses as a result of the Batwoman.  Not long after Bane's arrival in Gotham, it is revealed that there is not one but three Batwomen, all of whom were the women suspected by Batman; Kathy and Sonia met taking art classes at college and Sonia and Rocky were roommates. They had taken turns to remove suspicion on any one of the three, while using Roxanne's technological genius and contempt for the Penguin (who had framed her long-time fiancé Kevin), Kathy's money and access to several key aspects of her father's organization (Kathy wants to end her father's criminal career as it led to her mother being killed), and Sonia's physical and police skills to ensure that Thorne's operation is thwarted (as the crime lord previously left her family in financial ruin after arsonists who worked for him burned down her parents' shop and were not punished due to the lack of sufficient evidence). Alcana was also saved by Batman nine years prior, the event giving the detective the original inspiration for the costumed identity she now shares with her friends.  In the final confrontation, a ship taking the weapons into international waters for the exchange is destroyed by a bomb planted by Kathy. But not before she is unmasked by Bane. Kathy and Batman narrowly escape the explosion despite the efforts of Bane, who falls into the Gotham River and vanishes. At the conclusion, the GCPD are left to assume that Sonia is the only Batwoman after she helps rescue Batman from the ship. Sonia resigns from the police due to the potential problems her presence could cause and decides to leave the city. Batman gives Sonia evidence he discovered which helps clear Rocky's fiancé. Carlton agrees to testify against Thorne and the Penguin after saving Kathy's life during the ship's destruction. After she reconciles with her father, Kathy drives off with Bruce.  
Battle Royale II: Requiem
 Three years after the events of the first film, the survivors of previous Battle Royales have formed a rebel group called the Wild Seven which is led by [[Shuya Nanahara]]. A class of teenagers from  are kidnapped by the Japanese government. Instead of stereotypically studious Japanese students, these ninth graders are “a ragtag collection of [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquents]] and losers from all over Japan,” including tough-guy [[Rugby football|rugby]] players and [[Punk subculture|punks]] with dyed hair. More importantly, many are [[orphan]]s whose parents or family died in bombings by the Wild Seven. After their school bus is diverted to an army base, the students are herded into a cage, surrounded by armed guards, and confronted by their schoolteacher, [[Riki Takeuchi]], who lays down the ground rules of the new Battle Royale game. Wild Seven is hiding out on a deserted island (filmed on [[Hashima Island]]), and instead of being forced to kill each other, as in the old Battle Royale, the students are sent off to war and ordered to attack the terrorist group’s hideout ''en masse'' and kill Shuya within 72 hours. Most of the students are not interested in being forced to avenge their families, but they are coerced to fight through exploding metal collars, which their captors can detonate by [[remote control]]. The teacher shows them a line in the caged classroom: those who wish to participate are instructed to cross the line, while those who refuse to participate will be killed. The students are put into 'pairs'; if one student dies, then his or her partner will be killed via collar detonation.  The students are sent via boats onto the dangerous island base of the Wild Seven. A number of them are killed when they were bombed, shot or their collar detonated during the journey onto the island, leaving only a cluster alive. Most notably, two of the survivors are the delinquent Takuma Aoi and Shiori Kitano, the daughter of Kitano, the "teacher" of a Battle Royale program who was killed by Shuya three years ago. Taken into the Wild Seven's base, the surviving students' explosive collars are removed and they are encouraged to help the members of the Wild Seven stop the Battle Royale for good. While most of the survivors agree, Takuma and in particular Shiori remain unconvinced. Shuya sends a video message to the world of their goal to live free. In response to the video the US fires a missile to the island, and under pressure from the US government, the Japanese prime minister takes command of the military present at the Battle Royale headquarters and orders an attack on the island base, with no survivors allowed — if they fail, the US will bomb the island. Takeuchi is enraged by the change of actions and is discovered to have the same type of collar on his neck as the students.   On [[Christmas Day]], survivors of the base (including the surviving students, except Shiori) retreat to the mainland via a mine shaft while the war between the Wild Seven and the military occurs. Hearing the gunfire outside the tunnel, Takuma and two of his friends return to help in the fight. The combat takes numerous casualties on both sides, leaving Shuya, Takuma and Shiori as the only remaining fighters. While they try to evacuate, Takeuchi appears in a rugby uniform, and after a brief personal exchange, he allows the group to flee as he sacrifices himself. Outside Wild Seven's base the combat starts again and Shiori is mortally wounded by gunfire. Before she dies in Shuya's arms, she reveals herself as Kitano's daughter and seemingly forgives him for his past crimes. Shuya and Takuma run out to kill the rest of the soldiers while the U.S. bombardment starts. The program then ends on a voided status, listing the fates of Shuya and the surviving students as unknown.  Three months later, Shuya and Takuma rejoin the other survivors, including Noriko Nakagawa in [[Afghanistan]]. They have regrouped as friends, and what lies next for them remains open.  
Basic (film)
 In [[Panama]], a team of [[United States Army Rangers|Army Rangers]] led by Master Sergeant Nathan West ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) engage in a jungle training exercise that involves live ammunition. Sergeant Ray Dunbar emerges from the jungle carrying wounded Second Lieutenant Levi Kendall. The two men are pursued by Sergeant Mueller, who is shooting at them, and Dunbar kills Mueller in self-defense. Although no other bodies are found, West's team is presumed dead.  Dunbar refuses to talk to [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police]] investigator Captain Julia Osborne ([[Connie Nielsen]]) and insists on speaking to a fellow Ranger from outside the base, drawing an "8" on a piece of paper. The base commander Colonel Bill Styles ([[Timothy Daly]]) calls in his friend, and an experienced interrogator, [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent Tom Hardy ([[John Travolta]]) who is also an ex-Ranger, and assigns him to aid Osborne.  West was infamous for being a ruthless, tough-as-nails sergeant. One of the trainees, Pike, has earned West's wrath for not following the orders, and may have staged the murder.  Kendall, son of a [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] general, is a homosexual and claims West hated him and may have ordered a "training accident" on him. He claims West died when hit in the back with a white [[smoke grenade|phosphorus grenade]].  When Pike confessed to the crime, Dunbar wanted to turn him in; a firefight ensued, in which most of the trainees were killed.  Dunbar says Kendall is lying. Mueller and Castro were illegally selling prescription drugs and West became aware of their drug dealing. Mueller used Pike's grenade to kill West, then tried to pin the blame on Pike. A firefight broke out and all the trainees were killed. Dunbar claims that Dr. Peter Vilmer ([[Harry Connick Jr.]]), an old friend of Hardy and Osborne's former love interest, supplied the drugs and falsified drug tests so that soldiers came out clean. After confessing to the crime, Vilmer is placed under arrest.  Styles orders Osborne and Hardy to not talk to Kendall again. They disobey and interrogate Kendall once more, but he suddenly becomes much worse, bleeding and vomiting blood. Before he dies, he draws an '8' with his own blood. Hardy reveals the conversation he had earlier with Styles. There is rumored to be a group of ex-Rangers in Panama, trained under West, who turned rogue and became drug dealers. They call themselves [[Section 8 (military)|Section 8]].  Styles is furious; he relieves Osborne of duty and asks Hardy to leave. He considers the investigation closed and the [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|CID]] transport from Washington will arrive to take Vilmer and Dunbar away.  Vilmer accidentally reveals that 'Dunbar' is actually Pike, and Hardy takes Pike off the plane at the last moment. In Pike's new story, West learned about the main operation going on at the base: cocaine smuggling. He  confronted the Rangers and threatened to turn them in to authorities. After a brief firefight, West and the other trainees were killed. Pike then took Dunbar's [[dog tag]]s and carried Kendall to the extract point. He then gives Hardy, Osborne, and Styles the number of a crate where Vilmer had stowed cocaine.  Hardy then confronts Styles alone. Styles was behind the drug-dealing operation the whole time. When West reported the operation to Styles, he ordered Mueller and Kendall to kill him in the jungle and then poisoned Kendall afterward to keep him quiet. Styles tries to bribe Hardy, then turns his weapon on him, but is killed by Osborne, who was eavesdropping on their talk.  As the investigation is concluded, Osbourne suspects that Hardy may be involved, because he served with West and hated him, and because Section 8 contains West's former trainees. She sees Pike sneaking into Hardy's car and follows them into Panama City, where they enter a doorway with a big [[eight-ball]] hanging above. In the building, she is greeted by West and the rest of the team—Castro, Dunbar, and Nuñez, who Hardy reveals as his 'colleagues'.  Section 8 is a [[Black operation|black-ops]] anti-drug unit led by Colonel Tom Hardy, and the "insane mercenary" story is a cover to spook the cartels. The agents infiltrated the base under false names to investigate cocaine trafficking, and discovered Mueller, Kendall, and Vilmer were responsible. West, not realizing Styles was also involved, informed him of drug dealing. The training mission ordered by West was a covert Section 8 operation to circumvent Mueller and Kendall, faking West's death in order to transfer him to Section 8. Hardy had been called to the base by the coded message to confirm Styles' and Vilmer's involvement.  Impressed by her work, Hardy offers Osborne a job in the unit.

He is shown walking down the street with Sarah and they hold hands. Kelly sees Lance again on his lawn where they faked the invasion, and goes over to him and confesses, only to be punched in the jaw.  
Battlefield Baseball
  It's every high school baseball team's dream to go to the legendary [[Koshien Stadium]] [[High school baseball in Japan|Tournament]]. For the first time in years, Seido High School has a chance&mdash;star player Gorrila Matsui has finally given the team an opportunity to succeed. Most delighted at this prospect is Principal Kocho. His hopes are dashed, however, when the [[Head teacher]] reveals to him that the first game will be played against the infamous Gedo High School.<ref>"Head Teacher" is only ever referred to by this title. This title-in-place-of-name system is standard in the Japanese language</ref>  Gedo is notorious for its brutal killings during games. They hardly play at all, instead engaging in a form of martial arts combat called "fighting baseball". Their matches erupt into brutal battlefields, Gedo slaughtering its opponents in any way possible, and the competing team vainly struggling for their lives. The Gedo team is almost inhuman in its slaughter, and their bizarre weapons and attire coupled with their green-grey skin only increase this reputation. Understandably, Kocho is distressed&mdash;not only at the likely murder of his students, but at the loss of yet another chance to win the Koshien Stadium Tournament.  Much to his delight, however, is the appearance of mysterious newcomer Jubeh, played by [[Tak Sakaguchi]]. Jubeh rescues Four Eyes (Megane, so named because of his [[eyeglasses]].), played by [[Atsushi Itō (actor)|Atsushi Itō]], from a gang of expelled students, beating Bancho (Japanese for "boss" or "leader") and catching Kocho's eye.<ref name="Crowd">During various points in the film, a crowd of people appears, usually engaging in spontaneous celebration or watching some event. Among the crowd is a schoolgirl dressed in a traditional ''[[sailor-fuku]]'', an injured man with a cast on his arm, and a nude man with his crotch covered by a [[fig leaf]]. According to the audio commentary included on the DVD release, the nude man is played by director Yudai Yamaguchi.</ref><ref name="Drunk">Another recurring element in the film is a drunk man, usually seen laughing uproariously at whatever event has just occurred. He is always accompanied by his dog. At the end of the film, it is revealed through narration that the drunk died of [[alcohol poisoning]] during the final confrontation between the antagonists and protagonists. He also states that the drunk was "[his] master", implying that the dog has been the narrator of the entire film. [[Andy Klein]] of the ''[[L.A. City Beat]]'' called this the film's "best joke". </ref> He begs and pleads with Jubeh to join the team to help them defeat Gedo, but he steadfastly refuses. During this time Kocho and Jubeh are also confronted by a resurrected Bancho, though his "face changed". Bancho joins the team, explaining that the injuries that prevented him from playing baseball were cured by Jubeh's punches.  When confronted by Four Eyes, Jubeh reveals why he has stopped playing baseball&ndash;in song. He musically laments his [[pitch (baseball)|pitching]] skill, explaining how he became so skilled he was a danger to himself and others. Only his father, with an absurdly huge [[catcher's mitt]], will allow Jubeh to pitch. However, when an accidental ball to the head kills him, Jubeh vows never to pitch again.  Despite this sorowful story, Four Eyes insists that Jubeh join the team, explaining his own plight. His mother hates baseball, and would be furious if he were to play. As a result, he must keep his presence on the Seido team a secret. Four Eyes' sheer love for the game touches Jubeh deeply, and he joins the team.<ref name="Crowd"/>  However, when the game against Gedo starts, Jubeh is nowhere to be found. As a result, the team is, predictably, slaughtered by the Gedo students.<ref name="Drunk"/> Jubeh gets there in time to hear Gorilla's last words.<ref>During this speech, the letters that make up the word "Seido" on Gorilla's uniform are strewn about to indicate the trauma that he has experienced.</ref> Finding a body he believes to be Four Eyes', Jubeh laments the loss, before realising that it's in fact a Gedo trap. The "body" explodes, hurling Jubeh across the field, sending him to an early grave.  Jubeh finds himself in a sepia-toned small town street in the afterlife. He sees a man he has not seen for some time&ndash;his father. He convinced Jubeh to embrace his pitching skills, and defeat Gedo once and for all. Jubeh pledges to do so as he watches his father ride off. Returning from the afterlife, he introduces his pitch, dubbed the "Super Tornado". Bancho also returns, again, this time as a child. He too met Jubeh's father in the afterlife, and was given his catcher's mitt.  In the meantime, somehow Four Eyes' mother has discovered that he was on the baseball team. As punishment, she locks him up in a cage, and watches over him day and night. Jubeh comes to rescue him, fighting Four Eyes's mother. He confronts her, asking her why she hates baseball so much. She reveals that her husband was killed by a baseball pitcher. All three come to a sudden realization&mdash;They are family. In jubilation, Four Eyes' mother gives him permission to play.<ref name="Crowd"/>  Kocho, Bancho, Jubeh, and Four Eyes, having formed a new Seido team, confront Gedo. The Gedo coach mocks the size and strength, or more accurately the lack thereof, of the new team. Much to his surprise however, several new team members show up&mdash;Head Teacher and Gorilla, now [[cyborg]]s, having been resurrected by "advanced technology", one of the school's [[cheerleader]]s, and Four Eyes' mother all team up to defeat Gedo.  Ultimately, all except Jubeh and the Gedo coach have been knocked unconscious. They duel with elaborate baseball bats, before Jubeh is knocked to the ground.  Then, the Gedo coach unveils his ultimate weapon: the Gedo Poison Bat. Filled with a combination of deadly poisons and healing herbs, the effect is to create a horrific pain that will last for "hundreds of years." The coach slams it down onto Jubeh&mdash;However, Four Eyes has sacrificed himself, jumping in the way of the coach's attack. Jubeh, furious at the loss of his brother, leaps up and bitterly attacks the coach. However, before he can kill the coach, the Gedo players plead for his life, explaining how he brought them out of orphanages and became like a father to them. Seeing their heartfelt plea, Jubeh can't help but allow the coach to live.  Happily, the coach gains a newfound respect for life, and throws a bottle of antidote to Jubeh. A crowd gathers,<ref name="Crowd"/> and the sun begins to shine. However, this peace is soon interrupted by one member of the Gedo team, his head wrapped in bandages. He guns down everyone on the field, firing randomly and hitting everything in sight, including his own teammates. Jubeh manages to escape only through his own dexterity and the gunman's limited ammo. Looking around in outrage, Jubeh sheds a tear. As [[cherry blossom]]s fall, everyone on the field returns to life, before Jubeh attacks the bandaged gunman, literally knocking the muscles off his bones.  Joyously, the crowd celebrates, and the narrator states that they lived happily ever after&mdash;Including the one person on the field that day who wasn't resurrected by Jubeh's tears.<ref name="Drunk"/>

Bayside Shakedown 2
 The movie takes place again in the fictional Wangan Station of the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department]], in the five years since the [[Bayside Shakedown THE MOVIE|previous movie]], the once empty space within Wangan's jurisdiction (the station was once referred to disparagingly as "the empty space station" by the surrounding jurisdictions) has become a popular tourist attraction, the officers at Wangan Station now have their hands full dealing with all manner of tourist related issues. In a sign of how much has ''not'' changed in the last five years, when Detective Sergeant Shunsaku Aoshima and several of other detectives playing the part of terrorists defeat a [[Special Assault Team]] unit during a counterterrorism exercise in front of the police brass and the media, all the detectives promptly have their pay docked by headquarters.  When a string of murders of company execs begins taking place, Aoshima jumps at the opportunity to pursue something other than his current case, which he finds less than inspiring. However the powers that be have other ideas, and Wangan again plays host to a special investigation team from headquarters, led by Superintendent Okita, whose inflexible methods, reliance on technology over old fashioned police work, and condescending attitude towards the locals quickly leads to one fiasco after another, with the local officers working to clean up the resulting mess. Aoshima's friend Superintendent Shinji Muroi, assigned by headquarters to assist Okita, is again powerless to help the local officers as decisions are made by the higher ups.

Belly of the Beast
  Jake Hopper ([[Steven Seagal]]) is a successful businessman and retired CIA agent who runs a successful private security business. Ten years ago, as a CIA agent stationed in Thailand, things were going the right way until a fight with thugs results in his partner, Sunti ([[Byron Mann]]) escaping with his life after accidentally killing a woman. However, Jake called it quits and returned to the United States when his wife died, and Sunti became a Buddhist monk to atone for his sins. Jake has since been a devoted father to his daughter Jessica ([[Sara Malakul Lane]]), now an adult, while running a successful private security business.  While hiking in Thailand, Jessica and her friend Sarah Winthorpe (Eilidh MacQueen), the daughter of U.S. Senator John Winthorpe are kidnapped. A group of Islamic fundamentalists known as the Abu Karaf claims responsibility. The Abu Karaf demand the release of 20 prisoners from American custody. Tom Collins (Martin McDougall), an ex-colleague of Jake's, recognizes Jessica on the ransom tape, and he tips Jake off. Knowing that he must rescue the girls himself, a former CIA colleague puts Jake in contact with Leon Washington (Patrick Robinson), an active CIA agent who is working in Thailand. Jake goes to Bangkok, and escapes an assassination attempt by gangsters and unknown forces.  Meanwhile, Leon arranges a meeting for himself with Soku, the internal security chief for General Jantapan ([[Tom Wu]]), a rebel military general who is making a play to be one of the most powerful men in Thailand. Secretly, Jantapan is messing with some very dangerous spiritual forces. Soku provides Jake with a cover story, but the CIA wants Jake out of it because they're planning to take out the Abu Karaf with the aid of the Thai army, and they don't want a civilian in the middle. Jake is a spiritual man, so he contacts his spiritual master, Buddhist monk Paijan Paitoon. As Jake is in trouble, Paitoon offers to arrange a divination from the oracle of the order. He enlists the help of Sunti. Jake gets Lulu (Monica Lo), the girlfriend of arms dealer Fitch McQuoid (Vincent Riotta), to steal information leading to the Abu Karaf.  Jake and Sunti follow the leads to a warehouse where they discover evidence of highly sophisticated weaponry. With their enemies now after Lulu, Jake takes Lulu under his wing. He then shares some of his info with Leon still testing the waters. Another attempt is made on Jake's life and this time, Jake's sure that Leon was involved.  Finally, the Abu Karaf contact Jake to arrange a meeting to see the pieces are coming together. Jake figures out that it was not the Abu Karaf who kidnapped Jessica and Sarah. Jake gets his reading from the old oracle, and the cryptic message confirms that his fears, demonic spiritual forces, are working against him. Jantapan later goes to an evil temple and tries to send the spirit of an ancient warrior demon to kill Jake, but the ceremony goes wrong and the spirit enters Jantapan himself, giving him evil physical and spiritual powers, disguised as feats.  Jake and Sunti go to meet Mongkol ([[Pongpat Wachirabunjong]]), the leader of the Abu Karaf. Mongkol confirms what Jake suspects; ever since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks of 2001]], Jantapan has worked to corner the narcotics and arms markets. He also adds that Jantapan kidnapped the girls and blamed the Abu Karaf so the army would wipe out Jantapan's competition. Mongkol, knowing where the girls are, gives Jake plans and intelligence and they both need the girls alive. Jake must engage in a rescue effort that will put him to the ultimate test as he takes on Jantapan in a battle in which death may be the only ending.  Later that night, Jake and Sunti plan to rescue the girls who are locked in a cell in Jantapan's mansion. After killing two gang members guarding the cell and freeing the girls, a horde of corrupt Thai policemen intervene and make a deadly shootout but end up dead through the firearms of the two. Meanwhile, Sunti kills the rest of the cops while Jake battles with Jantapan in the upstairs living room. Jake kills Jantapan by disarming him and inflicts several injuries in his body like breaking his neck. He ends the fight by throwing Jantapan in a display cabinet which crushes his spine killing him. Jake returns downstairs which is now full of dead bodies of Thai police and embraces the girls and then Sunti only to discover he is fatally injured. Sunti wishes Jake farewell before dying in his arms. Military forces led by Leon and their General enter but Leon orders them to hold fire after seeing Jake with the dead Sunti and kidnapped girls.  After the battle, a Buddhist funeral with Jake in the lead is seen. Jake steps into the river and throws Sunti's ashes in the water. A vision of Sunti smiling fades in and later fades out. Jake was looking at the river and saying "Goodbye, brother."  
The Best Two Years
  ''The Best Two Years'' portrays the experience of four [[Missionary#LDS missionaries|missionaries]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] living in the same apartment in [[Haarlem]] in the [[Netherlands]].  The movie begins with [[Elder (religious)|Elder]] Rogers finding out that his new companion will be a "greenie", a newly trained missionary fresh from the [[Missionary Training Center]].  He and the other two missionaries that reside in the same apartment, Elder Johnson and Elder Van Pelt, go to the [[train]] [[train station|station]] to meet the new elder.  Elder Rogers finds out that the new missionary, Elder Calhoun, is exactly what he had jokingly predicted his new companion would be like.  Elder Rogers used to be an excellent missionary, until his girlfriend married one of his former mission companions.  That is why he and the other two missionaries residing in the same apartment are surprised that the mission president has assigned him to be the trainer (first companion and mentor) to a missionary new to the mission.  The new missionary, Elder Calhoun, tackles mission work with unbounded enthusiasm.  He attempts to talk to anyone although he has little knowledge of the [[Dutch language]].  Despite his poor Dutch, he continues to have an eager attitude.  Fortunately for him, he soon encounters a man from the [[United States]] that speaks [[English language|English]].  They speak briefly in the park before the man goes off with his girlfriend.  Later, when he encounters the same man in a market, Calhoun gives him a Dutch [[Book of Mormon]] with his telephone number.  Despite what the other three missionaries expect, the man does call and asks for Calhoun.  The man doesn't want to meet the missionaries in his own apartment because his roommates wouldn't understand.  The missionaries arrange for him to meet them in their apartment.  When he tries to give back the Book of Mormon because he doesn't read Dutch, they promptly give him one in English. The missionaries find out his name (Kyle Harrison) and teach him a discussion (short lesson) about [[Joseph Smith]] and Joseph's [[First Vision]].  Afterwards, Kyle shows sincere desire to learn more, so the missionaries schedule another discussion.  Tension has been building throughout the entire movie between Elder Johnson and Elder Van Pelt.  Earlier, Johnson had received an [[audio tape]] from his girlfriend.  He hasn't been able to play the tape for several days because Van Pelt had lent their tape player to a [[Ward (LDS Church)|ward]] member.  Also, Van Pelt is annoyed by Johnson's repeated use of the word "flip", as a mild substitute for any of a number of [[profanity|profane]] words. Johnson had told Van Pelt to hit him every time he used that word, but while waiting outside the apartment Johnson says it, and frustrated with Van Pelt for always hitting him, physically forces him to stop, showing his anger. This tension culminates outside of the missionary apartment just as Kyle is leaving from his first discussion. As he is leaving, Johnson and Van Pelt are looking in, hoping for him to leave soon. However, Johnson states: "Oh, flip! They're just standing around in there!" Forgetting Johnson's threats if he does so again, Van Pelt hits Johnson on the back. Johnson chases Van Pelt around, and eventually, as Kyle is on his way out of the door, Van Pelt enters and hides. Johnson quickly bursts in as well, smashing Kyle behind the door. He demands to know where Van Pelt is, and misunderstands most of what Rogers says and hears only, "Behind the door" . He angrily starts to smash Kyle even more, until he realized what he just did. Rogers and Calhoun leave with Kyle out the door, but rush back in when they hear Van Pelt scream. They run in to see that Johnson has just [[hogtie]]d Van Pelt with a rope when the mission president arrives in the apartment.  President Sandburg gives Johnson and Van Pelt a mild, but appropriate and effective, reprimand for their misbehavior.  (Prescriptions were respectively  and .)  He recommends Elder Calhoun work on his Dutch, ( Calhoun had, in Dutch, stated: "With all the walking and bike riding, my rear end has become quite beautiful."), and gently reprimands Rogers for not having written letters to his mother for a while, and persuades him to send at least one letter a week home for the remainder of his mission.  Things start to get worse for Elder Johnson when the president has to talk to him and Van Pelt decides to listen to his tape from his girlfriend. At the end of the tape, Johnson's girlfriend reveals she is getting married to a returned missionary after dating him for three weeks.  The second discussion with Kyle is followed by several more, again in the missionaries' apartment.  He does decide to be become a member of the Church.  The [[Baptism (Mormonism)|baptism]] is scheduled for the Saturday just over a week from then.  Kyle chooses Rogers to baptize him, to the great surprise of Rogers.  Johnson starts to resemble Elder Rogers when he starts to not do his work and jokingly says that the zone leaders are coming to promote Van Pelt because of Van Pelts' high hopes, like those Rogers had when his girlfriend broke up with him. Afterwards, Rogers convinces him to not do the same thing he did after Calhoun and Van Pelt leave for a store.  The baptism takes place in a [[river]] as scheduled, on the same day that Rogers is leaving for home.  There are long good-byes at the [[train station]].  And in the station, with Rogers looking on from the train, Calhoun finally understands and speaks Dutch well.  
The Best of Youth
 ''The Best of Youth'' is a [[family saga]] set in Italy from 1966 through 2003. It chronicles the life of an Italian family, the Caratis, but focuses primarily on two brothers, Matteo ([[Alessio Boni]]) and Nicola ([[Luigi Lo Cascio]]), documenting their journey from the prime of their wild youth in the mid-1960s [[counterculture]], to [[parenting|parenthood]] and [[retirement]] in the early 2000s. The film aims to show the interaction of the personal and the political, the ways in which small events may become turning points in the important choices made by individuals.  ===1966 summer=== Two brothers go their separate ways after attempting to rescue a young girl, Giorgia ([[Jasmine Trinca]]), from an abusive sanitarium. The brothers are Matteo and Nicola Carati ([[Alessio Boni]] and [[Luigi Lo Cascio]]). Their parents are Angelo (Andrea Tidona) and Adriana ([[Adriana Asti]]), their older sister is Giovanna (Lidia Vitale), and their younger sister is Francesca (Valentina Carnelutti). Their friends, their lovers and others drift through, including Giorgia who struggles with mental issues, but whose life seems to follow in parallel.  Matteo walks out of his first exam, while Nicola qualifies as a doctor (and will pursue a career in [[psychiatry]]). Matteo takes mental patients for walks to help them begin to feel normal and takes a particular interest in his patient Giorgia. Noticing that Giorgia has been wounded by [[electroshock]] therapy, he decides to remove her from the [[institution]] and take her along with him and Nicola&mdash;who are about to go on a trip to [[Norway]].  Eventually, Giorgia is captured by the police and taken back to the [[Insane asylum|asylum]]. Matteo, filled with sadness and depression, returns to [[Rome]] and joins the army.  Nicola continues to Norway and gets a job as a [[lumberjack]]. The brothers meet again in [[Florence]] just after the 1966 [[Flood of the River Arno in Florence|Arno River flood]]. Here, Nicola meets a university student, Giulia ([[Sonia Bergamasco]]).  ===1968 February=== Nicola and Giulia are living together in Turin, but the two do not marry.  ===1974=== Matteo leaves the army and joins the police force. During this time, Matteo shows signs of continuing depression and anger. He accepts an assignment in [[Sicily]], a place corrupted by the Mafia. Meanwhile, Nicola and Giulia conceive and care for Sara, their daughter.  ===1977=== In Sicily, Matteo meets a photographer in a ''caffè'' named Mirella ([[Maya Sansa]]). She wants to be a librarian, and he advises her to work at a beautiful library in Rome.  Because of his temper, Matteo is forced to leave Sicily. He decides to reside in Rome but refuses to visit his mother.  Meanwhile, Nicola becomes a psychiatrist, and works to eliminate the abuse and maltreatment of patients in mental hospitals. He finds Giorgia in one of these hospitals. She is tied to a bed in inhumane conditions, does not talk, and shows fear of being touched by others. After some time, Giulia gets drawn into a secret [[Red Brigades]] [[covert cell|cell]]. One night, she leaves Nicola and Sara and disappears into the [[terrorist]] underground.  ===1983=== Years later Matteo walks into that same library and sees Mirella for the second time. They fall in love, and one evening, make love in a car.  Eventually he pushes her away.  ===1983 December=== Mirella meets with Matteo with news for him, but he behaves harshly and forces her to leave. On New Year's Eve, Matteo decides to finally visit his mother. Everyone is there to celebrate. Instead of waiting for the traditional toasts, however, Matteo decides to leave early and, at midnight, jumps off the balcony of his apartment and kills himself.  The family is devastated by the tragedy. No longer motivated, Nicola's mother quits her teaching job and lives a life in solitude in Rome. Nicola, feeling that he could have saved Matteo and not wanting to make the same mistake again, arranges for the capture of Giulia to prevent her from killing someone else or from getting killed. She is sentenced to 17 years in jail. During her jail term, Nicola visits Giulia and proposes to her but is rejected.  ===1992 spring=== Nicola finds a photograph of Matteo taken by Mirella. He is encouraged by Giorgia to meet with Mirella which, after some hesitation, he agrees to do. When he meets Mirella, Nicola learns about her son (Andrea) and that Matteo was the father. Nicola breaks this exciting news to his mother and they visit Mirella and the boy on the small island of Stromboli. Inspired by new meaning in her life, Nicola's mother decides to stay with Mirella and her grandson.  Meanwhile, Sara, now in her early twenties, is still struggling with the poor choices her mother has made. She decides to move to Rome to study [[Conservation-restoration|art conservation]] and becomes engaged to Mimmo. During this time, Nicola finds out his mother has died and, as a result, travels to Stromboli to visit Mirella and pay his respects.  ===2000 spring=== Having finally moved past the death of Matteo, Nicola and Mirella fall in love. Sara, now happy and strong, is encouraged by Nicola to confront her mother and try to patch things up. Giulia, now out of jail and in desperate need of love, embraces Sara, but is not ready to open up completely.  ===2003=== The film ends with Matteo's son, Andrea, visiting [[Norway]], specifically [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]], which is where his father and Nicola ventured to go at the beginning of the movie, but never completed their journey.

Beyond Borders (film)
  While attending a fund-raising gala, Sarah Jordan ([[Angelina Jolie]]), a naive, married American socialite living in England, witnesses a fiery plea delivered by an intruder – a renegade humanitarian, Dr. Nick Callahan ([[Clive Owen]]). His plea made on behalf of impoverished children under his care turns Sarah's life upside down. Attracted to Nick and his cause, she impulsively abandons her job at an art gallery and sheltered life in England to work alongside him in his effort to aid the refugee camps. She travels to Ethiopia.  As Sarah's work takes her to these volatile areas, where few people have traveled and even fewer have survived, she discovers that the harsh realities she encounters, and her growing romantic attraction to the charismatic, unpredictable doctor, ignite in her a passion for saving lives, while risking her own in the process. She works for humanitarian and human rights organizations for ten years after she first travels to Ethiopia, and eventually works for the U.N.H.C.R. and acts as a regional representative for the United Kingdom.  
Beyond Re-Animator
 For the past 13 years, [[Herbert West|Dr. Herbert West]] ([[Jeffrey Combs]]) has been serving a prison sentence due to a murder at the hands of one of his zombies. With what scant supplies he has on hand in the prison medical center, Dr. West has been capable of performing only extremely basic experiments on rats. However, his lack of supplies does not prevent him from uncovering a key element in his re-animation process. Dr. West has discovered "NPE" (Nano-Plasmic Energy), an energy that can be extracted from the brain of a living organism through an electrocution-like process, to be stored in a capsule resembling a small light bulb. The capsule can then be connected to a corpse and used in conjunction with West's previously developed reagent to restore the former dead to a lifelike state. The NPE prevents the degeneration seen in previous instances, where the reanimated are nothing more than mindless zombies. Used together with the re-agent, reanimated corpses regain their skills, memories, and motor functions and nearly fully resemble normal humans.  When a young doctor named Howard Phillips (Jason Barry) comes to work at the prison, West is assigned to assist the new doctor. Due to Phillips' interest with Dr. West's research, West is able to attain the supplies and tools needed to bring his experiments to the next level. It is revealed that Phillips is the younger brother of the teenage girl who was killed by West's zombie (he's shown watching West being taken away by the cops) and came to the prison for the explicit purpose of working with him. Despite his interest, Phillips still maintains an ethical reluctance to allow West's research to full completion. In the meantime, journalist Laura Olney (Elsa Pataky), covering a story for her newspaper at the prison, meets and begins an affair with Dr. Phillips, and they fall in love. This new romance only temporarily postpones West's experiment, however. After the warden of the prison, also infatuated with Laura, attempts to seduce Laura himself, she resists and he angrily kills her.  Crushed by Laura's death, Dr. Phillips succumbs to Dr. West's wishes and his experiments are allowed to literally take on new life. West & Phillips revive Laura with the NPE, although it is quickly seen that the dangerous side effects of West's past work are still present with the NPE. Eventually the warden of the prison uncovers West's experiments and moves to put an end to them, but he is killed by West, and subsequently re-animated. West uses the NPE from a prisoner's pet rat, causing some unexpected side effects in the warden's behavior. It quickly manifests itself as the prison descends into utter chaos as a riot breaks out, with vials of the reagent circulating through the population. Soon, it is unclear who is dead, who is alive, and who has been exposed to the agent.   When the chaos finally settles from the (very) bloody prison riot, West escapes captivity before the guards appear by stealing Phillips' I.D. (when he comes across Phillips weeping over Laura's decapitated body). As police and authorities take control of the prison, Herbert West is shown putting on his glasses outside the prison, and disappears into the night to continue his research.  
Bhoot (film)
 The story is about Vishal ([[Ajay Devgn]]) who is married to Swati ([[Urmila Matondkar]]). The couple rents a high rise apartment at a ridiculously low price. The caretaker of the apartment, Mr Thakkar ([[Amar Talwar]]) explains to Vishal that a widow named Manjeet Khosla ([[Barkha Madan]]), the previous resident, committed suicide after killing her own son. Vishal hides this fact from Swati, as she will object to buying such a residence. But Mr.Thakkar accidentally slips in the secret.  Swati is livid at Vishal, although he disbelieves the notions of ghosts and bad luck. Then, Swati starts behaving strangely. Vishal consults Dr Rajan ([[Victor Banerjee]]). But soon enough, Vishal witnesses Swati killing the watchman of the apartment in a supernatural way, and his skepticism is rudely challenged. Inspector Qureshi ([[Nana Patekar]]), who reaches the apartment to investigate the death, becomes suspicious of the duo and their strange behaviour. He follows Vishal and Dr. Rajan.  Vishal's maid witnesses Swati shouting and throwing Vishal away. She helps him tie her. She tells him that Swathi was shouting like Manjeet and tells him that an exorcist can help her but not doctors. Finally, Vishal's maid calls an exorcist named Sarita ([[Rekha]]). Sarita sees the ghosts of Manjeet and her son. She advises Vishal to meet Manjeet's mother ([[Tanuja]]), since she can placate her daughter's spirit. Vishal complies and meets Manjeet's mother. He learns from Manjeet's mother that Manjeet was not the type of woman who would commit suicide. He explains the situation to her and asks her help. She comes with him and somehow placates Manjeet's spirit.  They come to know that Mr.Thakkar's son, Sanjay ([[Fardeen Khan]]) tries to molest Manjeet and when she resists she accidentally falls off the balcony and dies. Hence, Sarita advises Vishal to call him. Vishal makes an unknown call to Sanjay and tells him that his father is sick. When Sanjay arrives, Vishal cleverly tells Mr. Thakkar and Sanjay to help him take Swathi to the hospital.  It is then revealed that many years ago, Sanjay came to visit his father and lusted for Manjeet, after he saw her in the apartment. He broke into her house, and attempted to profess his lust, but when she rejected him, he pushed her and she accidentally fell off the balcony and died. Manjeet's young son witnessed the murder, upon which Sanjay hired the watchman to kill him.  Manjeet, who has still possessed Swati's body, sees Sanjay and chases him. Qureshi tries to stop her, having no idea of the real story. Swathi tries to kill Sanjay by strangulating him. But, Sarita asks Manjeet to leave him as the blame will come upon Swathi.  Sanjay escapes, only to find himself surrounded by Vishal, Sarita, Manjeet and Qureshi who now knows the truth. A terrified Sanjay confesses to the crimes, upon which Manjeet's mother urges her to stop. Sanjay is arrested by Inspector Qureshi, and thrown into jail. Manjeet leaves Swati's body, and Vishal and Swati live a good life in the apartment. Meanwhile, in the lockup, Qureshi tells Sanjay that death sentences are light penalties for a criminal like him. He wishes that Sanjay gets a bigger punishment. After Qureshi leaves the darkened cell, Sanjay finds himself face to face with Manjeet. He starts begging for mercy, but his voice soon fades out as Manjeet draws closer; it is implied that she kills Sanjay.  
Bhalo Theko
 The film is set in Acharya [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]]'s home in [[Falta, South 24 Parganas|Falta]], West Bengal, masquerading as [[Uttarpara]]. It deals with the story of a girl Anandi and her family (including uncle, brother, parents and sister), lover (brother's friend Babua) and few neighbours. Nature, tradition and love are Anandi's pillars of support in difficult times. Her brother will slowly drift away with bad or risky companies, will not return home one day, and will be lost forever. Her parents will die heartbroken and her sister will get married suddenly and will leave the family. Babua will go abroad and marry somebody else.  It is implied that Anandi is forgetful of her sorrows that she was deceived by Babua ([[Joy Sengupta]]) whom she loved most. Babua comes back from abroad only to say: 'Anandi, I came back to set you free.'  ''Bhalo Theko'' has a non-linear pace with frequent jumps between current time and past. Film critics described Anandi as a large canvas painted in several hues. She stands against rootless internalisation and perplexed culture. A poem by a renowned Bangladeshi author and scholar [[Humayun Azad]] named "[[Shuvescha]]" was recited in the ending of the film by Anandi while wandering lonely in their garden.<ref></ref>  
The Big Empty (2003 film)
  John Person (his [[stage name]]) is an out-of-work actor living in [[Los Angeles]], with credit card debt of almost $28,000. Across the hall from him lives his friend, Grace. One night, his nebbish neighbor Neely, who wears a [[neck brace]], invades his apartment with an unusual request: deliver a large blue suitcase to the [[truck stop]] of [[Baker, California]], where it will be picked up by a man named "Cowboy", for which he will be given $25,000. John is also given a gun to defend against anyone taking the case. He initially refuses and thinks the plan is insane, but Neely has a file containing much of John's personal information, including [[masturbation]] preferences and sperm sample test results. Realizing that Neely is serious, John takes the job, but demands that he be given $28,000 to pay off his debts. Neely agrees, and John drives to Baker.  In Baker, he checks into the Royal Hawaiian Motel, where he meets Elron, the peppy manager, who tells him that John has just missed meeting "Cowboy", and describes him as wearing a "big, stupid black [[duster (clothing)|duster]] and a black [[Stetson]]". Looking for a drink, John meets the bartender Stella, and is immediately held at gunpoint by the hot-tempered Randy, who thinks John is after his girlfriend. Later that night, a young girl named Ruthie comes to John's hotel room and gives back his wallet that he dropped in the bar, and they hit it off. Later, John finds that Ruthie is Randy's girlfriend.  The next day, John goes to a diner and meets Dan, who tells a lot of [[tall tale]]s and [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] about what goes on in the desert. Later, John meets Ruthie outside a gas station, where he buys her some beer and [[Jack Daniel's]] whiskey, and a can of whipped cream. Then, they drive out to Devil's Crest lake bed far out of town. She describes how RVs and people "disappear without a trace" out there. The two then get drunk, mostly on a mixture of Jack Daniel's and whipped cream. Ruthie gets sick and faints, so John drives her home to Stella's bar.  The next day, the jealous Randy confronts John and asks what Ruthie and he did at Devil's Crest, and threatens to kill him if he even talks to Ruthie anymore. Later, at the bar, Stella reveals that she is not really Ruthie's mother, but that she found Ruthie wandering around the dry lake bed at Devil's Crest when she was two years old.  John goes back to the motel, and hears that he missed Cowboy again, but that Cowboy left him a package: a bowling ball bag that he is supposed to hold on to, and is not allowed to open. Neely's name is on the name tag. Back at the hotel, Grace calls John, and says that Neely was murdered, and that FBI agent Banks was looking for John. She described the murder as Neely getting shot, then beheaded, and tells him Neely's head is missing. John immediately suspects Neely's head is in the bag, but cannot be sure, since he cannot open the bag.  Candy, a [[prostitute|hooker]], comes into John's room, because she heard that John was meeting Cowboy. She previously had an "encounter" with Cowboy, and cautions John, because she has heard a rumor that Cowboy abducted three [[stripper]]s from [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], and they were never seen again. She describes Cowboy's familiar black duster and Stetson, and John immediately becomes suspicious. John soon buries the bag, and meets FBI agent Banks at the bar, who tries to link him to Neely's murder and 75 mysterious disappearances related to the town of Baker.  The next day, John finds that Randy has stolen his suitcase. He drives down to the junkyard, armed with his gun, and finds that Randy has tied Ruthie up. Randy and John have an armed standoff, but John convinces Randy to let Ruthie and him  go by threatening to shoot Ruthie. Later, Ruthie comes to John's hotel room to tell him that Randy was arrested, and they make love.  The following evening, Randy points a [[shotgun]] at John, and orders him to drive out to the desert and dig a grave. After the hole is dug, Randy is about to shoot him, but Randy is shot by Cowboy. Cowboy and John go back to the motel, and John finds more suitcases stacked in his room. Cowboy asks John to drive out to the dry lake bed at Devil's Crest with the suitcases, but John refuses, saying "he's done his job." Cowboy convinces John to take the suitcases by using Grace as a [[hostage]]. John goes to Devil's Crest and meets Bob the Indian who tells John where to leave the highway and how to arrange the suitcases in a circle, then drives away.  Cowboy arrives in an RV, with a group of travelers in blue tracksuits, similar to one Neely wore. One of the travelers is Ruthie. Cowboy opens the infamous bowling bag, and pulls out a pair of size-11 [[bowling shoes]]. He offers them to John, claiming that he will offer him a chance to "come with him" to Paradise. He refuses, so Cowboy instead gives the shoes to the barefooted Ruthie. John asks Ruthie about it, and she excitedly asks John to come with her. He declines, and then Cowboy shoots a [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flare]] into the air. John warily asks what the Cowboy is, and is told he is a cowboy, pure and simple, even as his skin begins to turn both blue and translucent.  As the flare explodes, John blacks out.  John wakes up alone on a dry lakebed in the middle of the desert. All of the suitcases are open and empty, except for a locked one near John. Frustrated, John takes it, and begins the long walk over sand dunes to the highway. Grace meets him, and says he has been missing for three days. Grace gives John a key from Cowboy and he opens the case to find the $28,000 amount originally promised to him.  Back in Los Angeles, Agent Banks interrogates him about what happened in Baker, which explains the 75 disappearances attributed to Cowboy. Banks says that he cannot bring a story like this to the families of those who have disappeared. He then tells John that his credit card debts were already paid off with money unrelated to the $28,000, which he thinks John won in Vegas. Banks hints that he believes John's story, and John sees a [[band-aid]] on Banks' neck, similar to one that appeared on John's neck after his encounter at Devil's Crest, which is related to one of the conspiracy theories Dan told John about.  Sometime later, John and Grace are on a date at a bowling alley. Grace congratulates John for getting a supporting role in a movie, implying that John's acting prospects are becoming better. She then repeats the Cowboy's line spoken before firing the flare about starting a new game, and her eyes are bright blue. John, wearing size-11 shoes, remarks she looks different, before he bowls a ball down the alley; John's eyes turn bright blue (another sign of an alien encounter). The bowling ball is then shown rolling across the vast moonlit landscape of Devil's Crest. Far in the distance, white flames, apparently from another flare like the Cowboy's, rise from the desert floor.

Biker Boyz
  In the world of underground motorcycle drag racing, the undefeated racer known as Smoke ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) is the undisputed "King of Cali." But Smoke's dominance of the set is about to be threatened by a young motorcycle racing prodigy called Kid ([[Derek Luke (actor)|Derek Luke]]), who is determined to win Smoke's [[Motorcycle helmet|crown]] and earn the coveted title. Kid says that the difference between men and boys are the lessons they learn - and that his father, Slick Will, taught him plenty.  The film starts with Kid, a novice rider and motorcycle club "prospect," assisting his father, Slick Will, as they prepare Smoke's bike for the evening's drag races.  A biker issues a challenge to Smoke, who accepts, and the race begins. In the midst of the race, the other biker suffers a hydraulics malfunction and spins out of control, sending his bike flying from under him into a row of parked bikes, one of which heads right into Slick Will, throwing him through a store window and killing him instantly. At the funeral, dozens of bikers from the "Black Knights" (to whom Slick Will was the mechanic) show up with Smoke, who drops a rose and a signed Black Knights flag into his grave.  Six months later, Kid is now a familiar racer with his custom-powered bike, and he shows up at the events. His first "race" was when he interfered with Stuntman's race with Donny. As he interrupts the race, he pulls off several stunts, notably standing on top of the motorcycle while it is still moving. He wins the race and the crowd seem to like his stunts, much to the dissatisfaction of Smoke. Kid demands to race with Smoke but Smoke says he is too inexperienced and should get experience first.  Kid then goes to a diner where he meets Stuntman, and it is revealed that the two were [[hustling]] in the previous race. Fellow biker Primo tells them to create a bike club; after a bit of persuasion they agree, and Kid goes to the biker jury consisting of 8 leaders of the most powerful biker gangs, where Smoke is the chairman. He apologizes for his disrespect towards Smoke and they all agree to verify the club, calling themselves the "Biker Boyz."  Kid is set to race Motherland to prove himself to Smoke. However he has showed up late to "make an entrance" after Smoke has already beaten his long-time rival Dogg, who is continually after Smoke's helmet. Kid is arrested when racing Motherland, and the rest of the bikers manage to escape. Anita confronts Kid, saying that if he ever races again, she will kick him out of the house.  One night at a Black Knights dance, Kid is challenged to race Dogg and accepts in a fit of rage. Having overheard, Anita finds Smoke before the race, and demands that he stop the race. Angry, Smoke confronts her and demands a reason, and she tells him that Kid is actually ''his'' son, not Slick Will's.  Smoke successfully stops the race by punching out Kid and stealing his keys, but this only leads to a fight between the two, from which Kid comes off considerably worse than Smoke. Smoke then tells him that he is his son, to which Kid angrily goes home and confronts Anita, who confesses that it's the truth. In a rage, he leaves home and moves in with his girlfriend Tina.  Kid decides to turn renegade and after gaining quite a few more followers for his club, announces that "we're gonna win more lids than any crew on the set and we're gonna out hustle every crew off the set" and indicates that from that point on, "Biker Boyz set their own rules." The Biker Boyz get their own hangout and begin hustling several races, but when Stuntman successfully hustles the nephew of a dangerous biker, he and Primo are ambushed at a party. Kid comes to the rescue but is quickly overpowered as the leader of the other club pulls a gun on him; Smoke and some of the other Black Knights intervene and convince the other bikers to stand down. Smoke takes Kid inside and sits down to give him a stern talking-to, but Kid shrugs it off angrily. Aggravated, Smoke finally agrees to race Kid, under the condition that whoever loses will never race again. But first Kid has to race Dogg - this time, at the track.  On the race track, everybody shows up, including the Black Knights. At the race, Dogg and Kid race down, and Kid is going to win, but Dogg plays dirty and causes him to crash; although Kid survives, his bike is wrecked. Later that day, Smoke talks to Kid, and informs him that the authorities are going to close the track, due to many crashes, but he managed to rent a local farm outside of town to race on it. Kid agrees to arrive the next day. Later that night, Kid, Primo, and Stuntman are trying unsuccessfully to fix Kid's bike until Dogg's crew arrives to confront them, but Dogg's mechanic admits that the damage is too severe to be fixed in time for the race. Dogg informs Kid; "There are only 2 bikes as strong and fast as Smoke's: yours, and mine." As a peace offering, Dogg offers to lend Kid ''his'' bike, but only if Kid promises him that he will beat Smoke tomorrow.  On the day of the race, both the crew of the Black Knights and the Biker Boyz arrive. Smoke wants it to be a fair race, with no N20 system, and Kid wants Tina to start the race. Smoke and Kid are racing on a farm with open fields. With the finish line in sight, it is obvious that Smoke will win - however, filled with emotions, he decides to slow down and let his son win the race, becoming the new "King of Cali." Kid tells Smoke to hang onto his crown for a while, and that he'll come and get it someday.  Kid rides off, repeating his sentiment that the difference between men and boys are the lessons they learn, and that his father taught him plenty.

Blackball (film)
 Cliff Starkey (played by [[Paul Kaye]]), is a rebellious young [[bowls]] player, brought up on "the Lynx Estate", with his friend Trevor (played by [[Johnny Vegas]]), and grandfather Mutley (played by [[Bernard Cribbins]]) as a [[painter]] and [[House painter and decorator|decorator]]. He dreams of playing for his [[country]] but always preferring to play by his own rules, was always disapproved by the local [[Torquay]] [[bowls]] club. He learns of [[Australian]] brothers (Carl and Mark Doohan) future tour of England, and plans to get selected for the national team. Starkey would play through the tournament undefeated, defeating veteran player (and thirteen times champion) Ray Speight (played by [[James Cromwell]]). After winning the competition, and becoming eligible to play for England, Speight, the head of the local [[lawn bowls]] association, bans Starkey for fifteen years for writing an expletive on an opponent's scorecard. Angry about the ban, Starkey [[gatecrash]]es the celebration party for Speight, who was declared champion; launching a [[glossary of bowls terms#Wood|wood]] across the dinner table at Speight.  [[File:Screenshot from film Blackball.jpg|left|thumb|[[Paul Kaye|Cliff Starkey]] being presented by [[Vince Vaughn|Rick Schwartz]] as the "bad boy of [[bowls]]".]]  Starkey is then picked up by [[sports agent]] Rick Schwartz (played by [[Vince Vaughn]]), where Starkey is re branded as the "bad boy of bowls", turning the normally sedate sport into a glitzy, in your face competition. Having defeated many lower key players in [[unofficial]] matches, using his variety of [[trick shot]]s Starkey develops a [[romance (love)|romance]] with Kerry Speight (played by [[Alice Evans]]), Ray's daughter. Schwartz proposes a way to get the ban on Starkey lifted, by using this relationship, where the two are spotted by national press, setting Ray Speight to swear at a [[public address]], causing the ban to be removed.  With the sport's popularity at an all-time high, both Speight and Starkey become media celebrities. Schwartzs organises both Starkey and Speight take on [[Australia]]'s unbeaten Doohan brothers in "The Ashes", a one off tournament in a custom made bowls arena in [[Torquay]]. Schwartz; afraid that the relationship with Kerry is affecting Starkey's game; ends his relationship without his consent causing Starkey to fire Schwartz.   Both players have a wide disdain for each other, and are made to use custom bowls for the game. After failing with his woods, and the pressure of the game getting to him, Starkey throws his own woods (and signature [[carrier bag]]) into a [[canal]]. With both players failing at half time, Trevor and Kerry talk to the pair, and get them to work as a team to make a comeback. Starkey would dive into the canal, followed by Ray Speight, who thought Starkey was trying to [[drown]] himself, but was in fact rescuing his own bowls. The two return to the arena, wet and make a comeback thanks to Speight's experience and Starkey's extravagance, to force the game into an extra name (humorously titled the "golden bowl"), much to the disbelief of Carl and Mark Doohan.   The final end, a one bowl play-off, sees a perfect front [[glossary of bowls terms#toucher|toucher]] from Mark Doohan. Speight gives the bowl to Starkey, but stops him from playing his intended [[glossary of bowls terms#Fire|fire shot]], and instead instructs him to play his own signature large [[glossary of bowls terms#arc|inswinging]] bowl. The shot works, and the two celebrate having defeated the Australian team, and make amends with Trevor and Mutley.

Within a few minutes, a large, menacing black car begins stalking them, repeatedly creeping up close and backing off again. Later, they pick up Deputy Sheriff Charlie Harman, whose '86 Chevrolet police cruiser has frozen to death at the side of the road.

Later, the men stop at a cafe at the side of the road to grab some refreshments for the night, where they soon discover a message on the windshield of the SAAB stating "Your sin will find you", mysteriously unremovable.  The trio begins to puzzle why they are being pursued, who its occupants are, and who wrote the message. Suspicious, Scott decides to kick Charlie out of the car and leave him, believing he is the reason they are being chased. The Cadillac then reappears from hiding and Charlie is apparently killed by a gunman in the front seat. As the night progresses, the men attempt to escape and outwit the Cadillac, which causes the SAAB to overheat. In the midst of frustration, a fight breaks out between the three men. CJ intervenes and stops the fight. After spotting a garage in the distance, the three push the SAAB down the road towards it. They try repairing their car, but CJ is soon kidnapped by the Cadillac's occupants while outside. A chase between both cars across the nearby frozen lake ensues, in which Scott's car is finally destroyed by its overheating problems.  CJ is then found tied to a tree, and the reason for the entire set of events is revealed. Charlie, who in truth is a cruel and vindictive man whose death was faked by his brother Luther, the Cadillac's driver, has been attempting to identify the man whom his wife had been seeing at a roadhouse, and learned that it was Scott. As he prepares to kill Scott with a hunting knife, his wife Jeanine taunts and distracts him, allowing Scott, Robbie and CJ to break free and run. An insanely enraged Charlie, now personally driving the Cadillac, chases after them. When he corners Scott at the edge of a cliff, he waits a moment, then charges. His wife appears at the last moment in front of Scott, causing Charlie to veer away, sending the Cadillac crashing down the cliff and into the lake. Charlie and Luther are killed, and the destroyed, burning car sinks into the lake while Scott, CJ, Robbie and Jeanine look on. The next morning, the group finally makes it across the state line into Minnesota.

As he leaves for work one day, four armed men in a car kidnap him and he is incarcerated. Keenan wakes up, almost naked, alone in an iron-clad room. Initially he refuses to eat until he is told why he is being held prisoner. He is kept on his own but eventually he is moved into a cell in a deserted house, where he is joined by another hostage, the English journalist John McCarthy, who had been reporting on Keenan’s kidnapping not long before he himself was abducted. The grumpy Brit-hating Irishman and the more pliable British journalist are forced to share their small prison cell.  Keenan refuses to be shaved or wear clean clothes until he gets answers from his captors. He protests about having his beard shaved off.  A grumpy idealist, Keenan sees his treatment by his Muslim jailers as equaling the British historic treatment of Ireland. McCarthy is neutral and pragmatic. The two men are periodically moved around to new hiding places. The pair slowly begin to bond as they make a temporary life together, playing chess, catching mosquitoes, trapping  a mouse, telling stories and imagining they are somewhere else. They become very close friends and when one man is in trouble or close to the breaking point, the other invariably helps him.  Their guards treat them with a mixture of detachment, kindness and cruelty.  After another move, to a small, white-tiled cell, McCarthy is traumatized after being shown a video of his mother pleading for his return. He finds strength in Keenan's own brand of self-control.  The two men are smuggled to a house in the countryside. Keenan attacks a young guard who is trying to humiliate him by making him open and close a window repeatedly. He is beaten. McCarthy intercedes with the leader of the captors saying this should not have been allowed to happen. He too is beaten. Eventually in 1991 after more than four years of imprisonment, Keenan is released. He is reluctant to accept his freedom if it means leaving McCarthy behind.

After regaining consciousness, Kavanaugh is interviewed by Sheriff Kolb (Shepard), however, because of his head injuries, he is unable to explain what has transpired due to a case of temporary [[amnesia]]. Given his condition, Kavanaugh is ordered to stay in the hospital for closer observation.  Much to their dismay, Sheriff Kolb and his deputies are unable to find any clues as to what might have happened to Kavanaugh. After a thorough search of the crime scene, Sheriff Kolb returns to the hospital to find that Kavanaugh, in a violent and confused state, is claiming to have knowledge of a possible assassination attempt on the president of the United States. Dr. Conway ([[Gil Bellows]]) persuades Kavanaugh to remain calm and later explains to Sheriff Kolb that his paranoia stems from a delusional side effect of the amnesia. Amongst the added confusion, Kavanaugh experiences a myriad of images that could be pure fantasy or actual pre-amnesiatic memories. The most vivid image, one in which a dark, shadowy figure is seen talking with a mysterious woman named Ms. K (Dunaway), hints at various details of a possible assassination attempt involving key government parties. However, because of Kavanaugh's deranged state, he is unable to differentiate between reality and fantasy.  Sheriff Kolb believes that there is some credibility to Kavanaugh's story and continues to question him. To further complicate matters for Kavanaugh, his fiancée, Chloe (Campbell), arrives at the hospital and makes arrangements for his immediate release. It is then revealed through Chloe that she and Kavanaugh are actually from [[Chicago]] and that Kavanaugh works for the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]]. She produces documentation that verifies Kavanaugh's employment with the government, and further explains to Sheriff Kolb that she and Kavanaugh were in New Mexico on vacation. She also produces a seaside photo of Kavanaugh and herself walking on a beach as further proof that she is his fiancée. Kavanaugh still strongly believes in an imminent attempt on the President's life and later calls the [[US Secret Service]] and warns them of an assassination plot that will occur in Black Point within the next few days. Distraught over his situation, Chloe convinces Kavanaugh to leave the hospital with her, and she drives him back to the motel they had checked into a few days earlier. Incidentally, recent news updates reveal that the President and his campaign team have been touring the Southwest and will arrive in New Mexico within the next few days.  As the President arrives and prepares to address the public, Kavanaugh attempts to follow what evidence he has to warn the authorities and avert the assassination. While he views the President from a nearby building, he discovers a set of sniper's equipment, including a rifle, which he instinctively assembles. Taking aim out of the window, he sights the President through the scope of the rifle, and realizes that he, in fact, is the assassin, and that his flashbacks are of all the preparation leading up to the date of the event. He notices another assassin taking aim at the President with his sniper rifle from the other side. Understanding that he has the power to change the course of events, Kavanaugh aims at the other assassin through his scope and shoots him, killing him and averting the assassination.

However, it becomes apparent that although she is from a very different social stratum than Peter, and has a self-presentation which is the polar opposite of his, she is nonetheless kind, intelligent, ingenious, and well-educated in the law, thanks to the studying she did while she was incarcerated.  At one point, Charlene is forced to “pass” as the nanny of Peter’s children. She ends up genuinely making friends with the children, and she is able to help Peter’s son Georgie overcome his inability to read, as well as forcibly sorting out Peter’s daughter Sarah’s boyfriend problems.

Munna's friends walk out of their homes too, in a show of solidarity for Munna and Harini.  Mangalam helps the teenagers find a modest residence and they take up part-time jobs to support themselves, including their education. This does not prove successful, so Mangalam encourages them to explore their natural musical talents. The teenagers form a band named "Boys", composing modern versions of popular Tamil devotional songs, and eventually gain recognition. Soon, they are approached by a [[Naxalite]] group to compose songs against the government. They do it for the money and are eventually arrested under [[Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002|POTA]].

Harini, who is deeply hurt at this revelation, leaves Munna and returns to her parents, despite his insistence that they did not meet before the encounter and that he did not have sex with Rani. As Rani is the only one who can prove that Munna did not have sex with her, the friends begin searching for her. Kumar spots her on a moving bus and tries to get on it. In the process he falls under the wheels of the bus and dies. Munna decides that his words were more than enough proof for Harini and accepts her decision.  The gang's album soon releases and becomes a huge hit. But without Harini, the lead female vocal, the record labels are unwilling to sign them. When the boys request Harini’s presence for a live show on [[MTV India|MTV]], her parents accept, but on the condition that Munna sign the divorce papers. Munna agrees, realising that their career is more important than their love. The group has a very successful live debut. They dedicate their first live success in memory of Kumar. They also dedicate their success to Mangalam, whom Krishna calls their godfather.  On the day of the divorce hearing, Mangalam, now the pop group’s manager, fields many calls to replace Harini with another girl. When Harini looks at the pictures of all the pretty girls vying to be the group’s new lead female vocal, a bout of jealousy strikes her. She gets angry and starts hitting Munna.

Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering the body of [[Jimmy Hoffa]], earning him his job back, or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off. Bruce, still wanting the anchor position as well as wanting to get revenge on Evan Baxter for taunting him, uses his powers to make Evan humiliate himself on air, causing Bruce to be promoted to anchor position while Evan gets fired.  After taking Grace to a fancy dinner and telling her about his promotion (disappointing her, as she thought he was going to propose), Bruce begins to hear voices in his head. He re-encounters God, who explains that the voices are prayers to God, and that Bruce must deal with them. Bruce creates an e-mail system to receive prayers and respond to them - but finds that the influx is far too great for him to handle, even with the use of his powers. So he sets the program to automatically answer "Yes" to every prayer, thinking this will make everyone happy.  During a party to celebrate Bruce's promotion, Susan seduces and kisses him. When Grace arrives and sees this, she angrily storms out; Bruce follows her, but she is heartbroken and won't listen to him. He tries to use his powers to convince Grace to stay, but cannot influence her free will (causing his relationship with her to get mocked by Susan). As Bruce looks around, he realizes that automatically granting everyone's prayers has plunged the city into chaos. Bruce returns to God, who explains that despite how chaotic things seem, there is always a way to make things right, and that Bruce must figure out a way to solve it himself. Bruce then begins to solve his problems in life practically, such as helping a man whose car has broken down, potty training his dog properly, and allowing Evan to have his job back (and actually congratulating him, in contrast to his fake congratulation earlier).  Bruce returns to his computer system, having briefly unplugged it, and he finds many prayers from Grace about Bruce. As he reads them, another prayer from Grace arrives, this one wishing not to be in love with Bruce anymore. A despondent Bruce walks alone on a highway, asking God to take back His powers and letting his fate be in His hands. Bruce is suddenly struck by a truck and regains consciousness in a white void (''[[heaven]]'').   God appears and tells Bruce to pray for what he truly wants; Bruce prays for Grace to find a man that would make her happy. God agrees and Bruce finds himself in the hospital, shortly after being miraculously revived by the doctors. Grace arrives and the two reconcile. After his recovery, Bruce returns to his field of reporting simple stories and takes more pleasure in it. Bruce and Grace announce their engagement on live television. The film ends with the homeless man Bruce had ran into on various occasions turning into God, who claps the film off.  
The Brown Bunny
 Motorcycle racer Bud Clay undertakes a cross-country drive, following a race in New Hampshire, in order to participate in a race in California. All the while he is haunted by memories of his former lover, Daisy. On his journey he meets three women, but Bud seems to be a lost soul, and he is unable to form an emotional connection with any of them. He first meets Violet at a gas station in New Hampshire and convinces her to join him on his trip. They stop at her home in order to get her clothes, but he drives off as soon as she enters the house.  Bud's next stop is the home of Daisy's parents, the location of Daisy's brown bunny. Daisy's mother does not remember Bud, who grew up in the house next door, nor does she remember having visited Bud and Daisy in California. Next, Bud stops at a pet shelter, where he asks about the life expectancy of rabbits (he is told it is about five or six years). At a highway rest stop, he meets a distressed woman, Lilly. He comforts and kisses her, before starting to cry and eventually leaving her. Bud appears more distressed as the road trip continues, crying as he drives. He stops at the [[Bonneville Speedway]] to race his motorcycle. In [[Las Vegas]], he drives around prostitutes on street corners, before deciding to ask one of them, Rose, to join him for a lunch. She eats [[McDonald's]] food in his truck until he stops, pays her, and leaves her back on the street.  After having his motorcycle checked in a Los Angeles garage, Bud stops at Daisy's house, which appears abandoned. He leaves a note on the door frame, after sitting in his truck in the driveway remembering about kissing Daisy in this place, and checks in at a hotel. Daisy eventually appears there. She seems nervous, going to the bathroom twice to smoke [[crack cocaine]], while Bud waits for her, sitting on his bed. As she proposes to go out to buy something to drink, Bud tells her that, because of what happened the last time they saw each other, he does not drink anymore.  They have an argument about Daisy kissing other men. At this point, Bud undresses Daisy and she  [[fellates]] him. Once done, he insults her as they lie in bed, talking about what happened during their last meeting. Bud continuously asks Daisy why she had been involved with some men at a party. She explains that she was just being friendly and wanted to smoke [[marijuana]] with them. Bud becomes upset because Daisy was pregnant and it transpires that the baby died as a result of what happened at this party.  Through flashback scenes, the viewer understands that Daisy was [[rape]]d at the party, a scene witnessed by Bud, who did not intervene. Daisy asks Bud why he did not help her, and his feelings of guilt on this are considerable. He tells her that he did not know what to do, and so he decided to leave the party. After he came back a bit later, he saw an ambulance in front of the house and Daisy explains to Bud that she is dead, having passed out prior to the rape and then choked to death on her own vomit. Bud awakens the next morning, alone; his encounter with Daisy turns out to have been a figment of his imagination. The movie ends as Bud is driving his truck in California.  
Brother Bear
 The film is set in a post-[[ice age]] Alaska, where the local tribesmen believe all creatures are created through the Spirits, who are said to appear in the form of an [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]. Three brothers (Kenai, the youngest brother; Denahi, the middle brother; and Sitka, the eldest brother) return to their tribe in order for Kenai to receive his totem, a necklace in the shape of an animal. The particular animal it represents symbolizes what he must achieve to call himself a man. Unlike Sitka, who gained the eagle of guidance, and Denahi, who gained the wolf of wisdom, Kenai receives the bear of love. He objects to this, stating that bears are thieves, and believes his point is made a fact when a bear takes some salmon. Kenai and his brothers pursue the bear, but a fight follows on a glacier, during which Sitka gives his life to save his brothers, although the bear survives. Angered, Kenai heads out to avenge Sitka. He chases the bear up onto a mountain and kills it. The Spirits, represented by Sitka's spirit in the form of a bald eagle, transform Kenai into a bear after the dead bear's body evaporates. Denahi arrives, mistaking Kenai as dead, and believing his bear form is responsible, vows to avenge Kenai by hunting it down.  Kenai falls down some rapids, survives, and is healed by Tanana, the shaman of Kenai's tribe. She does not speak the bear language, but advises him to return to the mountain to find Sitka and be turned back to normal, but only when he amends his mistake; she disappears without an explanation. Kenai quickly discovers the wildlife can talk, meeting two brother moose, Rutt and Tuke. He gets caught in a trap, but is freed by an outgoing bear cub named Koda. They make a deal: Kenai will go with Koda to a nearby [[salmon run]] and then the cub will lead Kenai to the mountain. As the two eventually form a sibling-like attachment, Koda reveals that his mother is missing. The two are hunted by Denahi, who is still determined to avenge Kenai, unaware that the bear he is pursuing is actually Kenai. Eventually, Kenai and Koda reach the salmon run, where a large number of bears live as a family, including the leader Tug, a [[Grizzly Bear|grizzly bear]]. Kenai adjusts to his surroundings and is happy living with the other bears. During a discussion among the bears, Koda tells a story about his mother fighting human hunters, making Kenai realize that the bear he killed was Koda's mother.   Shocked and horrified at what he has done, Kenai runs away in a fit of guilt, but Koda soon finds him. Kenai reveals the truth to Koda, who runs away, grief-stricken. An apologetic Kenai leaves to reach the mountain. Rutt and Tuke, having had a falling out, reform their brotherhood in front of Koda, prompting him to go after Kenai. Denahi confronts Kenai on the mountain, but their fight is interrupted by Koda, who steals Denahi's hunting pike. Kenai goes to Koda's aid out of love, prompting Sitka to appear and turn him back into a human, much to Denahi and Koda's surprise. However, upon realizing that Koda needs him because of his own misdeeds, Kenai asks Sitka to transform him back into a bear with Denahi's support. Sitka complies, and Koda is reunited briefly with the spirit of his mother, before she and Sitka return to the Spirits. In the end, Kenai lives with the rest of the bears and gains his title as a man, through being a bear.

Bulletproof Monk
  In [[Tibet]], 1943, a Tibetan monk is informed by his master that he has fulfilled a series of prophecies that mark him as his successor. The monk, forgoing his name, is entrusted with guarding a scroll his master protected, that contains knowledge that will make its reader powerful, young, and immune to injury. Granted its powers, the monk learns he will need to find his own successor to pass on the scroll in his future. Shortly after he receives the scroll, he is forced to flee when German soldiers, led by their officer Strucker, attack the monk's temple and kill his master. Strucker, who sought the scroll for his own desires, vows to track down the monk.  Sixty years later, the nameless Monk witnesses a young pickpocket named Kar, fleeing from police after he was caught robbing one of their officers, along with members of a local gang who do not like him pick-pocketing on their turf. When the pair collide into a young girl and put her into the path of an oncoming train, Kar and Monk rescue her. Shortly after the pair introduce themselves to each other, Kar steals the scroll from Monk and runs away. Monk pursues after him, suspecting he may be a suitable successor to his role, based on three prophecies his master told him before his death, the first of which Kar has fulfilled. When Kar finds himself fighting against the local gang's leader, he meets a young woman named Jade, whom he falls in love with. The next day, Monk meets with Kar to talk with them, just as Jade approaches them to ask Kar to return her necklace to him, which he had stolen to earn her esteem. The meeting is interrupted when Monk is forced to run from a group of mercenaries seeking him, taking Kar with him.  At an Asian laundromat, Monk reveals that it cellar houses a group of fellow monks who aid him, and decides to show Kar some advanced combat techniques. While training at an abandoned warehouse, the pair are attacked by the mercenaries, who steal the scroll for their employer Nina, the head of the Human Rights Organisation, and Strucker, her grandfather. However, the pair discover the scroll is a fake; Kar learns that the real secret in it was tattooed onto Monk's body. Angered, Nina visits Kar's home to track the pair down, murdering Kar's employer. When Kar learns of this, he proceeds to seek out help from Monk at the laundromat. An ambitious monk betrays the group to Strucker and Nina. While Monk and Kar escape, the mercenaries capture all of the monks and take them a secret facility beneath the Organisation's headquarter, where all are tortured; the monk who betrayed them, is killed.  Seeking help, Kar and Monk visit Jade at her home, learning that she is the daughter of a currently imprisoned Russian crime lord. Monk realises that this fact and a small tussle between Kar and Jade inside the house, has fulfilled the second prophecy he was told about. At that moment, the group are interrupted by Nina and her mercenaries, who capture Monk and take him back to their base. Jade, having met Nina earlier that day when she was opening an exhibit created by the Organisation, helps Kar to infiltrate their headquarters. Both later get separated. Strucker, dressed in his officer's uniform, begins reading the scroll on Monk's body and regains his youth. However, finds that the scroll's last verse is missing, to which Monk reveals he memorised it. Before Strucker can scan Monk's brain for it, Kar arrives and distracts him, allowing Monk to break free. While Jade, having dealt with Nina, works to free the monks, Monk and Kar engage with Strucker and throw him off the headquarter's roof and onto some electric cables.  Believing he has been dealt with, Monk and Kar reunites with the monks and Jade, before the Scroll's contents are transferred to Kar, having fulfilled the third prophecy. Strucker, still alive, attempts to kill Kar, but is killed himself instead by a falling statue. Kar is then surprised to find that Jade has the Scroll's power herself, having survived being shot at by Strucker - like Kar, she also fulfilled the three prophecies, and has the Scroll's content on her body as well. Monk, now aged, meets with Kar and Jade the next day, giving each one half of the final verse, deeming them now inseparable. The pair wish him a good vacation from his duties, before departing to fulfil their new role.

Calendar Girls
                  Annie Clarke and Chris Harper live in the village of Knapely, where they spend their time at the local WI and with each other. Annie's husband, John, is suddenly diagnosed with leukemia and Chris visits John and Annie at the hospital regularly, often complaining bitterly about the uncomfortable couch in the waiting room. After noticing a "girlie" calendar in a local shop, she hits upon the idea of printing a calendar featuring some of the members of the Knapely branch of the [[Women's Institute]] discreetly posing nude while engaged in traditional WI activities, such as baking and knitting, in order to raise funds. Her proposal initially is met with great skepticism, but she eventually convinces ten women to participate in the project with her. They enlist one of the hospital workers, an amateur photographer named Lawrence, to help them with the concept.  The head of the local Women's Institute branch refuses to sanction the calendar, so Chris and Annie go to a national congress of the Women's Institute in [[London]] to plead their case. They are told the final decision rests with the local leader, who grudgingly agrees to the calendar's sale. The initial printing quickly sells out due to popular demand which causes a huge wave of massive media attention from across the nation.  The women are invited to appear on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' in [[Los Angeles]]. All the publicity surrounding the calendar has taken a toll on their personal lives and, during a photo shoot for washing powder, the tension boils over, with Chris and Annie lashing out at each other in angry frustration. Annie accuses Chris of ignoring her husband and son and the demands of the family business in favour of her newfound celebrity, while Chris believes Annie welcomes the [[Mother Teresa]]-like status to which she's been elevated that allows her to cater to the ill and bereaved who have bombarded her with fan mail. All is resolved eventually, and the women return home to resume life as it was before they removed their clothing for the camera.  
Camp (2003 film)
 The film centers on the experiences of several teenagers at Camp Ovation, a summer theatre camp. The campers are a mishmash of youngsters from different backgrounds, dealing with different issues, but all feel most comfortable while performing. School is out, and the campers reunite as they prepare to board the buses to Camp Ovation. Shy, self-conscious Ellen Lucas happily greets her friends, recovering from an embarrassing situation where she desperately tried to land a prom date, and ended up asking her brother. Nerdy Fritzi Wagner attempts to befriend icy diva Jill Simmons, but ends up toting her luggage instead. Returning camper Jenna Malloran laments that her parents forced her to have her jaw wired shut in order to lose weight. Upon arrival to Camp Ovation, the kids settle in. Ellen converses with her friend Michael Flores, a gay teenager who was violently beaten by his classmates after showing up to his junior prom in drag. The campers are struck dumb with the arrival of Vlad Baumann, a handsome new camper who is, as a staff member marvels, "an honest-to-god straight boy."  Camp Ovation puts on a new play or musical every two weeks. Vlad and Ellen bond after rehearsal one day and flirt a bit. However, soon afterward, Vlad is seduced by the conceited Jill, who later makes cruel cracks at Ellen for her weight and her inexperience with boys. Feeling guilty, Vlad comforts Ellen and the two begin to inch toward a relationship. The camp enlists a guest counselor for the summer: composer Bert Hanley, whose play "''The Children's Crusade''" was a [[one-hit wonder]] many years earlier. Frustrated with his lack of recent success, he is now a grumpy alcoholic and shows up two days late at Camp Ovation. He constantly drinks on the camp grounds and is very irritated by Vlad, who idolizes him and attempts to strike up conversation.  Jill shares a cabin with Fritzi, who is still catering to her every whim. However, after Fritzi is caught washing Jill's underwear, Jill expresses her disgust with Fritzi and kicks her out of the cabin. The usually meek Fritzi becomes filled with borderline psychotic rage, and sabotages Jill's next performance in "''[[Company (musical)|Company]]''" by putting Woolite in her Snapple. As Jill vomits during her performance of "The Ladies Who Lunch," Fritzi shows up in costume and takes her place mid-song. She reveals herself to be a talented and passionate actress.  Michael is rooming with Vlad, on whom he has developed a crush. Vlad convinces Michael to invite his parents to his next play, although his father is incredibly unsupportive of his homosexuality. Though his mother tells him they will come, Michael notices mid-performance that they did not. Crushed, he flees the stage. He is found later by Vlad, who explains that he too has his share of problems. Though Vlad is a seemingly normal, all-American teenager, he reveals to Michael that he suffers from an acute type of [[Obsessive Compulsive Disorder|OCD]], for which he is medicated.  Hanley is angered after hearing Vlad play one of his songs, and begins to tell the campers that theater will only make them bitter and lonely, much like himself. Vlad follows a drunken Hanley back to his room and berates him for his cruel speech. After Hanley throws up and passes out, Vlad finds a trove of music that Hanley has written over the years but not released. During a rehearsal for the camp's benefit performance, Vlad and the campers sing "Century Plant", one of Hanley's songs. Hanley's heart is lifted and his disposition changes. Shortly before the benefit, Michael sleeps with Dee, Ellen's roommate, out of frustration about Vlad. When Vlad hears of this, he immediately asks Dee if it was true. Vlad and Dee end up making out on Dee's bed, and Ellen walks in on them. She runs off, hurt, and refuses to talk to Vlad.  The night of the benefit concert arrives, and the campers are starstruck as famed composer [[Stephen Sondheim]] is in attendance. The dressing room atmosphere is tense, and gets even more awkward when Vlad's girlfriend Julie shows up to see him. Meanwhile, in another act of revenge, Fritzi sabotages Jill's makeup, causing her to break out in boils. Jill attacks her, injuring her, and both are unfit to go onstage. To replace her, Bert cuts the wires on Jenna's mouth, allowing her to sing a powerful song directed to her parents in the audience, telling them to accept her as she is.  The benefit is a hit, but Vlad, Michael, and Ellen are still arguing. Vlad and Michael meet up by the lake, where Vlad strips down to gain Michael's attention. After being set straight by Michael, Vlad admits that he is an "attention junkie", and attempts to please everyone in order to gain their good favor. He apologizes to Michael for leading him on. Ellen arrives, and Vlad explains that he still cares about her, and that his girlfriend Julie had just broken up with him. After another apology, Ellen forgives him, and the three go swimming.  During the end credits, the entire cast does an elaborate rendition of [[Todd Rundgren]]'s "Want of a Nail".  
Carandiru (film)
 This episodic story is set in [[São Paulo|São Paulo's]] notorious prison Carandiru, one of Latin America's largest and most violent prison systems.  ''Carandiru'' tells the stories of different inmates at Sāo Paulo’s Carandiru Penitentiary through the filter of Dr. Varella, who goes to the prison to test the inmates for [[HIV]]. Similar to many Brazilian crime films, Dr. Varella narrates ''Carandiru'', however, it is not his story that is told. He (like Buscapé in ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'') acts as a filter for the stories of those that cannot speak.  The inhumane conditions of the prison, such as the 100 square foot cells inhabited by sometimes up to 16 prisoners, are shown, as well as the lack of control that the guards have. Order in the prison is entirely controlled by the prisoners themselves, which leads them to face problems such as murders, rampant drug use, and disease all within the prison.  Several stories are developed, ranging from drug addiction to murder to family struggles to romance. Some of the more memorable stories are Lady Di (a trans female) and No Way’s marriage, Deusdete and Zico’s family dynamic, Ezequiel and Zico’s crack addictions, and Majestade’s “affairs.”  The prisoners are humanized to the audience by telling their stories, which makes the riot and the [[Carandiru Massacre]] even more painful for the audience to watch. Thus, when the film ends with real shots of Carandiru Penitentiary’s demolition, Babenco employs catharsis.<ref name="search.proquest.com"/>

Caterina in the Big City
  Caterina ([[Alice Teghil]]) is the 13-year-old only child of Giancarlo Iacovoni ([[Sergio Castellitto]]), an aspiring novelist and teacher of accounting at a country school in an area north of [[Rome]] that one character describes as "hillbilly country." In spite of his often lucid assessments of modern society, Iacovoni is a typically burned-out teacher whom his job (perhaps among other, undisclosed personal experiences) has imbued with bitterness and social resentment, with a sheer lack of perspective concerning human relations, and with an overbearing, holier-than-thou demeanor that is a major plot point throughout the movie.  He relocates his daughter Caterina and his timid, long-suffering wife Agata ([[Margherita Buy]]) to his birthplace, [[Rome, Italy|Rome]], after having finally secured a long-coveted teaching position. The family settles in Giancarlo's former district, where he reconnects with his neighbor and childhood friend, Fabietto ([[Silvio Vannucci]]). Once settled in the Italian capital, Caterina enrolls in a fast-track high school. She immediately finds herself pulled between two competing student cliques: a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] [[bohemian]] contingent headed by Margherita Rossi-Chaillet and a right-leaning group headed by Daniela Germano. Both clique leaders come from socially prominent families. Margherita's mother is a noted intellectual and political writer. Daniela's father is a right-wing government minister (loosely inspired by real politician [[Gianfranco Fini]]) who married into a wealthy family.  Margherita instantly adopts Caterina as her new best friend. The two girls attend rallies, visit graves of poets, and listen to [[Nick Cave]] records. Margherita kisses Caterina, but it's a bit ambiguous as to whether this is to imply sexuality or a pact between them, as she says, to never betray each other. Caterina eventually has a disagreement with Margherita due to being caught by her father drunk and having just gotten a tattoo from Margherita, and begins to gravitate toward Daniela's group. Daniela invites Caterina to join her at a wedding, where Caterina observes a group of [[Neo-Fascism|neo-fascists]] pay homage to Daniela's father Manlio who, it is heavily implied, is a covert fascist himself. There is also a subtle hint at an intimate relationship between Daniela and her father's bodyguard.  Meanwhile, Caterina's father is trying to capitalize on his daughter's connections. While Caterina is friends with Margherita, Giancarlo secretly gives Margherita a copy of his manuscript to pass along to her mother (with instructions not to tell Caterina), a highly placed editor. Once Caterina becomes friends with Daniela, Giancarlo pays a visit to Daniela's father's office to solicit favors, after having become enraged on a talk show and a laughing stock. He was fired due to hitting a student who was mocking his TV performance and lost his job, leading him to his visit with Signor Germano. After failing to get help from this source as well, he slowly becomes more and more despondent. Caterina then finds out that Daniela and her friends don't like her and "tried to make her civilised", a disappointment which is compounded by a failed romantic liaison with a wealthy boy from Daniela's clique whom his grandmother forbids from seeing Caterina again. She then lashes out at Daniela and runs away from home only then taking comfort with her neighbor, a young Australian about her age. He has been watching their family and describes them as a [[soap opera]] and that she is his favorite character. She then returns home but her family is still in misery. Her father, then, begins shouting about all that matters in the world is tightly knit groups. This is one of the first moments in the movie where Caterina's mother shows her stress and unhappiness by screaming and smashing plates on the floor.  Caterina's father remains in his miserable life only working on his motorcycle until he fixes it. Once he does, his newfound optimism is cut short when he casually finds out that either his wife and Fabietto are having an affair or it is a mere question of time before they do—a fact all the more surprising to him since he had surmised Fabietto to be gay. Unaware that her husband is listening, Agata concedes to Fabietto that she wants to leave Giancarlo but is unable because she doesn't think he could make it on his own. Upon hearing this, Giancarlo then rides off on his motorcycle and is never heard of again; as phrased by Caterina, he "doesn't bother our family more, we like to think he's in a place that's making him happy".  Caterina graduates middle school and is encouraged by Margherita to apply to the conservatory of music. Before leaving on holiday, her young Australian friend explains that he is going back to Australia because his parents are getting back together. She then tells him that, if they ever meet again, she would like to be his girlfriend. She abruptly kisses him; embarrassed she runs back to her mother's car wanting to speed off. The summer includes her playing with her second cousin on the beach, while spending time with her mother and Fabietto. The last shots are of Caterina singing in a performance at her [[Music school|conservatory of music]].

At Caulfield's house in [[San Bernardino]], the Angels track his assassin Randy Emmers ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]) to a beach where they meet with former Angel Madison Lee ([[Demi Moore]]). During the Coal Bowl motorcycle race, Emmers targets another witness named Max Petroni ([[Shia LaBeouf]]), but is killed by the Thin Man ([[Crispin Glover]]). Inside Emmers' pocket, the Angels discover the photos of Caulfield, Max, and, surprisingly, Dylan, under her birth name, Helen Zaas.  Dylan reveals that she is a protected witness after sending her former boyfriend, [[Ireland|Irish]] mob leader Seamus O'Grady ([[Justin Theroux]]) to prison. O'Grady has since targeted those who wronged him, including Dylan and Max, whose parents O'Grady killed. Max is sent to the home of Bosley's mother ([[Ja'net Dubois]]) for his protection. At a monastery, the Angels learn about the Thin Man's past from the Mother Superior ([[Carrie Fisher]]), who reveals his name, Anthony. Afterward, the Angels track O'Grady's mob at [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] and manage to get the rings, but O'Grady threatens Dylan with the murder of everyone she loves. While Natalie attends her boyfriend, Peter Kominsky ([[Luke Wilson]])'s high school reunion at [[Hermosa Beach, California|Hermosa Beach]] and Alex returns home to find her action star boyfriend-under-timeout, Jason Gibbons ([[Matt LeBlanc]]) telling her awestruck father ([[John Cleese]]) about her exploits, Dylan leaves the Angels and heads to [[Mexico]].

While in Mexico keeping a low profile, Dylan is convinced to return after seeing an apparition of former Angel Kelly Garrett ([[Jaclyn Smith]]).  Natalie and Alex deduce that Carter is a part of O'Grady's scheme after seeing him return Bosley's keys without any pain, since he had earlier claimed to have broken his ribs, which is now proved to have been a lie. Following him, the two witness him being shot to death by Madison, the true mastermind behind all of this.

Channels of Rage
 The film focuses on two young [[rapping|rap]] artists, [[Subliminal (rapper)|Subliminal]], an [[Israeli Jews|Israeli Jew]], and [[Tamer Nafar]], a [[Arab citizens of Israel|Palestinian citizen of Israel]], and focuses on their music, friendship, and their politicization as public figures. The film traces the relationship between Tamer and Subliminal, as the events of the [[Second Intifada]] unfold, and lets the viewer draw conclusions from the souring relations between the two as an individual representation of the polarization process which took place during these years of bloody conflict. In this aspect, the film succeeds in delivering the atmosphere of the loss of hopes for peace after the failure of the [[Camp David]] summit between [[Ehud Barak]] and [[Yasser Arafat]] and the renewed intensity of the conflict since. The film was featured in the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival.

When Priya receives the talisman, she too recalls Raj's confession. Raj returns home to find Priya waiting for him. She says that the only way to make their dream come true is to be together.

The Challenge (2003 film)
 Twin sisters, Shane ([[Mary-Kate Olsen]]) and Elizabeth Dalton ([[Ashley Olsen]]), live separately from one another on opposite ends of the country after their parents divorced years earlier. Shane, who lives with their mom in Los Angeles, is a chilled out, tree-hugging [[vegetarian]] who is very into nature and spiritual beliefs, while her estranged sister Lizzie, who lives with their dad in Washington D.C, is a level-headed grade A student with a driven personality. However, unknown to each other, they both enter to be a contestant on a TV [[quiz show]] filmed in Mexico called ''The Challenge'', which tests contestants strength and survival skills in various tasks as they work as part of a team in order to win college scholarships.  Head intern Marcus ([[Brian Skala]]) informs the show's producer, Max (Joe Michael Burke), of their distant relationship and, knowing they dislike each other, he puts both girls on the same team, Team Mayan, as part of a deceitful scheme to boost the show's [[Audience measurement|ratings]]. Backstage, Shane meets and becomes close with Adam (Lukas Behnken), a laid-back jock who is put on the opposite team, Team Aztec. Team Aztec also includes Kelly (Sarah Bastian), an over-competitive swimmer, JJ ((Diana Carreno)), a ditzy "triple threat" with dreams of stardom, and Charles ([[Ty Hodges]]), a calm and intuitive city boy who plans to study psychotherapy. Along with Shane and Lizzie, Team Mayan also includes Anthony ([[Theo Rossi]]), an Italian-American food enthusiast, and Justin (Zakk Moore), a surfer and skater from sunny Florida. At their first meeting, Max informs the group of the rules, which includes no romantic entanglements between teammates of the same or opposite team, as it can result in disqualification from a task.  During the first three tasks, Shane and Lizzie's bickering prevents them from working together, and Team Aztec win the points. However eventually, when Anthony and Justin make them realise that they'll need to pull together, they start putting aside their differences for the sake of the team. Over the first few days, Shane and Adam become more and more close, and Kelly suspects something is going on. At the same time, Lizzie starts hanging out behind the scenes with Marcus, although he is still being asked to spy on the girls by Max. Marcus finds out that Shane hates heights and that Lizzie is afraid of snakes, information which Max plans to use later on. Team Mayan win the fourth and fifth takes, making the score 3-2 to Team Aztec, and Shane and Lizzie both start to respect what the other knows.   One night, the girls sneak out to meet Marcus and Adam, but they're followed by Max who fails to get video footage. However, Kelly manages to take a picture of Adam and Shane kissing and shows it to Max. He disqualifies both of them from the next round, which Team Mayan eventually win, making the scoring tied. To celebrate, they are given a boat party as a prize, which Team Aztec have to cater for in costume. At the party, Marcus tells Lizzie that he's been behind Max's troublemaking and she ends whatever they had going on. Later on, the girls resolve their past problems for good after realising they're not so different after all.  The final task will crown the winners. It is an assault course featuring various challenges that includes walking harnessed on a bridge high over a canyon (Shane's fear) and then walking on narrow planks over a pit of snakes (Lizzie's fear). However, the girls help each other out and Team Mayan reach the totum before the others, making them the winners. All teammates receive college scholarships. With the experience coming to a close, Kelly apologies for the mistakes, Lizzie makes up with Marcus, and then the girls get their own back on Max by tipping slime on him while taking a picture.  ''The Challenge'' was Mary-Kate and Ashley's last direct to video production, so at the end in a short scene, past boyfriend's from their previous films show up and begin arguing over who they loved more, leading the girls to exit saying, "Boys may come and go, but we'll always have each other, and that's not just in the movies."

Raja with support from Kavita gets himself ready for the match. In the match he emerges victorious and dedicates the trophy to Rohit and then celebrates his love with Kavita.  With Jeet's journey in Bengali film world taking a new-found momentum from this film after the huge success of 'Saathi', the industry got yet another great young actor in Siddhartho Banerjee, in the role of Rohot (Jeet's elder brother). Siddhartho, though a regular face in TV serial lead roles, was relatively a newcomer on the big screen. His screen presence was at par with that of Jeet and acting was top-notch. This film also gifted the industry another budding actor, Sagnik (in the role of Rony) who was a great fit opposite the Jeet-Siddhartho duo.

He met his future wife, Kate at Illinois Poly Tech, and together, they gave birth to 12 children (Nora, Charlie, Lorraine, Henry, Sarah, Jake, Mark, fraternal twins Jessica and Kim, Mike, and identical twins Kyle and Nigel). In her narration, Kate has written her story into a book and hopes to send it to her friend to publish the book. Meanwhile, Tom unexpectedly receives an offer from his old friend and football teammate, Shake McGuire, to coach at his alma mater in his hometown of [[Evanston, Illinois]]. Tom accepts the offer, and he and Kate begin making plans on returning to Evanston. The kids find out and demand the move be put to a vote, even though Tom says it would not have any power. He loses the vote, even after he and Kate decide to join, but goes ahead with the move anyway, claiming there will be more money and that they will be a "happier and stronger family". The atmosphere at the Bakers' new house is tense and the situation at school is even worse.  Later, the Bakers meet their next-door neighbors, the Shenk family--which consists of Bill, Tina, and their son, Dylan. After a series of mishaps, Dylan invites the younger kids to his birthday party. Shortly afterwards, Kate tells Tom that she is leaving on her book tour now that her book is ready for publication, leaving Tom to take charge of the kids. Tom decides to hire the family's oldest child, Nora, and her self-absorbed boyfriend, Hank, to help him with the other children. The younger children soak Hank's boxers in meat, and unleash the family dog, Gunner, on him. After Nora storms out with Hank, Tom scolds the younger children for their naughty prank.   Kate departs for her book tour and Tom realizes that he cannot handle the children on his own after a chaotic night. In reply to this revelation, Tom tries to hire a housekeeper or nanny, but nobody is willing to work with a family as large as the Bakers. The children start causing trouble at school, so Tom decides to bring the football players he coaches into the family's house for game practice while the children perform chores and their household games. When things get completely out of control, Tom grounds the children from attending Dylan's birthday party. While Tom's back is turned, the children sneak out to attend the party anyway.   At Dylan's party, Jake tells Mike to go get the football they got for Dylan so they can play with it. When he does, he knocks some of the presents over, and the Brazilian mud viper they also got for him escapes. The resulting panic causes Tom to realize the kids had disappeared, and he orders his players to round the kids up. Tom tries to remove Sarah from the bounce house, but during the chaos, a helium tank falls on the bounce house, causing it to overinflate, then explode, sending Tom and several kids flying through the air. While the football players successfully catch Sarah and the other kids, Tom accidentally lands on top of Dylan, breaking his arm and he is taken to the hospital.  Kate overhears from the children about the chaos and cancels the book tour to take charge of the situation. Kate's publisher decides to create an additional promotion for her book by inviting [[Oprah Winfrey]] to tape a segment about the Bakers in their home instead. Despite much coaching from Kate, the Bakers are not able to demonstrate the loving, strongly bonded family that Kate described in her book. When Mark becomes upset that his pet frog has died, a heated fight erupts moments before the segment starts, leading the cameramen to tell Winfrey to cancel it. Mark runs away from home, prompting the Bakers to find him. During the search, Tom indulges a hunch from Nora that Mark is trying to run back to the Bakers' old home, and eventually finds Mark on an [[Amtrak]] train departing from Evanston to Midland. Reuniting with the rest of their family, the Bakers begin to address their issues with each other. Tom ultimately step down from his position at his alma mater with Shake. The film ends when Kate narrates that family become stronger and closer together.  
Chasing Papi
 The movie opens with an animated telling of Tomás Fuentes's ([[Eduardo Verástegui]]) life, in which he is always surrounded by women. In his current life, he is a representative for the Olivero & Sanchez Marketing Group in Los Angeles and is busy travelling to visit all three of his girlfriends to give them each a gift. Cici ([[Sofía Vergara]]), a cocktail waitress from [[Miami]] who enjoys being the center of attention; Patricia Sofia Ordonez Coronado del Pescador ([[Jaci Velasquez]]), a debutante of [[New York City|New York]]'s high society who is tired of her mother's ([[María Conchita Alonso]]) endless attempts to marry her off; and Lorena Morales ([[Roselyn Sánchez]]), a lawyer from [[Chicago]] who loves how Tomas makes her feel sexy; have fallen for him and given him the affectionate nickname "Papi". This love triangle of sorts affects Tomás's work life, causing him to pass out during a presentation. His doctor learns of the love triangle, tells Tomás to choose only one woman, prescribes tranquilizers and advises against driving, alcohol and women.  By coincidence, all three of his girlfriends go to Los Angeles after hearing their horoscopes read by [[Walter Mercado]], [[Univision]]'s ''[[Primer Impacto]]'' fortune teller. The three women arrive at his house while he is at the doctor's. Instead of fighting each other, all three agree to leave and quit Tomas cold turkey as revenge for his cheating on them. In their absence, Tomás arrives home and takes his tranquilizers with alcohol. The girls each have second thoughts about leaving and return to confront Tomás directly. First Lorena, then Patricia and finally Cici, causing Tomás to overdose on alcohol and tranquilizers and pass out again.  Mary ([[Joy Enriquez]]), Tomás' secretary, calls hoping he is doing better. Outside Tomas' house, FBI agent Carmen Rivera ([[Lisa Vidal]]), is waiting. She followed Cici to Los Angeles as part of an investigation. Fala, Cici's business partner, had Cici do her boyfriend, Ricky, a favor by taking a car that he sold online to the buyer in Los Angeles. Ricky is involved in the Whittaker counterfeit ring Agent Rivera is investigating. The girls spot her while panicking about what to do with Tomas and think she is "the L.A. woman" who just called, probably from a cell phone.  Scared by Agent Rivera's firearm, the girls decide to take Tomás out of the house and wait until he wakes up and decide which girl he wants to be with. They load all their bags in Ricky's car and, after a short chase, they decide to stay at a [[Marriott hotel]] instead of a [[Motel 6]]. Unfortunately, Patricia's credit cards have been canceled by her mother. However, Lorena is their saving grace. The Miss Latina American Beauty Pageant is being held in that very same hotel and Miss [[Puerto Rico]]'s flight was delayed. Lorena bears a resemblance to the real beauty contestant and takes her place. Cici passes herself and Patricia off as her staff. When moving their bags to Miss Puerto Rico's room, a bag falls off the cart onto the luggage room floor.  In the hotel room, all three girls have dinner, empty three bottles of champagne and share their life stories with each other. They each then have a dream in which they end up with Tomás but feel bad about leaving the other two behind.  The next morning, Lorena has to meet the judges and Cici has to deliver Ricky's car to a man named Rodrigo ([[D.L. Hughley]]) who apparently bought it. They leave Tomás but, in their absence, he's taken by Agent Rivera who has followed them to the hotel. It turns out Rodrigo was not interested in the car but a bag that was supposed to be in the trunk. Upon returning to the hotel with Rodrigo's associate, Victor ([[Freddy Rodriguez (actor)|Freddy Rodriguez]]), the girls discover Tomás is missing and a note that reads, "If you want your Papi back, bring the money to the [[Don Quixote]] puppet at L.A. Latin festival at 5 PM. No cops."  Patricia knocks Victor out with a lamp and Cici calls Fala in Miami for answers about the car but doesn't get any. All that is left is to do what the note says. They are interrupted by Costas Delgado ([[Paul Rodriguez (actor)|Paul Rodriguez]], uncredited), the director of the pageant, who has been looking for Lorena and needs her to meet with the judges immediately. Patricia finds the extra bag filled with money in the luggage room and Cici gets a map to the festival. Victor comes to, calls Rodrigo and they plan to catch the girls at the festival.  While Miss [[Mexico]] is being interviewed, Lorena unbuttons her blouse slightly to show off her cleavage and Costas helps her with her sash. During Lorena's interview, Patricia and Cici arrive but so does the real Miss Puerto Rico ([[Nicole Scherzinger]]), who outs Lorena as an impostor. Cici trips her, allowing all three to escape. Outside, Tomás wakes up in Agent Rivera's car. Agent Rivera tells him she intends to use him and the girls in order to detain Victor and Rodrigo. They follow the girls to the festival as they leave in Ricky's car.  On the way, the girls' car breaks down completely. They steal a [[Harley-Davidson]] motorcycle, which Patricia knows how to drive, promising the owner to bring it right back and lose both the map and Agent Rivera in another chase. Upon arrival, the girls see the puppet is behind the stage. Running through the crowd to avoid the cops, Patricia loses one of her colored contact lenses. Since she looks "so much better without all that money", she simply takes the other one out. Victor and Rodrigo spot them and the girls run on stage where [[Sheila E.]] is performing and dance to singer [[Christina Vidal]]'s song, ''Dejaré'', regardless of their mixed dance backgrounds. Victor and Rodrigo get closer to the stage, causing the girls to run off mid-performance. They all run to the puppet, where Carmen and other FBI agents surround them and apprehend Victor and Rodrigo.  Tomás is reunited with all three of his girlfriends. He apologizes to them for his deception and is unable to choose between them. The girls, however, have all found their inner strengths and choose to leave him instead. Tomás decides to take Agent Carmen's advice and spend some time alone... after taking her out for dinner. Returning to the festival crowds, the girls are invited to return to the stage where they dance to [[Christina Vidal]]'s song ''It's All About Nothing''.  The movie's timeline advances five months later and the girls have kept in touch. Patricia has moved into her own apartment with her dog Fifi and has gotten a job at an art gallery. Cici is an entertainer on a cruise liner with her business partner Fala. Lorena is still a lawyer working pro-bono but puts her time off to good use and becomes the self-proclaimed "Queen of Tango". Fifi hears her horoscope that advises her to "go outside the door because love is waiting for [her]." The movie ends with Fifi finding her "Puppy Chulo."

 The piece begins with the view of the Wayne Enterprises building to which Bruce Wayne is gazing out the window during a party. He's pulled to the dance floor by three lovely young ladies. Each has her turn before [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] rescues Bruce, who dives into a nearby elevator. When he reaches his office, he sees none other than Catwoman at the safe, looting it. Catwoman pins Bruce to the wall while she finishes robbing the safe, and makes her escape. Bruce breaks free, and heads after her as Batman.  He finds her on the rooftops, and the chase begins. She dives several dozens stories below into busy traffic, breaking her fall with a banner and swinging onto a tour bus. She poses for some pictures until Batman arrives, taking most of the publicity away from her.  [[File:Chase Me.png|thumb|left|Batman and Catwoman.]]  They jump on a milk truck tanker and Catwoman blows the tires out. The truck spins off, and Batman pursues after her, ignoring the truck dumping gallons of milk on a couple of stray cats, as well as onto [[Harvey Bullock (comics)|Harvey Bullock]].  Then, they jump on a train, where, while going into a tunnel, Batman loses Catwoman, only to see her trail leading into a zoo. Expectedly, she had detoured through the Large Cats exhibit and leaves Batman. He escapes through the sunroof while Catwoman runs into an aviary to be chased out by a colony of bats. She is then cornered by Batman against the gates of the zoo. She notices he was scratched earlier, and leans to kiss him. Batman pushes her away, and she appears hurt. Batman then sweeps her into his arms and kisses her.  The police arrive, and Catwoman looks around, concerned. She pushes at Batman to leave. Batman then slowly smiles at her. He takes the bag of money and leaves. Catwoman smiles, thinking she's been let off the hook, only to find herself handcuffed to the fence. She falls to the ground, despondent, then looks up in quiet rage.  A remorseful Bruce Wayne looks through the window at the party, again, watching police cars fly past below. Then, a lady who bears a striking resemblance to Catwoman's alter ego Selina Kyle grabs his arm and pulls him back to the party.  Note: [[Black Canary]] makes a cameo appearance 42 seconds into the silent film.

The Classic
 The film tells the parallel love stories of a mother and daughter. The story of the mother is told partially in [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s.  The movie starts in the present day. The daughter, Ji-hye ([[Son Ye-jin]]), is cleaning-up around her house when she comes across a box full of old letters and a diary that detail the story of her mother, Joo-hee (who is also played by Son Ye-jin). Periodically in the movie, Ji-hye reads one of these letters, which starts a flashback scene in which the story of the mother is told. These flashbacks are intertwined with Ji-hye's own story, in which she falls for a fellow student, Sang-min ([[Jo In-sung]]), who is involved with the school theater.  The movie tells the story of both relationships. The mother, Joo-hee, visits the countryside as a student one summer and meets Joon-ha ([[Cho Seung-woo]]). Together they explore the countryside, playing near a river which they both will always remember as their special place. When a storm starts they take shelter together under a tree, but not before Joo-hee twists her ankle and is rendered helpless. Joon-ha carries her on his back and they struggle home, only to be confronted by her angry parents. Before they separate, Joo-hee gives him a necklace, which he keeps close as a precious reminder of their time together.  Unfortunately, as often happens in affairs of the heart, a third party prevents any deepening of their relationship. Joo-hee has been promised by her parents as a bride to Tae-soo, Joon-ha's friend. But Tae-soo, a noble friend, finds out about Joo-hee and Joon-ha's attraction for each other and helps the two communicate secretly by letting them use his own name in place of Joon-ha's in their letters. When Tae-soo's father finds this out, however, he beats Tae-soo. Tae-soo tries unsuccessfully to commit suicide so that his two friends can be together.  Meanwhile, in the present, Ji-hye falls for Sang-min in whom her friend Soo-kyeong is also very interested, but he seems not to notice. Then, in a sweet scene, they take shelter from the rain together under the same tree. He uses his coat to cover both of them and escorts her to where she needs to go. The moment, while magical, does not go anywhere as she feels his help was only due to his generous nature and not from any feelings for her on his part.  Back in the past, Joon-ha is guilt-ridden over his friend's attempted suicide and Joo-hee's own guilt. Determined to prevent any more hurt to her, Joon-ha joins the army and goes to [[Vietnam]]. There he loses his eyesight while he tries to retrieve the necklace Joo-hee had given him. When he returns to Korea, he meets again with Joo-hee, and, trying to hide his blindness, convinces her he has married in the hope she will move on with her life. Though heart broken that their relationship cannot continue, she does move on and eventually marries Tae-soo, Joon-ha's kind friend. After they have been married for several years and have a young daughter (Ji-hye) Joo-hee is approached by friends of Joon-ha, who relate Joon-ha's last wish: that his ashes be scattered by Joo-hee in the river, now a reservoir, where they first met. She then finds out that Joon-ha hadn't married, but he later did after Tae-soo and Joo-hee were married. She was told that he had a son also. The heart-break is too much and she cries.  In the present, Ji-hye's own story unfolds. Sang-min reveals his true feelings for Ji-hye&nbsp;— feelings that mirror her own. It is also revealed that their taking shelter together during the storm was no accident: he had purposely left his umbrella behind in a shop so that he could join her under the tree. Then, when Ji-hye pensively reveals her mother's story to him, tears stream down his face. Silently he lifts a necklace from around his neck and places it around hers. It is the necklace that Ji-hye's mother, Joo-hee, had given to Joon-ha when they met. The circle is completed: Joo-hee's daughter and Joon-ha's son have fallen in love.  
Cloaca (film)
 The career of homosexual art historian Pieter, who has been working as an [[archivist]] at a municipality, has been going nowhere for 20 years: he is ignored by his colleagues, and for many years now, as a sort of revenge, he has been taking a painting from the depot in the cellar on his birthday. Brest, his boss's boss, takes Vermeulen out for a meal. Pieter expects good news, but instead hears he must return the paintings: in any case the eight paintings by Van Goppel (who died recently) which all of a sudden have become worth a lot of money. This produces a major problem, because Pieter has sold four of the Van Goppels in order to pay for his apartment.  If anyone can help him, it would be his old student friends Joep and Tom. Joep, a politician who is slated to become the next Minister for Foreign Affairs, has been turned out of his house by his wife Conny because he proved to have an extramarital affair with Jennie. He thought he would be able to stay at Tom's, but Tom went insane a couple of months earlier as a result of [[cocaine]] abuse. As a lawyer, Tom wants to take the case of Pieter himself. Joep cannot help with Pieter's problem now, because he's on the verge of being appointed.

During the marriage festivities, Bhavani and her brother Hareendhran ([[Biju Menon]]) come to prevent the celebrations. Along with them comes the elder brother of Sandhya, Shekarankutty ([[Lalu Alex]]). He challenges SP, saying that he has more right over Sandhya as he is her brother, while SP is just a half-brother. Shekarankutty then claims all of SP's property, which SP is willing to give, provided Sandhya lives happily and marries Srikumar. Bhavani's household members use Shekarankutty to take advantage of SP; first by trying to snatch his company then trying to snatch his home. In the brawl, SP vows that Sandhya will marry Srikumar and he will wipe off everyone who stands in the way. Bhavani then tells SP that Sandhya will be married off to Hareendhran.

She says she would marry anyone that her brothers tell her too because she cares about both of them. SP then says he know what needs to be done to end the family feud, which should have been long ago. He then marches to Bhavani's house and starts hitting Bhavani's dad thinking of killing him. In the end, SP points at Kuruvilla and says he is the witness of Vishnu's murder. Bhavani's father finally admits that he killed Vishnu and framed it on SP's father. Then SP pours kerosene on Bhavani's dad and as he approach Bhavani, he is stopped by Hareendaran who begs for his sisters life. Bhavani realizes her mistakes and goes to SP's house to apologize. But she tells SP that only thing she can now offer is the marriage proposal of her sister Bhama to SP. SP initially refuses when Srikumar tells that he'll also remain bachelor if SP doesn't marry. SP finally agrees and tells him to go inside with Bhama.

Clean Out
  
Cold Mountain (film)
 When [[North Carolina]] secedes from the Union on May 20, 1861, the young men of [[Cold Mountain (North Carolina)|Cold Mountain]] hurry to enlist in the [[Confederate States Army]]. Among them is W.P. Inman, a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada Monroe, a preacher's daughter who had come from [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to care for her ailing father. Their whirlwind courtship is interrupted by the war, but they share their first kiss the day Inman leaves for the army. Before parting ways, Ada promises Inman that she will wait for him.   Three years later, Inman fights in the [[Battle of the Crater]] and survives; he then comforts a dying acquaintance from Cold Mountain, while fellow soldier Stobrod Thewes plays a tune on his [[fiddle]]. Inman is later wounded in a skirmish; as he lies in a hospital near death, a nurse reads him a letter from Ada, who pleads for Inman to come home to her. Inman recovers and deserts, embarking on a long trek back to Cold Mountain.  Inman encounters a corrupt preacher named Veasey, who is about to drown his pregnant slave lover. Inman stops Veasey, and leaves him tied up to face the town's justice. Exiled from his parish, Veasey later joins Inman on his journey. They help a young man named Junior dispose of a bull cadaver, and then join him and his sordid family for dinner. Junior leaves and returns with the [[Confederate Home Guard]], who take Inman and Veasey away along with other deserters. During a skirmish with Union cavalry, Veasey and the group are killed while Inman is left for dead; an elderly hermit living in the woods finds Inman and nurses him back to health. Inman eventually meets a grieving young widow named Sara and her infant child Ethan, and stays the night at her cabin. The next morning, three Union soldiers arrive demanding food; they take Sara and Ethan hostage, forcing Inman to kill two of them, while an enraged Sara fatally shoots the last one trying to flee.  Back in Cold Mountain, Ada's father has died, leaving her with no money and few means to run their property's farm in Black Cove. She survives on the kindness of her neighbors, particularly Esco and Sally Swanger, who eventually send for Ruby Thewes—Stobrod's daughter—to help. Ruby moves in and together they bring the farm to working order, becoming close friends. Meanwhile, Ada writes constant letters to Inman in hopes of meeting him again and renewing their romance.  Ada has several tense encounters with Captain Teague, the leader of the local Home Guard who covets Ada and her property, and whose grandfather had once owned much of Cold Mountain. One day, Teague and his men kill Esco, and then torture Sally to coax her deserter sons out of hiding and kill them as well. Ada and Ruby rescue Sally, who is traumatized and rendered mute. The women celebrate Christmas with Stobrod, who has deserted and arrived to Cold Mountain with traveling companions Pangle, a simple-minded [[banjo]] player, and Georgia, a [[mandolin]] player to whom Ruby is attracted.   While camping in the woods one night, Stobrod and Pangle are cornered by Teague and the Guard while Georgia watches from hiding; Pangle unintentionally reveals the musicians are deserters, and the Guard shoot Pangle and Stobrod. Georgia escapes and informs Ruby and Ada, who return to the scene to find Pangle dead and Stobrod badly wounded. The women remove a bullet from Stobrod's back, and they take shelter in an abandoned [[Cherokee]] camp. Ada goes hunting for food and is reunited with Inman, who has finally returned to Cold Mountain. They return to the camp, and spend the night consummating their love for one another.  Leaving Inman and Stobrod to hide at the camp, Ada and Ruby are surrounded by Teague and his men, having captured and tortured Georgia for their whereabouts. Inman arrives and kills Teague and most of his band in a gunfight. He then chases Teague's lieutenant, Bosie, and exchanges [[fast draw]]s; Bosie is killed, but Inman is mortally wounded. Ada finds and comforts Inman, who dies in her arms.  Years later, it is revealed that Ada's night with Inman had produced a daughter, Grace Inman, and that Ruby has married Georgia bearing two children. With Stobrod and Sally, the family celebrates Easter together at Black Cove.  
The Company (film)
  ''The Company'' is composed of stories gathered from the dancers, choreographers, and staff of the Joffrey Ballet. Most of the roles are played by company members. While a small subplot relates a love story between Campbell's character and a character played by [[James Franco]], most of the movie focuses on the company as a whole, without any real star or linear plot. The many company stories woven together express the dedication and hard work that dancers must put into their art, although they are seldom rewarded with fame or fortune.  
Code 46
 In the near future the world is divided between those who live "inside", in high-density cities, and the poor underclass who live "outside." Access to the cities is highly restricted and regulated through the use of health documents, known as "papeles" in the global [[pidgin]] language of the day (composed of elements of English, Spanish, French, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], Italian, [[Farsi]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]).  Most city residents venture outside only after dark since direct sunlight is now considered hazardous to their health (UV rays can cause [[melanoma]]). However, a few residents still venture outdoors during the day. The government appears to be [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[dystopian]]. Society is regulated by various "codes". The code of the movie title prohibits "genetically incestuous reproduction", which may occur as a result of the various medical technologies which have become commonplace, such as [[cloning]].  William Geld ([[Tim Robbins]]), an insurance fraud investigator, is sent to Shanghai to interview employees at a company known as "The Sphinx", which manufactures "covers", ostensibly "insurance cover documents" but which in fact regulate the movements of people among cities and "inside" and "outside". William's assignment is to identify employees who are suspected of forging "covers". After interviewing numerous Sphinx employees, he identifies a young worker named Maria Gonzalez ([[Samantha Morton]]) as the forger. He is able to do this using a [[genetically engineered]] "[[empathy]] virus," which allows him to gain information from people if they voluntarily reveal something about themselves. Maria tells William that she has the same dream each birthday: she is traveling the [[rapid transit|subway]] to meet someone she cannot identify. Each birthday she is one station closer to her destination, where she expects to meet the person. William is captivated by her, and instead of turning her over to security, he identifies another employee as the forger.  William then meets up with Maria and they begin an affair. Putting complete trust in a man who could have had her arrested, Maria reveals how she was able to smuggle papeles out of her workplace. In a nightclub they meet Damian (David Fahm), a naturalist who longs to travel to [[Delhi]] to study [[bat]]s. He has applied for cover for eight consecutive years but has always been refused. Maria supplies Damian with a papel. William is upset by this and indicates that he should turn Maria over to the authorities, but Maria knows he won't. William explains that there are legitimate reasons why Damian is unable to obtain the proper clearances legally. Maria believes that some risks are worth taking to fulfill one's dreams.  Back at her apartment, Maria shows William her "memory scrapbook" (an electronic booklet that records video from the user's mind), which contains memories of her parents and friends. Other movies show her passing papeles to various people. She thinks they are beautiful and their eyes are full of desire and dreams, and that they have a different look from "everyday" people. As Maria sleeps, William finds a forged cover in her room and takes it.  William's travel cover will expire the next day so he returns home to his family. On the way to the airport, he gives the forged cover to a street vendor at the city's perimeter checkpoint, an act of humanity which could change the vendor's life. Later, he learns that Damian died in Delhi after exposure to a virus to which he had no immunity. William is reprimanded for not discovering the true Sphinx forger. He explains that he had trouble with his empathy virus and requests that someone else be sent, as there may have been an accomplice to the innocent man he fingered as the guilty party. However, he is ordered to deal with the problem and to return to Shanghai.  Upon his return William discovers that Maria has gone. Her apartment is abandoned and the only clue is a medical clinic appointment. He visits the clinic and, using his empathic abilities, learns that Maria was pregnant and that the pregnancy was terminated due to a violation of Code 46. William knows that this means Maria is somehow genetically related to him, but he has no idea how.  William discovers that Maria has been taken to have her memory of the episode erased. He talks to Maria, but finds her memory of him is gone. He succeeds in getting the clinic to release Maria into his care by telling them she is a witness in his fraud investigation. After she is released, William proves to Maria that she knows him by his intimate knowledge of her and by showing her the memory recording of when she gave Damian the papel, which includes a shot of William. William tells her about the memory erasure and about how he didn't report her for fraud. Maria is disturbed by this information and becomes very distressed. William gives her a sleeping pill and, while she is sleeping, he cuts some hair from her head and takes it to a facility providing instant DNA analysis. There he discovers that Maria is fifty percent genetically related to him, a biological [[cloning|clone]] of his mother, who was one of a set of twenty-four [[In vitro fertilisation|in-vitro fertilised]] clones. This knowledge does not affect William's feelings, but instead of going back to Maria he decides to go home to his family. However, when he tries to leave he is not allowed to do so as his 24-hour cover is now expired.  William then realises that his only hope of returning home is to get a papel from Maria. He returns to her apartment and tells her about his inability to leave. She agrees to help him. She tells him she must acquire a papel and meet him at the airport later. She goes to work to obtain a papel, but is unable to forge one herself, as she was moved to another area of work, so a co-worker makes the cover for her. While taking a train to meet William she remembers her birthday dream, and that he was the person she is looking for in the dream. She recalls her feelings for him. She meets William, gives him the papel and tells him so. He decides not to leave her.  William and Maria then travel to [[Jebel Ali Free Zone|Jebel Ali]] in the Middle East, which does not require special travel clearance. The two hide out in the old city where they book a room. Here William reveals to Maria that, in addition to the memory wiping, she has been given a virus that induces a terrorising adrenaline rush in response to physical contact with the person who brought about the Code 46 violation. However, Maria still wants to make love with William, so he ties her down to prevent her from fleeing once the adrenaline rush kicks in.  Afterward Maria enters a [[somnambulistic]] state, also caused by the virus, which forces her to report the further Code 46 violation to the authorities. She is unconscious of this, though William is aware of the virus's reaction. They then rent an old car and travel away to escape the authorities who are tracking them. William crashes the car while avoiding a collision with camels and pedestrians and they are both knocked unconscious.  When William awakes in the hospital he finds himself in Seattle with his wife and child. He has no memory of Maria or the Code 46 violation, as all memories of her and their time together have been completely flushed from his mind and replaced with memories of  a successful investigation. The authorities had brought William before a tribunal, but decided the empathy virus had affected his judgment. He attempts to use the empathy virus to read his son's thoughts on the drive back from the hospital, but is unable to because the virus was permanently removed, and antibodies implanted to render reinfection impossible. Maria is more severely punished, in effect, by not having her memories of William loving her erased (instead being altered to make them stronger), essentially forced to remember him and exiled to the place she hated the most, the desert, outside of "cover". Her final words of the film (portrayed through voiceover of the end-of-film events and a montage of her poor, "beggar" life and existence) are, "I miss you."  
Cold Creek Manor

They befriend local tavern owners Ray and Ellen Pinski and their daughter Stephanie. As Cooper begins to sort through the many documents and family photographs scattered throughout the house, he decides to commit its history to film.  Converting the old building into their dream house becomes a nightmare for the Tilsons when previous owner Dale Massie, recently released from prison, shows up and pressures Cooper into hiring him to help with the renovations. While he initially proves to be a good worker, the underlying sense of menace he projects is unsettling. A series of terrifying incidents, including Cooper being pursued by an unknown car, the sudden appearance of poisonous snakes in the house, and the killing of the horse given to them by the Pinskis leads the Tilsons to research the estate's dark past. Hoping to glean some details about its history, Cooper visits Dale's aging and slightly demented father in the nursing home where he is living. Disjointed comments made by the elderly man lead Cooper to believe Dale murdered his wife and children, and he begins to search his 1200 acre property for their remains. Sheriff Annie Ferguson, sister of Dale's battered, slatternly girlfriend Ruby, is skeptical about Dale's guilt, but slowly comes to realize Cooper may be right.  Cooper's suspicions are confirmed when he and Leah discover three skeletons in Devil's Throat, a deep well, hidden in the woods. Using a [[walkie talkie]], he contacts Sheriff Ferguson, unaware she has been attacked and disabled by Dale, who punctures the tires on Cooper's truck and sets Leah's car on fire to prevent them from escaping. Trapping them in the house in the middle of a storm that has knocked out the electricity, he forces them to rely on their wits and physical prowess to save themselves. Dale finally corners Cooper and Leah on the roof after chasing them through the mansion. Dale, now raving mad, openly declares his insanity as well as his intent to kill them and throw them down the Devil's Throat like his family. However, the couple is able to turn the tables on their tormentor by charging him with a line of rope that knocks him off his feet. They quickly tie him down against a roof lantern before he can break free. Cooper takes the killing tool and taunts Dale as Dale had done to him, before shattering the skylight, sending Dale to his death.  Dale's family are entombed in the family graveyard at Cold Creek Manor and Cooper and his family attain their wanted peace.

Sondra is meanwhile joined by her sister Misty (Sheridan), who came to look after her. Later that night Werther kills Lynn in her house, showing an online live feed of the murder to Sondra and Misty. Werther is shown to be a psychopath who loves to quote from ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]'' by [[Goethe]] and calls his victims by the name Lotte (the object of the affections of Werther in that novel).  Sondra and Misty call the police and eventually speak with FBI agent Matheson (Lewis). When they send him the file of the murder, it appears to be encrypted. On the advice of agent Matheson, Sondra and Misty invite a computer expert to decrypt the file. As the expert arrives at the door, Werther calls them, pretending to be the expert. Sondra and Misty thus send the real expert away, believing he is the killer. A short while later, Werther shows up at the house, keeping his disguise.

 [[Geophysics|Geophysicist]] Dr. Josh Keyes ([[Aaron Eckhart]]) and scientists Dr. Serge Leveque ([[Tchéky Karyo]]) and Dr. Conrad Zimsky ([[Stanley Tucci]]) become aware of an instability of [[Earth's magnetic field]] after a series of bizarre incidents across the globe. They determine that the Earth's molten core, which generates this field, has stopped rotating and that, within a year, the field will collapse, exposing the planet's surface directly to devastating solar radiation. Backed by the U.S. Government, Keyes, Leveque, and Zimsky create a plan to bore down to the core and set off several [[nuclear explosion]]s to restart the rotation. They gain the help of rogue scientist Dr. Ed "Braz" Brazzelton ([[Delroy Lindo]]), who has devised a vessel made of "[[Unobtainium]]" that can withstand the heat and pressure within the Earth's crust and convert it to energy, as well as a laser-driven boring system that will allow them to quickly pass through the crust.  Construction starts immediately on the ''Virgil'', a multi-compartment vessel to be helmed by [[Space Shuttle Endeavour]] pilots [[Commander]] Robert Iverson ([[Bruce Greenwood]]) and [[Major]] Rebecca "Beck" Childs ([[Hilary Swank]]), who will join Keyes and the others. To prevent a worldwide panic, Keyes enlists computer [[hacker]] Theodore Donald "Rat" Finch ([[DJ Qualls]]) to scour the Internet and eliminate all traces of the pending disaster or their plan.  ''Virgil'' is launched through the [[Marianas Trench]] from an offshore platform. The team accidentally drills through a gigantic empty [[geode]] structure 700 miles below the surface, damaging the lasers when it lands at its base and cracking the geode's structure and causing magma to flow in from above. The crew repair and restart the laser array in time, but Iverson is killed by a falling crystal shard that hits him in the helmet and subsequently fell into magma, while returning to the ship. As ''Virgil'' continues, it clips a huge diamond that breaches the hull of the last compartment. Leveque sacrifices himself to save the nuclear launch codes before the compartment is crushed by extreme pressure.  Meanwhile, on the surface, the public becomes aware of problems after a lightning superstorm and an unfiltered patch of ultra-violet radiation from the sun destroy [[Rome]] and [[San Francisco]], respectively. Finch is unable to stop worldwide panic but instead learns of the top-secret project "DESTINI" (Deep Earth Seismic Trigger INItiative), which is the government's 'secondary protocol' and will be deployed should the ''Virgil'' mission fail. Finch relays his information to Keyes, who discovers that Zimsky was one of DESTINI's lead scientists. DESTINI, according to Zimsky, was designed as a weapon to propagate earthquakes through the Earth's core, but its first activation unintentionally stopped its rotation instead. Zimsky reveals the government will use it again to attempt a restart of the core. Keyes is convinced it will have disastrous results and has Finch hack into DESTINI's system and cut its power supply to buy the ''Virgil'' more time.  ''Virgil'' eventually reaches the [[Outer core|molten core]], and, as they take readings, they discover that the density of the core is far different from what they expected, which will not allow their plan to work. They calculate that by splitting their nuclear weapons into the remaining compartments and jettisoning each at specific distances, they can create a "[[ripple effect]]", where the power of each bomb will push against the blast of the next, generating the energy required to restart the core. However, because ''Virgil'' was not designed to jettison undamaged compartments, the plan requires someone to deactivate a safety switch that is in an area exposed to the extreme temperatures. Brazzelton volunteers and deactivates the switch, dying shortly afterwards.  Keyes and Zimsky race to reset the nuclear charges, and Zimsky gets trapped in one of the detaching compartments. Keyes believes they still may have too little yield, but Zimsky suggests they use the ship's nuclear fuel source as well, which will leave the ''Virgil'' powerless. Keyes deploys the nuclear core in the last compartment and detaches it just as the triggered detonations start, and then the core's rotation is restarted. Drifting powerless in the core, Keyes and Childs realize they can use the unobtainium shell to convert the heat and pressure from the wavefront to power the ''Virgil'', and they are able to escape from the Earth's core.  They break through the crust underwater, leaving them safe on the ocean floor, but power and communications are offline. They believe themselves lost underwater but use the remaining power to activate a weak sonar beacon. The beacon attracts a nearby whale pod, and Finch is able to trace their [[whale sound|whale songs]] to locate the ''Virgil''. A week after the mission, Finch unleashes the full details of the mission (including those lost) and of DESTINI to the public via the Internet.  
The Cooler
 Unlucky Bernie Lootz ([[William H. Macy]]) has little positive going for him: he lives in a dreary place—a  [[studio apartment]] in a run-down motel  near the [[Las Vegas Strip]]; he can't recall the last time he had physical contact with a woman; he's indebted to the Shangri-La [[casino]] boss Shelly Kaplow ([[Alec Baldwin]]), who years earlier cured him of a gambling habit by breaking his kneecap. Kaplow had also paid Lootz's casino debts, and Bernie has been working off that large debt to Shelly for several years and the debt is nearly paid off.  Lootz is weary of the casino business, and tells Kaplow he is leaving Las Vegas soon. His future success as a luck "cooler" is changed when cocktail waitress Natalie Belisario ([[Maria Bello]]) seemingly takes an interest in him, and his luck—and that of those around him—takes a turn for the better. What Bernie doesn't know yet is that Shelly has paid Natalie to seduce him into staying and working at the Shangri-La. What Shelly doesn't know is that Natalie actually has fallen in love with Bernie, and vice versa. Additional complications arise when Shelly, a relative old-timer who resents the [[Disneyfication]] of Vegas, resists the efforts of new Shangri-La owner advisers, including [[Ivy League]] graduate and condescending upstart Larry Sokolov ([[Ron Livingston]]), to update the casino hotel property and bring it into the 21st century.  Lootz also learns his seldom-seen adult son is back in town, and, with his wife, is interfering with the operations at the Shangri-La. Though Shelly still has the backing of certain mob associates, such as gangster Nicky Fingers, the growing power of the new young Ivy League casino owners is lessening his power grip on the casino and the business he truly loves.  
Coney Island Baby (film)
 After spending time in [[New York City]], Billy Hayes returns to his hometown. He wants to get back together with his [[ex-girlfriend]] and take her back to [[United States|America]] in hopes of opening up a [[gas station]].

Confidence (2003 film)
 A group of [[con artists|grifters]] rip off their latest mark and celebrate, while [[de facto]] leader of the group Jake Vig ([[Edward Burns]]) explains the art of the con. When one of the four ([[Louis Lombardi]]) is found shot to death, the other three learn that the latest money they stole actually belonged to a local L.A. [[crime]] lord called The King ([[Dustin Hoffman]]). Jake proposes that the grifters work for the King and steal money from Morgan Price ([[Robert Forster]]), a rival who owns a bank.  Jake enlists the aid of his remaining partners, Gordo ([[Paul Giamatti]]) and Miles ([[Brian Van Holt]]), and also convinces an independent con artist named Lily ([[Rachel Weisz]]) to round out their foursome. The King, a ruthless killer who suffers from [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], demands that one of his men, Lupus ([[Franky G]]), also come along.  The con involves bribing a bank vice president into wiring money offshore.  The plan hits a snag when Special Agent Gunther Butan ([[Andy García]]) shows up in L.A., looking to finally bust Jake, whom he has followed for years.  Butan forces corrupt LAPD detectives Omar Manzano ([[Luis Guzmán]]) and Lloyd Whitworth ([[Donal Logue]]) to switch their allegiance from Jake to him.  After hearing about Butan's arrival, a nervous Jake pulls the plug on the whole con. He screams at Lily, making her walk out. Lupus gets Jake to reconsider nixing the con, hinting that The King will torture and kill the grifters if the plan falls short. The con is back on, though now without Lily's help.  The bribed bank VP wires the money to Gordo in Belize. Gordo brings it to Ontario Airport, where he is met by both Butan and The King's men, both sides after the $5 million in a duffle bag. Butan arrests The King and confiscates the money.  Gordo disappears. Lupus, thinking the King has the money, reveals he was the one who killed Jake's grifter friend. Lupus holds Jake at gunpoint, but is shot by Travis ([[Morris Chestnut]]), a henchman for Morgan Price. It turns out that when Lily walked out, she went straight to Price himself and revealed the entire con, which was taking place that minute. Price told Travis to locate Jake and find out exactly how the con was engineered, to stop such a thing from ever happening again.   Travis takes Jake to an abandoned lot and forces him to explain the entire story. A furious Lily takes out a gun and kills Jake. Travis demands that he and Lily both disappear immediately.  Minutes later, Butan arrives in a car and Jake sits up from a pool of blood, unharmed.  The final parts of the con are revealed. Lily's "quitting" was faked—a set-up to confuse Lupus. Butan is actually an old confidant of Jake's. He managed to "confiscate" the money and arrest The King at the same time. Butan has the money and it's split five ways. Jake was wearing squibs to fake his own death in the lot.  In the end, everyone was in on everything except for The King and Lupus (the first marks), Price and Travis (the second, bigger marks), and the two corrupt LAPD detectives, who have been arrested. The four grifters reunite and celebrate.  
Conspiracy of Silence (film)
 Father Sweeney ([[Padraig O'Loinsigh|Patrick Casey]]), a gay Catholic priest living with HIV, commits suicide. His death leads local investigative journalist David Foley ([[Jason Barry]]) to write a story that publicly identifies Sweeney as having HIV.  At the local seminary, two students near ordination are expelled because one, Daniel ([[Jonathon Forbes]]) was seen leaving the room of the other, Niall ([[Paudge Behan]]). Niall is gay and Daniel is straight and they engaged in no sexual activity but were still expelled for the sake of appearances. Daniel returns home, where he is torn between his calling to the priesthood and his love for his ex-girlfriend Sinead ([[Catherine Walker (actor)|Catherine Walker]]).  Daniel meets with Foley, who writes a follow-up article exposing a covered-up AIDS protest that Sweeney had staged at the Vatican three years earlier and Daniel's dismissal. He also alleges that cardinals close to the Pope are engaged in sexual relationships and calls on the Church to re-examine its celibacy requirement for priests. The local bishop, Michael Quinn ([[Jim Norton (Irish actor)|Jim Norton]]), pressures the editor of the local paper not to run the second story. The editor acquiesces but after reading the story sends it to the ''[[Irish Times]]'', which prints it.  The next day the bishop, his aide, Foley and Daniel appear together in a live television debate. Before the broadcast, agents of the Church threaten to harm Foley's family unless he retracts his story on the air. Bishop Quinn offers to reinstate Daniel if Daniel is willing to admit he has been wrong. On-air Foley capitulates but Daniel does not, asking the bishop if he himself practices celibacy. When the bishop refuses to answer, Father Sweeney's partner, former priest Matthew Francis ([[John Lynch (actor)|John Lynch]]) confronts Quinn with Sweeney's suicide note in which Sweeney discloses that Quinn and he had had an affair.  At film's end, Daniel is back at home with Sinead.  
Corps à corps
 Laura Bartelli is a stripper in a French bar. She retires after a moody landscape architect named Marco Tisserand asks her to abandon her life and share his. However, after her red [[Volkswagen]] runs off the road en route to the rendezvous, she ends up scarred and comatose in a hospital. Marco stays at her bedside.  After some months, she awakens in a world of silence and gradually begins her new life with Marco, which is filled with affection and tenderness. She begins to love herself as much as she loves Marco. They have a son, Jeannot. Laura's deafness is more an irritation than an impediment and six years pass in family harmony. However, when Jeannot displays an unusual dysfunction at school, she goes to see a psychologist in Lyon, and shows a photograph of her son with his father. The psychologist recognizes Marco as a former university student colleague and tells her that he is a doctor. She investigates and finds out that he is a doctor specialized in multiple transplants, and that his (also deaf) wife Claire and daughter Jeanne had a car accident and are in a coma. Their whereabouts are unknown. She further finds out that her own car accident is unregistered with the police, and that her "hospital room" was a room in her own house. The medications she has to take are for people who receive transplants. All this suggests that she received multiple transplants from the first wife: internal organs and a hand, and that her ability to hear was removed on purpose, thus creating a copy of the first wife.  After Laura comes back from her investigative tour, Marco imprisons her. He then confesses to her son that he chose Laura because she had a blood test at the hospital he worked, and that the blood characteristics were identical to his first wife. The "accident" did not happen as thought; instead, he put nails on the road so that she would crash and then ambushed and drugged her so she lost her memory of that moment. He gives his son a drink with a testosterone inhibitor, and tells him that he will have to drink it daily. Laura tries to escape with her son but they are recaptured. She is able to communicate with her son and tell him to switch off the family chateau's electricity. A second attempt to escape is successful, her son helps her to find the secret room where the comatose daughter/sister lies. When Marco comes with a syringe to paralyze Laura, there is a standoff and she cuts off the electricity there too. Marco falls on the syringe and dies.  Two months later, Laura gets ear implants and gets back 60% of her hearing. She and her son visit the grave of Marco and his first family. She wants to get rid of the hand and get a prosthesis.

Cradle 2 the Grave
 The film opens with a group of thieves led by Anthony Fait attempting to steal diamonds for a Frenchman named Christophe, who serves as the middleman for a mysterious employer. When Fait contacts Christophe, a [[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|Taiwanese Intelligence Agent]] named Su intercepts the conversation and attempts to identify the criminals.  While the crew gathers up as many diamonds as they can, including a bag of [[Carbonado|black diamonds]], Agent Su calls Fait and demands that he and his crew leave the diamonds in the vault, warning him that the police are on the way. However, Fait ignores this warning, and the criminals attempt a daring escape past a [[SWAT]] team blockade. While Fait, Daria, and Tommy all manage to escape, Agent Su captures Miles and recovers Miles' share of the diamonds. Su is disappointed to find that Miles does not have the black diamonds though. Meanwhile, Fait asks his friend Archie to appraise the black diamonds he had stolen. Arriving at the [[San Francisco International Airport]], Christophe's mysterious employer, Ling, is informed, by his assistant Sona, that Christophe has been attacked and that Fait and his gang have taken the black diamonds.  Later that night, Fait runs into Su. During this inadvertent meeting, Fait receives a phone call from Ling, who demands that Fait hand over the black diamonds. Fait refuses and is subsequently attacked by two of Ling's henchman. With Su's help, he defeats them and escapes. After the fight, Archie tells Fait that some gangsters came to his workshop and demanded the black diamonds as well. After some hesitation, Archie admits that he gave the stones to the gangsters to spare his own life. Fait also receives another call from Ling, who has kidnapped Fait's daughter, Vanessa, to persuade Fait to give up the diamonds. Now with a common enemy, Fait and Su team up to recover the diamonds from the gangsters and rescue Vanessa from Ling.  Fait visits jailed crime lord "Jump" Chambers, most likely the employer of the gangsters who had robbed Archie. When Chambers refuses to cooperate, Fait goes to Chambers' night club, hoping to find the stones somewhere in his office. The plan goes awry, and Fait and the gang have to leave empty-handed. Meanwhile, Su and Archie go to an underground club to try to find the gangsters who attacked Archie. Because the club does not allow guests, Su is forced to enter as a fighter in the club's fighting ring. During Su's fight, Archie sees the man they are looking for, recognizing the man's ring. Through this informant, they learn that the diamonds are hidden in the bubble bath in Chamber's office. When they return to the nightclub to retrieve the diamonds, they find that Ling's men have already taken the stones. Meanwhile, while locked in a van, the bound and gagged Vanessa frees herself, and finds a cell phone to call her father. Just before the phone's battery runs out, Vanessa gives some clues as to her location. With these clues, the gang surmises that Vanessa is being held in an airport hangar.  Realizing that Ling will want to auction off the stones, which are actually weapons of mass destruction, the group searches flight schedules to find an airport where a large number of private flights will be landing that night. Finding the right airport, the group races to the hangar, where Ling's auction is already starting. A fight ensues, and Fait and his crew take out members of Ling's team. However, Vanessa is rescued and Ling is killed after Su forces him to swallow a capsule of synthetic plutonium and then breaks the capsule lodged in his neck. When the police arrive, Fait promises to end his criminal career in order to lead a safe and happy life with Vanessa.  In a bonus scene during the credits, Tommy and Archie made a plan to make the movie with their story, and using famous actors, such as [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Denzel Washington]]. They plan to get the director of the movies ''[[Exit Wounds]]'' and ''[[Romeo Must Die]]'' (Andrzej Bartkowiak).  
Cowards Bend the Knee
 ''Cowards Bend the Knee'' is set in a vague time period that is stated in the published script and on the DVD commentary as the 1930s, although certain of the film's events (e.g., the [[Winnipeg Maroons (ice hockey)|Winnipeg Maroons]] winning the [[Allan Cup]]) did not occur until the 1960s.<ref>Beard, William. ''Into the Past: The Cinema of Guy Maddin.'' Toronto: U of Toronto P, 2010. Print. 197. </ref> Guy Maddin (played by Darcy Fehr), star hockey player for the Winnipeg Maroons, is told by his father Maddin Sr (Victor Cowie), the team's announcer, to visit his mother in the hospital since she is gravely ill. Maddin instead takes his girlfriend Veronica (Amy Stewart) to get an illegal abortion at the home/beauty salon/bordello of Liliom (Tara Birtwistle). During the operation, Guy more or less forgets about Veronica and ends up leaving with Liliom's alluring daughter Meta (Melissa Dionisio). Veronica dies as a result of the botched abortion and perhaps despair at her abandonment.  Meta reveals that her father, Chas, was murdered by Liliom with help from the police captain Shaky, who also plays hockey with Guy. Chas' hands, stained blue from hair dye, were severed during the murder and Meta keeps them with her in a jar. She rejects Guy's sexual advances, saying that she won't be his until he murders Liliom and Shaky to revenge Chas. The abortionist/hockey team's doctor, Dr. Fusi (Louis Negin) agrees to sever Guy's hands and suture Chas' hands in their place.  However, while Guy is sedated and Meta is gone, Dr. Fusi just throws the hands away and paints Guy's own hands blue. Believing himself possessed by Chas' murderous hands, Guy sets out to kill Liliom but instead ends up trying to seduce her and eventually "fists" her in the beauty salon. Veronica's ghost has meanwhile risen and takes a job at the beauty salon, as does Guy. Guy becomes infatuated with Veronica's ghost, not recognizing her as the girlfriend he abandoned to die on the operating table (he has forgotten Veronica completely by this point).  Tormented, Guy discovers a wax museum that has been hidden and forgotten in the rafters of the Winnipeg hockey arena. The museum features wax sculptures of famous Winnipeg Maroons, including Chas. Meta continues to coerce Guy to carry out her revenge plans. Guy ends up murdering Shaky during a hockey game and, feeling guilty, attempts to confess his crime to the policeman Mo, but Mo refuses to arrest Guy and tries to get him to stop confessing. Guy then strangles Mo to death in the middle of the police station but none of the other officers notice.  Veronica's ghost has meanwhile begun dating Guy's father, Maddin Sr. after Guy's mother dies, unvisited. Guy is now involved with both Meta and Liliom (who he's promised Meta he will kill) while in love with the ghost of his ex-girlfriend Veronica, whose death he is somewhat responsible for and who is now involved with his own father. The pressure of the situation, in addition to the delusion that he is possessed by the murderous hands of Chas, drives Guy to finally strangle Liliom when she tries to stop Veronica's ghost from having a second abortion of unknown origin (presumably his father's child and thus his sibling, or perhaps his child needing to be aborted a second time). Meta by this time has soured on Guy and demands that Fusi returns her father's hands to her. Dr. Fusi then chloroforms Guy again and amputates his blue-painted hands.  Handless, Guy heads to the hockey arena and suits up for the big game, taping his hockey gloves over his fresh stumps. Guy heads to the urinal pre-game, but finds peeing a difficult tasks with no hands. At the urinal, he encounters his father, Maddin Sr., and sees that his father's penis is exceptionally large (much larger than his own). During the game, Maddin Sr. announces while stroking a block of ice carved into the shape of a woman's breast. Veronica's ghost, aroused by this, walks across the catwalk over the arena's ice towards the radio booth. Guy also climbs to the top of the arena and heads into the wax museum, where tarot cards predict "a mysterious apocalypse." Maddin Sr. and Veronica's ghost enter to announce that Guy's old girlfriend will be his new mother. The anguished Guy invokes the wax heroes of hockey old to aid him, and they in fact do awaken, having revealed themselves not to be wax heroes at all but cowards who have chosen immobility as an escape from life.  Guy and the hockey immortals pursue Maddin Sr. and Veronica's ghost out of the room and onto the catwalk. Meta sees her father Chas among the wax immortals and rushes to meet him. She attempts to reenact the childhood game that Chas and Meta used to play — she swooned and he caught her — but since Chas no longer has hands, he cannot catch her and she falls to her death. Guy then joins the wax immortals in the museum, in cowardly retreat.

Cosmopolitan (film)
 In an American suburb in [[Northern New Jersey]], conservative, middle-aged Indian immigrant Gopal, a telephone-company engineer who has taken early retirement, is celebrating [[Diwali]] in November with his wife and grown daughter. His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in [[Mongolia]] with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an [[ashram]] in India.  Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter's phone calls from Mongolia. He tries to cope with his emptiness by redecorating slightly, searching through the various corners of his small house, reading newspapers, and watching videos of [[Bollywood]] romance extravaganza films. Desperately lonely, he latches upon a copy of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine that had belonged to his daughter, and takes a quiz gauging a man's suitability for a relationship – which reveals that he is a "Ditchable Dude".  In the midst of his distress and his Bollywood fantasies, Gopal's eccentric neighbor, the oddly attractive divorcée Mrs. Shaw – whom he had previously thought of as loose-moralled (because of her one-night stands) and slovenly – appears at his door asking to borrow one of his rakes. This sets off a whole new set of fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day. While cleaning and straightening for the date, Gopal finds several more of his daughter's ''Cosmopolitan''s, and reads several articles on "What women want" from a man – evidently it is for them to "listen, listen, listen".  With the help of the advice gleaned from the pages of ''Cosmopolitan,'' and to some extent in spite of it, Gopal and Mrs. Shaw (Helen) hit it off, and develop a warm, tender, intimate relationship. Mrs. Shaw is a high school counselor, and therefore a good and empathetic listener herself, and Gopal confides in her about his childhood dreams and sorrows.  But the relationship does not go exactly as Gopal had planned. On Christmas Day, when Helen gently rebuffs his insistence on his long-term vision for the relationship, Gopal is very upset and shouts at her to leave. He then holes up sullen and frustrated in his house, refusing all attempts at communication from her, and is visibly angry when he sees she has a male visitor nearly a week later.  On New Year's Eve, Gopal discovers Helen has left a Christmas gift for him, and it is something very meaningful to him. He breaks down, and something in him shifts – regarding the relationship, his family, and himself.

Crime Spree
 Daniel Foray ([[Gérard Depardieu]]) is the leader of an unusual group of burglars in [[Paris]]. When Daniel is instructed by his boss to go to [[Chicago]] to pull off an easy home robbery it seems simple enough. However, when the group arrives in [[Chicago]], the mission quickly turns into a fiasco.  First, the group has a run in with a local gang of street thugs. Then, the  group's "keep a low profile" stay with Sophie Nicols ([[Joanne Kelly]]) is disrupted by a noisy neighbour. To make matters worse, while preparing for the burglary the group steals a car which belongs to a Latino street gang... After breaking into the house, tying up the owner and cracking the safe, the group realise that they have burgled the wrong house!

The group desperately tries to flee the city and return to Paris, all the while being hotly pursued by the Mafia, the Latino gang, the Chicago police, and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] who had Zammeti's house under surveillance.  
Crimson Gold
  The movie opens with a scene inside a jeweler’s shop, which the main character, Hossein, appears to be attempting to rob.  Hossein tries to force The Jeweler, to give him the key to the safe at gunpoint.  The Jeweler refuses, and manages to trigger the alarm.  Hossein then shoots The Jeweler, and, after some deliberation, takes his own life as well.  The rest of the movie proceeds to tell Hossein’s story.  The action flashes back to a scene two days before Hossein’s attempted robbery, in which Ali comes to tell Hossein that everything has been cleared for Hossein’s marriage to Ali’s sister, The Bride.  A con artist, The Man in the [[Tea House]], then joins them and expounds on the profession of [[pickpocketing]].  Hossein, naturally sensitive to his social status, is somewhat offended by the con artist’s automatic classification of him and Ali as mere pickpockets.  However, the con artist makes one point which can be taken as something of a universal truth: “If you want to arrest a thief, you’ll have to arrest the world.”  Later on, Hossein and Ali attempt to enter the jeweler’s shop and are viciously snubbed by The Jeweler, who literally shuts the doors in their faces.  That night, Hossein reports for [[pizza]] delivery duty.  It appears that Hossein is also dealing with some mental stability issues relating to either his war experience, his medication, or both.  His habit of not wearing a helmet while riding his motorbike is one manifestation of this.  Hossein first delivers to a man on the 4th floor of a building.  Since the elevators are broken, this necessitates him climbing 4 flights of stairs. The man pays Hossein 19000 [[Iranian toman|Toman]]s for the three pizzas (which costs 18500 Tomans) and tells him to keep the change. When he learns Hossein is a war buddy he gives him a lot more money, feeling sorry for him.  His next delivery is the site of a raucous block party in one of the more wealthy districts of [[Tehran]], which has been staked out by the police.  The police stop Hossein when he attempts to make the delivery, but don’t allow him to leave until the party has broken up, estimated to be around 4 AM.  While Hossein waits, he strikes up a conversation with a young soldier (only 15 years old).  Despite his uniform and assault rifle, The Soldier is still a child, arguably not ready for the responsibility given him.  Since it is obvious that he will not be able to deliver the pizzas, Hossein lets his kinder side show through and hands out pizza to the various police and soldiers on the scene.  It is notable that only after the chief accepts a slice do the others accept some as well.  The next morning, Hossein, Ali, and The Bride, dress nicely and gain admittance to the jeweler’s shop.  They browse among jewelry much too expensive for their means, while Hossein primarily waits to see The Jeweler.  When The Jeweler actually shows up, he treats the three with the same condescension and contempt as before, suggesting that they go to a pawnshop to buy handcrafted gold that can be easily liquidated in an emergency, a not-so-subtle reminder of their social status.  Hossein, clearly disgusted, takes The Bride home and then goes home himself.  Upon arriving at his apartment, the difference between Hossein’s accommodations and those of his clients is fairly obvious.  Hossein lays down on his bed and dozes for a while.  He is awakened by an arrest in a building close to his, and observes the police drag out a man who loudly and continuously protests his innocence.  The police pay no attention, and the class contrast is again seen, this time illustrated by the difference between the treatment of the wealthy and the poor by the police.  That night, Hossein again reports for [[pizza delivery]] duty.  On the way to his destination, Hossein encounters a fellow pizza courier who has been killed in an accident.  The destroyed motorbike and sprawled remains of the pizza warmer box are a grim reminder of the dangers of Tehran’s freeways at night.  Hossein delivers the pizza to The Rich Man, who lives in an extremely wealthy district.  This is exemplified by the fact that as Hossein is on his way up, two young women come down, dressed in essentially Western clothing, something that would not be found in less affluent neighborhoods. He invites Hossein into his spacious apartment.  While The Rich Man is otherwise occupied with a phone call with one of the young women Hossein passed coming up, Hossein proceeds to make use of the apartment’s many amenities, including a shave and a short swim.  Later, Hossein, obviously drunk, goes out onto The Rich Man’s balcony and surveys the city-scape.  The next morning, the scene returns again to the jeweler’s shop.  When The Jeweler comes and opens the shop, Hossein forces his way in with a gun and demands to see a specific piece of jewelry.  The Jeweler refuses to be pushed around, and Hossein then changes his demand to wanting the key to the safe.  The intent is to link this final scene back to the first scene, which culminates with Hossein taking his own life.  
D.E.B.S. (2003 film)
 A narrator explains that there is a test hidden in the [[SAT]]s which measures an applicant's ability to fight, cheat, lie and kill. Female students who score well on this hidden test are selected to become members of the secret paramilitary group D.E.B.S. which stands for Discipline, Energy, Beauty and Strength.  Focusing on one squad of D.E.B.S. composed of the team captain Amy ([[Alexandra Breckenridge]]), the tough Max ([[Tammy Lynn Michaels]]), French exchange student Dominique ([[Shanti Lowry]]), and the prissy and insecure Janet ([[Jill Ritchie]]), all of whom faces off against a ruthless villain named Lucinda Reynolds also known as Lucy in the Sky ([[Clare Kramer]]).  Spoofing television prime time shows, a listing of "Previous on D.E.B.S." shows the team's boss Mr. Tibbs explaining that Lucy in the Sky was spotted entering the United States again. Max is frustrated knowing that for some reason Lucy keeps capturing Amy and the team has to rescue her. Amy is captured, leading to Max to take over the team to lead them to Lucy's hideout in a dockside warehouse. Max, Janet, and the chain-smoking Dominique make entry into Lucy's hideout and soon are facing off in a gun battle with Lucy's henchmen, led by her right-hand man Billy Skids.  Meanwhile, unknown to either Lucy's henchmen or the D.E.B.S., Lucy and Amy are lovers and Lucy keeps capturing Amy so that the two of them can have sex, with Amy timing them to know when her colleagues will appear to "rescue" her. This time Lucy becomes frustrated over the same routine they have to go through over their secret romance each time. Amy then tells Lucy that she really loves her, and Lucy is happy.  Elsewhere, Max, Janet, and Dominique defeat Lucy's henchmen (with Dominique never dropping the cigarette she's smoking, and Max having an all-too-brief meeting of minds with Skids during their fistfight, while Janet is just determined not to get her favorite sweater ruined). The three D.E.B.S. arrive at a locked door to Lucy's quarters where they hear Amy screaming out, leading them to try to break down the door. But Amy is not screaming in pain, but in passion as she climaxes from the sex. Lucy and Amy quickly dress where Amy tells Lucy that she can capture her again next week during the D.E.B.S. mission to Uganda. On cue from Amy, Lucy punches her out and makes her escape as Max, Janet, and Dominique arrive, none of them aware to Amy's secret tryst with the enemy. Amy thanks them for rescuing her—again. The four D.E.B.S. walk out of the warehouse and into the sunset as Janet asks Amy if that is her sweater that she's wearing and if she got blood or any dirt on it.

Daddy Day Care
 Charles "Charlie" Hinton is a food products marketing executive whose wife Kim has just gone back to work as a [[lawyer]]. They enroll their son Ben, in Chapman Academy, an expensive and [[Hothousing|very academic]] [[pre-school]] headed by a woman named Miss Harridan. Some time later, Charlie and his best friend, Phillip "Phil" Ryerson, are laid off due to the [[early 2000s recession]]. Unable to find either a suitable daycare or new employment, Charlie pulls Ben out of Chapman due to its cost and decides to open up a day care center in his home with the help of Phil, calling it Daddy Day Care. At first, the local parents are [[Gender role|suspicious of men]] wanting to work with kids, but as Daddy Day Care is cheaper and more [[Student-centred learning|child-centered]] than Chapman Academy, the latter begins to lose students.  Unwilling to accept the presence of competition, Miss Harridan attempts to shut down Daddy Day Care by notifying [[child services]] that Charlie and Phil are not following the relevant regulations. Mr. Dan Kubitz, a director of child services, notifies them of the codes that they need to fix, which Charlie and Phil quickly correct. Daddy Day Care grows in popularity and attracts more children and parents. Mr. Kubitz then informs Phil and Charlie that they need another employee to keep an appropriate ratio of children to caregivers. Luckily, Marvin, a nerdy former co-worker, had dropped by and after seeing how good he is at entertaining the children, Phil and Charlie ask him about joining. Marvin is unsure at first, but then finds himself falling for Kelli, the single mother of Dylan-(one of the kids in the daycare) and agrees.  Later, Mr. Kubitz tells them they have too many kids to stay at Charlie's residence. They find an abandoned building with potential, but do not have the money to buy it. They hold a fund-raising event called "Rock for Daddy Day Care", which Miss Harridan finds out about. She and her assistant Jenny sabotage the festival by unplugging a bouncy castle, filling the food with cockroaches, switching face paint with glue, releasing animals from the petting zoo, and turning on the park sprinklers. As a result, Daddy Day Care does not raise enough money. Shortly after, Charlie and Phil are offered their old jobs back, accepting Miss Harridan's offer to take the kids back to the academy at a lower cost. Marvin, heartbroken by the closing of the day care, declines Charlie and Phil's offer to be on board their marketing panel.  Charlie soon realizes during a cereal pitch that the time he has given to his new life, that the increased bond with his son is "the most important thing", and starts to question the morality of his current assignment (which involves marketing a high-sugar breakfast cereal to children). He quits his job and tells Phil to quit with him. Then he and Phil pick up Marvin before heading off to Chapman Academy. Charlie confronts Harridan, claiming she doesn't care about what children want. Listing examples of how he has helped the children improve, Charlie successfully convinces the children and their parents to return to Daddy Day Care, making it a raging success, and causing Chapman Academy to shut down for good. Marvin is now in a relationship with Kelli, Miss Harridan gets demoted to a school crossing guard, and Jenny joins Daddy Day Care at the new facility.  
The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll
 Shot in and around Willis' native [[Chicago]] area, the documentary simply shows footage of Willis' daily life with his songs serving as the soundtrack. Willis appears unkempt, obese and mentally unstable.  His songwriting technique is shown as he visits a local [[FedEx Kinko's|Kinko's]] dressed sloppily and barefoot, and types expletives and repetitive [[bestiality]] references on a computer as [[lyrics]] and prints the document. His songs deal with subjects such as praise for celebrities that he had met or admired, reports on bands that he had seen, stories about violent confrontations with [[superhero]]es, and expletive-packed rants at his mental demons. Willis says music helps him silence the discouraging mental voices, but his fan following comes from people who find his songs humorous. Many of his compositions are very similar, a fact that is highlighted by scenes of him recording songs such as "I Whipped [[Superman]]'s Ass", "I Whipped [[Spider-Man]]'s Ass" and "I  Whupped [[Batman]]'s Ass", which are overlaid to highlight their similarities.  Willis also visits a zoo, overdubbed with one of his many songs about [[bestiality]].  Towards the end Willis is shown playing with his band, the [[Wesley Willis Fiasco]].  Several of Willis' friends are interviewed, among them recording engineer [[Steve Albini]]. They reminisce over how they met Willis and how they feel about him. Generally they are all sympathetic about his plight and it is stated he would likely be dead if he had not cultivated such a network.  One friend describes Willis' poor upbringing (involving forced viewing of his mother having sex in exchange for drugs), and touchingly, Willis' own despair at his condition:  "I'm already doomed. I can't find a girlfriend, I can't do a goddamned thing."

Desperate to help her son, she persuades Rusty to begin sessions with the therapist she is dating, Bob ([[Jeff Goldblum]]).  Around the same time that Rusty is making up his mind to go back to Texas to compete in rodeos, Dallas is presented the opportunity to be the driver for "Rubin the Roofer", where there is supposedly $50,000 to be had, of which he will get $20,000.  But he has to put $1,000 up front for Rubin, to ensure he doesn't get scared and flee.  In the search to collect the $1,000, Dallas attempts to borrow $300 from Christian (played by Val Lauren), one of the men they collect money from for Bear.  Christian refuses to loan Dallas the money, so Dallas offers to rob Bear with Christian, telling Christian he knows for a fact that there is $150,000 to be had, as long as he gives him the $300.  Christian ends up overhearing Dallas tell Rusty that he won't go through with the plan with Christian, but will still do the job with Rubin.  Christian follows Dallas and Rubin on their robbery job, and it turns out that they are robbing Bear.  After Rubin goes inside, Dallas decides to go after him to get the proper share of the $150,000.  They end up getting killed trying to rob Bear.  In the end, Rusty goes to Texas, and rodeos like he wanted to. On the bus ride to Texas, Rusty sees a sign that reads "Dallas 362", the title of the film.

Dangerous Night (film)
   
Daredevil (film)
  [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] is a blind lawyer who lives in New York City's [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] neighborhood, where he runs a firm with best friend [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin "Foggy" Nelson]]. As a child, Matt was blinded by a toxic waste spill. The accident enhanced Matt's other senses and gave him [[sonar]] to "see" via sonic vibrations. Matt's father, boxer Jack "The Devil", was killed after refusing to turn in a fixed fight for the mobster who had employed him earlier. After his father's death, Matt promised to stop all crime that controlled Hell's Kitchen as the vigilante crime-fighter "Daredevil".  Matt meets [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]], daughter of Nikolas Natchios, a businessman who has dealings with [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]], a rich executive who is also the criminal leader known as the Kingpin. When Nikolas tries to end his relationship with Fisk, the mobster hires the Irish hitman [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], who has preternatural aim, to kill him. Matt tries to stop Bullseye, but Bullseye ultimately succeeds in killing Nikolas and framing Matt's alter-ego in the process. Elektra vows to exact revenge, while reporter Ben Urich discovers his secret identity. Believing Matt to have done good things for Hell's Kitchen, Urich tells Matt that Bullseye is going after Elektra next.  Matt tracks Bullseye, but is attacked by Elektra, who plans to use her own training in martial arts to avenge her father's death. She defeats and injures Matt; when she manages to remove his mask, she discovers Matt's secret identity and innocence. Forced to fight Bullseye alone, Elektra is overpowered and killed by the hitman. A wounded Matt makes his way to a church, where he is looked after by his confidante, Father Everett, who knows his secret identity. After recovering slightly, Matt fights Bullseye, who had followed him to the church. Bullseye discovers that loud noise is Matt's weakness and prepares to kill him with a spiked piece of wood after incapacitating him. Matt blocks the attack and hears an FBI sniper stationed on the neighboring building preparing to fire. As the bullet is fired, Matt moves out of the bullet's path and pulls Bullseye's hands into it. When Bullseye pleads for mercy, Matt throws him from the church's steeple. Bullseye lands on the hood of Urich's car, severely injured but alive.  Upon discovering that Fisk is the Kingpin and Bullseye's employer, Matt makes his way to Fisk's office. There, Matt and Fisk begin a fierce fight; however, Fisk proves to be a surprisingly powerful combatant due to his size and brute strength, and he dominates Matt for most of the fight. Lying on the floor, Matt questions Fisk as to why he killed the people Murdock loved, including Jack Murdock years before: Fisk replies it was just business, for he had worked under Fallon at the time he killed Jack, and Elektra was "in the wrong family at the wrong time". Angered, Matt regains his strength and breaks Fisk's legs, but refrains from killing him, instead allowing him to be arrested by the police, who have discovered his criminal connections. Before being taken away, Fisk—who had also discovered Matt's secret identity after overpowering him—swears revenge on Matt, who points out that Fisk cannot reveal Matt's secret identity because the humiliation of having been beaten by a blind man will cause him to be perceived as weak by other prison inmates. Having gained closure over his father's murder, Matt returns to his day-to-day routine, and meets Urich one last time, in which Urich assures him he will not publish his article about Matt's true identity.  In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Bullseye, having been moved to a prison hospital and severely bandaged after his confrontation with Matt, is shown to still have his perfect aim after he impales a fly with a syringe needle and says "Bullseye."

He gets out of the car to take a further look, and the woman appears, holding a baby. Marion, seeing how distressed the woman appears to be, and realizing that she needs help, offers to walk so that they can take the woman in the car to a house for help. The woman gets into the car, and as the family ask her questions, she remains silent. They arrive at a wooden cabin, and Laura and Frank go in to investigate. Meanwhile, Richard goes to masturbate in the woods, leaving Brad in the car with the woman and her child. Brad begins questioning the woman and telling the woman his plans to propose to Marion, meanwhile Marion walks along the road to catch up with the family and rehearses how she plans to break up with Brad. The woman tells Brad the name of her child; Amy, and passes her to him. A confused Brad asks how the child can breathe with the blankets covering her face, the woman replies that the baby is dead. Confused, Brad lifts the blankets to discover what appears to be the rotting corpse of the child, and screams. The camera changes back to Richard, who hears the scream and immediately runs back to the car. Brad, and the woman, are nowhere to be seen. However, Marion sees a hearse driving down the road, and as she turns to look, she sees Brad slam his body at the back of it. She runs back to the family and makes them drive after the hearse, the journey is unsuccessful.  Driving along the road, Frank once again stops the car, and gets out to look at the road, telling the family to stay back.

Frank abruptly stops the car once again, when he sees a pram in the road, Richard gets out to look and pretends to be pulled into the pram, scaring his parents. They get back into the car, only to stop again, however this time, it's Richard who the hearse picks up. Later on, the family find his body, and Laura begins to go insane.  Driving with his daughter in the front of the car, Marion appears to have returned to normal, and the family pass a sign that says "Marcott". Frank realizes that this must be a military road, and that's why it's not on the map. During a stop, Laura shoots Frank in the leg with a shotgun that they had unwrapped from a present for a family member. After dressing the wound, they begin the drive again. Shortly after, Laura talks about seeing the face of a friend who had died 20 years earlier in the woods. She demands to visit with her departed friend, and upon Frank refusing, jumps out of the moving vehicle. Frank stops and they search for Laura until she appears, disheveled and babbling with her brain exposed from the impact before soon dying. Putting her in the back of the car, he continues to drive. They come across the same ranger station they had stopped at earlier, and Frank is attacked in the dark by the Lady in White. Afterward, Frank has a noticeable change in demeanor and punches Marion unconscious. He sees the Woman in White once again, and chases her into the woods with the shotgun, only to be quickly dispatched in the dark. Marion awakens and gets out of the car, and begins to try and walk down the road. She comes across body bags in the middle of the road containing her dead family members. As she cries, the hearse pulls up, but the Woman in White comes from behind, telling a frightened Marion that the hearse isn't there for her before getting into the hearse and driving off, leaving Marion alone with her dead family.  Marion suddenly awakens in the hospital, heavily bandaged. The doctor tells her of her coma and assure Marion that she and the baby will be fine. On the way out of the hospital, the doctor talks to a man claiming to be the one to find the family after the car crash. The car is then seen being pulled from a wreck, and the doctor discusses the accident. The man surmises that the whole family, except Marion, have died, and that the crash has also claimed the life of a young woman and her baby in the other car. He asks the doctor for her name, and she reveals to him that it is Dr. Marcott. The viewer gets the impression that Marion dreamed of how her family had died while in a coma, and that the hearse not picking her up was her dream telling her that she would live. As the doctor tries to leave, her car fails to start, and the man who found the family offers her a lift in the same hearse from Marion's dream.  As the credits roll, two workers are seen sweeping up debris from the crash. They find a note Frank had previously written in the car with Marion before their final stop, insinuating that the experiences of the family were real.  
Darkness Falls (2003 film)
  In the town of Darkness Falls, widow Matilda Dixon was adored by the town's children. She gave them gifts and gold coins when they lost teeth, earning her the nickname Tooth Fairy. A fire in her home left her face disfigured and sensitive to light; she wore a white porcelain mask and only left her house at night. The town's adults were suspicious of Matilda; they blamed her when two children went missing. They hanged her and exposed her face to light. Dying, Matilda swore vengeance. When the two missing children returned home unharmed, the townsfolk realized their mistake and quickly buried Matilda's body. Over the next 150 years, the story of Matilda, the Tooth Fairy, became a legend; her dark spirit visits children on the night they lose their last baby tooth. If anyone sees her when she visits, they are marked for her vengeance.  Kyle Walsh, an antisocial teenager befriended by Caitlin Greene ([[Emily Browning]]), loses his last baby tooth. That night he sees Matilda and realizes the story is true. Knowing light is her weakness, he shines a flashlight into her face and hides in the brightly lit bathroom. His mother is killed after seeing Matilda. The next morning, police arrive and Kyle is taken to a mental hospital after mistaken speculations that he killed his mother.  Twelve years later, Caitlin ([[Emma Caulfield]]) telephones Kyle ([[Chaney Kley]]) to ask for his help with her younger brother Michael ([[Lee Cormie]]), who refuses to sleep in the dark. Kyle still suffers fear and paranoia from his encounter with Matilda; he has dozens of flashlights and medications for anxiety and depression. Kyle visits Michael at the hospital but denies any relation to his condition and walks away from Caitlin, who believes his story.  Kyle tries to warn others of Matilda but faces ridicule and skepticism, which leads to the death of many townspeople. A lightning storm blacks out the whole town; realizing Michael and Caitlin are in danger, Kyle rushes to the hospital. He rescues them and gains allies as others realize his story is true. Kyle, Michael, and Caitlin hide in the local lighthouse. They are helped by several medical personnel, all of whom are killed by Matilda.  During the struggle, Matilda tries to kill Kyle, but before she can do so, the lighthouse lights up. The sudden exposure to light causes her pain; she drops her mask. Kyle sees her disfigured face and realizes she is now vulnerable. She resumes her attack, during which Kyle's right sleeve catches fire and he kills Matilda by striking her face with it. As she is burning, Matilda is destroyed and her curse ends.  As the film ends, a boy is being tucked into bed by his parents. He is scared because he has just lost his last baby tooth. He finds his mother replaced the tooth with a gold coin, showing that Matilda and her curse are gone.  
Danny Deckchair
 Danny Morgan (Ifans) works as a [[concrete]] maker driver and [[construction worker]] who lives in a big Australian city with his girlfriend but is unhappy with his life. Danny yearns for the simple life while girlfriend Trudy (Clarke) fantasizes about bright lights and fast times.  While Danny plans for their annual camping trip, Trudy tells him she has to work, so the trip is off.  In reality, Trudy is using her work connections at a local real estate agency to set up a meeting with a handsome local sports reporter, Sandy Upman (Muldoon).  Danny sees them together while he's shopping for a weekend [[barbecue]], leaving him even more disenchanted with their relationship.  During the barbecue in his backyard, Danny, being an [[inventor|inventive]] character, ties a bunch of [[helium]]-filled [[balloon]]s to his [[deckchair]] as his friends hold him down.  When they inadvertently let go, Danny is set on an airborne adventure across Australia, which causes him to become a national sensation. As he floats over idyllically beautiful rural landscapes, totally foreign to the concrete structures of his discontent, he appears on the verge of some enlightenment.  After he's beaten up in a rugged ride through a thunderstorm, fireworks from a small town's macadamia festival burst his balloons. Danny lands in a tree in Glenda's front yard as the remnants of his chair float away.  Glenda (Otto), who was watching the fireworks from her front porch, sees Danny fall into the tree but doesn't see the deckchair.  As firemen and townsfolk arrive to find out if the fireball caused any damage, they see Glenda helping a disheveled Danny.  Glenda tells them that Danny is an old professor from college days and takes him into her house, which belonged to her parents.  As he recovers from the harrowing end to his journey, the lonely Glenda, fascinated by the strapping Danny, doesn't press him about his past.  Danny doesn't help matters by offering only vague explanations about his origins and unorthodox arrival in the town of Clarence.  As Danny explores the town, Glenda's friends wonder about their past relationship, but they are quickly won over by Danny's whimsical ways.  This was easy to accomplish as Glenda's friends are just happy to see that the withdrawn, and sometimes depised, traffic officer is with someone special.  Using his easy-going manner, Danny persuades Glenda to dress-up and go with him to the harvest ball.  She gives him some nice clothes (formerly her father's) to wear to the ball.  After Danny looks in the mirror, he shaves his beard and trims his hair.  At the ball and around town, Danny's mysterious past, detached demeanour and off-the-wall ideas make him an instant hit with the townsfolk.  His ideas that were considered hair-brained in the big city seem fresh in the small town of Clarence, and he is hired to become the manager of an aspiring politician's campaign.  As they spend time together at Glenda's house, Danny finds her father's old motorcycle, which for sentimental reasons Glenda keeps in the shed.  After she shows Danny pictures of her parents on the motorcycle exploring the country, Danny fixes up the old motorcycle when Glenda is at work.  All the while, the big city media can't get enough coverage of Danny's disappearance, constantly broadcasting interviews of his friends, family and co-workers.  Trudy takes up with the sports reporter (Muldoon), who sees covering Danny's story and Trudy's suffering as a way to the top.  Back in Clarence, Danny is forging a deep connection with Glenda.  But their budding relationship is not viewed by everyone in town as all peaches-and-cream.  Their flirtations arouse jealousy and suspicion in Glenda's male co-worker, the town's police supervisor, who busts them for speeding when they take Glenda's motorcycle out for a ride.  But nothing fazes Danny as he continues to immerse himself in his ideal world.  He even goes so far as to give a stirring speech at a political rally, and he is asked by some of the townsfolk to run for office.  All caught up in the dizzying events surrounding the political rally, Glenda and Danny spend the night together.  He wakes reveling in his new soul-mate, gets dressed in a haze of happiness and steps outside onto Glenda's porch to greet the dawn of his perfect new life.  However, local kids have found and reported the deck chair causing Danny's past to come crashing down upon him in a torrent of media frenzy.  As a shocked Glenda emerges from her house to see what all the noise is about, she spots Danny running down the street with a crowd in hot pursuit.  Just then, Trudy and Upman drop down in a news helicopter and land in the street in front of Glenda's yard, stopping Danny dead in his tracks.  Trudy reclaims Danny amidst an explosion of camera flashes to take him back to the big city, where she can bask in his new-found fame.  As his half-truths become uncovered in the stark light of media exposure, Glenda rails against Danny as he's whisked away.  Although she is angry at being deceived by Danny, his departure brings Glenda to the stark realization that she has been deceiving herself as well.  She finally admits to herself that her life is at a dead end and she decides it's time for a change.  Meanwhile, unhappily plugged back into his old job and with Trudy trying to capitalize on his fame, the deep changes within Danny that happened in Clarence make city life all the more unbearable.  Danny confronts Trudy, tells her it's over and uses the connections his media storm have forged to get on a military plane to win Glenda back.  Back in Clarence, Glenda has finished packing up her motorcycle and is saying goodbye to her friends.  Just then, Danny parachutes out of the plane over Clarence and crash-lands in the tree in front of Glenda's house as she's starting to leave on her motorcycle.  At first, Glenda appears excited to see Danny; but immediately she starts yelling that he can't just drop in and everything will be all right.  Glenda resolutely drives off before Danny can convince her how much he needs her and his new life in the town of Clarence. Dragging his parachute, Danny runs after her, shouting that he'll do whatever it takes to get back together.  As she drives away, Danny's parachute cord gets caught on the back of the motorcycle and he is lifted into the air.  As Glenda glances into her mirror for one last look at her old life, she notices Danny flying behind her and stops the bike. As he comes down, Danny and Glenda get entangled in the parachute, wordlessly embrace and kiss.  As the movie ends, Danny and Glenda, in their bathrobes, symbolically float upward in deck chairs as they talk about their future plans.  
Darna Mana Hai
 Darna Mana Hai interweaves six stories into one film. Seven friends get stuck in the middle of a [[forest]] when their car breaks down, and all of them except Vikas find refuge in an abandoned house. To keep each other amused, they tell each other [[Horror fiction|horror]] and [[supernatural]] stories that they have heard over a [[bonfire]].  ===Story 1 - On the Way=== The first story revolves around a married couple, Karan ([[Sohail Khan]]) and Anjali ([[Antara Mali]]), who get stuck in the middle of a forest. After their car suddenly stops, Karan gets out to investigate the problem. After his disappearance and his constant cries for help from the desolated forest, Anjali gets out and runs into the forest to rescue him. She finds Karan's [[torch]] covered in blood and is stalked by an unseen person or [[supernatural being]]. Panicking, Anjali runs around and finds a hand reaching out of a [[swamp]]. She then becomes terrified to find that the hand is wearing a watch identical to her husband's. After failed attempts to rescue him, the hand disappears. Someone creeps up on her and as Anjali screams, it turns out to be Karan. Karan seems completely normal and fine while Anjali, whimpering, attempts to tell him that she heard him screaming. However, Karan tells her that he heard her screams from the forest when he went to retrieve water. She looks at the torch she found, which is suddenly clean of the blood it was covered in. She then hurries back to the car with Karan, telling him to get them both out of there. After quickly fixing the car problem with the water, Karan and the panicked Anjali climb into the car and drive off. After seeing Anjali's anxious and worried state, Karan puts his arm around her as she leans on him and closes her eyes. He then smirks and looks into the rearview mirror of the car, in which his reflection is not visible and Anjali seems to be leaning on nothing.  After this story, one of the friends who gets frightened goes back to the car.  ===Story 2 - No Smoking=== The second story is about a [[photographer]], Anil ([[Saif Ali Khan]]), who checks into an [[inn]] while on his way to [[Mumbai]]. The manager and owner ([[Boman Irani]]) of the lodge is a strange and eccentric man who insists that [[smoking]] is strongly prohibited in his inn. When Anil tries to go outside for a smoke, the man restricts him, telling him about the diseases that come along with smoking. The owner then locks Anil inside the lodge and tells him that in a matter of months, he can cure his smoking addiction. The owner takes Anil to a basement of sorts and shows him piles of dead bodies, telling him that he tried to prevent them but these people would not stop smoking. After a few months, Anil is now seen working at the lodge, acting strange and eccentric himself. When a customer walks in smoking and asks him for a room, Anil tells him that smoking is strongly prohibited. When the customer displays indifference, Anil proceeds to shoot the man with a gun. The story ends with Anil and the owner sitting together, smiling and watching a commercial about the effects of smoking.  After this story, a second friend in the group around the bonfire goes to the car looking for a blanket. When she leaves, the body of the first girl who left the bonfire is shown. The second girl is chased around the forest, caught and stabbed by an unseen assailant.  ===Story 3 - Homework=== The third story is that of a school teacher ([[Raghubir Yadav]]). He confronts a student, Pramila, who is always punished for not completing her homework. One day when the teacher asks her to hold out her hand for punishment (assuming she did not do her homework), the student produces her homework instead. But her homework elicits a strange reaction from the teacher. Everyday following this, the incident repeats itself making the teacher increasingly anxious. Upon a suggestion from a coworker that she might be receiving help from parents or a tuition, the teacher calls upon Pramila's mother. She denies about helping her daughter. He then asks about the [[Om]] sign Pramila draws on every page of her homework. The mother shrugs it off which forces the teacher to drop the topic. Later, he decides to go to Pramila's house. The teacher confronts her and he explains that he once murdered his intelligent friend called Varun in jealousy and thinks Pramila is a [[reincarnation]] of his friend. He says that he drew the Om sign to prove it. He realizes he is slipping into insanity and leaves apologizing. On the way back home, he is confronted by the spirit of his childhood friend Varun, who lets him know, "You are not insane [yet]. But you will be." By the next morning, the teacher loses his sanity and he keeps on scribbling basic mathematics on the road.  After this story is told, another friend in the group leaves the bonfire looking for the girls who had left them before. He reaches the car to discover Vikas killed by the knife he had in his hand. When he goes back to warn his friends he also was confronted by the mysterious attacker.  ===Story 4 - Apples=== The fourth story focuses on a housewife ([[Shilpa Shetty]]), who goes to a market and comes across a vendor selling apples for Rs. 20 as compared to everyone else selling apples at Rs. 60. She buys the apples from the vendor ([[Rajpal Yadav]]) but his demeanour and behaviour unsettles her. When she gets home, her husband ([[Sanjay Kapoor]]) eats one of the apples and finds it very tasty. The wife worries that something might happen to him after eating the apples, as she harbours suspicions about the vendor. The next morning, when she wakes up, she is shocked to find an apple next to her instead of her husband. She runs outside and is astonished to see apples everywhere on the ground, seemingly that every person who has eaten an apple has turned into one. The vendor then appears with an evil look, offering her his last apple for free.  ===Story 5 - Ghostly Lift=== In the fifth story an elderly man named John ([[Nana Patekar]]) is standing at a [[graveyard]]. A young man in [[sunglasses]], Amar ([[Vivek Oberoi]]), drives by and gives John a lift. Amar asks John why he was at the graveyard, as he thinks that John's wife is dead so he might have come to visit her grave. But John says that it is actually he who is dead. Amar dismisses it as a joke. After some more conversation, Amar gets exasperated by John's strange behavior. Amar then stops the car, gets out and asks John to get out. John then explains that he works for [[MTV]] Bakra (a program similar to [[Punk'd]]) and Amar is the first person not to get scared. Amar says that he was not scared because he knew beforehand that John was not a [[ghost]]. He says that he knew this because he himself is a ghost. John thinks that Amar is now trying to play a prank to get back at him. Amar then takes off his sunglasses, revealing that his eyes are hollow, before disappearing. When John sees this, he dies of shock.  Back in real time, at the end of the fifth story, only two friends are left, as none of the five have returned. The two of them start talking about other things when a man suddenly appears, sitting at a corner. The strange man (revealed to be [[Sushant Singh]]) approaches the two and tells them that he has heard the five stories. He asks the boy out of the two friends to tell a story, who narrates the following.  ===Story 6 – Stop/Move=== The sixth and final story is about a young student, Purab ([[Aftab Shivdasani]]), and his love interest, Abhilasha ([[Isha Koppikar]]). Purab contemplates suicide because Abhilasha rejects his advances and nobody else in his college likes him either. He sadly rants about not being special in front of an [[Murti|idol]]. Later, he discovers that he has developed an extraordinary ability - he can immobilize a particular person just by saying "Stop" to them. Purab uses his ability to freeze Abhilasha, and later imitates it to her by immobilizing a number of students in their college. Abhilasha, frightened of Purab's power, agrees to date him. Thereafter, Purab goes to his house and uses his power on his father on the way to his room. In his room, he, in delight of his ability, starts making plans to use his power. As he looks into the mirror, he says "Stop", which freezes him on the spot. His father finds him like that in his room, with a victorious smile frozen on his face. He is immediately rushed to the hospital but in vain.  ===Ending=== The strange man tells the two friends that it is his turn now to tell a story. He tells them a story that they are partly familiar with.  A group of seven friends are travelling when their car breaks down one night. They seek shelter under a ruined shack and start telling stories to each other to kill time. After each story, one friend in the group (supposedly frightened) goes out into the forest and gets killed, one by one, until only two are left. The two friends that are left stop telling stories to each other and the killer, who is now bored, comes out to them. The killer appears to be the very same strange man that is narrating this story. He says that his only reason for the murders is fear because he cannot stand it and would kill anyone who is scared.  The man then kills the boy. The girl, Shruti (Sameera Reddy), runs into the forest as fast as she can but the killer catches up to her and stabs her. She manages to kill the man before falling unconscious.  When day breaks, Shruti awakens and walks up to the main road to find that the place is swarming with police and her friends' bodies are being taken into ambulances. Then she sees the killer standing by a car, smiling. Shruti points at the man and tries to tell the police that he is the murderer, but the police take no notice of her and appear not to hear her. The killer then points at a body, which she shockingly discovers to be her own. She realizes that she too is dead and is now a ghost, and watches their bodies being taken away with tears in her eyes. As she watches, she is joined by the ghosts of her friends and the killer.

Tia's mother accepts for Tia's sake, though she loathes Jai for killing her son-in-law and causing her daughter's memory loss. Tia is told that Anita was her best friend, who died in a car accident, and Anshu is Jai and Anita's son. Tia is told that Anshu loves his "aunt" very much and that she should look after the boy so he won't miss his mother too much.  In South Africa, Tia's mother realizes that Tia is developing feelings for Jai and warns him not to encourage her or reciprocate her feelings. Jai looks after Tia, but whenever she tries to get close to him, he keeps his distance. Jai's father ([[Paresh Rawal]]) tries to set them up to be together but Jai refuses — even though he still loves her very much. Finally, Tia's mother accepts the fact that her daughter is in love with Jai. However, Jai is still reluctant to enter a relationship with Tia since he feels guilty for causing the accident.  Tia confronts Jai about his attitude towards her, which leads to an altercation. Tia flees and Jai follows her. When she threatens to commit suicide, Jai is forced to admit that Anshu is Tia's son, Anita was only his friend, and that her husband died in the accident as well.  Jai's father, who arrives with Tia's mother, explains that Jai is very much in love with Tia, but he hopes that she regains her memory and punishes him for what he did: killing her husband in the car accident. However, Tia forgives Jai, even though she doesn't regain her memory, telling him that the accident was her destiny, and if he had not crashed into her, someone else would have. She says that since Jai does not want to be with her, she will take her son and leave. Jai stops her, saying that he wants to be a father figure to Anshu, tells her that he loves her and asks her to marry him, which she accepts happily.  
Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star
 Dickie Roberts is a former [[child actor|child star]] who shot to fame on a TV [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] called ''The Glimmer Gang'' with his catchphrase "This is Nuckin' Futs!". His career subsequently halted after his 6th birthday. Since his heyday, he has been reduced to parking cars at [[Morton's Restaurant Group|Morton's]] and appearing on ''[[Celebrity Boxing]]'', where he is matched with [[Emmanuel Lewis]]. In the public eye and to his girlfriend Cyndi who apparently leaves him during a roadside incident, Dickie is washed up.  After talking to an old friend, [[Leif Garrett]], Dickie is absolutely convinced that a new [[Rob Reiner]] movie in the works, ''Mr. Blake's Backyard'', will be his comeback vehicle. Even after Sidney, his agent, does not land him an audition, Dickie persists. While on duty at Morton's, he joy rides in a customer's vehicle, drops into an [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meeting, and he pesters [[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]] to hook him up with Reiner. After he is kicked out because he's not an alcoholic, Dickie fakes being wasted and crashes what turns out to be a [[Lamaze]] class. However, [[Brendan Fraser]] (in an uncredited cameo appearance) is in the class and, finding his entrance to the class hilarious and ridiculous, he agrees to help him out and calls Reiner for Dickie.  Reiner bluntly tells Dickie that the part is not within his abilities because it requires knowing how a regular person lives. Unfortunately, Dickie never had a real childhood; he grew up in the limelight, and then his mother abandoned him when his show was cancelled. Desperate to prove to Reiner that he's right for the part, Dickie sells his raunchy [[autobiography]] to raise $30,000. With the money, he pays a family to "adopt" him for a month, as he believes he will "watch and learn".   Once Dickie hires his "family", things get off to a rocky start, as George, the bread-winning father, insists that they need the money, despite the rightful reservations of the other family members.  Grace, the mother, comes to pity and gradually provides him with surrogate guidance, realizing the lesson from ''Blake's Backyard'' itself: sometimes all of the things you need are in your own backyard. Dickie learns much about himself and life in general, and begins to act as a third parent. He helps the family's son score a date with his dream girl and helps the daughter join the pep squad. Cyndi returns to him and is admired by George, who turns out to be inept on the subject of fidelity.  Sidney lands an audition for Dickie by donating a kidney to Reiner after Reiner is savagely beaten by a psychotic street douche whom Dickie provoked while unknowingly driving Reiner's vehicle; Dickie is awarded the part, proving that "In Hollywood, Sometimes Your Dreams Can Come True...Again".  After George and Cyndi abandon the household together, Dickie gives up the part to be with the family he has come to love.    The movie ends with a faux ''[[E! True Hollywood Story]]'' report on Dickie, who now turns his real story into a new sitcom that uses all of his old friends, as well as his new family (including the mother, whom he has married). The closing credits are a take-off on Relief albums listed as "To help former child stars". The song includes ''[[The Brady Bunch]]''s [[Maureen McCormick]] singing "But if one more person calls me 'Marcia', I'll bust his fucking head", and many references to old television sitcoms.  The movie shows Dickie interacting with numerous former child stars, played by over two dozen actual former stars lampooning their careers, such as Leif Garrett, [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]], [[Dustin Diamond]] and [[Danny Bonaduce]].  
Distant Lights (2003 film)
 Unlike many ensemble films, the subplots of the film mostly do not interconnect with each other, and the film ends without a finale. Instead, the story threads illustrate life on the border between two countries; what appears to be poverty and desperation to some is a promised land for others, worth risking their lives to reach. The threads are:  *Kolya, a [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], has paid to be smuggled into Germany illegally; he finds he has been left on the Polish side of the border. When he is caught, a German interpreter agrees to smuggle him herself; he reaches [[Berlin]]. *Ingo, a German mattress salesman, finds business in Frankfurt to be minimal and the people self-interested. He is humiliated and becomes desperate, but may have found love in Simone. *Antoni, a Polish taxi driver, struggles to find the money to buy a [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] dress for his daughter. By the time he is able to afford it, he is too late. (This subplot pays [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to [[Ken Loach]]'s film ''Raining Stones'' and [[Mike Leigh]]'s ''[[All or Nothing (film)|All or Nothing]]''.) *Philip, a young German architect, runs into his Polish former girlfriend Beata while working on a building project in Słubice. Neither the romance nor the project works out. *Anna and Dimitri, a young Ukrainian couple, are swindled out of their money and try with Antoni's help to cross the river Oder, almost drowning in the attempt. *Andreas, a young German orphan who smuggles cigarettes, attempts to take the money and run away with a girl from the children's home.  
Die, Mommie, Die!
 The film opens with Angela Arden kneeling in front of her twin sister Barbara's grave. Angela is a lounge singer who is attempting to resuscitate her floundering career, which became obsolete around the same time Barbara committed suicide. She's unhappily married to her [[film director]] husband Sol Sussman, with whom she has two children&ndash;Lance, who is gay and emotionally disturbed, and Edith, a "daddy's girl" who is openly contemptuous of her mother. Also living in the house is the snoopy maid Bootsie, who is infatuated with Sol. Bored and unhappy, Angela begins cheating on her husband with Tony Parker, a tennis-playing "[[lothario]]" and failed actor who is reputed to be well endowed.    Sol finds out after hiring a private detective to follow Angela around. He confronts her about it but he refuses to divorce her. Instead, he gives her "life in prison". Not only does he cancel all of Angela's credit cards, he forbids her from performing at an engagement in New York, destroying the contract before she has a chance to sign it. Feeling trapped and eager to get her hands on her husband's money, Angela poisons an ever-constipated Sol with an [[arsenic]]-laced suppository.  Despite the fact that Angela receives virtually nothing in Sol's will, her children, along with Bootsie, begin to suspect Angela's involvement. And the suspicious circumstances of Sol's death bring old questions about Angela's sister's death to light. Edith&ndash;and later Lance&ndash;hatch a plot to get her to confess. Meanwhile, Tony successfully seduces both the children, taking an unusual interest in the details surrounding Aunt Barbara's death. After Bootsie is found dead, the children eventually get Angela to confess her crimes by lacing her evening coffee with [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].  During her bender, Angela not only reveals that she poisoned Sol, but that she is not Angela but really Barbara. In flashback, Barbara reveals how as Angela's career flourish, her own fell apart, culminating in her arrest for jewelry theft. After serving her sentence, Barbara arrived at Angela's mansion, greeted with scorn and ridicule from the immensely egotistical Angela. Watching the physical and emotional abuse Angela doled out to Sol and the children, Barbara devised a plan to poison her sister and take over her life, her family and, most importantly, her career. The children watch with confusion as Barbara announces she killed Angela.  As they turn the tape over to Tony, Edith and Lance fight over who will be the one to run away with him, while he respectfully refuses both of them. Meanwhile, a masked assailant pops up and tries to dispatch Barbara; in the scuffle, Barbara pulls off the assailant's mask, revealing Sol underneath. With all the primary players in the room, Sol reveals how he and Bootsie faked his death for him to escape outstanding mob debts he couldn't pay back and how he was forced to kill Bootsie to protect his secret. Tony then reveals he is really an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent who's been heading a case investigation Angela's murder before arresting Sol. The children&ndash;finally understanding Barbara's motives and desperation&ndash;hug Barbara while Tony says he will destroy the evidence to protect her from an eventual prison stint and trip to the gas chamber. But Barbara tells them, as she walks to her waiting police escort outside, that by finally being herself, she will finally gain her freedom from living under her sister's shadow.

Dogville
 The story of ''Dogville'' is told in nine chapters and a prologue, with a one-sentence description of each chapter given in the film, in the vein of such chapter headings in many 19th-century novels. These descriptions are given below.  ===Prologue=== Dogville is a very small [[United States|American]] town by an abandoned [[silver mine]] in the [[Rocky Mountains]], with a road leading up to it and nowhere else to go but the mountains. The film begins with a prologue in which a dozen or so of the fifteen citizens are introduced. They are portrayed as lovable, good people with small flaws which are easy to forgive.  The town is seen from the point of view of Tom Edison Jr., an aspiring writer who procrastinates by trying to get his fellow citizens together for regular meetings on the subject of "[[Moral Re-Armament|moral rearmament]]". It is clear that Tom wants to succeed his aging father, a physician, as the moral and spiritual leader of the town.  ===Chapter 1=== :''In which Tom hears gunfire and meets Grace'' It is Tom who first meets Grace Mulligan, who is on the run from gangsters who presumably shot at her. Grace, a beautiful but modest woman, wishes to keep running, but Tom assures her that the mountains ahead are too difficult to pass. As they talk, the gangsters approach the town, and Tom quickly hides Grace in the nearby mine. One of the gangsters asks Tom if he has seen the woman, which he denies. The gangster then offers him a reward and hands him a card with a phone number to call in case Grace shows up.  Tom decides to use Grace as an "illustration" in his next meeting—a way for the townspeople to prove that they are indeed committed to community values, can receive a gift, and are willing to help the stranger. They remain skeptical, so Tom proposes that Grace should be given a chance to prove that she is a good person. Grace is accepted for two weeks in which, as Tom explains to her after the meeting, she must gain the friendship and trust of the townspeople.  ===Chapter 2=== :''In which Grace follows Tom's plan and embarks upon physical labor'' On Tom's suggestion, Grace offers to do chores for the citizens—talking to the lonely, blind Jack McKay, helping to run the small shop, looking after the children of Chuck and Vera, and so forth. After some initial reluctance, the people accept her help in doing those chores that "nobody really needs" but which nevertheless make their lives easier. As a result, she becomes an accepted part of the community.  ===Chapter 3=== :''In which Grace indulges in a shady piece of provocation.'' In tacit agreement Grace is expected to continue her chores, which she does gladly, and is even paid small wages which she saves up to purchase a set of seven expensive porcelain figurines, one at a time, from Ma Ginger's shop. Grace begins to make friends, including Jack, who pretends that he is not blind. She earns his respect upon tricking him into admitting that he is blind. Once the two weeks are over, everyone votes at the town meeting that Grace should be allowed to stay.  ===Chapter 4=== :''Happy times in Dogville'' Things go well in Dogville until the police arrive to place a "Missing" poster featuring Grace's picture and name on the mission house. With the townspeople divided as to whether they should cooperate with the police, the mood of the community darkens somewhat.  ===Chapter 5=== :''Fourth of July after all'' Still, things continue as usual until the [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] celebrations. After Tom awkwardly admits his love to Grace which she reciprocates and the whole town expresses their agreement that it has become a better place thanks to her, the police arrive again to replace the "Missing" poster with a "Wanted" poster. Grace is now wanted for participation in a bank robbery. Everyone agrees that she must be innocent, since at the time the robbery took place, she was doing chores for the townspeople every day.  Nevertheless, Tom argues that because of the increased risk to the town now that they are harboring someone who is wanted as a criminal, Grace should provide a [[quid pro quo]] and do more chores for the townspeople within the same time, for less pay. At this point, what was previously a voluntary arrangement takes on a slightly coercive nature as Grace is clearly uncomfortable with the idea. Still, being very amenable and wanting to please Tom, Grace agrees.  ===Chapter 6=== :''In which Dogville bares its teeth'' At this point the situation worsens, as with her additional workload, Grace inevitably makes mistakes, and the people she works for seem to be equally irritated by the new schedule—and take it out on Grace. The situation slowly escalates, with the male citizens making small sexual advances to Grace and the females becoming increasingly abusive. Even the children are perverse: Jason, the 10-year-old son of Chuck and Vera, asks Grace to spank him, until she finally complies after much provocation (von Trier has noted that this is the first point in the film where it is clear how completely Grace's lack of social status and choices makes her vulnerable to other people manipulating her).<ref>von Trier in the dvd audio commentary track, Ch.6</ref> The hostility towards Grace finally reaches a turning point as well when Chuck rapes her in his home.  ===Chapter 7=== :''In which Grace finally gets enough of Dogville, leaves the town, and again sees the light of day.'' That evening, Grace tells Tom what had happened and he starts to form a plan for her escape. The next day, Vera confronts Grace for spanking her son Jason and Liz informs her that a few people saw Tom leave her shack very late the night before, casting suspicions on her virtue. The next evening she is confronted again by Vera, Liz and Martha in her shack. Martha witnessed a sexual encounter between Chuck and her in the apple orchard. Vera blames her for seducing her husband and decides to punish Grace by destroying the figurines. Grace begs her to spare them and tries to remind Vera of all the good things she has done for her including teaching her children the philosophy of [[stoicism]]. Vera cruelly uses it against her while destroying the figurines she worked hard for. Grace goes to Tom that evening and they decide to bribe the freight truck driver Ben to smuggle her out of town in his truck. En route, she is raped by Ben, after which the truck lumbers only to return Grace to Dogville.  The town agrees that they must not let her escape again. The money paid to Ben to help Grace escape had been stolen by Tom from his father—but when Grace is blamed for the theft, Tom refuses to admit he did it because, as he explains, this is the only way he can still protect Grace without people getting suspicious. So Grace finally becomes a slave: she is chained, repeatedly raped, and abused by the people of the town. She is also humiliated by the children who ring the church bell every time she is violated, much to Tom's disgust.  ===Chapter 8=== :''In which there is a meeting where the truth is told and Tom leaves (only to return later).'' This culminates in a late night general assembly in which Grace—following Tom's suggestion—relates calmly all that she has endured from everyone in town, then heads back to her shack. Embarrassed and in complete denial, the townspeople finally decide to get rid of her. As Tom tells Grace this, declaring his allegiance to her over the town, he attempts to make love to her. Still chained, she responds to his advances by saying "...lt would be so beautiful, but from the point of view of our love so completely wrong. We were to meet in freedom."<ref>http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/dogville-script-transcript-nicole-kidman.html</ref> She questions if thoughts of using force against her are in fact why he is so upset, noting that he could have her if he wants—all he needs to do is threaten her to get his way, as the others have done. Tom defends his intentions as pure, but upon reflection realizes that what she says is true. Shaken by self-doubt, he decides it would jeopardize his career as a philosopher if this doubt were allowed to grow. To rid himself of its source, he decides to personally call the mobsters and turn Grace over.  ===Chapter 9 and ending=== :''In which Dogville receives the long-awaited visit and the film ends'' When the mobsters finally arrive, they are welcomed cordially by Tom and an impromptu committee of other townspeople. Grace is then freed by the indignant henchmen, and we finally learn who she really is: the daughter of a powerful gang leader who ran away because she could not stand her father's dirty work. Her father motions her into his [[Cadillac]] and argues with her about issues of morality. After some introspection, Grace reverses herself and comes to the conclusion that Dogville's crimes cannot be excused due to the difficulty of their circumstances. Tom, who has become aware that the mobsters pose a threat to himself and the town, is momentarily remorseful, but rapidly descends into rationalization for his actions. Grace returns, sadly, to her father's car, accepts his power, and uses it to command that Dogville be removed from the earth.  Grace tells the gangsters to make Vera watch her children die, as punishment for destroying her figurines. Dogville is burned to the ground and all of its inhabitants brutally massacred with the exception of Tom, whom she executes personally with a revolver right after he applauds the effectiveness of her use of illustration as an attempt to get her to spare him. After the massacre, the gangsters hear a barking sound from one of the houses. It is the dog Moses. A gangster aims a gun at the dog, but Grace commands that it should live: 'He's just angry because I once took his bone'. The chalk drawing of Moses becomes a real dog as his barks lead into the credits.  
Le Divorce
 Isabel Walker ([[Kate Hudson]]) travels to Paris to visit her sister Roxy ([[Naomi Watts]]), a poet who lives with her husband, Frenchman Charles-Henri de Persand ([[Melvil Poupaud]]), and their young daughter, Gennie. Roxy is pregnant, but her husband has just walked out on her without explanation. Isabel discovers that he has a mistress, a Russian woman named Magda Tellman, whom he intends to marry after securing a divorce from Roxy. Roxy refuses to divorce him.  Roxy is also in possession of a painting of [[Saint Ursula]] by [[Georges de La Tour]]; the painting belongs to the Walker family, but due to her marriage to Charles-Henri and French community property laws, the ownership is disputed between the two families. The [[Louvre]] deems the painting worthless and concludes that it is not a real La Tour. However, the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]] takes an interest in the painting and its curator believes that the painting was done by La Tour himself.  Paris-based American author Olivia Pace ([[Glenn Close]]), a friend of Roxy's, offers Isabel a job. Isabel also meets Yves ([[Romain Duris]]), Olivia's protégé, and they begin dating. The sisters visit Charles-Henri's family's country home for Sunday [[brunch]], where Isabel meets Charles-Henri's mother Suzanne ([[Leslie Caron]]), and her handsome middle-aged brother-in-law, Edgar ([[Thierry Lhermitte]]). Isabel is attracted to the older, wealthy and married Edgar and they begin an affair, although Isabel continues to string Yves along. Edgar begins to send Isabel various gifts, including an expensive red Kelly bag by Hermès, which Isabel carries with her at all times. During a visit to Isabel, Suzanne discovers the Kelly bag, after which she realizes that Edgar is having an affair with Isabel.  Charles-Henri maintains a blasé attitude about his infidelity and insists on a divorce. He also hopes to benefit from the French community property laws in the divorce, especially with regard to the La Tour painting. His mistress Magda is married to a man named Tellman ([[Matthew Modine]]), who begins to stalk and harass Isabel and Roxy, believing the latter to be responsible for his wife's desertion. Charles-Henri's cruelty and insensitivity take their toll on Roxy, and she attempts suicide in late pregnancy. She survives and is supported by Isabel and her lawyer Bertram.  Roxy and Isabel's family arrive from the US to support the sisters, and to also discuss the divorce proceedings and the ownership of the La Tour painting. Things are further complicated when Edgar's wife, Amélie, discovers the affair through Suzanne. Following a brunch with both families, Suzanne and Amélie privately inform Isabel's mother about the affair; she later confronts Isabel with this information.  During an outing, Magda and Charles-Henri tease Tellman with their new relationship. Later, they are both murdered by Tellman in a [[crime of passion]], with Charles-Henri's body being found in Roxy's apartment complex. Roxy and Bertram come upon the scene and the stress causes her to go into labor. Tellman then follows Isabel and her family on an outing to the [[Eiffel Tower]], where he corners them and pulls a gun, demanding an opportunity to explain to Roxy why he killed her husband. After some persuasion, the distraught Tellman releases the gun to Isabel, who puts it into the Kelly bag and throws it off the Eiffel Tower.  Edgar, persuaded by his socially conscious family's concern, and tiring of his young lover, casually ends his affair with Isabel with a gift of Hermès scarf and a lunch. Afterwards, Isabel begins a real relationship with Yves. After Roxy's baby is born, she marries Bertram. The family attends an art auction where the La Tour painting sells to The Getty for 4.5 million Euros. Because its ownership is no longer disputed due to Charles-Henri's death, the money goes to the Walker family, who then go on to establish the "Fondation Sainte Ursule" (The Saint Ursula Foundation).

He's even gone so far as to join a support group for virginal men, but this type of reinforcement still can't make him a hit with the ladies. When he seeks the help of a sex guru named Pheb ([[Josh Holloway]]), who actually teaches a private class to help socially inept men learn how to please the opposite sex, Ben's luck changes drastically. He begins to take advantage of his patients (with their consent) and quickly sheds the derisive slang labels of "lork" and "sooser."

Down with Love
 New in [[New York City]], in 1962, Barbara Novak arrives at Banner House to present her new work, ''Down with Love'', a book the intent of which is to free women from love, teach them to enjoy sex without commitment, and to replace the need for a man with things such as chocolate. Following her rules would, she believes, help to give women a boost in the workplace and in the world in general.  The men who run Banner House refuse to support the book. But Vikki Hiller, Barbara's editor, has an idea to promote the book, and that's for Barbara to meet Catcher Block – a successful writer for the magazine ''Know'' and a notorious "ladies' man, man's man, man about town" – but he avoids her repeatedly by postponing their dates until she gets fed up, insults him, and walks out.  Catcher's boss and best friend, Peter McMannus, and Vicky take a liking to one another. However, their relationship revolves around Barbara and Catcher, and neither is brave enough to express their feelings for the other. Peter feels overshadowed by Catcher's strong personality, and Vicky wants to see strength in her lover. She even assumes Peter must be gay.  Barbara starts promoting her book with Vicky's help, and things take off when they get [[Judy Garland]] to sing the song "[[Down with Love (song)|Down with Love]]" as a promotion to the book on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Sales skyrocket, as housewives and women around the world buy the book and rebel against their men; Catcher now wants to meet Barbara, but now it is ''she'' who rejects ''him''.  It all comes to a boiling point when Barbara appears on a national TV show talking about a chapter from the book – "The Worst Kind of Man" – and cites Catcher Block as the perfect example. His date rejects him, which infuriates him. Catcher swears he will prove Barbara is the same as every other woman, wanting the same things men do.  He arranges for a casual meeting at a drycleaners, taking advantage of the fact that Barbara has never met or seen him, and he poses as an astronaut, Major Zip Martin, attentive and polite. Barbara appears to be immediately infatuated with this man who seemingly has no idea who she is, in contrast to men who now avoid her, viewing her as the enemy since the publication of her book.  "Zip" takes her to the most fashionable locations in New York while maintaining considerable sexual tension between them by feigning naivete and a desire to remain chaste until he is "ready" for a physical relationship. But he starts falling for her, and it gets harder to go through with his plan.  When Barbara finds Catcher/Zip at a party he is almost caught out, and decides it is time to take everything to the next level: he tells Barbara that Catcher Block wants to interview him for an exposé on the [[NASA]] space program and asks her to accompany him. It is his own apartment and he sets everything up to record her saying she loves him. But then it is she who reveals the truth: she knew he was really Catcher from the beginning, but she also lied as she is not Barbara Novak but Nancy Brown, once one of Catcher's many secretaries, who fell in love with him whilst working at ''Know'', but who turned him down when he asked her out because she did not want to be just another one in his long list of romances.  She tells him she did this to be different from all the women he knew, and make him love her. They both realize that Catcher does love her, but as he is proposing, one of his many lovers appears and thanks Barbara for what she's done for womankind. Barbara realizes that she does not want love or him as she has become a real "down with love" girl. Vicky and Peter's relationship also changes when she insults him for helping Catcher. Peter realizes he is indeed like any other man and takes Vikki to Catcher's apartment to take things to the next level.  Days later, Catcher is completely depressed; all his efforts to win Barbara back have failed. Even his exposé is ruined now that Barbara has told her story in her own magazine, ''Now''. Peter is also depressed as his relationship with Vicky is now apparently based only on sex.

Dot the i
 Carmen, a young [[Spanish people|Spanish]] woman who is engaged to be married, has her [[hen night]] at a French restaurant in London. She is invited to participate in the observance of an old custom which allows her to kiss the stranger of her choice before the marriage, symbolically "kissing her single life goodbye" and bringing luck for the future.  The man she chooses is Kit and both enjoy the kiss far more than they have intended. They fall in love, which creates a "[[love triangle]]" among Carmen, her fiancé Barnaby, and Kit.    What initially appears to be a typical urban love story begins to take some surprising and dark twists. In the third act, it is revealed that the circumstances have been arranged in order to create an "emotional [[snuff film]]". Unbeknownst to Carmen, she has been cast as the female lead in this endeavor. Barnaby has hired Kit to play a part in the deception, but has misled him by neglecting to mention that he himself, the director, will take on the role of Carmen's fiancé (Kit believing that the couple know nothing of the film). Barnaby is apparently unscrupulous, as he actually marries Carmen for the sake of the film and later fakes a violent suicide (his motive being that Carmen will never love him as she does Kit). In a state of shock, she returns to Kit, who is also horrified, guilty, and never having met the husband, still in the dark as to the true identity of a man he knows only as "Ford". He admits to Carmen that he has been paid by a man to seduce her for a film, and that he regrets it immensely.  Barnaby, whom Kit recognizes as his employer, suddenly appears, offering Kit his final pay and removing camera equipment he previously has concealed in the actor's [[bedsit]] without his knowledge. With contemptible satisfaction, he unravels his entire plan to the shocked, broken pair and bitterly ridicules them before leaving.  Several months later, as the film is about to open, Barnaby appears to have won Carmen back. For a ceremony during which he is to accept a filmmakers' award, he engineers a publicity stunt by which it appears that Kit will have the ultimate revenge. However, Carmen takes advantage of the opportunity to do in her manipulative husband for real while framing his business partners for murder. Tragedy generates sensation and, while its clueless producers await trial, the film enjoys a big opening at which Carmen and Kit arrive in style, together.  
Doppelganger (2003 film)
 At a medical instrument manufacturing company, timid engineering scientist Michio Hayasaki ([[Kōji Yakusho]]) struggles to develop a robotic chair that could mobilise a clinically paralysed person. He realises he's not getting anywhere with it--not while his company keeps making demands and issuing deadlines on him. Highly stressed, he bitterly realises he doesn't have the courage to bite back.  Whilst arriving home from work, he's startled to find himself waiting on his doorstep. He soon sees it's not him, but a man who's the spitting image of him. Fearing he's having a mental breakdown, he wonders whether a legend that says one is destined to die soon after seeing own doppelganger may be true. His apparent twin (also Kōji Yakusho) smoothly assures him that he has nothing to fear. He's a [[doppelganger]]. Bemused, Hayasaki invites him to his home.  He eventually notices that while his doppelganger is identical to his looks, mannerisms and speech, the doppelganger's personality and attitude are drastically different from his own. Where he's too timid to get what he wants, his doppelganger has no qualms in getting what it wants. Where he's too afraid to speak out, his doppelganger speaks its mind. Where he's moderate with drinking, the doppelganger indulges heavily. Where he's detail-oriented, it doesn't pay much attention to details as it is more concerned with the end result.  As his doppelganger removes all sources of Hayasaki's stress, reorganises his life for better, acquires all things he's yielded for, does rebellious things Hayasaki couldn't do, and assists with building the robotic chair that frustrates him for so long, Hayasaki learns to enjoy his doppelganger's seemingly nihilistic actions.  He soon wonders whether his doppelganger has an agenda when he realises he's being dragged into madness.

He is a double agent, and when he contacts Yun at the radio station, she is to be his handler.  Although Yun no longer has a job at the radio station, they are able to maintain contact when Baek's wife, a churchgoing acquaintance of Yun's, sets Rim up with Yun with the approval of Baek who has been wanting Rim to settle down.

In doing so, they uncover a link to Yun, who is identified by Baek.

One night, Jonesy sees Duddits beckoning him to cross the street, but as he does so Jonesy is hit by a car. His injuries heal with mysterious speed and six months later he is able to make it for the group's annual trip. Jonesy rescues a man lost in the forest named Rick McCarthy. He is very ill, so Jonesy and Beaver let him rest and recover inside their cabin. Suddenly, all the forest animals run past their cabin in the same direction; it is implied fear is the motivation as predator and prey flee together, followed by two military helicopters that announce the area is now quarantined. Jonesy and Beaver return to the cabin to find a trail of blood from the bedroom to the bathroom, where Rick is sitting semi-catatonic on the toilet, which is now covered in blood. Rick is pushed off the toilet, falling, dead, into the tub as a three-foot long [[lamprey]] like creature writhes and screams in the toilet. Beaver attempts to trap the creature under the toilet lid, but the creature breaks out and kills him. Jonesy tries to escape but is confronted by a large alien called Mr. Gray, who [[Spirit possession|possesses]] Jonesy's body and emits a red-dust around the entire cabin.  Nearby, Henry and Pete crash their SUV to avoid running over a frostbitten woman from Rick's original hunting party. Henry walks for help while Pete stays with the woman. She dies and also excretes a worm, which Pete barely manages to kill. Mr. Gray tricks and kidnaps Pete, but Jonesy telepathically warns Henry to stay hidden. Henry returns to the cabin to find Beaver dead and the worm that killed him laying a group of eggs. To kill all of the alien larvae, he sets fire to the cabin.  Meanwhile, an elite military unit specializing in extraterrestrials, led by the slightly unhinged Colonel Abraham Curtis, seeks to contain everyone exposed to the aliens. Col. Curtis is planning to retire after this operation and will pass command, along with a pearl-handled stainless-steel .45 pistol, to Captain Owen Underhill, his trusted friend and second in command. The two lead an air-strike into a large forest clearing where the aliens' spaceship has crash-landed. The aliens use telepathy to ask for mercy, but the helicopters massacre most of the aliens with mini-guns and missiles. The alien ship self-destructs, destroying the remaining aliens and two helicopters.  Jonesy retraces his memories of the area while watching Mr. Gray use his body. Mr. Gray tries to coerce Pete into cooperating but bites him in half when he refuses. Jonesy realizes that Mr. Gray possessed him, not by chance, but to access past memories of Duddits which he needs. Henry arrives at the fenced-in concentration camp only to realize that Col. Curtis plans to kill all of those quarantined. Henry convinces Underhill to prevent this by going over Curtis' head and having him relieved. Later, Henry uses Underhill's gun as a phone.  Henry and Underhill break out of the camp and head to Duddits' home. Duddits, who is dying of leukemia, informs them Mr. Gray is headed for the [[Quabbin Reservoir]] to seed the water with alien larvae. Curtis, realizing the danger looming to the entire planet, leaves the camp in his armed helicopter and tracks down Henry, Underhill, and Duddits via a micro-chip in the pistol. At the reservoir, Underhill is mortally wounded and dies shortly after he shoots Curtis down.  In the reservoir's pump house, Henry uses Underhill's machine gun to kill Mr. Gray's worm but cannot decide if Jonesy is possessed. Duddits confronts Mr. Gray, who finally exits Jonesy's body. The two struggle as Duddits reveals himself to also be an alien of a different race. Both aliens explode in a cloud of red-dust which briefly resembles a [[dreamcatcher]]. Jonesy, now himself again, steps on the final alien larva before it can escape and contaminate the reservoir.

This leads her to alert her boyfriend Lowell, who is suffering from an ultimately fatal degenerative sickness. Lowell claims a wealthy investor wants to fund their research into the mysterious corpse.  On their heels is Father Uffizi, seemingly the [[Holy See|Vatican]]'s official vampire hunter. He has been given the task of not only killing Dracula, but granting him [[absolution]] (as the Church realizes that Dracula is in fact [[Judas Iscariot]]), which would allow the vampire to rest in peace. Unbeknownst to the Church, Uffizi has been infected with vampirism after being scratched by a fang during in a previous hunt.  Each day he exposes himself to the sun, burning out the vampiric infection while he screams in pain.  Luke doubts that Dracula is a purely natural phenomenon. He surrounds the now-awake vampire with folkloric wards like mustard seeds and knots. Meanwhile, Elizabeth feels increasingly strange as the infection in her grows, as does her attraction/bond to Dracula. Another member of the team injects himself with Dracula's blood and becomes a vampire, setting out to feed. He kills a woman, making her undead like himself. Uffizi finds and kills them both.  Lowell reveals that there is no "secret investor" and that he used Elizabeth and the others to find a cure for himself. An injection "cures" him, but he survives mere moments before Uffizi arrives. Uffizi tells Elizabeth, now on the verge of becoming a vampire herself, to enter the sunlight and burn away her vampirism. Eric, a member of the team turned by Dracula, attacks the group but is killed with holy water by Luke. Uffizi goes after a now-free Dracula, telling Luke will make a great vampire hunter someday.  Uffizi catches up with Dracula, who taunts him with the knowledge that Elizabeth will simply die and Uffizi knows it. In his weakened state, Dracula is not quite a match physically for Uffizi. The priest manages to get a whip around Dracula's neck and begins the rite of absolution. Dracula then taunts Uffizi with images of Christ's betrayal and [[Crucifixion of Jesus Christ|crucifixion]], and insinuates that he turned Christ into a vampire.

Dragon Head
  ===Arc 1: Escape from the tunnels=== Teru Aoki (青木 輝), the main protagonist, on a train to Tokyo after a school trip. Just before his train enters a tunnel, Teru briefly sees something in the distance, though he doesn't understand what he saw. Soon after entering the tunnel, a powerful earthquake derails the train and blocks both sides of the tunnel with rubble. Knocked unconscious during the derailment, when he reawakens Teru finds, much to his horror, that all of his teachers and classmates have died in the crash. Wandering the wrecked wagons of the train, he finds Nobuo Takahashi (高橋 のぶお), a highly unnerved boy who apparently was being bullied at school, and Ako Seto (瀬戸 憧子), who is unconscious and wounded.   Teru treats Ako, who wakes up after several days. While they find temporary shelter in the dining wagon, Nobuo gives in to fear and declares that "something" is lurking in the tunnel with them. Nobuo's mental state deteriorates to the point where he claims the wrecked train for himself, forcing Teru and Ako to build a makeshift shelter outside in the tunnel. After days pass with no sign of rescue, Teru tries to find an escape route and ventures into a partially collapsed ventilation shaft. Meanwhile, Nobuo becomes deranged, paints his body as if he was a primitive savage, and mutilates the corpse of a teacher thinking he's still alive. He kidnaps Ako and almost [[rape]]s her, though she manages to escape.   In the ventilation shafts, Teru is suddenly hit by a powerful stream of contaminated water, which saves him from a previous cave-in that almost buries him alive, and the shaft collapses while the tunnel is rocked by more powerful tremors. In the chaos, amidst falling rocks and choking steam, Teru notices Ako being chased by a crazed Nobuo and comes to the girl's rescue. Despite getting stabbed in the shoulder, Teru manages to overcome and defeat Nobuo before almost killing him with a rock. However, he and Ako soon escape after the tunnel starts collapsing and, incredibly, [[lava]] begins flowing in it. They succeed in escaping through the ventilation shafts, but Nobuo is left behind in the darkness and is never seen again.  ===Arc 2: Searching for allies=== Teru and Ako surface in the ruins of a wastewater treatment plant. They find that the landscape is covered by a thick layer of [[volcanic ash|dense ash]], and the sky is filled with clouds thick enough to almost blot out sunlight. A functioning television reveals to them that society has collapsed and that most cities have been taken over by looters. Ako follows someone to a hospital where they are helped by a group of teenage survivors. Ako and Teru initially follow this group to Tokyo, but decide to leave after witnessing them wounding themselves and dancing amidst dead cattle.   During the trek they are almost killed by a sudden [[mudslide]], and soon after they see a squadron of military helicopters in the sky above them. Following the direction of the helicopters, they arrive to a deserted town. Exploring it, Teru gets separated from Ako after he notices a helicopter and, thinking they can be rescued, goes investigating. Aboard the helicopter are Captain Nimura (仁村), pilot Iwada (岩田), and crewmen Yamazaki (山崎) and Ōike (大池). While Iwada seems to be a voice of reason, Nimura is an unprofessional loose cannon and chases away Teru when he begs them for help. Meanwhile, Ako encounters Yamazaki, who left the rest of the crew in search of fuel.  Seeing Yamazaki return wounded and now knowing there's a girl in town, Nimura and Ōike grab their guns and start searching for her. The stress of the situation, the urge to defend Ako and the hatred for the soldiers briefly cause Teru to "give in to the darkness" as Nobuo did, preparing [[Molotov cocktail]] in hiding. After Nimura and Ōike separate in their search, the latter finds Teru in a crazed state. He tries to reason with him, before noticing the petrol bomb in his hand and trying to disarm him. Teru's grip slips and the petrol bomb crashes at Ōike's feet, burning him to death. Teru then confronts Nimura, though the situation is cut short by a huge [[conflagration]] which starts burning down the town. Ako fends off Yamazaki, grabs hold of his gun and forces him to take her to the helicopter.  The conflagration quickly becomes a powerful [[firestorm]]. At the schoolyard where the helicopter landed, Iwada and Ako take off, leaving Yamazaki behind to be burned alive enormous [[fire whirl|fire tornadoes]]. Nimura and Teru almost share the same fate if not for Ako's insistence to rescue them. They are saved in the nick of time when Iwada lands the helicopter near them and takes them aboard. The group leaves the town, now completely engulfed in flames.  ===Arc 3: Izu peninsula=== After Teru falls unconscious due to his injuries, the helicopter gets lost in a massive, thick [[ash cloud]]. Because it's impossible to fly directly through the cloud without damaging the helicopter's engine, they decide to take a detour through the [[Izu peninsula]]. Iwada worries about the lack of fuel, wondering if they even have enough to reach Izu. Before they can gather much, the road starts to collapse into the sea and they have to fly away.  In Izu, is greeted by a survivor who tells them that a [[tsunami]] hit, reaching far inland, and that the main town has been taken over by looters. The survivor, who has medical training, tells them Teru has [[tetanus]], due to the untreated wound inflicted to him by Nobuo. Iwada repairs the helicopter while Ako and Nimura, much to his annoyance, go to the town searching for medicine and fuel. To keep Nimura from doing anything dangerous, he is given weapons but no ammunition, which Ako carries instead, to give him only in emergencies. They are also given radios to remain in contact with Iwada.  As Ako and Nimura have to camp out for the night, they briefly see lights in the distance. The next day, they find mutilated bodies at a nearby lake as well as a frightened young man and his companion, a seemingly disabled boy with strange scars on his head. Inhabitants from the town appear and attack them in a frenzy. The silent boy gets badly burned on his arm, but incredibly doesn't make a sound, as if completely numb to pain. A policeman shoots and wounds Nimura, and he, Ako and the scarred boy are brought to the town.  Ako and Nimura find that the town has been barricaded to prevent those inside from escaping, and that due to the tsunami, Izu has now become an island separated from mainland Japan. This isolation has left the survivors without food and, due to the dire circumstances, has driven them to go mad and murder their relatives, with plans to stage a [[mass suicide]]. However, the sight of Ako makes them even more crazed, wanting to sacrifice her before their kill themselves. Fortunately, Nimura, Ako and the scarred boy, Kikuchi, manage to escape from the mob, though they can't leave town.  The trio run to a building filled with gasoline, where the mob plans to kill themselves in a makeshift [[funeral pyre]]. They manage to reach the town's hospital, though in the process Ako has to kill some of the townspeople to defend herself. There, Ako and Nimura briefly barricade themselves, and she finds the much-needed medicine for Teru. As Ako tries to find out an escape route, she notices that Kikuchi has wandered off. When she finds him, he mentions a certain painting believed to be related to the events, and calls himself Dragon Head.  Soon after, the trio are cornered in the hospital by the townspeople. Nimura and Ako fight them off and escape on a motorcycle, while Kikuchi is left alone and beaten by one of the aggressors. However, Kikuchi scares off his attacker when he doesn't die of his injuries, and mocks everyone for the fear they feel. Nimura, on the other hand, explains that he looks out only for himself, but says that he is different from the townspeople — he is afraid to die, unlike them.  Meanwhile, a smaller group of townspeople find the radio in the forest and call Iwada, pretending to have hostages. They lure Iwada to their location and attempt to commandeer his helocopter. He is forced to land, but while they argue over who gets to fly away, he dispatches them with a [[rocket launcher]]. He takes off again to the town, but he is wounded when one of the invaders manages to enter the helicopter and shoots one of his ears off with a gunshot. Iwada fends him off and resumes his flight.  Ako and Nimura climb to the top of the pyre building just as the ash cloud moves over the Izu peninsula. Iwada reaches them and they manage to load fuel barrels on the helicopter before leaving. As the town is completely engulfed in the massive cloud, a townsperson ignites the pyre and blows the building up, burning to death with the other survivors. As they fly away, Teru's group sees Kikuchi on the rooftop, on fire and showing no expression, a sight that greatly disturbs Ako.  After the group finds a safe place to hand at the home of an anonymous woman, Ako treats Teru. The two agree to stick together and look for their families in Tokyo. Remembering the words from Kikuchi, Ako reaches a nearby building where, reading through some books, manages to link the "painting" he spoke about to [[Mount Fuji]].  Everyone comes with them except for the woman, who warns Teru and Ako not to give in to fear and that fear itself can be faced and conquered.  ===Arc 4: Discovery=== With the helicopter's engine now able to withstand the ash cloud, the group decides to try through it. On the other side, they find a darkened wasteland covered by rivers of lava, and see the wrecks of Nimura's helicopter squadron. Mount Fuji has vanished, and in its place they find a gigantic crater. They dare to fly inside the hole to see how deep it goes, but ascend when they are overcome by fear. Considering the environmental conditions, the group theorizes that Mount Fuji has either suffered a catastrophic [[volcanic eruption]] or has been hit by a [[meteor]].  Flying through the ash cloud again, the group find themselves in a location where the sky is brighter, and the ash falling is almost snow-like. They land on top of a shopping mall to search for supplies. Unfortunately, the place has already been looted and it is dangerously unstable. They leave when a powerful [[tornado]] forms nearby and moves in the direction of the mall. In the ensuing chaos, Iwada, Ako and Nimura manage to take off in the helicopter while the roof of the mall collapses beneath Teru. He survives by hiding in an elevator, where he falls unconscious.  When Teru wakes up, he comes across the wreck of the helicopter and a makeshift grave for Iwada, who died in the crash. Although initially overcome by despair, Teru looks inside the helicopter and finds and a note from Ako, which tells him that she and Nimura are heading for Tokyo on foot. Hopeful to see Ako again, Teru embarks on the long trek to follow them. Along the way, he makes a strange encounter with a wounded man, who incoherently babbles about Tokyo being both Hell and Heaven, how he wants to escape from there, and how he wants to go back. In a fit of madness, the man runs away and falls off a cliff. After giving him a hasty burial, Teru resumes his journey arrives in ruined Tokyo.  ===Arc 5: Tokyo ruins=== Teru wanders through the corpse-littered streets of Tokyo, clinging to the hope of finding other human brings. Distraught and tired, Teru stops near the entrance to the subway, where he briefly hears a voice. Following the source, Teru finds that someone has put radios in the subway tunnels, which all repeat a garbled message. Deeper into the underground, the boy finds a man-made cave that leads him to another station, under which lava is flowing. Terrified, Teru goes even deeper, and finds himself in a massive warehouse where a group of survivors, led by a self-declared scientist, have stockpiled supplies. Many members of his group are covered with self-inflicted wounds, while others are painted and armed like Nobuo.   The scientist explains that the group's supplies are experimental compounds which numb fear. After consuming them for a prolonged period of time, the survivors of his group stopped feeling fear completely and, longing for it again, started wounding themselves. Disturbed by what he sees and hears, Teru leaves the group and makes his way to the surface. Teru finds his now-collapsed apartment building, where he finds another note left by Ako urging him to go to their school. Meanwhile, the scientist's group attacks a patrol of foreign soldiers, and a fleet of ships from another country is seen anchored in what was once Tokyo Bay.  Teru reaches the school meets Ako and Nimura, but Nimura pulls a gun on him and says he is taking Ako for himself. He holds Teru at gunpoint, and Teru opines that without fear — either by being numbed to it, or just never needing it — life is lessened. Unnerved, Nimura declares that he saw the graves where the victims of the disaster were collected, and among whom were Teru's whole family. He then shoots Teru before being subdued by both him and Ako. Teru discharges Nimura's gun in the air and leaves him alive before leaving with Ako. Nimura, alone, is left wondering about himself.  Foreign soldiers storm Tokyo and are attacked by the survivor group. The scientist, now holding a pair of severed heads, says to a soldier that he helped bring about the [[apocalypse]]. A document discovered by other soldiers indicates that three [[nuclear weapon]]s were on Japanese soil, that the governments of Japan and other nations have vanished, and that no one seems to know exactly caused the catastrophe. During the chaos, a volcano suddenly emerges in what was once central Tokyo. Teru and Ako sit together and watch the volcano, and Teru reflects that the world is what you make of it, and that even with the world in ruins good or evil still both have chances to triumph, leaving a faint glimmer of hope for things to adjust themselves in the future.  
Dreamkeeper
 The film opens with Eagle Boy, a young man who is on a vision quest. It then cuts to the present, where a 17-year-old Lakota named Shane Chasing Horse is living on the Pine Ridge reservation. He is in trouble because he owes some money to a local gang—money he used to buy a beautiful ring for Mae Little Wounded, a girl he likes. Meanwhile, his mother asks him to drive his grandfather, Pete Chasing Horse, a storyteller, down to the powwow. Shane is reluctant. However, when the gang comes after him, Shane changes his mind and heads out to the powwow with his grandfather, who agrees to give him his truck once they reach the powwow. Grandfather tells Shane the story of a young Lakota man who tries to win the hand of Bluebird Woman. He also tells the story of how a thunder spirit falls in love with a Mohawk woman and brings her up into the ethereal world of Sky Woman, and of how she raised their son back in her village until he was struck by one of the villagers and brought back to live with his father.  Later, when a young redheaded man who is eager to learn about Native culture and hoping to be adopted by a Native American family asks to ride with them to the powwow, Shane says no. His grandfather then tells him the Kiowa story of Tehan, a white man who lived among the Kiowa and fought bravely alongside them, and Shane relents and lets the redhead ride with them. Shane’s grandfather then tells how Eagle Boy follows the advice of a shining spirit elk, and seeks out an old woman who can give him weapons with which to slay the mighty serpent [[Unhcegila|Uncegila]]. He is repulsed when the ugly old woman embraces him, but reacts quite differently when she transforms into a beautiful younger woman. She reproaches him, but gives him what he needs. Eagle Boy slays Uncegila, whose heart instructs him and grants him great power and prophetic visions.  Eventually, the gang members who are after Shane catch up with them, but accidentally drive their car off a cliff and into the Rio Grande River while chasing him. Shane dives in and saves them, and his struggle is contrasted with Eagle Boy’s underwater battle with Uncegila. The gang members ride with them for a ways, until they and the redheaded hitchhiker leave them in order to travel with a group of attractive young women who are also headed to the powwow.  As they travel, Shane’s grandfather tells Shane many other stories: several are about the trickster Coyote and [[Iktomi]] the spider. Another is about a young Pawnee man and his mother who are scorned by the rest of their tribe until the young man finds an unwanted dun pony who brings them good medicine. As Shane and his grandfather look up at the stars, the grandfather tells the story of the Quillwork Girl and her seven star brothers, which is about a Cheyenne girl who puts her faith in a dream and searches for seven brothers, but who must then contend with the Buffalo nation.  The next story is about a young Chinook woman who sacrifices herself in order to cure her village of a terrible sickness, and the next is about a young Blackfoot hunter who cannot let go of the memory of his father.  Shane and his grandfather continue their journey, losing their truck along the way and continuing on horseback and on foot. The two become closer. However, it then turns out that Shane’s grandfather has led them not to the powwow but to Shane’s father’s (Sam Chasing Horse) trailer home. Shane is outraged and disappointed to be tricked, but is persuaded to stay the night. The next morning Shane finally makes peace with his estranged father. However, he then becomes grief-stricken when he discovers that his grandfather had meanwhile died in his sleep. Shane decides to continue on to the powwow on horseback, and his father says that when Shane comes home he’ll be there too. The ending of Eagle Boy’s story is revealed: Eagle Boy decides that he wants to live like other men, and disobeys the heart by revealing it to the entire tribe (to whom it appears to be nothing more than an ordinary stone).  At the powwow, Shane takes on the role of a storyteller, and children gather around him to listen.

Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd
 In 1986, Harry Dunne ([[Derek Richardson (actor)|Derek Richardson]]) finally gets his chance to go to regular school. At the same time, Lloyd Christmas ([[Eric Christian Olsen]]) has been adopted and exchanged several times until he is finally accepted by the school janitor, Ray ([[Luis Guzmán]]). Harry bumps into Lloyd on the way to school, in search for a treasure his mother ([[Mimi Rogers]]) asked him to find, and as if it were destiny, the two instantly became the best of friends. Lloyd introduces Harry to his "friend", Turk ([[Elden Henson]]), the school bully whose main function in life appears to be making Lloyd's life miserable. After putting Lloyd in a trash can, he hoists the two friends up a flagpole.  Meanwhile, the corrupt Principal Collins ([[Eugene Levy]]) is searching for a way to get a large amount of money to get a condominium in [[Waikiki, Hawaii]] for him and his girlfriend, Ms. Heller ([[Cheri Oteri]]), the school's cafeteria lady. Seeing Harry and Lloyd getting hoisted on a flagpole, Principal Collins establishes a fake "[[special needs]]" class to swindle $100,000 from a former Special Needs student named Richard Moffit. Obviously, Harry and Lloyd are more than thrilled to help, unaware of the real reason, and thus find themselves signing up people who are "special" enough for the class. These include a reluctant Turk; a teen named Toby ([[Josh Braaten]]) who broke his leg and arm in a skateboarding accident—and whom Lloyd believes is a "little crippled boy"; Toby's gorgeous girlfriend, Terri ([[Teal Redmann]]); geeky Lewis ([[Shia LaBeouf]]), whom Harry and Lloyd believe is a [[centaur]] after seeing him half-dressed in his horse mascot uniform; Cindy ([[Michelle Krusiec]]), also known as "[[Ching chong|Ching-Chong]]," a [[Chinese language|Chinese]] [[student exchange program|exchange student]] who later becomes Turk's girlfriend; and Carl ([[William Lee Scott]]), a badly injured football player obsessed with his sport. Ms. Heller becomes the teacher of the fake class and holds it in Ray's tool shed.  Jessica Matthews ([[Rachel Nichols (actress)|Rachel Nichols]]), a headstrong student and reporter for the school paper, is suspicious of Principal Collins' sudden contribution. Jessica invites Harry over to her house for dinner and asks Harry for information. Harry, who thinks that she is flirting with him, turns to Lloyd for courtship tips. A repulsive disaster involving Jessica's bathroom and a melted [[chocolate bar]] that looks like feces makes her father ([[Bob Saget]]) freak out, inadvertently directing her attention to Lloyd. Soon, Harry and Lloyd get into a fight over Jessica, without her knowing it, which causes the duo's friendship to split. Inevitably, the two make amends when Harry and Lloyd realize that they were nothing without each other. They find Principal Collins' chest in his office which contains evidence of every scam he and Ms. Heller ever pulled.  The next day, Principal Collins finds his evidence chest missing, and Ms. Heller falsely accuses Jessica of taking it. Meanwhile, the Special Needs class builds a float of [[George Washington]] for the [[Thanksgiving]] Parade. However, after Lloyd and Harry discover the evidence in the chest, they change the float to look like Principal Collins instead. After the class discovers his evidence, they agree to use him as the float instead. They also plan on having it pulled by the class's [[Ward Body Works|special bus]]. Before bringing out the float, they call the police. During the parade, the superintendent of the school district has a police detective pose as Richard Moffit, so Principal Collins would take the grant. Eventually, the Special Needs class brings out their float and proves Principal Collins and Ms. Heller as thieves by putting their recordings over loudspeakers, therefore exposing their plot. Before Principal Collins and Ms. Heller escape with the money, they are arrested. Jessica is grateful for Harry and Lloyd and regards them as heroes. However, just like in [[Dumb and Dumber|the original film]], the duo's advances to Jessica are in vain, as it turns out that Jessica had a boyfriend. He commends Harry and Lloyd for exposing Collins' and Heller's plot and rides off with Jessica.  Harry and Lloyd vow never to fight and risk their friendship over a woman, but as they head home, they are approached by Fraida Felcher (Julia Costello) and her twin sister, Rita (Chandra Costello) in a red [[Ferrari 308 GTB/GTS|Ferrari 308 GTS]], who offer to take them to a huge girls' party. After another debate over which girl they want, Harry and Lloyd reject them and Fraida and Rita furiously drive off, splattering Harry with mud in the process. Jessica's father accidentally hits Harry with his [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], resulting in Harry getting the windshield and hood covered with mud. Jessica's father recognizes Harry and as he frantically thinks his car is covered in feces, Harry and Lloyd casually walk away.  
Duplex (film)
 Alex Rose (Ben Stiller) and Nancy Kendricks (Drew Barrymore) are a young, professional, married [[New York City|New York]] couple in search of their dream home. When they finally find the perfect Brooklyn brownstone, they are giddy with anticipation. The duplex is a dream come true, complete with multiple fireplaces, except for one thing: Mrs. Connelly (Eileen Essell), the old lady who lives on the [[rent control|rent-controlled]] top floor. Assuming she is elderly and ill, they take the apartment.  However, they soon realize that Mrs. Connelly is in fact an energetic senior who enjoys watching her television at top volume day and night and rehearsing in a [[brass band]]. As a writer, Alex is attempting to finish his novel against a looming deadline. However, he is interrupted daily by Mrs. Connelly's numerous demands and requests, and what begins as a nuisance quickly escalates into an all-out war. Alex and Nancy try to get Mrs. Connelly to move out, but she refuses. Next, they try to file a noise complaint against her, but discover that she has already gone to the police first and filed a harassing complaint against ''them''. Mrs. Connelly soon turns all of Alex and Nancy's friends against them by play-acting as the "poor, innocent, old lady" and makes it appear that the young couple are out to harm her.  When Nancy loses her job and Alex misses his deadline (all because of the old lady's antics) the pair are trapped at home together with Mrs. Connelly with no place to go. Their rage turns to homicidal fantasy as they plot ways to get rid of their manipulative, no-good neighbor. After peace overtures and a break-in lead to nothing, Alex and Nancy decide to hire a hitman, named Chick (James Remar), to kill her. However, his asking price for doing the hit is $25,000. Unable to initially come up with the money, Alex approaches his friend and fellow writer, Coop, to ask for a loan, but is rudely rebuffed. Desperate and needing the money in two days, they sell almost every possession they own to pay Chick who will do the hit on Christmas Eve. Chick does break into Mrs. Connelly's apartment as planned, but fails to kill her when she defends herself with her speargun by shooting him in the shoulder, forcing him to flee, and the couple in fact have to rescue the old woman when the struggle results in a fire in her apartment.  Accepting defeat, Alex and Nancy decide to evict themselves, but find out that the old woman has died right when they leave. Alex and Nancy, now with no jobs, friends, or money left, move away where they contemplate their strange encounters. But here the audience learns in a climatic plot twist that the realtor of the duplex, Kenneth (Harvey Fierstein) (revealed to be Mrs. Connelly's son) and the ill-tempered NYPD Officer Dan (Robert Wisdom) (Kenneth's gay lover) who had frequently harassed and distrusted the couple and always sided with Mrs. Connelly in her arguments with Alex and Nancy, and Mrs. Connelly herself (who is not in fact dead) have been doing this to others. This wicked and unethical trio have been running a mean-spirited, real-estate scam for several years: Kenneth sells the ground floor apartment only to good-natured young couples, then Mrs. Connelly, aided by the corrupt Officer Dan, harasses and destroys the young couple's lives, eventually forcing them to move out, and then faking Mrs. Connelly's own death so that the couple will never return and leaving Mrs. Connelly, Kenneth and Dan to collect and live off of the sales commission from the next occupants that buy the ground floor apartment. Alex and Nancy were Mrs. Connelly and her son's latest victims among so many.  At the conclusion, it is revealed in a voice-over by Alex that he and Nancy relocated to [[the Bronx]]. Like all of the other couples that the trio scammed, they never saw Mrs. Connelly or returned to Brooklyn again, nor did they ever find out about the scam they were the victims of. While Mrs. Connelly, Kenneth and Officer Dan continue their scam by targeting the next friendly young couple that moves into the ground-floor apartment right after Alex and Nancy move out, Alex used his unpleasant experience of living there as inspiration for writing his next book, titled "''Duplex''", which became a best-selling novel, saving Alex and Nancy from their life of poverty, and giving the film a semi-happy ending.

The school principal, Mr. Luce, cornered by Eric in a hallway, begs Eric to lower his weapon and talk to him, but Eric yells, "I ain't putting ''shit'' down!" and fires at him. He does speak to Mr. Luce, however; while he is doing so, he turns without warning to see an approaching Benny and shoots and kills him before Benny could stop Eric's attack. Eric turns back to Luce and warns him to take heed of what's happened from bullied students and initially lets Mr. Luce go, before smiling evilly and changing his mind by firing several shots down the hall that strike and kill the principal.  Alex enters the cafeteria, which is strewn with overturned chairs, backpacks, several dead bodies, and numerous abandoned half-eaten lunches, and sits down. Alex picks up a cup from an abandoned lunch and casually drinks from it. Eric meets up with him, and they have a brief conversation, which ends when Alex shoots Eric in mid-sentence. Alex leaves the cafeteria, showing no emotion over shooting Eric, and discovers Carrie and Nathan in a freezer. He tauntingly recites "[[Eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]" to them to decide whom he should kill first. The film then cuts to credits leaving the ending ambiguous.

When discovered at the [[Santa's workshop|workshop]], the elves name him "Buddy" because he is wearing "Little Buddy Diapers", and he is adopted by Papa Elf.  Buddy grows up at the North Pole believing he is an elf, but due to his human size is unable to keep up with the other elves and demoted to the demeaning job of toy testing. When Buddy overhears that he is a human, Papa Elf explains that Buddy was born to Walter Hobbs and Susan Wells, and given up for adoption. Susan subsequently died and Walter, who now works for a children's book publisher at the [[Empire State Building]] in [[New York City]], is unaware of Buddy's existence. Santa reveals, to Buddy's horror, that Walter is on the naughty list due to his selfishness, but suggests Buddy could help redeem him.  Buddy travels to New York where he has trouble adjusting to the customs of the cynical human world. Buddy finds his father at work, but Walter is incredulous and has security remove him. Taking a security guard's sarcastic suggestion literally, Buddy visits the [[Gimbels]] department store where the manager mistakes him for an employee. At the store's Santa Land, he meets Jovie, an unenthusiastic employee to whom he is instantly attracted. After hearing that Santa will be at the store the following day, Buddy spends the night decorating Santa Land. When Buddy realizes that the Gimbels Santa is not the real Santa, he confronts him and yanks the beard off his costume, resulting in a fight that lands Buddy in jail. Walter reluctantly bails him out and takes him to a doctor for a [[DNA profiling|DNA test]], which confirms that Buddy is Walter's son. The doctor convinces Walter to take Buddy home to meet his step mother Emily and twelve-year-old half brother Michael. Walter and Michael are put off by Buddy's odd behavior, but Emily insists that they care for him until he "recovers".  Buddy and Michael become friends after defeating a gang of bullies in a snowball fight and Michael encourages Buddy to ask Jovie on a date. During the date, the two fall for each other. Walter's boss, citing the failure of the company's most recent book, expects a new book by Christmas Eve, so Walter and his team hire best-selling children's author Miles Finch. Buddy interrupts a meeting between Walter's team and Finch to tell Walter of his newfound love and mistakes Finch, who has [[dwarfism]], for an elf. Buddy pesters Finch into losing his temper and walking out on Walter. Angry over the setback, Walter harshly disowns Buddy. Buddy leaves a note for Emily and Michael, and wanders the streets lamenting that he does not fit in anywhere.  On Christmas Eve, after finding Finch's notebook full of ideas, Walter and his team scramble to create a book to pitch. Walter's boss is prepared to hear the pitch when Michael arrives and informs Walter that Buddy is gone. Realizing he was wrong, Walter tries unsuccessfully to reschedule, then resigns and leaves with Michael to find Buddy.  Santa's sleigh crashes in [[Central Park]], attracting a large crowd. Buddy finds Santa, who explains that the sleigh has lost its engine and cannot fly without it, due to a shortage of Christmas spirit. Buddy finds the engine and is reunited with Walter and Michael. Walter apologizes to Buddy and accepts him as his son; Buddy then takes them to meet Santa. Michael takes Santa's list and reads it in front of television news cameras gathered outside the park, proving that Santa is real. The Central Park Rangers, whom Santa had placed on the naughty list, chase the sleigh as Buddy tries to reattach the engine.

Emile (film)
 'Emile' is the third in a loose trilogy of films written and directed by Carl Bessai, all exploring aspects of personal identity. The first, 'Johnny', looked at a teenager with his life ahead of them, the second, 'Lola', portrayed a middle-aged woman trying to escape an abusive relationship, and 'Emile' is a Proustian examination of memory, imagination, regret, lost roots, and the possibility of redemption and reconciliation, all seen through the eyes of an old man whose life is almost over.  As a young man, Emile went to England on a university scholarship, leaving behind his brutal older brother Carl and his creative younger brother Freddy to run the family farm in [[Saskatchewan]]. Despite promising Freddy that he would return, Emile stayed in England and became an academic, turning his back on his Canadian past and even acquiring an English accent, while his brothers died one after the other in tragic circumstances: Freddy gassing himself with exhaust fumes in his pick-up; Carl dying in a crash in the same pick-up.  On his brief return (presumably for Carl's funeral) the authorities think he is there to adopt Carl's young daughter Nadia, but he abandons her simply saying "single parent families are not allowed on campus". All he is there to do is to resolve the family land-holdings.  Invited many decades later to receive an honorary degree by a Canadian university, the retired Emile decides to take an extended visit to [[Victoria, British Columbia]] to try to get to know Carl's now adult daughter Nadia (Deborah Kara Unger, who also briefly portrays Carl's wife) who has recently separated from her husband, and her ten-year-old daughter Maria (Theo Crane, who also portrays the ten-year-old Nadia) before it is too late. The discovery of his ancient typewriter amongst Nadia's belongings triggers a series of reveries, half memory, half fantasy, in which Emile's unresolved feelings about the past come back to haunt him.<ref>http://www.movie-gazette.com</ref>  
Eloise at Christmastime
 The movie begins with a shot of the Hotel Lobby, with a large pink gift box leaning on the display table, in the middle of the room. The hotel manager, Mr. Salamone, asks one of the staff to take the box to the package room. Two of the staff take the gift box to the package room. When they leave, the box is opened and we see Eloise crawling out. Eloise is on a mission to find any presents in the package room from her mother, who has taken a trip to Paris.  When Eloise does not find any packages from her mother, she then leaves the room in a large mess. She skips towards the lobby, and pushes into a long line at the check-in desk and interrupts a conversation between Mr. Salamone and two patrons, wishing to upgrade their current hotel suite to a park-side view room.  Eloise asks Mr. Salamone if there have been any packages from her mother in Paris, and he replies that there hasn't. He pushes her away, telling Eloise that he is currently very busy. Eloise pushes in the line again, offering Mr. Salamone some unnecessary assistance. Mr. Salamone declines, pushing Eloise away from the hectic line.  Eloise leaves, but is instantly back in a flash, when she notices a suspicious man waiting in the queue. She thinks that this patron is a spy, but Mr. Salamone declines, and instantly changes the subject so that Eloise can leave the line. He requests Eloise to look out for the hotel's Christmas Tree Delivery, which is due to be at the Plaza any moment. He tells Eloise to inform him when the delivery arrives.  Eloise leaves the line, and tells the "spy" that she is keeping her eye on him.  The main focal point of the story deals with the impending [[marriage]] between Rachel Peabody, the hotel owner's daughter, and a bachelor named Brooks Oliver, who was chosen by Rachel's family to be her husband.  Eloise eventually learned that Oliver is into doing something suspicious. She also found out that Rachel had taken a liking to Bill, a room service waiter and one of her friends, four years earlier. When Mr. Peabody became aware of his daughter's relationship with Bill, he then sent his daughter to a university, hoping to break his daughter's ties with the waiter. Eloise then intervened with the relationship, much to the disappointment of Rachel's father.  She then succeeded at restoring Bill and Rachel's romance with each other; Oliver is then arrested for [[forgery]], and Mrs. Thornton, who was in danger of being [[eviction|evicted]], is granted a permanent stay at the Plaza. And to top it off, Eloise's mom arrives and they rejoice.

Eroica (2003 film)
 The film is set in [[Vienna]] on 9 June 1804, the date of the private, first performance of Beethoven’s third symphony, later to be known as the ‘Eroica’. The performance, and most of the action in the film, takes place at the palace of one of Beethoven’s patrons, [[Joseph Franz von Lobkowitz|Prince Franz Lobkowitz]]. Midway during the performance, Beethoven tries to get his lover, a widow named [[Josephine Brunsvik|Josephine von Deym]], to marry him, but she refuses because of the unfair laws regarding child custody — she is a member of the nobility, and cannot marry a commoner without losing custody of her children. Later, composer [[Joseph Haydn]], now old and feeble, arrives just in time to hear the last movement of the symphony.  During the last few minutes of the symphony, the film flashes forward, and we see Beethoven going to dinner with his pupil, [[Ferdinand Ries]], where he is told that [[Napoleon]] has just declared himself Emperor of France, thereby completely betraying Beethoven's faith in him. In a rage, he crumples up the title page of his symphony, which he originally intended to call the "Bonaparte".  As he leaves the performance, Haydn is asked his opinion of the symphony, which he describes as "quite new", and then utters his now-famous and prophetic comment, "From this day forward, everything [in music] is changed". The film ends on a grim note; as the performance of the ''Eroica'' ends, Beethoven looks at his audience and is momentarily unable to hear any natural sounds — an ominous sign of his approaching deafness.

After a particularly vicious fight, Erik is expelled. The headmaster labels him vicious and accuses him of being pure evil. In an attempt to provide her son with a fresh start and last chance to finish school, his mother sells some of her valuable family heirlooms and sends Erik to an affluent boarding school.  Upon arriving in Stjärnsberg, realising the boarding school is his final chance at reaching Sixth Form, Erik attempts to forgo his violent tendencies. At the prestigious school twelve members of the Sixth Form form a Student's Council.

When Giovanna comes face to face with the old Davide Veroli, it turns out he is the old man they called Simone. Simone, in fact, had been the man Davide had loved when he was young. Davide heard the Nazis were going to kill all Jews in Rome and killed his boss in order to escape and to alert as many people as possible. However, Davide was in a crossroad: he had to choose between telling the others&nbsp;– his neighbors, those who had laughed at him for being homosexual&nbsp;– or looking for Simone first instead. He chose to save the others in the first place to prove that he deserved their respect and saved many people and children. He was given many honors after this, but he lost his only love.  After remembering who he was, he had gone back home, although without mentioning anything to the family that had given him a roof the previous days. Nonetheless, they became very good friends. Davide helped her make some big decisions in her life, like pursuing her dream to work in a bakery and having the strength to fight for her marriage and her children.  
Fake (2003 film)
 Three young hipster men who share an apartment in [[Bangkok]] are chasing after women, but are unaware that it's the same woman they are after.  
Fan Chan
 Jeab, a young man working in [[Bangkok]], receives word that his best friend from childhood, Noi-Naa is to be married. While driving back to his hometown, the memories of his friendship with her come flooding back, and their story is told in a [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashback]].  Jeab and Noi-Naa live in a small city in Thailand. Their fathers are rival [[barber]]s, with shops situated next to each other, with only a sweet shop to separate them. Jeab's father favors efficiency and uses an electric trimmer. Noi-Naa's father, meanwhile, has a more contemplative, artistic approach, and uses scissors. Jeab notes that the results of both methods seem to be the same.  The school holiday has ended. Jeab is notorious for oversleeping, so that each day he misses the [[school bus]] and must be driven part way by his father on a [[motorcycle]]. By taking a shortcut, Jeab and his father are able to catch up to the bus, but only just in time.  On the bus, other boys are introduced. Their ringleader is an overweight [[bullying|bully]] named Jack. On the bus, the children talk about what they are going to do after school. The boys decide they will play [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]] [[fantasy]] characters, while the girls plan to play "house".  Because Jeab must cross a busy street to play with the boys, and he fears getting hit by a car, he stays to play with the girls, which makes him the target of much taunting by Jack and the other boys.  Then, one day, Jack and his friends are playing [[soccer]] against a rival neighborhood gang. They are one player short. Jeab happens to be hanging around, and he's asked to join the game, proving his abilities.  He earns the trust of Jack's gang, and passes various tests in order to join. But the one thing he must do is sever his ties to Noi-Naa. Jeab does so, quite literally, by cutting a [[rubber band|rubber-band]] jump rope, which Noi-Naa is skilled at playing with.  From that moment on, Noi-Naa refuses to talk to Jeab. Then, one day, Jeab gets word that Noi-Naa is moving away. And, of course, on the day she is to leave, Jeab oversleeps and misses the chance to say his final goodbye to Noi-Naa. Jeab then gets Jack and his friends to commandeer a delivery motorcycle and pursue Noi-Naa and her family in their moving truck. But the motorcycle breaks down, and the truck rolls out of sight. Jeab is to never see Noi-Naa again ... until her wedding.  
Exploring the Reef
 Cousteau is narrating about the ocean. As he starts talking about [[coral reef]]s, Dory starts bothering him by entering the frame. The scene then cuts to an [[anemone]] that Nemo and Marlin come out of and Cousteau sighs for not being able to do his documentary. The scene cuts to real [[cuttlefish]]es, which Dory tries to speak to. When Cousteau tells Dory to stop it, the scene cuts to a live [[Spanish dancer]]. This makes Marlin think of dancing and soon all three animated fish are dancing to some music. This infuriates Cousteau so much that he yells "Stop!" and proceeds to make a quick rant about the [[water cycle]], concluding that "Everyone, everywhere, affects the ocean!". Dory expresses amazement and at first, Cousteau is satisfied, but when it is revealed that she was listening to the [[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]] inside a [[conch]] shell, Cousteau loses his temper and starts ranting in [[French language|French]]. For about six seconds, a [[cartoon]] still image of Cousteau in a [[swimming suit]] appears while [[Elevator music|Musak]]-style [[music]] plays, on a title card which reads "Please Stand By".  When Cousteau comes back, however, he has calmed down and talks with the three fish about [[coral]] that have suffered from [[coral bleaching]], while the whitened coral appears on screen. The next topic is [[Coral#Reproduction|coral reproduction]]. Dory frantically swims to every new egg to say "Happy Birthday", Marlin paternally covers Nemo's eyes and Cousteau talks about how there are so many eggs, that even the hungriest fish cannot possibly eat all of them. He concludes by talking all about how we must all work hard in order to preserve the beauty of the [[coral reef]]. Suddenly, Nemo and the other two fish interrupt him, inadvertently summarizing the message of the entire film during their arguing. Jean-Michel gets mad again and the camera cuts to him aboard his boat by night. Humiliated that he has been "up-staged by fish", Cousteau mutters that "this would have never happened to [[Jacques Cousteau|Papa]]." In a before-credits scene, Nemo tells the viewer about Jean-Michel Cousteau's website: ''oceanfutures.org''. <ref name="YouTube"></ref>   
Falling Angels (film)
 The first few days of 1970, in an  [[Ontario]] suburb, and the Field family's fragile domestic peace has come to an end with the death of mother Mary. The story is told in loops and flashbacks over 10 years, opening and closing with the water flowing over [[Niagara Falls]], while the bulk of the film depicts the fall and winter of 1969 leading to Mary's funeral. In the background looms the tragedy of the suspicious death years ago of the first-born child, three-month-old Jimmy; a pervasive and never spoken of subject, Jimmy's existence is only revealed through a single newspaper clipping the (then adolescent) girls find in Mary's purse.  The household is ruled by father Jim Field, modeled on his experiences in the military, as is illustrated by a flashback sequence to the two weeks he forced his family to spend trapped in his self-built backyard bomb shelter, for "practice".  Jim works as a used-car salesman and he is keen on keeping up appearances in front of the neighbors. He is psychologically unstable, drinks heavily and cheats on his wife (which she accepts) although he is also oddly protective of her, insisting that his daughters watch her all the time. His depressed wife Mary, a onetime dancer, has escaped into apathy and alcoholism a long time ago. She lives a catatonic life on the living room couch, staring absently at the television, her ever-present coffee cup full of whiskey impassively filled by one family member or another.  Each of the three teenaged daughters has her own way to cope with the deleterious family atmosphere. They try to find their own experiences while struggling with weight of their family duties and concern for their mother. Norma is the eldest daughter and the most responsible element of the family; quiet, subdued and selfless, she overburdens herself with domestic tasks and responsibilities, and patiently puts up with her father's antics. She is also the only one intent on keeping the memory of her brother and on uncovering the secret around his death (the news article suggests that Mary slipped and dropped Jimmy over the falls, though the police suspected it wasn't an accident). After unexpectedly becoming friends with a neighbour girl, she lets some pleasure into her dreary life. As the opposite of Norma, middle child Lou fights for her independence, standing up to her father and loving her mother but despising her weakness. She assuages her fantasies of rebellion, experimenting with boys and drugs. Not as involved as Norma in the housekeeping, nor as rebellious as Lou, sweet-looking Sandy devotes herself to becoming a perfect woman, with her own naive sense of femininity and sexuality. She engages in an affair with an older, married shoe salesman which ends up an awkward threesome scene with the man's twin brother, and Sandy learning that she is pregnant.  The story builds from one small event to another. Things climax during one long New Year's Eve night, as a dramatic event and the final admission of the secret definitively put an end to the Fields' "pretend normal" family life. The ending is left open, leaving the viewer to guess whether or not the characters will be able to start a new and more honest life and reconstruct family bonds.  
Fat Pizza
 ''Fat Pizza'' the film is yet another slice of life at a dodgy suburban Sydney take away. Bobo Gigliotti (who lives with his mother) is a psychotic pizzeria owner/pizza chef who is awaiting the arrival of his mail-order refugee bride Lin Chow Bang, and a new pizza deliverer is on the block. In the end, a group of biker thugs arrive at the new deliverers shop and threatens to murder everyone.  
Fear and Trembling (film)
 Amélie, a young Belgian woman ([[Sylvie Testud]]), having spent her childhood in [[Japan]], decides to return to live there and tries to integrate into [[Japanese society]].  She is determined to be a "real Japanese" before her year contract runs out, though it is precisely this determination that is incompatible with Japanese humility.  Though she is hired for a choice position as a translator at an import/export firm, her inability to understand Japanese cultural norms results in increasingly humiliating demotions.  Though Amelie secretly adulates her immediate supervisor, Ms Mori ([[Kaori Tsuji]]), the latter takes sadistic pleasure in belittling Amelie.  Mori finally manages to break Amelie's will by making her the bathroom attendant, and is delighted when Amelie tells her that she will not renew her contract.  Amelie realizes that she is finally a real Japanese when she enters the company president's office "with fear and trembling," which was possible only because her determination had been broken by Mori's systematic humiliation.  The title, "Fear and Trembling", is said in the film to be the way Japanese must behave when addressing the Emperor. For Westerners, it calls to mind a line from Philippians 2:12, "continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling", which could also describe Amélie's attitude during her year at Yumimoto.  
The Fanimatrix
 The short film is set within the ''[[Matrix (fictional universe)|Matrix]]'' universe, shortly before the discovery of "The One" (in ''[[The Matrix]]'').  It tells a story of two rebels, [[Dante]] and [[Medusa]], operating out of a ship called the ''[[Descartes]]'', and of their fateful mission onto the virtual world of the Matrix.  The film opens with the insertion of Dante and Medusa into the Matrix.  They materialize inside a [[machining|machine-shop]] and quickly move across the city while talking to their Operator, who is guiding them on their mission.  The night's objectives are simple: Medusa is to break into a high-security building in order to steal important data.  Dante is to provide a distraction so the Matrix will not discover Medusa's presence.  Dante heads for a particularly rough nightclub populated with [[Cyberpunk#Fashion|cyberpunks]] and [[gothic subculture|goths]].  After dispatching the two [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]], he quickly picks a fight with two goths who mock Dante's "normal" appearance.  The Operator - who is in constant contact with Dante via his cellphone - helps coordinates the fight so it coincides with Medusa breaking into the high-security building and taking out a team of security officers.  The nightclub brawl culminates with Dante delivering a [[superhuman]] kick to one of goths, which alerts the Matrix.  The system promptly dispatches an [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agent]] to take care of the situation and it begins chasing Dante.  He leads the Agent on a dangerous wild goose chase cross the city, keeping Medusa free to carry out her work.  Unfortunately things suddenly go wrong.  A security officer, missed by Medusa during her entry, discovers her presence and hits the alarm, meaning she has to flee.  Dante's goose chase now becomes a frantic dash to get to an exit point - the nearest being the machine shop they first appeared in, but he is unable to shake the Agent from his tail.  Dante is trapped and Medusa is out of time.  He realizes he must fight the Agent - even though it means certain death - in order to buy time for Medusa to escape with the information she's hacked.  He tells the Operator to get Medusa out and then, chanting the mantra "free my mind" to himself, he throws himself at the Agent. During an epic [[kung-fu]] fight he is able to hold off the Agent until he sees an opportunity to escape.  He decides, though, to not race to freedom, but continues the fight until he is eventually thrown against the machinery and his chest is pierced by a steel pipe, killing him.  As Dante dies, Medusa makes it back to the car and to safety - unaware of Dante's immense sacrifice for her own life.

The film begins by showing The Father comforting his son Aleksei, who just has a nightmare. Following in his father's path, Aleksei attends military school. He likes sports, tends to be irresponsible and has problems with his girlfriend, who is jealous of Aleksei's close relationship with his father. Eventually she breaks up with him.

A Ferret Called Mickey
 Paulie is having a pretend [[Tea party (social gathering)|tea party]] with his sister and his doll in the garden while his father and mother watch from inside the house. Paulie's father, Jim, is annoyed that his son is wearing his mother's dress and takes him to Dougie O'Neill to buy a ferret so that they can go [[rabbiting#Ferreting|rabbit hunting]]. Paulie picks a [[ferret]] and calls him "Mickey".  Jim takes his son into the countryside in the rain to find a rabbit burrow. Jim tells Paulie to release the ferret who scares the rabbits out of the burrow and into a net where he hits them with a shovel. Paulie is upset when he learns that the true meaning of hunting is to "kill bunnie rabbits". They arrive home with a table full of dead rabbits, to which Jim's wife complains what she is to do with them. He tells her to make rabbit stew. When Jim goes to the shed, Paulie tells him that he fed Mickey [[Éclair (pastry)|éclairs]] so he isn't hungry anymore and so won't have to kill any more rabbits.  At dinner, Paulie refuses to eat the rabbit meat and runs out to the shed. When Jim confronts Paulie he tells him to put Mickey back in his cage and go finish his food; but Paulie refuses and tells him to do it himself while holding the ferret up to him. Jim is actually scared of handling Mickey and backs up knocking some petrol cans over, causing the ferret to bite Paulie on the lip.  While returning the ferret to Dougie O'Neill, Jim realises that he was the one that lost his nerve with the ferret and it was his intolerance that caused Paulie to getting injured.  Back in the garden, Paulie is upset about losing Mickey when Jim sits beside him and invites him on a fishing trip. When Paulie declines, he says "You'll need this then, I suppose..." and hands him his doll, and the two sit together and have a pretend tea party.

The Fifth Reaction
 The opening scene of the film captures Fereshteh among her four other friends and colleagues in a luxury restaurant, gathering for lunch to comfort Fereshteh for her loss of her husband. Typical for this [[feminist]] women, they always discuss about their personal problems as women in Iran patriarchal society and decide to make [[feminist movements]] to stop the inequality and injustice towards women; however, they always talk without taking any further steps. As Fereshteh's father-in-law takes the custody of her two sons, her friends, unlike her lawyer, find it just the perfect opportunity to stand against men. Entertaining themselves with the battle between Fereshteh and her father-in-law, they help her to escape abroad. This game goes on while each competitor tries to score more. Finally, the father-in-law arrests Fereshteh in [[Bushehr]] while she is trying to escape to [[Dubai]] through seaway. In the closing scene of the movie, we see the patronizing, snobbish and arrogant presence of the father-in-law as his shadow darkens Fereshteh’s face as he stands above her in jail and conditions her freedom to his own terms. The father-in-law with his indescribable power is far "too extreme to be a credible character"<ref>[http://www.polfilms.com/fifthreaction.html]</ref> due to all [[injustice]] he brings to Fereshteh, the lonely woman who valiantly fights in the battle and draws the admiration of the audience. His [[wikt:egoism|ego]], selfishness and pursuit for his individual desires points to his psychological [[impediment]] to perceive women other than weak creatures who have no power to encounter men.  
Finding Nemo
  Two [[Amphiprioninae|clownfish]], Marlin and Coral, are admiring their new home in the [[Great Barrier Reef]], [[Australia]], and their clutch of hundreds of eggs, when a [[barracuda]] attacks. Marlin is knocked unconscious, and wakes up to find Coral and all but one of the eggs gone. He names this last egg ''Nemo'', a name that Coral had chosen.  On the first day of school, Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a field trip. While Marlin talks to the teacher, Mr. Ray, Nemo sneaks away from the reef toward a boat and is captured by a scuba diver. As the boat departs, one of the divers accidentally knocks his diving mask overboard. Marlin chases after the boat and meets Dory, a [[Paracanthurus|blue tang]] who suffers from short-term memory loss. The two encounter Bruce, Anchor, and Chum, three reformed sharks who have renounced eating other fish. While at their meeting, Marlin discovers the diver's mask and notices an address written on it. However, Dory and Marlin fight over the mask, giving Dory a bloody nose. The blood sends Bruce into a frenzy, and he attacks Marlin and Dory, who narrowly escape.  Nemo is placed in a fish tank in a dentist’s office, where he meets the Tank Gang, led by Gill. The gang learn Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece Darla, who has killed previous fish given to her. Gill devises a plan to escape: jam the tank's filter with a pebble so the dentist will put the fish in plastic bags to clean the tank, then roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter but fails, nearly dying in the process.   The mask falls into a trench in the deep sea, where Dory reads the address as 42 Wallaby Way, [[Sydney]]. To her own disbelief, Dory remembers the address despite her short-term memory loss. Dory and Marlin receive directions to Sydney from a school of [[Silver moony|moonfish]]. On the way, they encounter a bloom of [[jellyfish]] that traps and nearly stings them to death. Marlin loses consciousness and awakens on the back of a sea turtle named Crush, who shuttles Marlin and Dory on the [[East Australian Current]]. Marlin tells the story of his journey to a group of young sea turtles led by Crush's son Squirt. News of his quest spreads across the ocean. Near the harbor, a [[pelican]] named Nigel flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's efforts. Inspired, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. He succeeds, but the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before the Tank Gang can escape.  Marlin and Dory exit the East Australian Current and are engulfed by a [[blue whale]]. Dory communicates with the whale, which carries them to [[Sydney Harbour]] and expels them through his [[blowhole (anatomy)|blowhole]]. They meet Nigel, who helps the pair escape from a flock of [[Gull|seagull]]s and takes them to the dentist's office. Darla has just arrived, and the dentist is handing Nemo to her. Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel arrives, terrifying Darla and throwing the office into chaos. After Nigel is violently thrown out by the dentist, Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain that leads to the ocean.  Having mistaken Nemo for dead, Marlin thanks Dory and starts his return journey. Dory meets Nemo when he reaches the ocean, but she has lost her memory. Eventually, Dory's memory returns when she reads the word ''Sydney'' on a drainpipe. She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but she is caught in a fishing net with a school of [[grouper]]. Nemo enters the net and orders the grouper to swim downward to break the net and escape. Later, having returned home, Marlin and Dory proudly watch Mr. Ray carry Nemo and his friends to school.    
Final Destination 2
  Exactly one year after [[Final Destination (film)|the explosion of Flight 180]], college student [[Kimberly Corman]] is heading to [[Daytona Beach]], [[Florida]] for [[spring break]] with her friends, [[List of Final Destination characters#Shaina McKlank|Shaina McKlank]], [[List of Final Destination characters#Dano Estevez|Dano Estevez]], and [[List of Final Destination characters#Frankie Whitman|Frankie Whitman]]. On Route 23, Kimberly has a [[premonition]] of logs falling off a [[Semi-trailer truck|semi]], causing a massive car accident that kills everyone involved. She stalls her car on the entrance ramp, preventing several people from entering Route 23, including lottery winner [[List of Final Destination characters#Evan Lewis|Evan Lewis]]; widow [[List of Final Destination characters#Nora Carpenter|Nora Carpenter]] and her fifteen-year-old son [[List of Final Destination characters#Tim Carpenter|Tim]]; businesswoman [[List of Final Destination characters#Kat Jennings|Kat Jennings]]; stoner [[List of Final Destination characters#Rory Peters|Rory Peters]]; pregnant [[List of Final Destination characters#Isabella Hudson|Isabella Hudson]]; high school teacher [[List of Final Destination characters#Eugene Dix|Eugene Dix]]; and Deputy Marshal [[List of Final Destination characters#Thomas Burke|Thomas Burke]]. While Officer Burke questions Kimberly, the pileup occurs. Shaina, Dano, and Frankie are killed by a speeding truck, but Kimberly is saved by Officer Burke at the last second.  The survivors are brought to the police station, where they learn about the curse of Flight 180. Later, a chain reaction causes a fire in Evan's apartment which he barely escapes; but when Evan slips the escape ladder falls and impales his eye. Officer Burke researches the survivors of Flight 180, and discovers that [[Alex Browning]] was killed by a falling brick. Kimberly visits [[Clear Rivers]], the last survivor of Flight 180, who is now a voluntary inmate at a psychiatric ward. Clear refuses to help, but while arguing with Kimberly she realizes that the survivors are dying in reverse, and warns Kimberly to look out for "[[omens|signs]]" of Death. Upon returning home, Kimberly has a vision of a flock of pigeons attacking her and she and Officer Burke rush to save Nora and Tim, but they arrive too late and Tim is crushed by a glass pane, while leaving the dentist. Clear decides to help and introduces Kimberly and Officer Burke to mortician [[William Bludworth]], who tells them that only "new life" can defeat Death. They believe that if Isabella has her baby it will ruin Death's plan and they will all be safe.  Isabella is accused of driving a stolen van and taken into custody, while the other survivors reunite for safety. After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors, the group leaves to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor at the police station, while the officer on duty rushes Isabella to the hospital in her van. Along they way, they recall cheating death prior the Route 23 incident, which were all somehow connected to the Flight 180 survivors. Clear then deduces that Death's list is working backwards to "tie up loose ends". Since Officer Burke saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck earlier, she is last on Death's list.  The survivors' vehicle suffers a blowout, prompting them to swerve onto a farm. The back of the car is penetrated by [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, [[List of Final Destination characters#Brian Gibbons|Brian Gibbons]], the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him at the last second. Using the [[Hydraulic rescue tools|Jaws of Life]], Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.  Kimberly, Clear, and Officer Burke  rush to the hospital, and Kimberly has another vision of [[List of Final Destination characters#Ellen Kalarjian|Dr. Ellen Kalarjian]] "strangling" Isabella. After Burke immobilizes Dr. Kalarjian, they witness Isabella give birth and assume they have cheated death. However, Kimberly has another vision of someone with bloody hands in a submerging van and realizes that Isabella was never meant to die in the pile-up.  Clear searches for Eugene, but accidentally causes his room to explode from an oxygen combustion, killing them both. Kimberly realizes the person in her vision was herself and immerses a van in a lake to drown herself. Kimberly is rescued by Burke and resuscitated by Kalarjian, which was her actual premonition, thus granting her new life. Sometime later, Kimberly and Burke have a picnic with Brian's family and [[List of Final Destination characters#Michael Corman|Kimberly's father]] to celebrate their survival. There  they learn of Brian's deterrence from Death when his father tells them he was almost hit by a van, but Rory saved him. The group then see a malfunctioning barbecue grill explode, killing Brian.

He contacts the owner of the wallet by telephone, and then later discovers that the wallet contains the winning ticket in a $6 million [[lottery]].  Complications arise when Tepper's friends come over for their regular poker night. One of the conditions of the game is that everyone purchase a ticket for the lottery, to be thrown into the pot. The game is played as a [[Poker jargon#freezeout|freezeout]], with the winner collecting all the tickets and any prizes they may be worth.

Five (2003 film)
 The film consists of five long takes set by the ocean. As in a typical [[Yasujirō Ozu|Ozu]] film, the camera never moves, zooms or pans. There is no dialogue, and only one shot includes people.  Five sequences : 1) A piece of driftwood on the seashore, carried about by the waves 2) People walking on the seashore. The oldest ones stop by, look at the sea, then go away 3) Blurry shapes on a winter beach. A herd of dogs. A love story 4) A group of loud ducks cross the image, in one direction then the other 5) A pond, at night. Frogs improvising a concert. A storm, then the sunrise.  
The Fighting Temptations
 In the year 1980, a young boy named Darrin Hill ([[Cuba Gooding Jr.]]) and his mother, MaryAnn ([[Faith Evans]]), are run out of their hometown of Monte Carlo, Georgia, after MaryAnn is soon discovered to be singing secular music when she sings in a church choir also. After being confronted about this by the self-righteous Paulina Pritchett ([[LaTanya Richardson]]), MaryAnn is forced to choose between singing professionally or remaining in the choir.  Aunt Sally Walker ([[Ann Nesby]]), Darrin's great-aunt, attempts to defend MaryAnn but fails, and the church's pastor, Reverend Paul Lewis ([[Wendell Pierce]]), is too afraid of Paulina (who is his sister and who uses this fact to her advantage) and the other church members to let her stay. MaryAnn and Darrin are last seen on a bus saying goodbye to Aunt Sally, as they sadly wave to each other.  In 2003, Darrin has grown up to become a successful advertising executive in [[New York metropolitan area|New York City]] with a bad habit of lying. His only true friend and secretary, Rosa Lopez ([[Lourdes Benedicto]]), does a good job at keeping his credit problems under control. However, Darrin has achieved so much under [[false pretenses]], having faked his college degree and high school diploma and lied about being the son of a congressman. Eventually, his lies soon catch up with him and get him in trouble with his paranoid boss ([[Dakin Matthews]]) and Darrin loses his job. After being tracked down by a private investigator, Darrin soon finds out that Aunt Sally has died.  Darrin returns to his hometown of Monte Carlo, Georgia, and on the way, looks back on both comical and heartwarming memories of MaryAnn (who is later revealed to have died in a car accident when Darrin was a teenager) and the experiences they had together. When Darrin arrives, he finds a new friendship in Lucious ([[Mike Epps]]), the town's happy-go-lucky, womanizing cab driver (who also has a fear of the Lord). At Aunt Sally's funeral, [[Shirley Caesar]] makes a cameo appearance as a character who was an old friend of Sally and sings at the funeral. After the funeral, Darrin soon learns from the Reverend that Aunt Sally had stated in her will that he must direct the church choir and enter the annual "Gospel Explosion" competition and win the prize money of $10,000 and in doing so, will inherit Aunt Sally's stock in the company that produces the show which is currently worth $150,000.  Upon taking charge of the once-powerful choir, Darrin discovers that it has fallen into decline over the years, with only a handful of members remaining. He also faces opposition from Paulina, who is now the church's high-strung and wicked treasurer who expected to be the new choir director now that Sally has died. Paulina holds a grudge against Darrin because of his mother and for "stealing" her spot as choir director, as she was next in line and had waited for years for Sally to pass away.  After several setbacks, Darrin eventually recruits many new members, most of which he does so by promising half of the competition's prize money to them (though he has no intention of paying anyone). He also reconnects with his childhood friend and crush Lilly ([[Beyoncé]]), who has faced ostracization from the townspeople similar to MaryAnn's, due to her being an R&B [[nightclub singer]], and having a son, Dean, out of wedlock. Lilly, at first, refuses to join the choir as she is both disgusted by Darrin's romantic advances and because she doesn't want to put up with the townpeople's criticism of her, but with some assurance from Darrin, she ultimately relents and becomes the new lead singer of the choir, causing Paulina to quit in retaliation.  Several weeks later, Paulina reveals that Darrin forgot to enter the choir into the auditions on time. Luckily, the audition judge, Luther Washington ([[Faizon Love]]), who is also the town's prison warden, lets them perform in a show for his prisoners when their booked act cancels. Thanks to Lilly's beautiful looks and voice, the choir performs well and Washington lets them into the competition. Washington also lets Darrin borrow three convicts who can sing. The three convicts are Bee-Z Briggs, Lightfoot, and Mr. Johnson ([[T-Bone (rapper)|T-Bone]], Chris Cole, and [[Montell Jordan]]). After weeks of success, the choir has become more popular, as more people have joined both it and the church. Lilly starts to trust Darrin and develops romantic feelings for him as well. However, Paulina takes a message for Darrin in a phone call from Rosa and learns of his past troubles, and intends on exposing him the first chance she gets. The next afternoon at a church barbecue, Paulina deliberately reveals Darrin's secrets with a polite demeanor, in order to make herself look innocent. Lilly, furious and heartbroken about this, tells Darrin that she doesn't care what he does; she was only using him because he was using her, and the people whom he promised money to begin to panic.  Since Lilly wants nothing to do with him, Darrin decides to quit and returns to New York, where he has been offered his job back. However, when Darrin goes back and gets a new condo and a promotion, he comes to realize that none of these things mean anything without Lilly and the choir. Darrin quits his job and returns to Monte Carlo to reconcile with Lilly. The two then recruit Lucious and the Reverend and all of them rush down to the Gospel Explosion to join the choir for the performance.    When Darrin and Lilly arrive, Paulina tries to keep them out, citing that Darrin forfeited his inheritance when he left Monte Carlo. However, Reverend Lewis finally stands up to Paulina and calls her out for being a selfish, conniving, hypocritical individual. He then reveals to the choir that her husband, whom she previously had claimed was deceased, is alive and remarried to a better woman. Lilly scolds Paulina for insulting Sally's will and wishes, which gave Darrin the choir. They manage to convince the others to vote Paulina out of the choir, giving Darrin his position as director back. Before their performance begins, Darrin tells Lilly that she inspired him to name the choir ''The Fighting Temptations''.  After an outstanding performance, the choir wins the competition, but before ending his acceptance speech, Darrin starts a proper relationship with Lilly by surprising her with an unexpected marriage proposal, to which she accepts. Eighteen months later, the two are shown to be happily married with a baby of their own. In addition, the church is about to undergo an expansion, and a reformed Paulina rejoins the choir, having become more open to those who join.  In a mid-credits scene, Lucious pesters the baby jokingly claiming to be its father. Lilly's grandfather hears Lucious and scares him off with a cold stare.

Filmed over four years, ''Flag Wars’'' “as-it-is-happening” [[cinéma vérité]] style captures the emotions and honesty of unguarded moments as tensions mount between neighbors.  The story begins with Nina, a [[lesbian]] [[real estate broker|real estate agent]] who lives and works in the neighborhood and is at the center of the changes taking place. The changes include having areas of the neighborhood designated a [[Historic District]] (creating restrictive housing codes), an increase in [[code enforcement]] complaints, and efforts to reduce [[low-income housing]] in the community. [[Code enforcement]] is complaint driven and neighborhood resident Linda Mitchell believes the new residents moving in on her block are responsible for the code and zoning citations that have landed her in Judge Pfeiffer's Environmental Court. Linda suffers from [[cirrhosis]] of the liver and lives on [[disability insurance]]. She does not address the housing and zoning violations and her limited resources prevent her from making repairs to her home. This puts her in jeopardy of arrest, until residents assist in remedying with code violations. Baba, a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] [[Yoruba religion|priest]] and plumber, is the founder of the community gallery in the neighborhood, which occupies the bottom two floors of his three-story house.

Five Moons Square
  
The Fog of War
 The film focuses primarily on the interviews of former Secretary of Defense, [[Robert McNamara]], who was interviewed for about 20 hours by the director of the documentary, Errol Morris, through a special device called the "[[Errol Morris#Style|Interrotron]]" which projects images of interviewer and interviewee on two-way mirrors in front of their respective cameras so each appears to be talking directly to the other. Use of this device is intended to convey actual interaction with each other and direct eye contact with the viewer.  In the interviews, McNamara talks about aspects of international security and how and by what means it can be influenced by circumstances. The documentary explores recent events in American history and also focuses on McNamara's life and how he rose from a humble American family to be a  politician who achieved enormous power and influence. McNamara worked with presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and with general [[Curtis LeMay]], and had direct access to many governmental documents. His opinions, personal experiences and lessons learned while serving as a Secretary of Defense can provide the audience with an enlightening philosophy and outlook on American politics.  The documentary covers important events such as [[World War II]], [[Vietnam War]], [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], and many others that McNamara himself witnessed.  McNamara is regarded as the "architect" of the Vietnam War; a war that cost an enormous number of lives against a foe whose resolve he seriously underestimated. McNamara's interview, along with archival footage, offers a close look at international security and the international relations of the US, and an insight into why certain conflicts occur and the lessons that can be learned from these conflicts.

Flywheel (film)
 Jay Austin (Alex Kendrick) is a car salesman who consistently cheats his customers, even to the point of overcharging his own pastor. He teaches his rotund salesmen, Bernie Meyers (Tracy Goode) and Vince Berkeley (Treavor Lokey), to do likewise. Jay occasionally attends church, but only because his wife Judy (Janet Lee Dapper) wants him to go. He also fakes giving a donation to the church. His relationships with his wife and son (Richie Hunnewell), who both disapprove of his dishonesty, deteriorate. In addition he is facing [[foreclosure]] on his lot by the bank. Jay becomes troubled in his conscience, and one day while flipping television channels, he sees a pastor preaching that "you're in the shape you're in today because of the choices you've made." Jay becomes personally convicted and becomes a born-again Christian, prompting him to change his business practices.  Jay apologizes to his pregnant wife and his son and decides to sell cars honestly from that point on. However, he is now thousands of dollars in debt and facing the loss of his dealership if he can't catch up on his payments to the bank. Jay decides not to worry about his situation and to "let God handle it," telling the Lord that it is His lot. After the two rotund salesmen, whose interactions often provide comedy, leave over a disagreement about the newly reformed business practices, a young, innocent-looking "newcomer" Kevin Cantrell (Daniel Titus) comes to Jay to work for six weeks and asks him questions, such as how he sells cars. Jay answers by saying, "Just sell the car to them by its real price and God will decide." Sales are honest, but the amounts are mediocre at best. Kevin leaves after the six weeks, but later Jay sees himself on television as part of a news investigation on car dealerships. Kevin was a carefully concealed undercover agent investigating which car dealers cheat, and the report says that Jay Austin Motors was the only honest dealership among them. The next day Jay comes to the lot and sees many people there to buy his cars. Jay even has to call his wife to help sell all the cars on the lot that day. The total of the sales above the cost of the cars is enough to cover what the banker demanded, who comes later that day and wonders where all the cars have gone.   Business continues to be brisk, and then Jay begins to feel convicted in his conscience about his dishonesty during the prior two years that he had been in business, and with his wife's encouragement decides to make restitution to all the customers he had overcharged. He also finds that the amount due them was the same as the profit he had after expenses and salaries.   Shortly thereafter, Jay is asked to do another live television interview, this time from reporter Hillary Vale (Lisa Arnold) of WALB-TV.  On camera, Jay sees his now former employee Bernie saying that Jay Austin is a cheater, leading Hillary to say viewers will have to make up their own mind. However, many of his old customers (presumably all seeing the news) to whom Jay had just made [[restitution]] wasted no time to visit the lot to tell Hillary that there is more to the story.  Hillary broadcasts an update 30 minutes after the prior live newscast to reflect the lot's new visitations. At home Jay's wife and son, who had been praying for Jay since the first report, also see this latest development on television, and then his wife starts to feel contractions. Jay exits the lot and rushes home to bring his wife to the hospital. She gives birth to a girl named Faith, to stand as a living reminder of Jay's newfound faith in God. At the end of the film, Jay drives away with his son in his 1958 [[Triumph TR3]], an acquisition at the beginning of the film, which Max (Walter Burnett), his mechanic, had repaired with a newly installed flywheel (thus the film's title).

The driver of the car, Mrs Marion Kirkman ([[Kerry Fox]]), immediately calls an ambulance. During an examination at the local hospital the doctor comes to the conclusion that Cassie only has some scratches and not even a [[concussion]], but Cassie has lost her memory due to the accident. She only knows her name and mother country, but she does not know which town she comes from, who her family is and why she is in England. The doctor explains to her that the loss of memory is caused by a shock and that she will regain it after some recuperation. As a result of the examination Cassie is checked out. Marion Kirkman invites Cassie to stay at her house, until she has overcome her loss of memory, because Mrs Kirkman feels guilty and responsible for the lonely girl who nobody knows.  While recovering, Cassie is drawn into a deeper mystery, which seems to involve her hosts and other people she sees about the town. Her lack of memory compounds the air of suspense as she encounters a man named Dan Blakely ([[Ioan Gruffudd]]), whom she believes she knows, but with no idea from where. Cassie becomes very attached to Marion Kirkman's son, Michael (Harry Forrester) and becomes acquainted with her husband Simon ([[Stephen Dillane]]), an [[art historian]], who is in the process of examining a church from [[Early Christianity]] (built in [[Glastonbury]] during the first century AD) after the arrival of [[Joseph of Arimathea]]. This church was recently discovered by two visitors to the [[Glastonbury Festival]] who died after falling down a hole through the open roof of the buried church. In the Church there is an unusual [[relief]] made of stone, which illustrates the [[crucifixion]] of Christ. Also depicted are many curious onlookers who appear to be observing the gruesome scene.  During the next few days, Cassie has visions of the future of the people around her. She also recognises certain people who seem to watch her and often appear in a certain place in Glastonbury which she visits. She observes the strange [[auto mechanic]] Frederick Michael Argyle ([[Peter McNamara]]) and examines his belongings, which include a scrapbook containing news clippings that detail accusations of child abuse  at a local orphanage, that were ignored by the townspeople. The orphanage turns out to be the house the Kirkmans now live in. Cassie finds that Argyle was one of the children who was abused and that he identifies himself with the young Michael. She discovers that Argyle is planning to take revenge on the people of the town for their cruelty to him. Cassie suspects that a catastrophe is imminent, but she is unable to persuade anyone else of the impending danger she senses. She eventually finds out that the relief in the church illustrates a group of people known as "The Gathering". They are immortal and damned to watch catastrophes and murders for eternity as they stopped to watch the crucifixion of Christ out of morbid curiosity, a concept similar to the legend of the [[Wandering Jew]]. The priest and Bishop also discover this, and the priest rushes to inform Mr Kirkman. However, on the way he sees the "Gathering" on a bridge over the highway, and dies in a car accident as a result. The Gathering merely watch. Later that same day, Cassie experiences visions where she watches a young Argyle dragged into the house by the orphanage priest while three of the town's leading figures watch and laugh. The priest then drags the child into a nearby room where he further abuses the child and is joined by the other three men. Cassie follows the men into the room, only to wake from the vision to see Michael standing over pictures of the archaeological site. Cassie then finds one of the photographs, which seems to horrify her.  However, after the priest's accident, the Bishop is able to pass on this strange news to Mr Kirkman, who realises that his family is in great danger. He hastens to drive home to try to prevent whatever is fated to occur. Cassie is then seen attending the local festival with the Kirkman children only to then see the strange people gathering around the fairgrounds. She attempts to warn the police once more of Argyle's intent, but instead discovers Dan, who has killed the officer on duty. He then reveals that he is one of the Gathering, who have since stopped simply watching the world's tragedies but have also begun to set up the potential tragedies to be more likely to happen. Cassie manages to prevent Argyle from killing festival goers with a bomb, but is unable to stop him taking revenge upon the men who had abused him. After a harrowing chase, Cassie sacrifices her life to save the lives of the children of the Kirkman family. Mr Kirkman arrives just in time to stop Argyle from killing his family. At the end it is revealed that Cassie also belongs to ''The Gathering'', because just after she "dies", she appears standing among them as they stare at Argyle being electrocuted. Cassie is shown to be weeping while the others just stand there and watch impassively. Because Cassie has shown compassion and tried to prevent evil deeds, her life of wandering will end and she will find peace, which she tells the son of Mr Kirkman at night on the same day.  Similarities with the [[Ray Bradbury]] story "The Crowd" have been noted.

Amit tries to instill honesty and courage in his subordinates, but in vain. Bacha Yadav ([[Mukesh Tiwari]]), who is a stooge of Sadhu Yadav visits his hideout, sees an infamous local goon Nunwa taking shelter there.  Fearing that arresting him would open the lid on the nexus between Nunwa and the Tezpur Police, he kills Nunwa and misleads Police that he was killed in an encounter. Suspicious about the encounter, Amit Kumar summons Bacha Yadav, puts him off duty temporarily and also tries to keep him away from Sadhu Yadav and Sundar Yadav. Anxious that he would be transferred from Tezpur, Bacha Yadav, seeking the help of Sadhu Yadav, visits his home, where he finds out that he is being ditched by Sadhu and vows to settle score with them. Meanwhile, Sundar manhandles a Public Works Department engineer for not heeding to his word during a tendering process. Amit takes notice of the incident and also finds that a girl is missing from her home after being kidnapped by Sundar. Sensing an opportunity, Bacha Yadav urges Amit to give him one more chance, who obliges him. Bacha Yadav tricks Sundar into a factory where Amit and his men are waiting and after a brief scuffle, Sundar is arrested and produced in a local court, where the judge acquits Sundar on the account of lack of evidence against him.  Sadhu Yadav's men then try to [[vandalise]] a shop of local pan vendor after he testified against Sundar, before  being arrested and jailed in the police station. There, a fight arises between the accused and Bacha Yadav and his colleagues. It reaches an extreme point with Bacha Yadav piercing the eyes of the accused and [[Acid throwing|pouring acid]], referred locally as "Gangaajal", on their eyes. The incident raises a hue and cry in the local media, which accuses Police of [[vigilante]] justice. Angered by the incident, Amit Kumar orders his men involved to give their confessions in writing. While all, except Bacha Yadav, deny their involvement, Bacha Yadav writes his confession in a letter and submits it to Amit. When Bacha Yadav reaches his home, he finds his son and wife taken hostage by Sundar Yadav who, after a brief struggle, kills Bacha Yadav by shooting in his eyes. Enraged by the incident, Amit Kumar burns the confession letter of Bacha Yadav and issues a search warrant for Sundar and warns Sadhu Yadav to tell Sundar to surrender himself. Sadhu Yadav applies for an anticipatory bail for Sundar but before Sundar is produced in the court, he is arrested and is taken to jail. This time, the court rejects the bail application and orders the Police to keep Sundar in a 10-day custody.  However, Sadhu Yadav influences local home minister and the Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) ([[Mohan Agashe]]) of the area, Verma, to release his son and also to send Amit on an emergency leave. After being released, Sundar disrupts the marriage of the girl who he kidnapped earlier and kills her mother in the process. Unable to bear the loss of her mother and the torture at the hands of Sundar, she kills herself in the presence of Amit. Amit detains both Sadhu and Sundar and tries to take them to Police Station. However, locals stop Amit and demand that both be killed then and there itself, before being convinced by him that they would be tried as per the law. On the way to Police Station, however, both Sadhu and Sundar escape. Amit then catches up with them and brief fight takes place between them and the film ends with both Sundar and Sadhu getting killed by falling accidentally on chisels of a plough, which incidentally pierce through their eyes.

Gigli is attracted to Ricki, but he resents both Louis' lack of faith in him and having to take orders from a woman. He is also frustrated by Brian's insistence on going to "the Baywatch" and by the fact that Ricki is [[gay]]. A suspicious detective ([[Christopher Walken]]) comes to the apartment to question Gigli in reference to Brian's disappearance. Gigli is further annoyed when his mother ([[Lainie Kazan]]) takes an immediate liking to Ricki and when the two women team up to needle him.  The events take a darker turn when Gigli and Ricki receive orders to cut off Brian's thumb, something that neither wants to do. Worse, Ricki's ex-girlfriend, Robin (Missy Crider), shows up at Gigli's apartment, accusing Ricki of changing [[Sexual fluidity|sexual orientation]] and [[Self-mutilation|attempting suicide by slitting her wrists]] and is rushed to the hospital, where she thankfully survives. While there, Gigli sneaks into the morgue and cuts off a corpse's thumb, which he sends to the prosecutor as Brian's thumb. Gigli and Ricki go back to Gigli's apartment, where Gigli confesses his love and the two sleep together.  They are summoned to meet with the mob's boss. Starkman reveals that he did not approve of the plan to kidnap a federal prosecutor's brother or the order to cut off Brian's thumb. He nevertheless rages at them because the thumb they sent didn't match Brian's [[fingerprint]], and therefore not only failed to increase pressure on the prosecutor but even undermined the organization's credibility. Starkman then kills Louis, presumably in retaliation for the kidnapping and associated scrutiny by law enforcement. Starkman is about to kill Ricki and Gigli as well, but Ricki talks him out of it by pointing out that only they know where Brian is and only they can silence Brian and prevent him from revealing the involvement of Starkman's organization in the kidnapping or even accusing Starkman of having been personally involved. They leave Starkman's, decide to leave the mob, and discuss taking Brian back to where they found him. On the way, they discover ''Baywatch'' (or a similarly themed show or film) shooting an episode on the beach. Brian begs to be let off there and finally they consent.  Gigli convinces Ricki to take his car to escape to parts unknown; but at the last minute, Ricki returns to pick up Gigli, and they leave town together.  
Girls Will Be Girls (film)
  Evie Harris ([[Jack Plotnick]]) is a washed-up, alcoholic, aging C-List actress (star of [[kinescope]], stage, television, and film in such works as the TV special ''Christmas Evie'', [[vaudeville]]-era appearances promoting 'Dr. Vim's Miracle Elixir,' ''Court TV: Celebrities Who Kill'', ''[[Tabitha (TV series)|Tabitha]]'' and the sad 1970s disaster epic ''Asteroid'' [tagline: 'Earth Might Get Crushed!']). She lives in a tackily out-of-style bungalow with Coco ([[Clinton Leupp]]), a homely, lonely, doormat of a spinster who carries a torch for the handsome young doctor who performed her abortion years ago.  Evie's life is turned upside-down by the arrival of a new roommate, Varla Simonds ([[Jeffery Roberson]]), the voracious, starry-eyed daughter of Evie's rival, late actress Marla Simonds (whose claims to fame included playing Chesty on ''Fill Her Up'', the short-lived but widely acclaimed spinoff of ''[[C.P.O. Sharkey]]'', and almost being cast as the lead in "Asteroid" before Evie captured that "breakout" role). Evie acts very competitive around Varla, especially as she recognizes the growing chemistry between the young up-and-comer and her sweet, handsome and microscopically endowed son and "ambulance chasing" lawyer, Stevie (Ron Mathews). When Varla snags a plum starring role in commercials for "Bizzy Gal dinners," tensions and jealousies amongst the three women reach a boiling point and treachery soon rears its ugly head.  
Girl from Rio
 Raymond Woods, a junior manager in a bank in [[City of London|the City]], is becoming increasingly bored of his life as it takes a downhill tumble. First he finds out that he has missed the promotion opportunity at work by his bad tempered and disapproving boss, Strothers, and then he catches his wife a couple of days before Christmas having an affair with Strothers.  Touching down in Rio, he calls a cab to take him to a nice hotel. The cab driver, Paulo, takes him to a fairly run down hotel. Raymond insists he needs a much nicer hotel with a beach, while Paulo insists Raymond would not be able to afford such a hotel, but suddenly changes heart once Raymond shows him a large wad of cash. Paulo immediately befriends Raymond, with his eyes greedily on his cash as he owes money to the biggest [[Mafia]] leader in Rio. He insists that he is prepared to take Raymond wherever he needs to go and whatever he needs done can be done. Therefore, Paulo takes Raymond to the nicest hotel in Rio. Raymond trips up in a commotion at the door of the hotel, dropping his bag and spreading his cash all over the floor. Once he hastily shuffles it all away, the hotel clerks immediately show him to the [[Presidential suite]]. After a day of shopping and generous spending Raymond reveals to Paulo he has come to Rio to look for the famous samba dancer Orlinda.  Paulo then calls to tell Raymond he has found Orlinda. After dropping Raymond off at the club where Orlinda is performing, Paulo sneaks back to the hotel in an unsuccessful attempt to steal the money. Meanwhile, Raymond and Orlinda dance together, then Paulo drives them back to the hotel. Paulo tells Orlinda about the safe. Raymond enjoys a passionate night with Orlinda, but wakes to find the money gone. Raymond tries to find Orlinda, believing she has been kidnapped along with the money. Realising it is Christmas Eve, Paulo helps Raymond find Orlinda at midnight mass. She confesses to stealing his money, but tells him she doesn't have it, as she owed money to a Mafia leader, Bichero. On leaving mass, Raymond sees Bichero handing out cash, and runs after Bichero's car, but is captured. Bichero is about to have him executed, but instead locks him in a safe and forces him to count Bichero's money.  On Christmas Day, Orlinda visits Raymond to give him a present. Raymond is still angry at the fact that she has ended him up in this situation. She tells him that she wished the money was only a small portion of what he owned and it wouldn't matter that she took it, and tells Raymond he's a "common [[criminal|crook]]". She tells Raymond not to give up hope. Raymond collects a large portion of the money and claims it is his. Orlinda then meets up with Paulo who takes his taxi and ties a rope to pull away at the bars of Raymond's prison.  Raymond decides he should return the money to the bank, as he still has enough time to get back to [[England]] and return the money to the vaults without anybody noticing it had gone. He quickly buys a ticket back to London and hires a taxi driver to rush him back to the bank. However, when he arrives, the police are all over the building. About to rush in and explain to the police inspector, he discovers that over the Christmas period, somebody tunnelled into the vault and swiped the remainder of the money. Confused and relieved, Raymond leaves the bank, intending to return to Rio. Catching a taxi, when a couple leave, he recognises them as his wife and Strothers who have evidently just returned from their holiday in [[Tenerife]]. He tells his wife he'll leave her the address of where he's living in Rio to send the [[divorce papers]], resigns from his job and goes back to Rio. He is next shown living with Orlinda and Paulo some years later with two babies and Bichero as his servant.  
God Is Brazilian
 Taoca, a part-time fisherman and small-time [[confidence trick|con artist]], finds a man holding on to a buoy in the middle of the ocean. The man claims he is [[God]], but Taoca doesn't believe him until he performs some miracles.  It seems God has decided to take a break and is searching for someone to temporarily take over. With Taoca, God travels the country in hopes of finding a new saint who is fit for the job. Along the way, they meet a woman, Madá, who joins the two in hopes they will take her to [[São Paulo]], where her mother has died.  Eventually, the trio comes across a young man who appears to have the right qualifications, except he has no belief in a higher power.  
The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai
 Sachiko Hanai ([[Emi Kuroda]]) works as a [[call girl]] or [[soapland|soap girl]] specializing in [[sexual roleplaying|sexual roleplay]], or [[cosplay]]. In her work, Sachiko portrays a home-tutor, hence the film's original title, ''Horny Home Tutor: Teacher's Love Juice''. While at a café after one job, she witnesses an altercation between two men, one a [[North Korea]]n and the other from the [[Middle East]], who turn out to be spies in the middle of a transaction. When the argument escalates to gun-play, Sachiko foolishly starts to take a cell-phone picture of the incident and is shot in the forehead. Rather than killing her, the bullet lodges in her brain and gives her extraordinary mental powers, including the ability to understand languages of which she previously had no knowledge, arcane philosophical insight, advanced mathematical knowledge, and [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]]. After fleeing from the scene, she finds a metal cylinder in her pocket which contains a cloned copy of the finger of United States President [[George W. Bush]].<ref>http://deezone.com/</ref><ref>http://deezone.com/2007/04/19/the-glamorous-life-of-sachiko-hanai/</ref><ref>http://fest06.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=35</ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref>http://twitchfilm.net/site/</ref><ref>http://wc03.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:249621</ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref>http://www.jposter.net/images/products/sachiko-hanai.jpg</ref><ref></ref><ref>http://www.nypost.com/seven/03182007/entertainment/movies/shes_gritty_in_pink_movies_v_a__musetto.htm</ref><ref></ref><ref>http://www.palmpictures.com/film/the-glamorous-life-of-sachiko-hanai.php</ref><ref>http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117930463.html?categoryid=31&cs=1&p=0</ref><ref>http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0715,hollis,76355,20.html</ref>  While waiting in Sachiko's house to reclaim the finger, the North Korean falls in love with her. Sachiko befriends and makes love to a philosophy professor and the professor hires her as his son's tutor. The professor's wife becomes suspicious and goes to a detective, who happens to be the man who shot Sachiko.

In the end he takes Sachiko and she uses her powers to direct them to a cave where they find a machine that can decide the fate of the world.<ref>Synopsis based on [http://www.palmpictures.com/film/the-glamorous-life-of-sachiko-hanai.php Official American website]  ''and''  (publisher : http://deezone.com/ deezone.com)</ref>  [http://www.palmpictures.com Palm Pictures] has the American distribution rights and has promoted the film with their own trailers while [http://www.argopictures.jp/lineup/hanai.html Argo Pictures] retains the original rights for Japan.

  While vacationing on the Greek Isle of Love, a repressed 30-year-old Stefania reluctantly plays chaperon to her precocious and sometimes annoying 14-year-old niece, Meggy, who plans to lose her virginity before the summer is over. Unbeknownst to Stefania, Meggy's chosen man is in fact Stefania's ex-boyfriend. Amidst a mélange of sun rash, broken diets, nervous girls, sleeping bags, orgasms, '80s music, and a little ginger and cinnamon, the two women discover themselves and their sexuality.  
Girl with a Pearl Earring (film)
 Griet ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) is a shy girl living in the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1665. Her father, a [[Delftware]] painter, has recently gone blind, rendering him unable to work and putting his family in a precarious financial situation. To help matters, Griet is sent to work as a [[maid]] in the household of famed painter [[Johannes Vermeer]] ([[Colin Firth]]). Griet works hard, almost wordlessly, in the lowest position in a harsh hierarchy. She does her best to adjust, despite the unkind treatment from Vermeer's daughter Cornelia. While she is on a routine shopping trip outside the house, a butcher's son, Pieter ([[Cillian Murphy]]), notices Griet and is drawn to her. However, she is slow to return his affections as their relationship develops.  As Griet cleans Vermeer's studio, which his wife Catharina ([[Essie Davis]]) never enters, the painter begins to converse with her and encourages her appreciation of painting, light and color. Vermeer gives her lessons in mixing paints and other tasks, taking care to keep this secret from his wife, who would react with anger and jealousy if she found out that her husband was spending time with Griet. In contrast, Vermeer's pragmatic mother-in-law, [[Maria Thins]] ([[Judy Parfitt]]), sees Griet as useful to Vermeer's career.  Vermeer's rich [[patron]], [[Pieter van Ruijven|Van Ruijven]] ([[Tom Wilkinson]]), notices Griet on a visit to the Vermeer household and asks the painter if he will give her up to work in his own house, a situation which "ruined" his former girl-maid. Vermeer refuses, but agrees to paint a portrait of Griet for Van Ruijven.  As Vermeer secretly works on the eponymous painting, Catharina cannot help but notice something is amiss. Her growing disdain for Griet becomes more apparent, spurred on by Van Ruijven's deliberate suggestions of an improper relationship between Vermeer and the young maid. A conflicted Griet must deal with her growing fascination with Vermeer and his talent,and subsequently fend off Van Ruijven, who attempts to rape her in the courtyard. Later, when Catharina is out for the day, her mother hands Griet her daughter's pearl earrings, and asks Vermeer to finish the painting. At the final painting session, Vermeer pierces Griet's left earlobe so she can wear one of the earrings for the portrait. The tension heightens considerably when Griet reacts to the pain, and Vermeer tenderly caresses her face. Griet then runs to Pieter to be consoled, and presumably distracted from her thoughts of Vermeer. They embrace and make love in a barn, where Pieter proposes marriage, but Griet unexpectedly leaves. She then returns the earrings to Catharina's mother.  Later, Catharina flies into a rage upon discovering Griet used her earrings. She storms into the studio, accuses her mother of complicity, and demands Vermeer show her the commissioned portrait. Offended by the intimate nature of the painting, Catharina dismisses it as "obscene," and tearfully asks why Vermeer won't paint her. When Vermeer responds, "Because you don't understand," she tries but fails to destroy the painting. She then banishes Griet from the house forever, to which Vermeer does not object, and lets Griet depart. Later, Griet is visited by Vermeer's house cook Tanneke, who comes bearing her a gift: the blue headscarf she wore in the painting, wrapped around Catharina's pearl earrings.   The film ends with a slow reveal of the real-life painting, [[Girl with a Pearl Earring|"Girl with a Pearl Earring]]."  
Good Bye, Lenin!
 The film is set in [[East Berlin]], from October 1989 to just after [[German reunification]] a year later.  Alex lives with his sister, Ariane, his mother, Christiane, and Ariane's infant daughter, Paula. (It appears that his father abandoned the family and fled to the West in 1978.) Christiane has become an ardent supporter of the ruling [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (the Party). On the other hand, Alex is disgusted with the drab celebration of East Germany's 40th anniversary and participates in an [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|anti-government demonstration]]. There he meets a girl, but they are separated by the [[Volkspolizei]] before they can properly introduce themselves.  When Christiane sees Alex being arrested, she suffers a near-fatal heart attack and falls into a coma. While visiting his mother in the hospital, Alex encounters the girl he met in the demonstration, Lara, a nurse from the [[Soviet Union]] who is caring for his mother. Alex and Lara soon begin dating and develop a close bond.  Shortly afterward, the [[Berlin Wall]] falls, [[Erich Honecker]] resigns from office, and capitalism comes to East Berlin. Alex loses his job as a TV repairman but is hired by a West German cable company. Alex is paired with Denis Domaschke, an aspiring West German filmmaker with whom Alex quickly becomes good friends. When Ariane's university closes, she works at a [[Burger King]] drive-through.  After eight months, Christiane awakens from her coma, but she is severely weakened and her doctor warns that any shock might cause another, possibly fatal, heart attack. Alex realises that the discovery of recent events would be too much for her to bear and decides to maintain the illusion that things are as before in the German Democratic Republic. To do so, Alex, Ariane, and Lara revert their West decor to the decor they previously had in the bedroom of their now bed-ridden mother in the family apartment, dress in their old clothes, and repackage new Western products in old East German jars. Their deception is successful, though increasingly complicated as Christiane occasionally witnesses strange occurrences, such as a gigantic [[Coca-Cola]] advertisement banner on an adjacent building that she sees through her bedroom window. With Denis' help, Alex edits old tapes of East German [[Aktuelle Kamera|news broadcasts]] and creates fake reports to explain these odd events.  Christiane eventually gains strength and wanders outside one day while Alex is asleep. She sees all her neighbours' old furniture piled up in the street, advertisements for Western corporations, and a statue of [[Lenin]] being flown away by a helicopter. Alex and Ariane quickly take her home and show her a fake report that East Germany is now accepting refugees from the West following a severe economic crisis there.  Soon after, the family goes to inspect their [[dacha]] in the countryside at Christiane's suggestion. While they are there along with Lara and Ariane's new Western boyfriend, Rainer, Christiane reveals her own secret: Her husband had fled because the Party had been increasingly oppressing him, and the plan had been for the rest of the family to join him. Christiane, fearing the government would take Alex and Ariane away from her if things went wrong, chose to stay. As she regrets the decision, Christiane relapses and is taken back to the hospital.  Alex meets his father, Robert, and convinces him to see Christiane one last time, stating he should say he was moved to return East to see his dying wife. Under pressure to reveal the truth about the fall of the East, Alex creates a final fake news segment, convincing a taxi driver (who is or resembles the cosmonaut [[Sigmund Jähn]], the first German in space and Alex's childhood hero) to act in the false news report as the new leader of East Germany and to give a speech about opening the borders to the West. However, Christiane already knows the truth (Lara tried to convince her about the real political developments earlier the same day). Nevertheless, she reacts fondly to her son's effort, without mentioning anything.  Christiane dies two days later: She outlives the GDR, passing away three days after full official German reunification. Alex, Ariane, Lara, Denis, and Robert scatter her ashes in the wind using an old toy rocket Alex made with his father during his childhood.  
Good Boy!
 Owen Baker ([[Liam Aiken]]) is a 12-year-old who has been working as the neighborhood dog-walker so he can earn the privilege of getting a dog of his own. Owen's hard work pays off when his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Baker ([[Kevin Nealon]] and [[Molly Shannon]]), let Owen adopt a scruffy Border Terrier that he names Hubble (voice of [[Matthew Broderick]]). Owen has little time to make lasting friends, due to his parents' renovation and reselling of houses, so he hopes Hubble will be his best friend.  Owen does have a friend named Connie Flemming (Brittany Moldowan), a girl his age who lives in the neighborhood, but he is also bullied by two boys named Frankie (Hunter Elliott) and Fred (Mikhael Speidel). Soon after the adoption of Hubble, Owen finds out that his new abnormally intelligent dog actually came from outer space. Owen wakes up the next morning to discover that he can now understand every word Hubble says—including the ominous phrase: "Take me to your leaders."  Owen learns that dogs came to Earth thousands of years ago to colonize and dominate the planet. Hubble, who is really named Canid 3942, has been sent by the powerful Greater Dane (voice of [[Vanessa Redgrave]]) on a mission from the Dog Star Sirius 7 to make sure dogs have fulfilled this destiny.  The dogs Owen walks include pampered [[Poodle]] Barbara Ann (voiced by [[Delta Burke]]), rambunctious [[Boxer (dog)|Boxer]] Wilson (voiced by [[Donald Faison]]), nervous [[Italian Greyhound]] Nelly (voiced by [[Brittany Murphy]]) and Connie's gassy [[Bernese Mountain Dog]] Shep (voiced by [[Carl Reiner]]).  Despite the best efforts of Owen and this rag-tag group of neighborhood dogs to convince Hubble that everything is fine with Earth's dogs, Hubble soon discovers the awful truth about Earth dogs: "You're all pets!" Things get worse when Hubble learns that the Greater Dane is headed for Earth to do her own inspection. If things don't look right, all dogs on Earth will be recalled to Sirius.  Owen and Hubble have to work together to prepare the neighborhood dogs for a visit from the Greater Dane and her Chinese Crested Dog henchman (voiced by [[Cheech Marin]]). Owen, Hubble, Connie, and their canine pals set out to whip the other dogs into shape so that they can pass muster.  Owen's efforts fail and the Greater Dane recalls all dogs from Earth. Upset, Owen repairs Hubble's communicator and sends him a message declaring how much he loves him. The Greater Dane hears the message and is left curious by it so she approaches Hubble for his opinion on why the dogs on Earth are subservient to humanity when they should be ruling it. Hubble believes that the dogs and humans have formed a bond of love and loyalty. When asked where his own loyalty lies, Hubble asks the Greater Dane to refer to him as Hubble rather than Canid 3942, showing his bond with Owen. As a result, the Greater Dane sends the Earth dogs back and declares them a separate species. Hubble is allowed to return as well, but on the condition that he removes Owen's ability to communicate with dogs. Owen's parents choose to remain in town for once and Hubble starts to fit in as an Earth dog.  
Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.
 In 2004, [[Mechagodzilla|Kiryu]] is undergoing repair modifications after its battle with [[Godzilla]] one year earlier. Prime Minister Hayato Igarashi accepts Lead Scientist Yoshito Chujo's choice to replace the Absolute Zero Cannon with a powerful Tri-Maser.  The Shobijin ([[Mothra]]'s twin [[fairy|fairies]]) warn the [[Japanese government]] that Godzilla continues returning to Japan because they used the original Godzilla's bones in Kiryu's design. If they return the bones to the bottom of the sea, Mothra would gladly take Kiryu's place in defending Japan, but if they do not, Mothra will declare war on humanity. Soon enough, Kamoebas, a giant [[mata mata]] turtle, is found washed ashore on a Japanese beach. It is determined by the wounds on Kamoebas' neck that Godzilla killed it. Godzilla and Mothra fight, but Godzilla seems to have the upper hand. With the repairs finished just in time, Kiryu manages to even the odds, but Godzilla still manages to knock both it and Mothra out.  Meanwhile, on Infant Island, two twin Mothra [[larva]]e hatch from Mothra's egg, and rush to help their mother. As Kiryu undergoes repairs again, the larvae try to hold Godzilla off, but Mothra sacrifices herself by flying in the way of Godzilla's [[ionizing radiation|atomic]] breath, saving the larvae. Just in time, Yoshito and the humans repair Kiryu, who stabs Godzilla's chest with a drill, causing Godzilla to bleed and roar in pain. The larvae begin to bind Godzilla up in silk. Just as Kiryu's pilot, Azusa Kisaragi, receives the order by Igarashi to destroy Godzilla before the Kiryu project is scrapped, Kiryu's soul is reawakened through Godzilla's roar. The [[cyborg]] lifts Godzilla and secures its grip with cables. Kiryu then uses its boosters to carry itself and Godzilla to the bottom of the ocean.  In the film's [[post-credits scene]], in an undisclosed location, a laboratory is shown, filled with canisters that contain the [[DNA]] of numerous [[Toho]] [[kaiju]]. It is stated in the Japanese version via a narrator announcing that a "bio-formation" experiment involving an "extinct subject" is about to take place, implying that the JXSDF plans to create another mecha or kaiju-based superweapon, which could mean that Godzilla or another monster could appear once again. In the Japanese version, Godzilla and Kiryu are seen one more time, roaring as they descend into the ocean.  
A Good Lawyer's Wife
 Ju Yeong-jak ([[Hwang Jung-min]]) is a successful lawyer who works long hours. While he is working, his wife Eun Ho-jeong ([[Moon So-ri]]), who gave up her dancing career in order to be "a good lawyer's wife," raises their young adopted son (Kim Young-chan) and works as a dance instructor in the local gym.  Ju Yeong-jak's father, Ju Chang-geun ([[Kim In-mun]]), an [[alcoholic]] with a terminal [[liver failure]], has not slept with his wife Hong Byung-han ([[Youn Yuh-jung]]) in 15 years. She is having an affair with another man, and when Chang-geun finally dies, she tells Yeong-jak and Ho-jeong about her relationship with the other man—an old friend from her grade school—and says that she even plans to marry him. Her daughter-in-law Ho-jeong supports her.  Ho-jeong herself cannot achieve an [[orgasm]] from Yeong-jak. But for reasons that are not made clear in the English subtitles, he is not satisfied by her either and is having an affair with Kim Yeon, a younger woman who is an artist and a former model ([[Baek Jeong-rim]]). He receives from Yeon the satisfaction he lacks at home.  When Ho-jeong catches her teenage neighbor Shin Ji-woon ([[Bong Tae-gyu]]) [[Voyeurism|peeping]] on her undressing in her apartment, she is, at first, angered. But she then decides to fulfill his peeping wish and allows him to see her doing nude gymnastics through the window. He then follows her on his bike and even barges into her dance class. She eventually follows him to the cinema where they talk. As they watch a movie, she teases him by acting oblivious to him groping her breasts.  Meanwhile, Yeong-jak runs a drunk motor cyclist off the road while receiving a [[Fellatio|blowjob]] from his young [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. Yeong-jak takes the man to a hospital but drops off his girlfriend on the way; his primary concern is that the presence of his girlfriend not become public knowledge. Due to the other driver's reputation as a quarrelsome eccentric alcoholic, the authorities assume that the other driver is entirely responsible for the crash.   Yeong-jak promises the man ([[Sung Ji-ru]]), a postman who needs to be able to drive to keep his job, that if the postman does not mention that there was a woman in the car he will use his legal connections to make sure that the man does not suffer any consequences for having been driving while drunk.    One evening, after she Ho-jeong finally learns about her husband's affair, she tells Ji-woon to follow her without giving any details except suggestively saying "I hope you'll be okay." She takes him to the abandoned dance hall. Without exchanging a word, she just allows him to mount her, but he soon stops and rolls aside (apparently the victim of [[premature ejaculation]]). Not giving up, she fellates him. She then [[Woman on top (sex position)|mounts him herself]] while at the same time giving him a [[handjob]], moving in [[spasm]]s and moaning loudly as she finally gains her long sought orgasm.  Ji-woon's father soon finds out about their affair and exposes it to Yeong-jak, unaware that Yeong-jak apparently does not care what his wife does. However, Yeong-jak fails to keep his promise to the postman. The postman kidnaps Yeong-jak's adopted son and throws him off a building to his death. The postman then commits suicide.  Yeong-jak and Ho-jeong are devastated by their son's death. Ho-jeong blames Yeong-jak for starting the chain of circumstances that ended with the murder/suicide.  The story ends on an enigmatic note. Ho-jeong discovers than she is pregnant and knows that Yeong-jak cannot be the father. He offers to accept the child as his own but she informs him that he is "out of the picture."  It is unclear from the final scene if Yeong-jak is hurt or relieved by her announcement.  The story also addresses the legacy of the [[Korean War]] and its impact on many families. Yeong-jak's father and grandfather escaped from the [[North Korea|communist north]]—apparently during the war. Yeong-jak's grandmother and his father's sisters remained in the north and "perished". Yeong-jak's father is last seen in the final stages of [[dementia]] singing a communist anthem honoring North Korean leader [[Kim Il-sung]].   Yeong-jak goes out into the country to inform his grandfather of the death and discovers that his grandfather has been dead for six months, and that his grandfather's young female companion had not notified the other members of the family.  There is also a subplot about the excavation of a mass grave containing the remains of Korean civilians who were killed—apparently by the communists—during the Korean War.  
Gods and Generals (film)
 Colonel [[Robert E. Lee]] resigns from the Union Army as the south secedes from the Union and both sides prepare for war. Major Jackson, who is a professor at [[Virginia Military Institute]] in Lexington at the outset of the war, leaves his family behind to do battle at Manassas Junction. Jackson is asked by a retreating General [[Barnard Elliott Bee, Jr.|Barnard Bee]] for assistance against the Federal army who is pursuing them after a brief stand on Matthews Hill. In rallying his shaken troops, Bee launches the name of Stonewall into history and the Confederates rout the Federals at [[Henry House Hill]]. Jackson maintains steadfast discipline in his ranks during the battle despite suffering a wound to his left hand from a spent ball.  Meanwhile, Chamberlain makes his transition from teacher to military officer and practices drilling his soldiers, and is taught military tactics by Col. [[Adelbert Ames]], the commander of the [[20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment]]. He is called to battle at the Union invasion of Fredericksburg. The Southern forces lead a fighting retreat as the Union army crosses the river and storms the town, and there are scenes of the subsequent looting of Fredricksburg by the Union Army. Outside the city, Lee, [[James Longstreet]] and Jackson have prepared an elaborate defense on [[Marye's Heights]] outside the town, and the movie focuses on Confederate defenses  behind a formidable stone wall. Several Union brigades, including the [[Irish Brigade (U.S.)|Irish Brigade]], attempt to cross an open field and attack the wall, but are thrown back with heavy losses by Confederate rifle and artillery fire. At one point, two [[Ireland|Irish]] units are forced into battle against one another, to the anguish of a Southern Irishman who believes he is killing his kin. Chamberlain leads an unsuccessful attack against Longstreet's defenses, led by Brig. Gen. [[Lewis Armistead]] and finds his unit pinned down in the open field. He survives by shielding himself with a corpse until nightfall; eventually he and surviving members of 20th Maine are ordered to retreat and spend 2 nights on the battlefield, sleeping with the dead. Chamberlain and the defeated Union soldiers depart Fredericksburg. Jackson and Lee return to the city, and Lee is confronted by an angry citizen whose house has been destroyed by Union artillery.  Jackson spends the rest of the winter at a local plantation, [[Moss Neck Manor]], where he develops a friendship with a girl who lives there. Later, Jackson discovers the child has died from [[scarlet fever]] and he begins to cry. A soldier asks why he weeps for this child but not for the thousands of dead soldiers, and another soldier states that Jackson is weeping for everyone. Jackson is soon reunited with his wife and newborn child just before the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]].  Outside Chancellorsville, Lee identifies that the southern army faces an opposing force almost twice their size. Jackson calls upon his chaplain, Beverly Tucker Lacy who knows the area, and asks him to find a route by which the southern forces can infiltrate in secret.

Goldfish Memory
 The movie is set around a small group of characters experiencing relationships which build and crumble before the viewers' eyes. The title of the film refers to the belief, expressed by several of characters, that the goldfish retains a memory of something for only three seconds. Tom, one of the principal characters in the film, draws comparisons between this and the human tendency to jump from one relationship to the next, "forgetting" the pain that any previous one might have caused. The film shows complexities involved in straight, gay, lesbian, and bisexual relationships. Writer/director Liz Gill says the film was influenced by the work of directors [[Robert Altman]] and [[Richard Linklater]], particularly Linklater's film ''[[Slacker (film)|Slacker]]''.  
Gothika
 Dr. Miranda Grey is a psychiatrist who works at the Woodward Penitentiary For Women, and has a car accident after trying to avoid hitting a girl standing in the middle of the road during a stormy night. She rushes to try to help the girl. The girl turns out to be a [[ghost]] who possesses Miranda's body. Miranda wakes up as a patient in the hospital where she works, and receives treatment from her colleague, Dr. Pete Graham. Drugged and confused, Miranda has no memory of what happened after the car accident. She is horrified to learn that her husband, Douglas, was brutally murdered and that she is the prime suspect. While Miranda copes with life in the hospital, the ghost uses her body to carry out tasks, most noticeably, carving the words "Not Alone" into Miranda's arm, which leads her former colleagues to believe Miranda is suicidal and is inflicting the wounds on herself.  As a patient, Miranda bonds with fellow inmate and her own former patient, Chloe Sava. Several times in sessions with Miranda, Chloe claimed that she'd been raped while in the hospital, but she had always attributed these stories to mental illness. One night, the door to Miranda's room in the hospital is opened by the ghost that has been haunting her. When she passes Chloe's room in the hospital, she can hear the rape occurring, and momentarily sees a man's chest pressed against the window. The man's chest bears a tattoo of an [[Anima Sola]]. Miranda realizes that Chloe was not making up these stories and, when she sees Chloe the next day, she apologizes and the two embrace. Chloe warns Miranda that her attacker said he was going to target Miranda next. Miranda begins regaining some of her memories bit by bit and slowly comes to remember herself killing her husband. She realizes that the ghost had used her body to murder Douglas, thus making Miranda the patsy for his murder. This is why all of the physical evidence points to Miranda.  Miranda escapes from the hospital, having recognized the girl as a ghost. Seeking clues to the mystery of why she killed her husband, she goes to a farmhouse in Willow Creek, Rhode Island. In the cellar of the barn, she discovers a room containing a blood-stained bed, what appears to be a box containing drugs, restraints, and video equipment. She watches the tape that is still in the camera and the viewer hears a woman screaming as if tortured or raped. In the final seconds of the video, Douglas walks into the shot, covers a woman's lifeless body on the bed with a sheet, and winks at the camera. At this point, police arrive and one officer comes closer to Miranda and draws a gun on her while she is holding a knife to him. Miranda backs up to a staircase and, all of a sudden, an injured, frantically screaming girl grabs hold of her from the adjoining crawlspace. The police release the girl, and Miranda is taken to jail.  While she is in jail, Sheriff Ryan, who was Douglas's closest friend, talks to Miranda and quizzes her on how she knew all these things. He does not believe her claim that ghosts told her everything, and asks her what sort of person the accomplice would be. Miranda uses her experience as a psychiatrist to give a psychological profile, and as she does so, realizes that Ryan fits the profile perfectly. He attacks her, and in the fight reveals his tattoo (an [[Anima Sola]]). Miranda kills the sheriff in an act of self-defense with the help of the ghost. Pete, just a few seconds later, shows up at the station, worried about Miranda's safety after he solves the mystery himself. He looks relieved to see Miranda safe, and through the soundproof window mouths the words "I'm sorry, Miranda."  Approximately a year later, Miranda is seen walking with Chloe on a city sidewalk, discussing how each helped the other come to terms with her experiences. Miranda claims to be free of the ghost's influence and sends Chloe off in a taxi. Miranda then sees a young boy standing in the middle of the road who appears as though he is about to be struck by a fire truck. Miranda yells for the boy to move, but after the fire truck passes through the boy without harming him, she realizes he was only a ghost. As Miranda walks away, a poster with the words "Have you seen Tim?" and a picture of the same boy is shown taped to a pole next to the street on which Miranda is walking.

Green Tea (film)
 A conservative Beijing [[graduate student]] name '''Wu Fang''' ([[Zhao Wei]]) goes on a series of [[wiktionary:blind date|blind dates]]. Sensitive to slights and the advances of the men, she often becomes offended and leaves halfway through the dates, though sometimes it is the men who leave first, annoyed by her behavior. On one date she meets '''Chen Minglian''' ([[Jiang Wen]]), whose fiancee had recently left him after having an affair with another man. Their initial date is an unmitigated disaster. Mingliang discusses her fortune-telling friend who Mingliang scoffs at, and Wu Fang walks out when Mingliang asks her how many previous boyfriends she has had. When he chases after her suggesting that they get a room in the local hotel, she slaps him and takes a taxi to get away from him. However, Mingliang pursues Fang who, while initially resistant, agrees to go on additional dates with Mingliang.  During these dates, Fang begins to relate the tale of her friend's parents. The mother was a cosmetic artist for the dead in a funeral home, a fact that she had kept secret from her husband. When the father finally discovered the truth, he went nearly mad and descended into alcoholism. According to Fang, the father would drink to excess and beat both his wife and his daughter, often claiming that the wife's hands (and her profession) had destroyed his life. Over the course of several of their dates, Fang tells Mingliang that the mother eventually killed the father accidentally while resisting one of his attacks and was imprisoned for ten years. At times Fang suggests that she has made the story up, though Mingliang seems to remain entranced by the tale.  At the same time, Mingliang's artist friend Jun has been trying to set him up with a sultry lounge singer in a club. The singer, named '''Lang Lang''' (also Zhao Wei) bears a striking resemblance to Wu Fang but dresses far more provocatively and has no trouble with men. Mingliang tries to get Lang Lang to admit she is Fang, but eventually settles into the idea that she is a different woman. The two share several conversations where they discuss life and love, though Mingliang remains enraptured by the graduate student rather than the lounge singer. Finally Wu Fang agrees to become Mingliang's girlfriend. But when Jun has a dinner party planned, Wu Fang is nowhere to be found. Mingliang asks Lang Lang to pose as his girlfriend for just the night. During dinner, Lang Lang reads the fortune of Jun's girlfriend, revealing her to be shallow and manipulative. When the girlfriend gets too drunk, Jun slaps her. Lang Lang walks up to Jun and slaps him in return, telling him she hates men who strike women (something she shares with Wu Fang).  The film ends ambiguously. Laughing, Mingliang takes Lang Lang and they get a hotel room. At the same time, a conversation where Mingliang explains why he likes Fang is replayed on the soundtrack.

The next day Svend tells Bjarne that the nurse was his latest victim, and to throw out the rotten chicken meat. Eigil takes the dead chickens  to the cemetery to bury them, where Astrid finds him and befriends him. Bjarne then visits Astrid at the church and leaves when he sees Eigil there.  At the church, as Astrid and Eigil are tending to the chickens, Reverend Villumsen and Holger summon Astrid to the reverend's office. They tell Astrid that they believe the butchers are murdering people, and Holger reveals the details of the accident that claimed Bjarne's family. Astrid takes Eigil to the butcher shop with some dead chickens.  When Bjarne does not find Astrid at the church, he stops by the butcher shop. He finds out that Svend locked Astrid and Eigil in the freezer. Astrid leaves upset, and Bjarne threatens Svend, who escapes. The next day Svend does not show up at the shop and Bjarne opens without any human meat to sell. Instead, he prepares "chicky-wickies" with regular chicken. Holger and the public health authorities arrive and shut the shop down. Svend arrives and nearly confesses to the murders. The health authorities do not find any evidence of foul play and leave. Out in the alley, Bjarne tells Svend that the chicky-wickies were popular because of the marinade, rather than the fact that it was human flesh.

Haggard: The Movie
 The film's protagonist, Ryan ([[Ryan Dunn]]) is devastated and depressed after his girlfriend Glauren (Jenn Rivell) breaks up with him. Ryan believes she is seeing someone else and attempts to call Glauren several times, to which she finally returns his calls to reveal that she is in fact seeing someone named Hellboy ([[Rake Yohn]]), but denies sleeping with him; however Ryan does not believe her. He runs to the local coffee house where he finds his friend, Valo ([[Bam Margera]]), to explain what happened. After he attacks a customer for "taunting" him, Ryan requests that Valo vandalize Glauren's house, and he will pay him and Falcone ([[Brandon DiCamillo]]) 100 dollars each to do it. Valo then suggests that he should try and talk to some other girls. Ryan tries his luck with a girl in the coffee house, but after he insults her, she stabs him in the eye with a fork, which leaves him screaming in pain and he passes out on the floor. He now has to wear an eyepatch until his eye heals.  Valo seeks out Falcone, who is in his basement working on the "Reverse Microwave" (a microwave oven that now cools things down) for an upcoming Invention of the Future contest. After Valo explains Ryan's request, Falcone agrees to vandalize Glauren's house only because he needs the 100 dollars to buy Freon to get the invention working. At Glauren's house, Falcone defecates in the gas tank of Glauren's car and has Valo duct tape Don Vito's ([[Vincent Margera]]) feces to her garage door. They are interrupted by the sudden arrival of Glauren and Hellboy, forcing Valo to hide in some nearby bushes. Hellboy ends up urinating into the bushes, onto Valo's face, as Falcone watches from the roof in amusement. After returning to collect their reward from Ryan, they discover that he got a pathetic tattoo of a rhino, only because Glauren loves rhinos. Over the next few days, he sinks deeper into depression, much to the annoyance of Don Vito, whose house Ryan lives in.  While Falcone picks up his idiot cousin Raab ([[Chris Raab]]) from the train station, Valo seeks advice from Dooli ([[Brandon Novak]]) and Naked Dave ([[CKY Crew|David DeCurtis]]) about some stress-relief solutions for Ryan. Naked Dave suggests that Ryan should break bottles behind a Wawa convenience store. Ryan gets arrested for it, but after hearing about his problem, the arresting cop ([[Tony Hawk]]) gives him a break (as the cop is going through the same problem as Ryan with his "soon-to-be-ex-wife").  Still depressed and not convinced that Glauren didn't sleep with Hellboy, Ryan gives Valo a video camera and asks for him to break into Glauren's house to find and record any evidence of her sleeping with Hellboy. Falcone agrees to go along with the break-in, and suggests that Raab be the getaway driver. Valo reluctantly agrees (as he hates Raab because of his voice, his laugh, his stupidity, and a grunting noise he makes throughout the film). In an attempt to patch up their relationship, Ryan and Glauren meet for a date and decide to get back together, but Ryan is unable to contact Valo to call off the break-in.  Right after Ryan leaves from escorting her home, Glauren runs off with Hellboy to a bonfire with his friends. At that time, Valo and Falcone break in and start recording their findings with the video camera, such as a dildo in her drawers and pages of her diary which Falcone reads aloud. Unfortunately, Glauren and Hellboy return home early, forcing Valo and Falcone to hide in her closet and watch as they have sex. Upon Hellboy noticing the video camera left on the dresser, Valo and Falcone make a speedy escape with the camera to Raab's car and get away, but not before Falcone sustains a beating from a pursuing Hellboy. Meeting them at Valo's place, a happier Ryan tells them he is convinced that his relationship with Glauren is restored. They show him the footage from the break-in (including Hellboy and Glauren having sex), at which point, he becomes angry at Glauren's betrayal. Valo and Falcone tell him not to worry, as they have a plan set up to get revenge on Hellboy.  After Falcone (in disguise) falsely informs Hellboy that a new album from the band [[Gnarkill]] was released at the music shop Record Bin, Falcone prank calls the Record Bin owner, Cactus ([[Jason Ellis (radio host)|Jason Ellis]]), insulting the band (which Cactus loves). Upon arriving at the shop, Hellboy gets attacked by an enraged Cactus, thinking that it was Hellboy who called him, while Ryan, Valo, and Falcone look on through the shop's door. Hellboy spots them and engages the trio in a lengthy chase which forces them to split up. Ryan hides in a taxi with Heather ([[Angie Cuturic]]), who eventually becomes his new girlfriend, Valo barely escapes with the timely intervention of a skateboard arranged by Dooli, Falcone ends up in a junkyard full of refrigerators (containing the Freon he's been looking for), and Hellboy is run over by the taxi holding Ryan and Heather.  While Ryan and Heather's romance blossoms, Falcone is able to finish the Reverse Microwave to enter for the invention contest, winning the first place prize of a mountain bike covered with diamonds. At the after-party, while Falcone shows off his bike, Glauren arrives in an attempt to seduce Ryan; Ryan rejects her with a simple dismissal of "fuck off". She storms off angrily, but not before she randomly slaps Valo and pushes and shoves a few men. Glauren is then accompanied by a lesbian, while Ryan remains happily with his new lover. Upset that his date didn't show up and everything is working out fine for his friends, Valo finds an acquaintance from the contest, Ali ([[Olivia Hammond]]), who invites him back to her house, where they begin to make out. During this time, Ryan makes out with Heather and Glauren and the lesbian make out as well, with Glauren becoming a lesbian herself. Unfortunately for Valo, an injured and heavily bandaged Hellboy arrives, revealing himself to be Ali's brother, and Valo hastily escapes through a window. The next day, Valo and Falcone are seen sitting on a park bench, where they laugh about Valo's experience with Hellboy and Ryan going through the same exact problem with Heather. They then walk away, happy that everything is as it should be.

Fast-forward to the current day, when several student football players (who are also school bullies) are mysteriously becoming gravely ill. Just before falling into a coma, each victim is heard screaming the spirit's name, Abel Frye.

Unbeknownst to the rest of the school, Norman Bloom, a young geek Elisha befriended, is Frye's nephew. In retaliation for the bullying and mistreatment inflicted on the different students, Bloom exacts revenge on the popular football players.   Bloom's plan includes gaining access to the locker of each targeted bully and placing a deadly male spider, trapped in a straw, inside the locker. Bloom then gives the bully tainted money, upon which he has secretly placed trace amounts of female spider [[pheromone]]s. When the unsuspecting bully reaches into his locker, the waiting male spider is easily attracted to the pheromones, and then crawls out and bites the student. Among the effects of the toxin, the affected students experience hallucinations, believing that the ghost of Abel Frye is after them.   At one point, Bloom accidentally puts an additional female spider in one of the straws, which results in thousands of deadly spiders overtaking the school. Elisha Springfield, attending the school undercover as a student, eventually figures out the mystery and the diabolical plot designed by Norman Bloom. In fear of being discovered, Bloom attempts to keep his involvement in the haunting hidden by poisoning both himself and Elisha with a spider, hoping that they will both die. When Elijah figures out that Bloom is behind the sinister attacks in the school, he races to find his sister and the Springfield family rush to professor and scientist Dr. Algernon Wheeling (played by [[Frank Peretti|Peretti]]), who saves Elisha with an [[antivenom]]. In the end, the students at Rogers High School are protected not only from haunting and harm from others, but from the harm brought on by their own hatred and fear, as well.

Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi
 The film opens at [[Hindu College, University of Delhi|Hindu College]], [[Delhi]] with the story of three students, Siddharth Tyabji ([[Kay Kay Menon]]), Geeta Rao ([[Chitrangada Singh]]) and Vikram Malhotra ([[Shiney Ahuja]]).  Siddharth is a driven revolutionary who dreams of bringing a revolution in the state of [[Bihar]] that will end the [[caste]]-based discrimination there, bring social justice, and improve society. Geeta is a London-returned, South Indian in love with the firebrand Siddharth. She has led a very sheltered life and is yet to explore the terrain of the Indian socio-political landscape. While she finds Siddharth's [[Naxalite]] rhetoric attractive, she is not sure if she can whole-heartedly subscribe to it. Every time they come to a choice, Siddharth chooses his ideology over his love for her thus breaking her heart time and again. Vikram is a middle-class boy who dreams of making it big, whatever the cost. He is particularly afflicted by his father's Gandhian ideas, but irritated and frustrated at the same time, seeing his father's way of life as ineffective in bringing about change.  Siddharth leaves for Bihar to bring about a revolution; Geeta leaves for [[Oxford]] to get a degree; and Vikram sets up an office in Delhi.  A few years later, Vikram is a fixer in the power corridors of government, Geeta is married to promising [[Indian Administrative Service|IAS]] Officer Arun Mehta ([[Ram Kapoor]]) who, as Geeta says "has it all", and Siddharth is still trying to foment a revolution. But all is not as it seems. Below the mask of happiness, each is quite unhappy. Vikram has 'made it' but he cannot get Geeta, the love of his life. Geeta is married, but she meets Siddharth on the sly, cheating on her husband.  Geeta gets a divorce from her husband because of her love for Siddharth, even though she does not want to hurt her husband's feelings. Geeta joins Siddharth in the village and starts to teach the children, whilst the police repeatedly try to hunt down her now husband, Siddharth. She bears a child with Siddharth whom she sends to her parents in London since she believes he deserves more than to grow up in the remote village.  Eventually the police round up the entire village, capturing Siddharth and Geeta for intent to cause unrest and brutally assaulting them — fabricating a story of a villagers' riot to explain their injuries. Geeta is bailed out of prison by her now influential ex-husband. Siddharth, on the run, is shot by the police, admitted to a local hospital, and placed under arrest while Geeta believes him to have been killed.  Vikram, who has been consoling Geeta and taking care of her during the absences of her ex-husband and of Siddharth, is informed that Siddharth is alive. Vikram travels to meet Siddharth and release him using his influential contacts. However, he has an accident on the way and is admitted to the same hospital as Siddharth. During the night, local Naxalites break into the crude hospital and free Siddharth while Vikram lays there. The next morning, the policemen in charge of guarding Siddharth, frustrated, accuse Vikram of having conspiring to free Siddharth and beat him up. After discovering that he is a man of influence, they resolve to kill him and dump his body to make it unrecognisable. Vikram, terrifed, attempts to escape but is chased down. The policeman finds that the Naxalites have emptied his revolver and they beat Vikram with an iron rod. Soon, the police chief and a local politician come looking for Vikram and are able to stop the police from killing him.  Vikram suffers heavy brain damage and is rendered handicapped, while Siddharth tells Geeta that he intends to leave. Geeta refuses to accompany him. Siddharth has moved beyond simply trying to foment a revolution. He is prepared to delay it because he feels that the people are not ready in spite of their saying otherwise. He goes to London to study medicine and, through a letter, voices his anguish and disillusion with the idea of revolution, writing "I hope the mysteries of the human body will be less confusing" (in reference to his studying medicine and quitting the revolution).  The last scenes shows Geeta working in the village and taking care of the handicapped Vikram, who can no longer speak. The movie ends with Vikram writing "I love you Geeta" on a rock, as they sit by a placid lake and watch the sunset.

As he lies down on the sidewalk in front of a store saying "Jews Welcome (for about 5 minutes)" and spins his [[dreidel]] to cheer himself up, Santa Claus walks by and crushes the toy under his foot, then gives Mordechai the [[middle finger|finger]].  The scene then changes to the present with Mordechai as the Hebrew Hammer, a Certified [[Male circumcision|Circumcised]] [[Detective|Dick]] who has dedicated his life to defending Jews. His snappy dress (a cross between that of a pimp and a [[Hasidic Jew]]) and tough-guy demeanor have made him a local hero within the Jewish community. Jews and African-Americans have enjoyed a tenuous peace with the White Christians over the previous few decades, because the current Santa (the son of the cruel Santa who stomped Mordechai's dreidel years earlier) has pursued a policy of inclusion and tolerance.  This Santa is murdered and replaced by his son, Damian, who seeks to destroy Hanukkah and Kwanzaa thus reserving December for Christmas alone. Mordechai is reluctantly recruited to stop Damian, gaining allies along the way, including love interest and daughter of the Chief of the Jewish Justice League Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal and the Kwanzaa Liberation Front's leader Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim.

One of them would kid around telling him about his goat named Stubos that got away again and he chases it to a cave where the goddesses [[Hera]], [[Athena]], and [[Aphrodite]] appear. [[Hera]] offered him power while [[Athena]] offers her victory yet he chooses [[Aphrodite]], who promises him the love of the most beautiful woman in the world.  Meanwhile, in [[Sparta]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] sees Paris's judgement in a pool of water and happily accepts his choice of her love. She later meets the Mycenaean King, [[Agamemnon]], who has come to claim her sister, [[Clytemnestra]], as his bride, but is also immediately taken by [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]'s attractiveness. During the wedding feast, after she noticed that everyone seems to be staring at her including [[Agamemnon]] and [[Menelaus]], his brother, she is kidnapped by two Athenians. Helen learns the truth of her mother's death from [[Theseus]], one of the men who kidnapped her, then they took her to [[Athens]], where she falls for him, before her brother [[Pollux (mythology)|Pollux]] raids [[Athens]] and kills him in order to save her. As he is dying, [[Theseus]] stabs [[Pollux (mythology)|Pollux]]. In Sparta, [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]'s father [[Tyndareus]] rages at his daughter, blaming her for losing his heir. He presents her to the many suitors who seek her hand, bidding them to do as they wish.  The suitors draw lots after swearing an oath suggested by clever [[Odysseus]] that if anyone disrespect her husband's claims to her, they should unite and wage war against him. [[Odysseus]] rules himself and [[Agamemnon]] out of the lot, since they are both married. They agree to the oath and [[Agamemnon]]'s brother [[Menelaus]] wins. [[Agamemnon]] is visibly jealous.  Meanwhile, Paris' favorite bull is taken for the Trojan tribute games. Paris insists on competing, despite his father's protests. After winning in every competition and being recognized by his sister [[Cassandra]], Paris is welcomed by an overjoyed to [[Troy]]. [[Cassandra]], a seer, as well as his elder brother [[Hector]] are upset at their father's decision.  Paris is sent to [[Sparta]] to draw out a peace treaty with [[Sparta]], [[Menelaus]] alone, which angers [[Agamemnon]]. His treaty is refused and both [[Menelaus]] and [[Agamemnon]] plot to have him murdered. While there, however, he encounters and recognizes Helen, while Menelaus is showing off his new bride by having her walk naked through one of his feasts.  Paris later prevents her from committing suicide. He then gains her love and she helps him flee. Together they sail to [[Troy]].  When [[Menelaus]] finds this out, he demands that his brother launch war on [[Troy]] and the former suitors are gathered to fulfill their oath. But the winds are not in their favor and after a month, it is revealed that the goddess [[Artemis]] wants [[Agamemnon]] to sacrifice his daughter in return for favorable winds. He carries out the deed, despite a heavy heart.  Helen and Paris arrive at [[Troy]] with the Greek army at their heels. The Greeks send an embassy of [[Menelaus]] and [[Odysseus]] to demand Helen's return. [[Priam]] is at first reluctant to allow Helen to remain at [[Troy]] until he talks to her alone where she admits her love for Paris. [[Priam]] refuses, thus the Greeks plan an attack.  In the morning, the battle is joined on the beach of [[Troy]], with [[Hector]] nearly killed by [[Agamemnon]]. The battle ends with the Trojan army's crushing defeat and the Greeks camping on the beach.  Ten years pass. [[Agamemnon]] agrees to end the war with a single combat, between [[Menelaus]] and Paris. If [[Menelaus]] wins, Helen will be returned. If [[Menelaus]] loses, the Trojans may keep her. Whatever the outcome, the Greeks have to leave [[Troy]].  [[Agamemnon]] cheats, poisoning [[Menelaus]]' javelin without telling him. During the duel Paris is cut and the poison disorients him. [[Menelaus]], however, does not take advantage of him; instead, they stop fighting and make peace between each other as a fog obscures them from view.  As the fog lifts, [[Agamemnon]]'s cheating is exposed. [[Hector]] challenges [[Agamemnon]] to a duel that will end the war—this time, to the death. [[Achilles]] takes up the challenge, fighting for Agamemnon, but agrees to fight not for Helen but for his own honor. [[Achilles]] easily succeeds in killing [[Hector]].  That night Helen, fearing for Paris's safety, goes to the seer [[Cassandra]] and asks to know what she can do to protect Paris. [[Cassandra]] replies that her only choice is to give herself to the Greeks. Helen agrees, presenting herself in [[Agamemnon]]'s tent and offering a trade—her for the body of [[Hector]]. [[Agamemnon]] refuses, as he does not want his daughter's death to be in vain, as well as chases her around the camp, but Paris arrives in time to save her, challenging [[Agamemnon]] for the safety of [[Troy]]. [[Achilles]] charges at him, but Paris seizes a bow and shoots [[Achilles]] in the heel, killing him. Afterwards the Greeks attack him, but he is saved by Trojan soldiers and is reunited with Helen. Shortly thereafter, [[Agamemnon]] finds and stabs Paris. He dies in Helen's arms.  During Paris' funeral, the Greeks are reported to have sailed away—leaving a Trojan Horse, a massive wooden horse, on the shore. It is taken into the city and Troy celebrates late into the night. Unbeknownst to them though, there are some Greek soldiers inside the wooden horse. When they are all asleep, the Greeks come out and sack the city, slaying [[Priam]] and [[Hecuba]]. The great [[Agamemnon]] seats himself proudly on [[Troy]]'s throne as the new emperor of the Aegean and ruler of the World. [[Agamemnon]] has his men bring Helen to his throne. [[Agamemnon]] strokes Helen's hair, restrains her and then begins to rape her. [[Menelaus]] tries to stop him, but is held back by [[Agamemnon]]'s guards. [[Odysseus]] is also shocked at [[Agamemnon]]'s act, but can do nothing.  The next morning, as the Greek soldiers ravage the ruins of [[Troy]] of its riches and take its people as slaves, [[Clytemnestra]] arrives in the royal palace of [[Troy]], where she ventures into the royal pool. There, she finds [[Agamemnon]] and [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], both naked. [[Agamemnon]] relaxes in triumph, while Helen sits near the pool, not saying a word. [[Clytemnestra]] covers her sister with a robe and sends her away, leaving her alone with [[Agamemnon]]. She tells him she comes for their daughter, [[Iphigenia]]. [[Agamemnon]] replies that she is not here. [[Clytemnestra]] replies "I know" then attacks, throwing her net-like shawl over her husband and stabs him repeatedly to death in the pool.  [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] wanders woefully through the ruined city, halting at the spot where Paris was slain. There, she sees an apparition of Paris and they embrace. Helen begs Paris to take her with him to the afterlife and he tells her that he has prepared a place for her, but she must wait until it is her time. He disappears and [[Menelaus]] arrives and draws his sword out. Helen prepares for her punishment, but [[Menelaus]] put his sword back and can do nothing but feel sorry for her. Helen tells him she cannot love him, but she "will follow". The two head back to the Greek ships, ready to live the rest of their lives as king and queen of [[Sparta]], leaving [[Troy]], a kingdom that was once the richest of all, in ruins.

In between creating her art projects, Angélique works part-time at a cafe and house-sits for a wealthy vacationing family. Her friend David ([[Clément Sibony]]) disapproves of her affair with Loïc, who is married, but she insists that Loïc will leave his wife for her.  When Loïc's wife, Rachel ([[Isabelle Carré]]), has a [[miscarriage]], the pair separate and Angélique prepares to leave with Loïc on a romantic getaway to [[Florence]]. However, Loïc doesn't meet Angélique at the airport, having chosen to mend things with his wife. This throws Angélique into a self-destructive cycle of [[clinical depression]], losing her job and scholarship. While watching the news one night, she learns that Loïc has been arrested for assaulting one of his patients, Sonia Jasmin (Nathalie Krebs). She goes to Sonia's house to convince her to drop the charges and, in the ensuing scuffle, Sonia has a heart attack and dies. Thinking this will win Loïc back, Angélique steals from the house to make it look like a robbery. Instead, Loïc is arrested for Sonia's murder. Angélique, after witnessing Loïc embrace his wife as he is dragged away, returns home, turns on the gas oven, and lies down on the floor to commit [[suicide]].  At this point the film rewinds to the opening scene when Angélique bought the pink rose. This time the film follows the delivery boy and the subsequent events play out from Loïc's viewpoint.  Loïc receives the pink rose and assumes that his wife sent it to him. It is revealed that Loïc barely knows Angélique and that they cross paths only because Angélique is [[house-sitting]] for Loïc and Rachel's neighbor. Loïc receives Angélique's gifts and messages, but doesn't know who sent them. It is revealed that Rachel's miscarriage was caused by "someone" running her down with a [[moped]]; earlier in the film, Angélique is shown having suffered an "accident" that ruined her friend's moped and injured her arm. Loïc comes to believe that his stalker is Sonia; he physically attacks her and she presses charges for assault. After she dies of a heart attack, Loïc is arrested as the [[prime suspect]] for her murder. After his arrest, Rachel tells the police that he was with her on the night of the death, which clears him of all charges.  That night, Loïc sees an ambulance pull up to his neighbor's house after Angélique tries to kill herself. As a doctor, he performs [[mouth-to-mouth resuscitation]], which causes her to regain consciousness. Now aware of her, he considers the possibility that she is his stalker. Exploring the house that she was house-sitting, he finds a life-sized garbage [[mosaic]] of himself. Loïc and Angélique have a final confrontation, in which he declares that they never had, nor ever will have, a relationship. Angélique strikes him over the head with a brass figurine and he falls down the stairs. Angélique is arrested, diagnosed with [[erotomania]], and remanded to a [[mental institution]]. Rachel stands by her husband while he recovers from his injuries, and several years later the couple are shown at a house with their young children as Loïc hobbles around with a cane.  Five years after the attack, Angélique is released from the mental institution. Her therapist praises her progress and tells her, "If you keep taking your medication, you will be fine". However, when the cleaning man is clearing Angélique's room, he discovers her pills have been glued to the wall behind the wardrobe in a [[mosaic]] of Loïc, thus showing that Angélique has never taken her medication, and is still obsessed with Loïc. The film then ends with a quotation from a real erotomaniac:  "Though my love is insane, my reason relieves the pain of the heart, telling me to be patient and not lose hope."

Hello Friend
 The Subject (who is referred to as Mr Ward by the company and John by his wife - John Ward) one day receives an email advertising a product called "Praemus", described as "The cheaper, faster and better way of using the internet." After the Subject buys Praemus, he advises his friends to get it also. He also notices the mysterious connection unit, which helps the user to connect to his computer by sticking to it.  The Subject then sends an email complaining about Praemus. He complains that the unit claims he was online for 200 hours in a week, and other various problems with his computer, such as his monitor vibrating, blasts of [[static electricity]] and his screen shutting down, meaning he has to send his email from an [[internet cafe]]. The Subject gets an email back saying that this is the first time the Praemus system has done this, and that he should try turning the computer off and on again. However, unknown to him, there is no one working in the Praemus office.  The Subject responds by saying he does not know how to turn the system off. His friend, who normally helps him with his computer, is reluctant to get involved. Later, other problems begin to develop for the Subject, as his cat goes missing. Praemus send another complicated email explaining what to do. Whilst he reads the manual and email explaining it, his daughter begins to play with matches.  The Subject then responds again saying that he tried to remove the unit, but he got badly burned when he touched the glowing Praemus logo. He continues to complain that the company keeps sending him bills, despite the fact they are not helping him. The Subject then begins to have nightmares about the unit. Praemus then send an email saying that if he damages the unit, it will result in legal action. The Subject says that they were the ones who told him to interfere with the unit. He then goes on to say that there was some sort of "drinking sound" coming from the unit. Later, the unit tries to connect with his head and sell him Praemus Life Insurance.  The Subject then goes on to explain that the other units are harming the friends to whom he recommended the Praemus service. Their hands also get burned and their units also start moving. However, The Subject buys the Praemus Life Insurance. His wife leaves a note on the computer monitor in an envelope with "John" written on it. The note says that he can take the unit and shove it, that she is taking their daughter, and that he is not to try to find them. As his life deteriorates, he threatens in an email that he will begin "legal proceedings". However, as he types this, the computer refuses to display the characters onscreen. In frustration, he hits the keyboard with his head, which opens a new window on his computer. The window is a [[dialog box]] displaying the setup options for Praemus. The options are not related to the computer, but to himself and aspects of his life. Options displayed include, "Friends", "Spouse", "Children", "Sanity", "Pets" and "Acumen", all marked "Off". As soon as he tries to change one of the options, the computer turns itself off, and he has a heart attack.  Praemus send an email to the Subject's wife saying they were sorry at hearing the news of the heart attack. The Subject's heartbeat then appears to stop, and the light on the unit fades away, but it turns out the heart monitor is not working. A doctor simply hits the machine and it begins to work ironically implying that's all the subject needed to do. The monitor is also made by Praemus. Finally, the Subject wakes up.

Honey's dream is to make it as a renowned [[choreographer]].  When Honey hits the dance floor after her shift at the club she works at where her rival Katrina performs, the two are recorded as they try to out dance each other. When Honey and friend Gina leave the club, they encounter brothers Benny and Raymond street dancing with other kids from the neighborhood. Honey invites them to attend her classes at the community center, where they work together to inspire new dance moves. The video from the club catches the attention of music director Michael Ellis, who gives Honey a job as a backup dancer in [[Jadakiss]]' new video. Unimpressed with his current [[choreographer]], Michael decides to let Honey choreograph the video. Before long, Honey is asked to choreograph for [[Tweet (singer)|Tweet]], [[Sheek Louch]], and [[Shawn Desman]].  Honey's new choreography career makes it tougher for her mother to maintain the dilapidated community center. Wanting to help, Honey finds an old store for sale and decides to turn it into a dance studio for the local kids. Honey's parents want her to teach ballet classes and refuse to help with the new dance studio, but Honey puts down a deposit. Meanwhile, she convinces Michael to let her use the kids she teaches at the center as backup dancers in [[Ginuwine]]'s new video.  Honey makes plans to take Gina to Atlantic City for her birthday, but Michael convinces her to make an appearance at a black and white party instead, where he subsequently makes a drunken pass at her. She refuses his advances and leaves the party.  Michael later fires Honey and the kids from Ginuwine's new video, replacing her with Katrina and [[blackballing]] Honey from the business.  The kid dancers are heartbroken about this turn of events. Benny starts working for street corner drug dealers and soon lands in [[Youth detention center|juvy]]. When Honey visits him there, Benny refuses her help and insults her. As she leaves, Honey asks him how often his drug friends visit and he is visibly saddened by her question realising that his best friend Otis is the main reason that he is in juvy and none of his friends visit him at all.  Depressed, Honey is relieved when Gina renews their friendship and helps Honey realize she can still make her dreams come true.  Honey has been struggling to make the full [[down payment]] on the studio, and eventually comes up with the idea to hold a dance benefit at an abandoned church.  Benny, released from juvy, brings his dance friends to help prep for the benefit.   Michael has been hired to manage a new video for [[Missy Elliott]].

She makes it clear that she will postpone the filming of her video until Michael fires Katrina and brings in Honey, whose work she has seen. Once Michael realizes his mistake, he crawls back to Honey and begs her to work for him. He even offers to buy her the studio tries to apologize for his behavior. She refuses both his apology and his help, saying she will pay for the studio on her own. Honey also tells Michael off that he is selfish and arrogant just as Katrina for his behavior. She makes him realize that not only did his arrogance get Honey fired from her job, but caused her to break a lot of the students hearts when they had hopes of being backstage dancers for [[Ginuwine]]'s music video.  Gina talks to the bank manager, who calls some local arts community donors to attend the benefit. The benefit is a full house, including Honey's parents, Benny's disapproving mother and Honey's boyfriend Chaz. The audience is wildly enthusiastic about the performances.

Kiat Kun appears assured of third place, but unexpectedly trips over a stone and thus finishes first. Beng Soon ends the race in third place. While Kiat Kun is running, Mrs Chew goes into labour, forcing Seow Fang to run across a long path littered with broken glass to find a midwife.

After dinner, Marie and Alex get ready to go to bed. As Alex sleeps, Marie lies on her bed listening to music and masturbating. Marie hears a doorbell ring and Alex's father wakes to answer it. The man at the door is a [[serial killer]], who slashes Alex's father's face with a straight razor. Alex's father's head is pressed between two spindles of the staircase, then the killer shoves a bookcase towards the father's head, decapitating him. The noise awakens Alex's mother, who finds her husband dead and is approached by the killer.  Marie, hearing the mother's screams, quickly arranges the guest room to make it appear that no one is staying there, and hides under her bed. The killer inspects Marie's room but does not find her. Marie creeps downstairs and finds Alex chained in her bedroom. Promising to find help, she sneaks into the parents' room to find a phone. After hearing loud thuds, she hides in the closet and through the slats of the door witnesses the killing of Alex's mother as her throat is brutally slashed with a razor.

Eventually, Marie bludgeons the killer with a fence post covered in barbed wire. As Marie inspects the body, he grabs at her throat, so Marie suffocates him with a plastic sheet and makes her way back to the truck. Alex seems terrified of Marie as she returns to the vehicle. As police investigate the gas station murders via the in-store videotape, the tape shows Marie murdering the store clerk. In retrospect, the audience is shown how the family murders really happened. Finally, the audience discovers that Marie is murderous, delusional, and in love with Alex.  At the truck, Marie unties Alex. As soon as Alex is free, she threatens Marie with the knife and accuses her of butchering her family. Alex slashes Marie's face and stabs her in the stomach before running into the forest. Marie chases Alex with a concrete saw. Alex finds a road and flags down a car. As Alex is climbing into the car, Marie appears brandishing the [[concrete saw]] and disembowels the driver. A stray piece of glass slices Alex's Achilles tendon. Alex takes a crowbar from the car's toolbox and crawls along the road. Marie forces Alex to tell her that she loves her, and she kisses her. While engaged in the kiss, Alex plunges the crowbar into Marie's chest as Marie proclaims she'll never let anyone come between them.  The final scene shows Marie in a [[psychiatric hospital]] room, and Alex watching her through a [[one-way mirror]]. Marie grins and reaches for Alex, aware that she is behind it.

 Sergeant Joe Gavilan is a financially strapped homicide detective with the Hollywood Division of the [[LAPD]]. He has been moonlighting as a real estate agent for seven years. His current partner is K. C. Calden, a much younger detective who teaches yoga on the side and wants to be an actor. The partners are investigating the murders of the four members of rap group "H2OClick", who were gunned down in a nightclub by two unidentified assailants. The detectives discover there was a witness who fled, and they work to track him down. They are distracted, failing to bond as partners, as Gavilan has to deal with a looming real estate deal that may be the key to getting out of debt, while Calden further pursues his dreams of acting by trying to be scouted by talent agents.  Meanwhile, the manager of H2OClick, Antoine Sartain, has his head of security eliminate the two hitmen, who he had hired to kill H2OClick and, earlier a rapper named Klepto that Sartain also managed.  Gavilan and Calden believe the murders are gang-related, but when Calden happens to see the bodies of the hitmen at the morgue, they conclude that the murders were orchestrated. The detectives also notice similarities that tie the H2OClick and Klepto homicides together. Gavilan learns from an undercover officer that the songwriter for H2OClick, a man named K-Roc, has gone missing, leading Gavilan to believe he is their murder witness. They struggle to track down K-Roc until they finally learn his real name, Oliver Robideaux, the son of former Motown singer Olivia Robideaux.  Lieutenant Bernard "Bennie" Macko arrives at the station. Macko and Gavilan have a bad history, as Gavilan proved Macko wrong on a case years ago. The animosity is compounded by the fact that Gavilan's latest love interest, a [[psychic]] named Ruby, used to date Macko. Macko is intent on ruining Gavilan, going so far as to try to frame him and place both detectives in interrogation. Instead, it only serves to help Gavilan and Calden strengthen their partnership.

The partners track down K-Roc to his home, where Olivia professes her son's innocence and that manager Sartain was the real culprit. Sartain had been embezzling money from Klepto, H2OClick and other clients for years. Klepto and H2OClick threatened to hire lawyers to nullify their contracts, which led Sartain to have his head of security hire the hitmen as a "lesson" to all his clients. It also turns the security chief is former officer Wasley, and that Macko is also in league with Sartain.  When the partners can't locate Sartain and Wasley, Gavilan enlists the help of Ruby. She uses her psychic power to lead the two detectives to a clothing store. Just then, Sartain and Wasley happened to drive by, and Gavilan and Calden follow in a wild car chase. The chase ends with the four men on foot, with the two partners chasing the two culprits in different directions. When Gavilan struggles with Sartain, Sartain winds up falling from the top of a building to his death. Wasley has drawn a gun on Calden and loudly brags about having killed his father.

Holes (film)
  Teenager Stanley Yelnats IV lives in Texas with his family, who have been cursed to be unlucky – a misfortune they blame on their ancestor Elya's failure to keep a promise to a fortune teller years ago in Latvia. One day, Stanley is falsely arrested for stealing a pair of sneakers that were donated to charity by a famous baseball player. Upon conviction, Stanley decides to attend Camp Green Lake, a juvenile detention camp, in lieu of serving his time in jail.   He arrives to find that the camp is a dried up lake run by the warden, Louise Walker, her assistant Mr. Sir, and camp counselor Dr. Kiowa Pendanski. Prisoners who are known by their nicknames – including Zero, Armpit, Zig-Zag, Squid, X-Ray, and Magnet – spend each day digging holes in the desert; they may earn a day off if the inmates find anything interesting. After finding a golden lipstick tube initialed K.B. and a fossil, Stanley is accepted into the group and is given the nickname Caveman.   After taking the blame for Magnet's stealing of Mr. Sir's sunflower seeds, Stanley is taken to the warden's house where old wanted posters and newspapers lead him to suspect that "KB" stands for Katherine "Kissin' Kate" Barlow, a school teacher turned outlaw from the past. Walker asks Stanley to grab her box of nail polish and mentions that it contains rattlesnake venom. After he and Mr. Sir explain what happened with the sunflower seeds, Walker injures Mr. Sir and allows Stanley to return to his hole.  Camp Green Lake's history is revealed in a series of flashbacks throughout the film. In the 19th century, Green Lake is a flourishing lakeside community. Kate is involved in a love triangle with the wealthy Charles "Trout" Walker, whom Kate rejects, and an [[African-Americans|African-American]] onion seller named Sam, whom Kate loves. One night, after much turmoil, Walker kills Sam and in retaliation, Kate kills the local sheriff and becomes an outlaw; at one point, she steals Elya's son Stanley's chest. During her career as an outlaw, a severe drought strikes Green Lake, resulting in the drying up of the lake, and the eventual abandonment of the community. Twenty years later, the now bankrupt Walkers track down Kate and demand she hand over her treasure. Kate refuses and tells them to dig for the treasure, after which Kate dies from a lizard bite and the Walkers set about digging for the treasure.   In the present, when Pendanski mocks Zero, whose is actually Hector Zeroni, the latter hits Pendanski with a shovel and runs off. After some deliberation, Stanley searches for Hector. The pair have difficulty surviving in the desert without water. Eventually, Stanley carries the now ill Hector up the mountain where they find a wild field of onions and a source of water, helping them regain strength; at the same time, Stanley unknowingly fulfills his ancestor's promise to the fortune teller and breaks the curse. While camping on the mountain, Stanley discovers that Hector stole the sneakers and threw them over the bridge to evade the police.  Returning to the camp, Stanley and Hector investigate the hole where Stanley found the lipstick and discover a chest before they are discovered by Walker, Mr. Sir, and Pendanski. They soon realize that Walker, who is a descendant of Trout Walker, is using the inmates to search for Kate's treasure.   The next morning, the attorney general and Stanley's lawyer arrive, accompanied by police officers; the chest Stanley found is discovered to belong to his great grandfather before it was stolen by Kate. Walker; Mr. Sir, who is revealed to be a paroled criminal named Marion Sevillo; and Pendanski, who is a criminal impersonating a doctor, are arrested. Stanley and Zero are released and it rains in Green Lake for the first time in over 100 years. The Yelnats family claims ownership of the chest which contains jewels, deeds, and promissory notes, which they share with Hector, and both families live a life of financial ease as neighbors.  
The Hitcher II: I've Been Waiting
 Fifteen years after surviving the events of ''[[The Hitcher (1986 film)|The Hitcher]]'', Jim Halsey ([[C. Thomas Howell]]) now works as a police officer. He has recently been suspended for using [[excessive force]] on a kidnapping suspect, and decides to visit retired Captain Esteridge in [[Texas]] to talk about his lingering mental issues on what happened to him. Jim's girlfriend, Maggie ([[Kari Wuhrer]]), is unaware of Jim's past and pleads to come along.  The couple arrive in Yellowstone, and pick up Plum that big man left for them to drive to his house. The drive on the lonely road triggers Jim's [[Post traumatic stress disorder|PTSD]], and when they see an RV that has been run off the road, blood dripping through the door, Jim refuses to stop and help. Soon, a motorcycle speeds past them and crashes. The driver is seemingly all right, and Maggie insists they take him on board. The Hitcher ([[Jake Busey]]) is insistent on making small talk and joking with them, but Jim is overwhelmed and evicts him from the car.  Jim and Maggie continue their journey. They are eventually pulled over by a cop, but have been also followed by the Hitcher, who has hijacked an 18-wheeler truck and killed its driver. The Hitcher shoots the cop and tries to grab Jim and Maggie but is successfully thrown off the car when they escape.  The couple arrive at the Esteridge residence late at night, but the Captain and his wife have been killed by the Hitcher. Jim and Maggie find themselves caught in a shootout between the Hitcher, who is in the hayloft of the barn, and the local police, who have arrived on the scene. During the melee Jim pushes Maggie out harm's way and is shot by the Hitcher. Maggie manages to escape in her car, but Jim dies, his last words being to tell her to kill the Hitcher.  Maggie falls asleep in the desert. When she wakes up she is knocked unconscious and put inside an abandoned water tower that is on the verge of collapsing. The Hitcher taunts her and then leaves, but Maggie manages to escape and use the 18-wheeler from earlier in the film to get away. She arrives at a gas station, makes a phone call and cleans up, but the Hitcher has followed her and killed the clerk. The Hitcher intends to frame Maggie for all the killings that have happened, and as part of this plan cuts off his own finger. The police arrive at the gas station. The Hitcher spins his story and Maggie is arrested. She is transported by the sheriff's van, but during the journey the vehicle is knocked on its side by an excavator. The Hitcher kills all the police officers of the escort, and tosses the key and a revolver to Maggie to make it look like she killed all of them.  Maggie and the Hitcher have a final showdown, where the Hitcher drives a stolen tanker truck and Maggie pilots a mail carrier plane from a nearby airfield (she is shown to have a crop dusting business earlier in the film). Maggie [[kamikaze]]s the plane into the truck, but manages to escape the ensuing explosion. Maggie finds the unconscious Hitcher and ties him to the truck. When he wakes up, realizing he is trapped, begs for mercy. Maggie ignores his pleas and prepares to finish him.  But before Maggie can execute him, the police show up again. Knowing that his could be his only chance for escape, the Hitcher yells that Maggie is trying to kill him. The police believe him and they free the Hitcher and shoot Maggie in the leg as she attempts to enter the truck's cab. Once free, the Hitcher kills the cops. Maggie manages to make a safe distance away and shoot the tanker, which explodes and kills the Hitcher. The film then ends with Maggie dropping the shotgun to the ground and standing in the road facing the remains of the burning truck.  
House of 1000 Corpses
 On October 30, 1977, amateur criminals Killer Karl and Richard Wick attempt an armed robbery at a gas station; however, the owner, Captain Spaulding and his friend Stucky begin mocking the robbers, and Stucky identifies Wick and begins taunting him with his nickname. Karl decides to kill them both, but is attacked by Spaulding's assistant, Ravelli, allowing Spaulding to kill them. Later on, Jerry Goldsmith, Bill Hudley, Mary Knowles, and Denise Willis are on the road in hopes of writing a book on offbeat [[roadside attraction]]s. When the four meet Spaulding, who is also the owner of "The Museum of Monsters & Madmen", they learn of the local legend of Dr. Satan. As they take off in search of the tree from which Dr. Satan was hanged, they pick up a young [[hitchhiker]] named Baby, who claims to live only a few miles away. Shortly after, the vehicle's tire bursts in what is later seen to be a trap and Baby takes Bill to her family's house. Moments later, Baby's half-brother, Rufus, picks up the stranded passengers and takes them to the family home.  There they meet Baby's family: Mother Firefly, Otis Driftwood, her adopted brother, Grampa Hugo and Baby's deformed giant half-brother, Tiny. It's revealed that the family has kidnapped five cheerleaders and are torturing and killing them (Otis is later shown to be raping one of the cheerleaders). While being treated to dinner, Mother Firefly explains that her ex-husband, Earl, had previously tried to burn Tiny alive, along with the Firefly house after he suffered a psychotic break. After dinner, the family puts on a Halloween show for their guests and Baby offends Mary by flirting with Bill. After Mary threatens Baby, Rufus tells them their car is repaired. As they leave, Otis and Tiny, disguised as [[scarecrow]]s, attack the couples in the drive way and take them prisoner. The next day, Otis kills Bill and mutilates his body for art. Mary is tied up in a barn, Denise is tied to a bed while dressed up for Halloween, and Jerry is partially [[Scalping|scalped]] for failing to guess Baby's favorite movie star.  When Denise doesn't come home, her father Don calls the police to report her missing. Two deputies, George Wydell and Steve Naish, find the couples' abandoned car in a field with a dead, mutilated cheerleader in the trunk. Don, who was once a cop, is called to the scene to help the deputies search. They arrive at the Firefly house and Wydell questions Mother Firefly about the missing teens. Mother Firefly shoots Wydell in the head and kills him, and Don and Steve are then killed by Otis upon finding the bodies of the remaining murdered cheerleaders in the barn. Later that night, the three remaining teenagers are dressed as rabbits, and taken out to an abandoned well. Mary attempts to run away, but is tracked down and stabbed to death by Baby moments later. One of the family members dons the uniform of one of the deputies and drives their car, while drunk.  Meanwhile, Jerry and Denise are lowered into the well, where a group of Dr. Satan's failed experiments pull Jerry away, leaving Denise to find her way through an underground lair. As she wanders through the tunnels, she encounters Dr. Satan and a number of [[Intellectual disability|mental patients]]; Jerry is on Dr. Satan's operating table being [[Vivisection|vivisected]] and dies as Denise screams. Dr. Satan tells his mutated assistant, who turns out to be Earl, Mother Firefly's ex-husband, to capture Denise, but Denise outwits him and escapes the chambers by crawling to the surface as he is crushed by falling debris. She makes her way to the main road, where she encounters Captain Spaulding, who gives her a ride in his car. She passes out from exhaustion in the front seat, and Otis suddenly appears in the backseat with a knife. Denise later wakes up to find herself strapped to Dr. Satan's operating table and gasps in horror as the movie ends.  
House of Sand and Fog (film)
 Abandoned by her husband, recovering drug addict Kathy Nicolo, living alone in a small house near the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], ignores eviction notices erroneously sent to her for nonpayment of business taxes. Assuming the misunderstanding was cleared up months ago, she is surprised when Sheriff's Deputy Lester Burdon arrives to forcibly evict her. Telling Kathy that her home is to be auctioned off, Burdon feels sympathy for her, helps her move out and advises her to seek legal assistance to regain her house.  A former  [[Imperial Iranian Army]] Colonel Massoud Amir Behrani who fled his homeland with his family, now lives in  the Bay Area working multiple menial jobs. Living beyond his means, he maintains the façade of a respectable businessman so as not to shame his wife Nadereh, son Esmail, and daughter Soraya.  Seeing the auction of Kathy's house in the newspaper, he buys it for a quarter of its actual value, intending to improve and sell the house. Meanwhile, Kathy is evicted from the motel she is staying in. Having nowhere else to go, she spends the night in her car outside her home.  The next morning Kathy is angered to see her house being renovated and confronts the workers, injuring her foot. Nadereh and Esmail treat her wound, but her jealousy at seeing how the Behranis have settled in only makes her more determined to get her house back.  Taking Lester's advice, Kathy finds an attorney who assures her that because of the county's mistake, they will return Massoud's money and the house will be restored to her. Massoud, having already spent money on improving the house, is unwilling to accept anything less than the much higher appraised value of the property, which the county refuses to pay. Informed that her only option is to sue the county, which will take much longer, Kathy instead tries to convince Massoud to sell back the house for what he paid by telling him she and her brother inherited it from their father. Massoud refuses and angrily forces Kathy back into her car.  Desperate for help, Kathy seeks out Lester and seduces him into abandoning his wife and children and becoming her protector. Using a pseudonym, Lester confronts Massoud and threatens to have him deported if he refuses to sell the house back to the county. Massoud reports this to the police and identifies Lester from a photo, resulting in a reprimand by [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|internal affairs]], and gives Kathy a furious warning to back off and leave him and his family alone. Now aware that Lester is in trouble, Kathy calls her brother Frank, but cannot bring herself to admit that she is homeless, and he is unable to help her.  Despondent, Kathy first considers driving to the house and burning it, but after becoming drunk attempts suicide in the driveway with Lester's sidearm instead. Massoud finds her in her car drunkenly unable to discharge the gun, and brings her inside. Kathy again tries to kill herself with pills, but Nadereh saves her by inducing her to vomit. As she and her husband carry Kathy to the bedroom, Lester breaks into the house, retrieves his sidearm, sees Kathy unconscious, and locks the Behranis in their own bathroom, refusing to let them out until Massoud agrees to relinquish the house. Massoud eventually offers to sell the house back to the county for the price he paid and will give Kathy the money in exchange for her putting the house in his name. Lester agrees to take Massoud and Esmail to the county office to finalize the transaction, and Kathy reluctantly goes along with the plan.  Outside the office, Lester begins to manhandle Massoud and Esmail seizes Lester's gun and aims it at him. Massoud grabs hold of Lester and screams for help, drawing the attention of nearby police officers who misinterpret the situation and shoot Esmail instead of Lester. Massoud is arrested but is released after Lester confesses and is incarcerated.  Massoud rushes to the hospital and while he is there he prays, begging God to save his son and vowing to make whatever changes he needs to in his life. But he finds his son did not survive. Distraught and grief-stricken, Massoud goes home and, believing they have nothing left to live for, kills Nadereh by lacing her tea with pills. He then dons his old [[military uniform]], tapes a plastic dust cover over his head, and asphyxiates himself while clutching his wife's hand. Kathy eventually discovers the couple and frantically attempts to resuscitate Massoud but she is too late. As the bodies of Massoud and Nadereh are taken away by paramedics, a policeman asks Kathy if the house is hers. After a long pause, she quietly replies, "No, it's not my house."  
Hope Springs (2003 film)
  When Colin is dumped by his childhood love and fiancee, he decides to travel to a place with the most hopeful name he can find. He arrives in Hope, [[Vermont]], a quiet [[New England]] town in northeastern United States in autumn and checks into a hotel showing clear signs of emotional distress. He tries to forget his troubles by drawing the eccentric town residents and asks for "rubbers" instead of erasers at a store, causing the small-town locals to go on alert. The casual request embodies cultural differences with Americans and Brits and causes some misunderstandings between the characters. The quirky outlandish hotel manager, Joanie ([[Mary Steenburgen]]) sees the state he is in and calls over her friend Mandy, a therapist, to talk with him and take his mind off his troubles. The small town residents all know each other and have boring predictable lives, but by bringing Colin and Mandy together, Joanie and her fellow Hope residents add some romance and drama to their own lives. A pair of opposites, Colin is a reserved English artist and Mandy is a free spirited Vermont person that decorates her room with "her symbol" of butterflies. Eventually they fall in love with each other, with Colin healing and building a new life while finally getting over the breakup with his ex Vera.  Suddenly though, the attractive, sophisticated, witty and charming Vera shows up to get Colin back. Extremely self-confident and oblivious to anyone's ideas or feelings that don't match hers, Vera denies that Colin is no longer interested and relentlessly pursues him, while finding out about him and Mandy. Vera exploits Mandy's insecurities about her new relationship with Colin and being a simple country person, while manipulating Colin's memories of their shared romantic and cultural history. Vera and Colin's twenty years together adds to Vera's leverage, of couples that inevitably take each other for granted or stay together out of habit, but Colin tells her that, "In one minute...short span of time...you not only became unimportant as an aim in life, but also the very thing I need to flee from in order to find happiness".  Later Colin goes to Vera's hotel room to tell her to leave Mandy and him alone and go back to England, however she changes into sexy underwear while smoking and sets off the fire alarm. Mandy sees the two together in front of the hotel during the fire evacuation and assumes Colin took her back. Colin tries to clear up the misunderstanding with Mandy but the only thing she wants from him is a promise to never contact her. Colin agrees on the condition that she get a passport. The residents of Hope are small town unsophisticates but very familiar with personal dilemmas and the ordinary common feelings in everyone's lives, of loneliness, heartbreak, confusion, and naturally join in Colin and Mandy's drama. With other motives, Colin flatters the town mayor with a personal portrait and accepts an offer of an "appreciation gift".  Vera tells Colin that the town mayor found out her genealogy is linked to Hope, Vermont but Colin reveals to her that it was faked to convince Vera that they are over while refocusing her fixation with him to instead become the Queen of Hope at the town festival. Vera is finally convinced by Colin that their romance is over and decides to enjoy the consolation of becoming the Queen of Hope.  After Colin leaves Hope, Joanie tells Mandy that Colin's cousin was supposed to meet him but forgot to cancel the meeting and that she should pick him up at Hope Springs. When Mandy gets there she finds it is Colin and he proposes, giving her a vintage butterfly engagement ring with their names engraved in it. Colin carries her back to the hotel, where they pass and wave to Vera, Mr and Mrs Peterson and the residents of Shiny Shores where Mandy lives and works. Mandy tells him that she is too heavy to be carried through the whole town and warns him of hurting his back. When they finally get to the hotel and undress, Colin's back is hurt despite Mandy's warnings. They are happily reunited with no more complications from others and look forward to traveling back to England together, with Colin finding happiness when he least expected it.  
House of the Dead (film)
 After booking a boat trip to attend a rave to an island located off the coast of [[Seattle]] named "Isla del Morte" (Spanish for "Island of Death"), two college students, Simon ([[Tyron Leitso]]) and Greg ([[Will Sanderson]]) meet up with three girls: Alicia ([[Ona Grauer]]), Karma ([[Enuka Okuma]]) and Cynthia ([[Sonya Salomaa]]). Karma has a crush on Simon, Simon has a crush on Alicia, and Cynthia is Greg's girlfriend. When the five arrive at the dock, they find that they are late and the boat that is supposed to take them to Isla del Morte has already left. A man named Victor Kirk ([[Jürgen Prochnow]]) and his first mate Salish ([[Clint Howard]]) offer them a ride. As they leave, a policewoman named Jordan Casper ([[Ellie Cornell]]) tries to stop them from leaving, knowing of Kirk's past as a smuggler, but fails.  Arriving at Isla del Morte, they find the rave site messed up and deserted. Alicia, Karma and Simon leave the site to go find anybody around while Cynthia and Greg stay behind. As Greg and Cynthia are about to make out in a tent, the former leaves to urinate. Alone in the tent, Cynthia is killed by a group of zombies. Meanwhile, Alicia, Karma and Simon find a derelict house and as they attempt to investigate the place, they discover Rudy ([[Jonathan Cherry]]), Liberty ([[Kira Clavell]]) and Hugh ([[Michael Eklund]]), who inform them of a zombie attack during the rave. Alicia and Rudy used to date and Liberty was a dancer at the rave. The six leave the house to fetch Greg and Cynthia. Meanwhile, the zombies kill Salish when he is alone in the forest.  Alicia, Rudy, Karma, Simon, Liberty and Hugh return to the rave site and find Greg. A zombified Cynthia comes out from behind a tree and kills Hugh but is killed when Casper arrives and shoots her. They form a plan to return to Kirk's boat and leave the island. When they return to the beach they find only zombies on Kirk's boat. Casper and Greg leave the group to go find help, but Greg is killed in the forest.   Kirk reveals the island's history; Isla del Morte was home to a Spanish Catholic priest named Castillo Sermano, who was banished from Spain in the 15th century for his dark experiments, which the Catholic Church forbade (there was a union of Church and State in that period). Castillo murdered the crew of St. Cristobal, the ship that was taking him to the island, enslaved the island's natives, and murdered anyone who visited the place. He then created the immortality serum, which he injected himself with before he created the first zombie. Kirk leads the group to a spot in the forest where he has hidden a box full of guns and weaponry. Once everyone is armed, they decide to head back to the house only to find the facade filled with zombies. Liberty and Casper are killed in the ensuing fight and Alicia, Rudy, Kirk, Karma and Simon manage to take shelter inside the house.  When Kirk is alone, he hears Salish whistling outside of the house. He goes outside and sees Salish as a zombie. Kirk sacrifices himself by killing Salish with a stick of dynamite, but the explosion also blows up the entrance to the house. The remaining four lock themselves in a lab inside house, but the zombies break in. Karma finds a hatch in the floor which she, Alicia and Rudy use to escape. Simon manages to sacrifice himself to kill the zombies by shooting a barrel of gunpowder, blowing up the house and the zombies. Alicia, Rudy and Karma find themselves in underground tunnels. They make their way through the tunnels, but Karma is killed by zombies as she attempts to hold them off as Rudy and Alicia flee.  Alicia and Rudy are aided out of the tunnels by a mysterious man wearing Greg's face as a mask. The man is revealed to be Castillo Sermano. Alicia and Rudy escape the tunnels, blowing them up in the process. Castillo manages to survive the blast and Alicia gets into a sword fight with him. Castillo stabs her in the heart wherein Rudy manages to decapitate him. While he thinks that it has all ended, the still-alive headless body of Castillo begins to strangle Rudy. Alicia who is barely alive gets up and crushes the head under her foot which finally kills him. Although Alicia seemingly dies, she and Rudy are rescued by a team of agents. The agents ask for Rudy's name, to which he responds with Rudolph [[The House of the Dead (video game)|"Curien"]]. The ending narration reveals that Rudy gave Alicia the immortality serum and that is why she is alive. The two survivors return home.  
The Honourable Wally Norman
 The story begins with a corrupt [[Member of Parliament]] ([[Shaun Micallef|Micallef]]) shutting down a country town's main source of employment in the local [[Meat packing industry|meatworks]]. This leaves Wally Norman ([[Kevin Harrington (actor)|Harrington]]) out of a job, until drunk politician Willy Norman accidentally writes the wrong name on the parliamentary nomination form.  Wally is at first apprehensive about running, until he realises it is the only way to save the meatworks. Throughout the film Wally is coached by Willy Norman and assistant Myles Greenstreet (Nathaniel Davison) in how to best appeal to the voters, as well as overcome his [[Glossophobia|fear of public speaking]].  Meanwhile, Myles is attracted to Wally's daughter, and a [[wombat]]'s career skyrockets.  Much of the film's humour comes from wordplay, such as naming the town Givens Head, and the foreman of the meatworks being named [[George Foreman|George]]. Shaun Micallef said he had to insist that his own moniker was modified from F. Ken Oath to F. Ken Oats to soften one of the film's less subtle attempts at punning.<ref name="Age1"></ref>

Hulk (film)
 [[Scientist]] David Banner has the idea to create [[super soldiers]] by introducing modified DNA sequences extracted from various animals to strengthen the human cellular response, but General [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] denies him permission to use human subjects. Banner subsequently conducts the experiments on himself. After the birth of his son Bruce, he finds that his son may have inherited the effects and seeks a cure, but is stopped in the process. Following a traumatic event, Bruce remembers nothing of the incident, and has been raised by the Krenzlers. Years later, Bruce is a [[geneticist]] working with his ex-girlfriend, [[Betty Ross]], within the Berkeley Biotechnology Institute on [[nanobot|nanomed]] research. The pair hopes to achieve instantaneous cell repair by using low level [[Gamma radiation]] exposure to activate the nanomeds once they are introduced into a living organism. During routine maintenance of their appropriated [[gamma-ray spectrometer]], a circuit shorts and triggers the experiment's program sequence. Unable to prevent the machine from firing, Bruce throws himself in front of a colleague to shield the man and is exposed to a massive amount of [[gamma radiation]].  Betty visits Bruce in the hospital and remarks that he should be dead, but Bruce feels great. A new janitor at the lab claims that he is Bruce's biological father, of whom Bruce has no recollection. When under extreme stress, Bruce transforms into the Hulk, a huge, humanoid, green-skinned monstrous being who destroys the laboratory, though Bruce later has no memory of the incident. General Ross suspects Bruce of collaborating with David Banner but deduces Bruce has [[repressed memories]]. He (arrogantly/illegally) orders Bruce to be put under house arrest. Through a phone call with his father, Bruce learns that the radiation unleashed something that was already in his DNA, and that David Banner plans to have Betty killed by his dogs, which now have similar powers to the Hulk thanks to David mutating them with gamma radiation. Bruce is then attacked by Major [[Glenn Talbot]], leading to a transformation into the Hulk. The Hulk seriously injures Talbot before leaping to save Betty. After being wounded in a lengthy struggle, he kills David's dogs and changes back into Bruce before being captured by the military the next morning.  Bruce is kept under observation at a secret desert base, while Talbot intends to weaponize the Hulk's powers. David tries to recreate Bruce's failed experiment, but instead of turning into another Hulk he finds himself able to [[Absorbing Man|absorb any material he touches]] or energy to which he is exposed. He hands himself over to the military after lying to Betty and telling that he had murdered his wife in front of the child Bruce. Bruce has a nightmare about the event, he realises his father thought he was a monster and tried to kill him while his mother protected him. This leads to a more powerful transformation into the Hulk. While attempting to gain a sample of the monster, Talbot is killed. The Hulk escapes Desert Base and rampages across the desert to San Francisco, battling Army forces sent after him. Betty calms Bruce into his human form.  David tries to taunt his son into transforming into the Hulk, but fails. He then decides to "go first" and bites an electrical cable, absorbing all the electricity in San Francisco. The electricity hits Bruce, triggering his own transformation. A brutal fight ensues between David and the Hulk, with David absorbing the Hulk's energy. It proves too much for David to handle, but when he himself transforms into a massive creature, he is killed by an Army missile. One year later, Bruce is presumed dead, while General Ross mentions apparent Hulk sightings and Betty admits her love for Bruce. In a South American jungle, Bruce has become a doctor and is approached by rebel militants who want to take medical supplies from the poor. Bruce faces the militants' leader, warning him that, "You wouldn't like me when I'm angry." His eyes turn green and the roar of the Hulk is heard from the distance.  
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days
  Andie Anderson ([[Kate Hudson]]) is a writer for a women's magazine called Composure as the "How to..." girl. She is bored and wishes she could write more about important things such as politics, economics, religion, poverty; stuff she actually cares about. After Andie's best friend Michelle ([[Kathryn Hahn]]) experiences yet another break-up, Andie is inspired to write a new article titled "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"; she will start dating a guy and eventually drive him away using only the "classic mistakes women make" in relationships.  At the same time, [[Advertisement|advertising]] executive Benjamin "Ben" Barry ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) is striving for a pitch to advertise a new diamond campaign. When his boss questions Ben's knowledge about romance, Ben bets he could make any woman fall in love with him if he wanted to. His boss accepts the bet and confirms that if he can make any woman fall in love with him before the upcoming company ball, in just 10 days, he will allow Ben to head the advertising for the new diamond company. Ben's rival co-workers, Judy Spears ([[Michael Michele]]) and Judy Green ([[Shalom Harlow]]), who were at Composure magazine earlier in the day and are aware of Andie's new assignment, set Ben up to have him pick Andie as the girl to test his theory on.  Ben and Andie meet and soon their quests, neither revealing their true intentions. Andie works hard to drive Ben insane and make him break up with her in order to complete her article, but Ben continues to stick around in hopes of making her fall in love with him. Andie gets Ben knocked out in a movie theater by talking aloud while watching a [[chick flick]], rapidly moves her things into his apartment, acts overly possessive and sensitive and clingy, ruins his boys' poker night for him and his friends, and takes him to a [[Celine Dion]] concert when he was under the assumption he was going to see a [[New York Knicks]] basketball game.  Ben stays with her despite everything, and after coming very close to breaking up they attend couples counseling, led by Andie's friend Michelle. They agree, as a solution to their "problems", to visit Ben's family in [[Staten Island]] for the weekend. While holidaying together, Ben and Andie begin to form a genuine bond, and upon arriving home Ben even refers to Andie as his girlfriend. Andie then tries to explain to boss Lana ([[Bebe Neuwirth]]) that she cannot continue writing and publishing this article as she has "really got to know this guy", but Lana remains insistent upon it. Around the same time, Andie and Ben go to the company ball together where Ben's boss, Phillip ([[Robert Klein]]), meets Andie and tells Ben that he "met her, she loves you, you win".  Seeing Ben's good news, Judy and Judy are instantly envious and set about to ruin it for their co-worker. They tell his close colleagues, Tony ([[Adam Goldberg]]) and Thayer ([[Thomas Lennon (actor)|Thomas Lennon]]), that Andie knew about the bet all along and was playing along to help Ben win.

How to Deal
  Halley Martin ([[Mandy Moore]]) is a 17-year-old high school student who is disillusioned with love after seeing many dysfunctional relationships around her. Her parents are now divorced and her father, Len Martin ([[Peter Gallagher]]), a radio talk show host, has a new young girlfriend that the entire family despises. Her mother, Lydia ([[Allison Janney]]), is now always alone while her sister, Ashley, is so overwhelmed by her upcoming wedding with Lewis Warsher that she barely exists in the house. The shallowness of all the teens at her school convinces Halley that finding true love is impossible.  When Halley walks in on her best friend Scarlett having sex with her boyfriend, the high school soccer champ, Michael Sherwood, Halley tries to warn her of the complications that lie ahead. Ignoring her advice, Scarlett embarks on a summer fling with Michael. In the meantime, Halley must deal with Ashley and the rest of the Martins must deal with her soon-to-be in-laws, Lewis' overbearing Southern parents, who have an African American maid. In the meantime, Halley runs into classmate Macon Forrester, a slacker who never shows up for biology and is more interested in having fun than school work. He is Michael Sherwood's best friend.  Then a few weeks later, Michael dies of a heart defect on the soccer field while Halley, Scarlett and other classmates watch helplessly. This event changes the lives of Halley and Scarlett forever. While Scarlett does her best to look beautiful for Michael at his funeral, Macon gives a moving speech about his friend. Struggling with Michael's death, Scarlett, at age sixteen, soon learns that she is pregnant with his child. With Halley at her side, Scarlett reveals the pregnancy to her mother.  Halley's father, Len Martin, marries his mistress, Lorna, in a beach-side ceremony, with guests from all over the world, or "within his radio frequency", as Halley puts it.  Halley and Macon eventually start a relationship. He takes her to his and Michael's favorite hangout and once come close to having sex. Halley and her mother get into an argument and on New Year's Eve, Halley sneaks out with Macon to a party. Again, they come very close to having sex but this time Halley stops it and Macon is upset. On their way home, they are both upset and distracted and hit a tree. Halley gets a broken arm, but otherwise they both walk away from it unharmed, but Halley breaks up with Macon saying that she can't wait around for him to grow up. Later things go awry when Halley finds Ashley drunk on the family's front porch. Finding a male stripper's thong around her neck, Halley witnesses the break-up of her sister's engagement. She also learns that her mother sneaks out once a week to have sex with a man she met a couple of weeks previously, Steve. After another make-up, Lewis proposes to Ashley again, this time at a crowded airport: she says yes.  On the day of Ashley and Lewis' wedding, Macon bursts into Len's radio studio, professing his apologies and love to Halley. He then heads to the wedding. On the way, he finds Scarlett, who insisted on walking to the wedding, going into labor on the side of the road. He puts her in the car and walks into the wedding, getting Halley's attention. The three rush to the hospital, leaving Scarlett's mother behind in the rush.  While Scarlett is having her baby, Halley makes a list of all the little things she hates about Macon, the way his hair falls over his face, the way his voice gets low when he's serious, the way he bites his lip when he's nervous and the way his eyebrow twitches. Halley playfully uses Macon's 'Jedi Mind Trick' and they kiss and dance briefly in the hallway. The movie ends as Halley and Macon embrace and viewers see that Scarlett gave birth to a baby boy.

He confides in Jeetu of his plan to marry the daughter of Kachara Seth ([[Shakti Kapoor]]), a rich businessman. To feign richness, he pretends to being Radheshyam Tiwari's son and conspires with Tiwari's servant Pandu to trick Kachara Seth into a quick engagement, hopeful that the father-in-law will be unable to do anything upon discovering the truth after marriage. He also nudges Jeetu to go ahead and steal. Following his advice, Jeetu ends up stealing from his parents' safe and opens his electronics store.  Meanwhile, millionaire businessman Radheshyam Tiwari ([[Paresh Rawal]]), who lives in a village with his wife Anjali Tiwari ([[Shoma Anand]]) and retains the mannerisms of a villager despite his riches, decides to spend a few weeks in the city. With news of Tiwari's arrival, Pandu, fearful for his own employment, asks Anil to flee and make some excuse to Kachara Seth delaying the wedding.  Anjali gets news of Tiwari's arrival from a friend and pays a visit to the villa hoping to land a job there. She meets Tiwari's wife who distrusts and rejects her. Desperate for a job, she decides to wait outside to meet Tiwari himself. At this point, Jeetu shows up at the villa to fix a stereo he sold to Tiwari.

Unable to land a job at the Tiwari's, Anjali later bumps into Jeetu when she responds to a vacancy at his store. Already trying to woo Anjali for assuming her to be Tiwari's daughter, Jeetu hires her readily. Afraid of losing the job, Anjali continues the pretense. Every day after work, Jeetu drops Anjali off at the Tiwari villa believing she lives there with Anjali exiting the villa after Jeetu leaves. With Jeetu often showing up at Tiwari's villa asking for Anjali and Mrs. Tiwari spotting the real Anjali frequently outside the villa, the Tiwaris become convinced that each is having an affair with the younger counterparts. This results in several acrimonious arguments and much tantrum throwing between the elderly couple.  Nandu, in the meantime, has begun to fall in love with Anjali. Nandu and Jeetu cross paths resulting in a very public verbal altercation between them. Meanwhile, Anjali receives a letter from home, informing her that the landlord's son Raja ([[Rajpal Yadav]]) is coming to visit her. Raja arrives the next day but is intercepted by Nandu at the train station, who teams up with Bholu to formulate a plan to scare the simpleton Raja away from the city before he can get in touch with Anjali.  Agitated by Pandu and Anil absconding, Kachara Seth also makes several visits to the villa. Tiwari's attempts to explain to him that his only son is in London fall on deaf ears as Kachara's accusations create further rifts between Mr. & Mrs. Tiwari.  Now Jeetu is after Tiwari for Anjali's hand in marriage, Tiwari is after Jeetu for his perceived dalliances with his wife, Kachara Seth is after Tiwari and his missing son Anil; and Nandu's landlord's wife has fallen for Nandu and is after him about eloping with her. All the major characters start chasing after each other and end up in a warehouse, where a big melee follows.  In the end, Jeetu and Nandu confront Anjali and profess their love for her, forcing her to choose between them. Seemingly cornered, Anjali decides to write their names on paper chits, agreeing to marry the one whose name comes up. Jeetu picks out a chit, only to find Nandu's name on it, who then walks off with Anjali in tow. Left alone, Jeetu collapses to the floor, heartbroken and sitting amidst the remaining chits, opens another one, only to discover Nandu's name on that one too and then on all the other ones as well. He then realizes Anjali had fallen for Nandu along the way and she was never smitten to him to begin with.

Suddenly, Hallam is shot from behind with a tranquilizer dart and the FBI task force, which had been tracking Bonham, sweeps in to capture Hallam.  During his interrogation, Hallam is uncooperative and looks mainly to Bonham, who he regards as a father figure of sorts. When he begins to mention a military black operation he participated in, Bonham cuts him off for his safety. The FBI is unsure of how to treat their would-be murder suspect, and Hallam is soon in the custody of his former Special Forces colleagues, who tell the FBI that Hallam cannot stand trial due to the secret operations he was part of.  While being transported, the operatives indicate that they intend to kill Hallam to ensure his silence. However, Hallam manages to kill all the operatives and escape. Alerted to the incident, Bonham and the FBI team track Hallam across the city and back into the wilderness, where Hallam consistently evades them. As he had been taught by Bonham, he crafts an improvised knife by making a fire and forging a blade from pieces of scrap metal. Convinced that the FBI's tactics aren't working and before more men are lost, Bonham strikes out on his own to find Aaron. Crafting his own knife out of stone, he goes into the wilderness and the search quickly becomes a fight to the death between teacher and student.  In a vicious knife fight beside a waterfall, Bonham's knife is broken and he suffers severe wounds but manages to stab Hallam to death with his own knife. The FBI arrives too late, and Bonham walks away without saying a word. Returning to his home in British Columbia, Bonham starts to burn the letters Hallam referenced earlier, in which Hallam expressed his concerns over the things he had done as a government assassin.

I'm Not Scared
 The action of the film takes place in 1978, in a fictional town called Acqua Traverse in [[Southern Italy]], during the hottest summer of the century and the infamous Years of Lead. A nine-year-old boy named Michele Amitrano and a group of his friends set out on a race across scorched wheat fields to a deserted farmhouse. Michele's sister tags along but falls over, breaking her glasses, and she calls out to Michele, who runs back to her. Michele quickly calms her worries about the glasses, and they continue running. They are the last of the group to arrive at the farmhouse, which means that she and Michele must pay a forfeit. However, the leader of the group, Skull, chooses the only girl in the group apart from Michele's sister to pay up instead. He instructs her to expose herself to the boys, and she looks to the others for help, but they refuse to meet her gaze. She reluctantly and hesitantly begins to take off her clothes, when Michele pipes up that he was the one to arrive last and he should be the one to pay.  As his punishment Michele walks the length of a beam, high up in a rickety old barn-like building at the deserted farmhouse, and after that the group is seen going home. As Michele and his sister set off, she asks him where her glasses are, and he goes back to fetch them. While searching for the glasses at the farmhouse, Michele discovers a hole in the ground covered with a sheet of metal. He opens it and sees part of a bare human leg; horrified, due to the limited time he had to investigate the situation, he decides to keep this a secret from the others. He feels threatened by Skull and doesn't want such a big discovery to be taken away from him. The next day, he returns to the place, throwing rocks at the leg. As he moves to pick up another rock, the camera pans to him, on the ground, searching around him in the dirt, where Michele finds another rock to throw. As the camera pans back into the hole, the leg is out of sight. Startled, Michele is suddenly staring down at a zombie-like young boy stumbling out of the darkness and into view. Terrified, Michele hurries home once more, but then his bicycle chain breaks and he is thrown off his bike. As he returns home he is scolded for being late. The next day while playing with friends Michele thinks about the boy and later he decides to visit the zombie-like boy again. Michele finds that the boy is actually alive, although he is very weak. He brings him water and later food. One day, Michele goes to buy bread, to feed the boy.  On the way he sees the familiar face of Skull's older brother driving away from the house and thinks this may be the person who has imprisoned the boy.  He returns home, making sure that his own presence is not discovered by whoever put the boy there.  Michele climbs down to collect the bread back from the boy. During this time Michele's undaunted curiosity leads him to begin questioning the confused, possibly delusional, and traumatized boy. To Michele's annoyance, the boy thinks he is dead and asks Michele if he is his guardian angel. The boy walks over to him and Michele sees him at his full size, as going crazy the boy cries out "I'm Dead"!  He screams louder and louder, making Michele climb back up the rope quickly and return home.   One night, Michele sees his parents watching on the television news that a child named Filippo belonging to the Carducci family has been kidnapped from Milan, and the boy in the pictures shown looks just like the boy in the hole. He overhears his parents and their friends talking about keeping the boy hidden. The next morning, he discovers his parents are hosting late-night meetings with the parents of his playmates and one domineering visitor "from the North" who now sleeps in his room. Michele, to his shock, gradually comes to realize that his own father is involved in the kidnapping, as well as some other men in the town. He visits the boy and tells him he knows his name and informs the boy of his mother and the message she left on the TV about him. This message was not received well by the boy, who still believes he is dead. Until Michele told him that he is a guardian angel and comes visits him, he promise to visit again. He continues visiting Filippo (Mattia di Pierro) and one day he lets him out for some hours of play in the wheat fields together, and then he returns him back to the hole. To win a toy as a present for Filippo, he barters with his best friend Salvatore for a toy blue van by offering to share a secret, and reveals to him Filippo's existence, but Salvatore is uncomfortable about the news, even though he surrenders the van and promises Michele that he will not share his secret with anyone else.  On Michele's next visit to Filippo, he is caught by one of the kidnappers (the older brother of Skull), who finds him in the hole with Filippo and punches him, then hauls him out and drives him home. It turns out that Michele's friend Salvatore has revealed his secret to Skull's brother. His parents have contrasting reactions to his being apprehended. His mother defies Michele's attacker, in defense of her son, but his father, on learning that he has been visiting Filippo, threatens to beat him if he ever goes back to visit the boy again. Michele promises to obey his father. But then one day Skull cajoles his peers into again visiting the farmhouse, where Michele discovers the hole empty and Filippo gone. His friend-turned-traitor Salvatore readily tells him he knows where Filippo has been moved, having overheard his father tell Michele's father, and will tell him if Michele will forgive his betrayal. The next night, Michele overhears the adults discussing who will kill Filippo, and Michele sets out immediately to find Filippo — who is now in a "cave"  — and save him. He hoists him out over a gate and tells him to run for his life, while Michele tries to find a way out for himself with no one to hoist him over the gate. Meanwhile, Michele's father has drawn the short straw and shows up at the cave to kill Filippo. Michele sees it is his father and runs toward him across the cave just as his father fires his gun, shooting his own son in the leg. In the film's last scene, Michele's father runs with Michele in his arms in search of medical aid, as the ringleader from the North (Milan) finds him and insists he has to resume his assigned task of killing Filippo. However, Filippo appears and risks his own life to show gratitude to Michele, just as helicopters arrive and track down the ringleader trying to escape. The film ends with a repentant Pino clutching his son and Michele reaching out to Filippo.  
Identity (film)
 A convict named Malcolm Rivers awaits execution for several vicious murders that took place at an apartment building. Journals belonging to Malcolm are discovered mis-filed in the case  evidence, not introduced during the trial. Malcolm's psychiatrist, Dr. Malick, and his defense attorney argue that the evidence was intentionally suppressed by the prosecution and move to stay Rivers' execution, contending that Malcolm is legally insane. With this late evidence brought forth, a midnight hearing takes place, to determine if the journal is adequate evidence to grant their motion.  Meanwhile, ten strangers find themselves stranded in the middle of a torrential rainstorm at a remote [[Nevada]] motel, run by Larry Washington. The group consists of an ex-cop, now limousine driver, Ed Dakota; Caroline Suzanne, an actress popular in the 1980s; Officer Rhodes, who is transporting convicted murderer Robert Maine; Paris Nevada, a prostitute; newlyweds Lou and Ginny Isiana; and the York family, George, Alice and their nine-year-old son Timmy who are in crisis because Alice has been struck by Ed's car.  With both ends of the road completely flooded, the group is forced to spend the night at the hotel, but an unidentified killer begins to murder them one by one. Caroline is the first to be killed. Ed discovers her head with some of her clothes in a laundry machine inside the motel's laundry room. Rhodes and Larry join him shortly and the trio discover a room key marked with the number 10 inside the same machine where Caroline's head is found. When they go to check the room where Rhodes had left Maine, they discover that Maine has escaped. The group is told to stay together while Ed and Rhodes search for Maine, though Larry sneaks off to steal Caroline's wallet. Ginny becomes increasingly agitated, eventually fleeing to her room. She and Lou argue as he chases after her, but he is stabbed to death while she is hiding in the bathroom. Maine breaks into a darkened building, but when he looks outside he realizes he is in the diner, back at the motel, before being knocked unconscious by Ed and Rhodes. Ed and Rhodes tie up Maine to a post and put Larry in charge of guarding him; but Larry eventually sneaks off again, and Maine is killed. As the group confronts Larry, suspected of killing Maine, another room key marked with the number 8 is discovered near Maine's body. The group go back to check Lou's body to find a room key marked with the number 9 near his body. This leads the group to start thinking that they are being killed one-by-one in a countdown. A panicked Larry attempts to escape in his truck, claiming he did not kill anybody but accidentally runs over George, killing him. Ginny exclaims that the motel's brochure describe native Indians being buried next to the motel and the bizarre deaths could be the work of some supernatural element.  At the hearing, the contents of Malcolm's diaries are revealed, indicating Malcolm suffers from an extreme case of [[dissociative identity disorder]], harboring eleven distinct personalities. His journal contains entries written by his different personalities, each with distinct handwriting and writing style, as if they were the personal thoughts of several different people. His defense attorney argues that Malcolm is completely unaware of the crimes for which he is being executed, which is in violation of existing [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] rulings. Dr. Malick is introducing the concept of integrating the personalities of someone with dissociative identity disorder, when Malcolm arrives, strapped into a wheelchair.  At the hotel, the survivors tie Larry up, and he tells them his story - of taking over the hotel after finding the real hotel manager dead, of apparent natural causes, while leaving Vegas broke and desperate. It is discovered that Alice has apparently died from her injuries. A room key marked 6 is found by her body, so they check George's body and find the key marked 7 in his pocket, even though both George and Alice died from clear accidents. Ed, coming to the conclusion that it is unsafe for them to stay at the motel any further, asks Ginny and Timmy to leave immediately. However, the two die when the car they seem to have boarded explodes. Surprisingly, after putting out the fire caused by the explosion, their bodies are nowhere to be found. Rhodes accuses Ed of the murders as it was his idea for Ginny and Timmy to leave the motel, however as he passes the area George died, Georges body has vanished also. The remaining four head to all crime scenes around the motel and notice Lou's body gone, Alice gone, Caroline’s head vanished and Maine’s body dissapeared.  Paris, yelling in hysterics at their unknown assailant, says that her birthday is the next week. Larry mentions that his birthday is also next week, on the 10th - Paris, Rhodes and Ed all reveal that is also their birthday. They check Larry's photocopies of the guests' IDs and confirm that all 11 of them were born on May 10 - which is also Malcolm's birthday, and the day he committed the murders.  Sensing a headache, Ed hears a voice call out to him, as he listens he finds himself in different building, strapped to the chair, Dr. Malick calling out to him. Finding he is at the meeting to argue and postpone Malcolm's execution, confused as to why he's being told of the crimes and Malcolm Rivers' past. Dr. Malick gives him a mirror and shows Edward his own reflection, which is not his own. Dr. Malick further explains to the horrified Edward that he is in fact, one of the personalities that Malcolm Rivers created as a child to cope with the abandonment and abuse he was subjected to. Informed that one of the personalities is the homicidal template that went on a killing spree, Ed is instructed to "go back" to the motel to try and eliminate this identity.  Ed 'awakens' to find himself standing in the rain, looking at the motel from a distance. Paris finds convict-transportation files for both Maine and Rhodes in the police car. A flashback reveals that Rhodes killed the correctional officer transporting him and Maine, putting the officer's body in the trunk, and then assumed his identity. Rhodes attacks Paris, but she is saved by Larry, who is then shot and killed by Rhodes. Believing Rhodes to be the murderous personality, Ed goes after him, and they end up shooting each other fatally, leaving only Paris still alive. When Malick demonstrates that the homicidal personality is dead, Malcolm's execution is stayed and he is placed in a [[mental institution]] under Malick's care. In Malcolm's mind, Paris has driven back to her hometown in [[Frostproof, Florida]]. As she tends to some soil in her orange grove, she discovers the room 1 motel key, and finds Timmy behind her. Flashbacks reveal that Timmy orchestrated all of the deaths at the motel, and made it appear that he had been killed with Ginny. Timmy kills Paris, while Malcolm strangles Malick, causing the van to swerve off the road and stop before Timmy's voice repeats the poem one more time, now the sole personality of Malcolm Rivers.  
I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (2003 film)
 Davey Graham ([[Jonathan Rhys-Meyers]]) arrives at an upper class party to sell drugs to a woman named Stella. As he leaves, Stella's date watches him and makes a call on his cell phone. Outside the party, three men are waiting for Davey in a black Range Rover, including a car dealer named Boad ([[Malcolm McDowell]]). The men follow Davey around London, finally attacking him just as he's headed home. Two of the men wait for Davey as Boad waits down an alley.  Both men grab him, and one of them holds his hand over his mouth to muffle his cries for help.  They then drag him off the street and into a garage, where they hold him down as Boad rapes him. At dawn, Davey emerges from the garage and stumbles home, where he draws a bath for himself and gets in fully clothed. Several hours later, his friend Mickser ([[Jamie Foreman]]) arrives to pick up Davey. He discovers Davey dead in the bathtub, with his throat slashed. Mickser visits Helen ([[Charlotte Rampling]]) and asks her how to get in touch with Davey's brother Will ([[Clive Owen]]). She says that she has stopped receiving letters from Will, who left London three years earlier.  Will has been working as a logger in the country. He's unshaven with long hair, and he lives out of a van. After he's fired from his job for having no papers, he heads to the sea to take a ferry out of England when he sees Davey in the terminal. After realizing it was a hallucination, he begins calling Davey's flat. Receiving no answer, he returns to London, where he learns that Davey is dead.  His return to London stirs up the anxiety of crime boss Frank Turner (Ken Stott), who sends word to Will that he should leave town after he buries his brother. Will's old cohorts urge him to return for good, saying that Turner could be overtaken easily. Will makes it clear that he is not interested in returning to his old life. He visits Helen and apologizes for leaving her. He explains that he has been grieving for 'a life wasted', lamenting the fact that Davey also wasted his.  Will orders a second post-mortem to try to determine why Davey would kill himself. It reveals that he was raped the night before he died, in addition to the fact that Davey ejaculated during the rape. The coroner explains that it was a result of the [[Orgasm#Anal stimulation|anal stimulation]], surmising that Davey probably killed himself over the shame he felt after involuntarily ejaculating during the rape. He refers Will to a psychologist who can explain the phenomenon more eloquently. As Will listens to the psychologist explain the mindset of the rapist and the mental damage of a rape victim, he takes his first drink in three years.  Mickser visits the woman who hosted the party where Davey made his sale. The hostess remembers seeing the man make a phone call as Davey left, and she tracks down his identity. Will and Mickser visit the man who leads them to Boad. During a dinner party at Boad's house, Will cases the grounds and leaves. Meanwhile, Will's cohorts pull a prank at Turner's house, hogtying one of his bodyguards in a bra and panties. Irate, Turner hires an Irish hitman to retaliate.  Will visits a garage and uncovers a vintage Jaguar. He retrieves a suitcase from the trunk and checks into a hotel. The suitcase is full of money and clothes, in addition to a gun. Will has a suit pressed and orders a barber to cut off his long hair and beard. Clean cut and in his suit, he has the Jaguar washed and heads to Boad's house. On his way, he calls Helen and tells her to pack a bag. Turner's hitman is waiting outside her house, though.  At Boad's, Will trips the alarm on a car in the garage, drawing Boad out of the house. Will kills his dog and then points his gun at Boad, asking him why he raped Davey. Boad explains that he'd been following Davey for six weeks, fascinated by how fake he was. He hated the way that Davey waltzed through life, conning everyone with good looks and charm. Boad says that he wanted to make Davey realize that he was worthless. Will tells Boad that he will kill him later, because killing him at that moment would be too easy. As he's walking away from the house, he pauses and then returns to the garage and kills Boad.  Helen is shown sitting on the staircase in her flat, arms crossed, waiting with Turner's hitman for Will to arrive. The film ends on an ambiguous note as Will watches a man hitting golf balls into the ocean. It is the same shot and voiceover which opens the film. Will speaks about how most thoughts are just memories, and after someone is gone, the memories of him are all that's left. He gets into his car and drives off.

In America (film)
 In 1982, Johnny and Sarah Sullivan and their daughters Christy and Ariel enter the United States on a [[Visa (document)|tourist visa]] from Ireland via Canada, where Johnny was working as an actor. The family settles in New York City, in a rundown [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] [[tenement]] occupied by [[Drug addiction|drug addicts]], [[Transvestism|transvestites]], and a reclusive Nigerian artist/photographer named Mateo Kuamey. Hanging over the family is the death of their five-year-old son Frankie, who died from a [[brain tumor]]. The devout [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] Johnny questions God and has lost any ability to feel true emotions, which has affected his relationship with his family. Christy believes she has been granted three wishes by her dead brother, which she only uses at times of near-dire consequences for the family as they try to survive in New York.  After finding the apartment, Sarah gets a job in the local [[ice cream parlor]] to support the family while Johnny auditions for any role for which he is suited, with no success. Despite their poverty, the initial joy of being in the United States and the closeness of the family gives them the energy to make the most of what they have, and Christy chronicles the events of their life with a cherished [[camcorder]]. As money runs low and the city's temperatures soar, the family dip into savings to go to the movies to see ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and enjoy the air conditioning to find respite from the oppressive heat. Tensions between Johnny and Sarah begin to rise with the summer heat. Not helping their financial and emotional strain is the discovery that Sarah is pregnant.  Eventually Johnny finds work as a [[Taxicab|cab driver]] to augment their income and help pay for the girls' Catholic school tuition.  On [[Halloween]], the girls become friendly with Mateo when they knock at his door to [[Trick-or-treating|trick-or-treat]]. Despite Johnny's reticence about the somewhat imposing and forbidding man, Sarah invites him to their apartment for dinner, and eventually they learn that the man is sad and lonely because he is dying of AIDS.  Later, Mateo falls down a flight of stairs and is knocked unconscious. Christy tries to resuscitate him using [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]], although she is warned away from him by the other residents, who seem to be aware that he is [[HIV-positive]]. The man's condition continues to deteriorate as Sarah's fetus develops. The baby is [[Premature birth|born prematurely]] and in poor health, and is in need of a blood transfusion. Johnny and Sarah are ultimately nervous not only about the baby's survival chances, but also of the skyrocketing hospital bills that will now need to be paid following the baby's delivery, causing Sarah to have a brief [[nervous breakdown]] and blame Johnny for Frankie's death, and tearfully berates him.  However, after calming her down, Johnny and Sarah agree to the blood transfusion but without giving the baby "bad blood," as using hospital blood banks was the source of Mateo's contraction of HIV. Shortly, it is discovered that Christy has a compatible blood type to donate with, and Mateo's death coincides with the first healthy movements of the infant following a [[blood transfusion]] from Christy. After the successful operation, the family is startled to learn that Mateo had settled and paid for their astronomical hospital bill before he had died, upon the discovery that Mateo was in possession of a large trust fund he never spent. They give the newborn baby girl the middle name of Mateo in gratitude and to honor his memory.  With the birth of the new baby and the death of Mateo, Johnny finally is able to overcome his lack of emotion and put his grieving for Frankie to rest. He also finally catches a break by getting a small role in ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' on Broadway.  The film ends after a baby shower at the apartment is held for the Sullivan family with many of the apartment tenants present to celebrate, and Christy and the rest of her family overlook the view of the city and look out for Mateo in the night's sky.  
In the Cut
 High school teacher and writer Frannie Avery meets a student at a local bar, and when she heads to the bathroom sees a woman performing [[oral sex]] on a man. A few days later, Detective Giovanni Malloy questions her as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman, whose severed limb was found in her garden. They flirt despite the grisly nature of their introduction, and meet at the same bar later. Frannie is alternately thrilled and frightened by the detective's sexual aggressiveness, even as she grows more disillusioned with the attitudes and crude behavior of other men, including the detective's partner, Richard Rodriguez. Even as Malloy defends his partner, who can no longer carry a gun because he threatened his unfaithful wife, he promises he will do anything she wants except hit her. She leaves abruptly and is assaulted walking home, but calls Malloy and their affair begins that night.   Frannie recognizes the detective's tattoo, from the man in the basement of the bar, and asks her sister Pauline if she would trust a man who got a blow job in a bar. Pauline says yes, but Frannie is still suspicious. After Malloy tells her that she and the first victim were in the same bar the night of the murder, and she might have seen the murderer, she begins to suspect that Malloy may actually be the killer, especially after a second victim is found. But later she goes with him to a woodsy spot by the water, where he scares her by shooting at [[garbage bag]]s floating on the surface, then tells her she should learn how to shoot. She surprises herself by taking aim and shooting well, before they head back to the city.  She finds her old boyfriend in her bed when she gets home, and goes back to her sister's apartment, where she finds the door open and Pauline's dismembered body. She is now more frightened of Malloy than ever, but goes home and gets drunk, and almost stumbles into bed with her student before throwing him out. Malloy's partner is outside watching as the young man runs out, and Frannie shouts out the window that Malloy should stay away from her. But he comes over and helps her clean herself up, and she can't decide if she should trust him. So she cuffs him to a pipe and makes love to him, and as soon as she is done he starts rattling the cuffs, demanding to be set free. She is fishing in his jacket for the keys when she finds the missing charms from her bracelet, which he claims he found and was planning to return to her. She suddenly becomes very suspicious of him, and he gets scared and yells at her. She finally tells Malloy she saw his tattoo in the basement of the bar when he was getting a blow job, and she runs out, stumbling right into his partner's arms. Frannie tells Rodriguez what she saw, and he says they need to sit down and talk, so she gets in his car. Malloy's screams from the window are ignored.  Rodriguez drives her out to the GW bridge, telling her this is the place he goes to fish, and she says, "I teach that book, ''[[To the Lighthouse]]''." But as soon as he locks the gate behind them she knows she is in trouble, and he shows her the tattoo on his arm, the twin of Malloy's. She realizes Malloy is innocent, then she slips on his jacket before Rodriguez takes her in his arms. She shoots him once with Malloy's gun but he tries to strangle her before she can shoot him again; they fall, and he dies. She walks, bloodied, back to her apartment and lies down in the arms of the exhausted Malloy, still cuffed to the pipe where she left him.

In Hell
 Kyle LeBlanc is an American working overseas in [[Magnitogorsk]], [[Russia]]. When he hears his wife being attacked over the phone, Kyle rushes home, but is too late to save her. Sergio Kovic, the man who killed his wife, buys the judge and is found not guilty for lack of evidence. Kyle takes the law into his own hands and kills Kovic, and for this, he is sentenced to life in prison without parole. He soon befriends inmate Billy Cooper, a 21-year-old American who is subjected to constant rape and beatings by prison inmates with the assistance of the guards, and Malakai, a prisoner who uses a wheelchair and claims to know the ins and outs of prison life.  After getting into a brawl with an inmate who provoked him in a way similar to his wife's murderer, Kyle is put in solitary confinement. Then he is transferred to a cell with Inmate 451, who has the reputation of killing inmates, and the sadistic head of the guards believes he will do the same to Kyle. However, over time they begin to trust one another.  The general who runs the prison amuses himself by betting on organized fights between his prisoners to fill his pockets. After savagely killing the inmate who previously had provoked him in his first fight, Kyle is continuously forced into more fights because the general and guards know he is a sure thing, and slowly he begins to lose his sanity. At one point 451 asks him, "Do you even know who you are? Probably not." Meanwhile, Billy attempts multiple times to escape the prison, first by running during outside work detail, and again by sneaking off during the Russian Independence Day celebration; the latter fails as he is betrayed by Malakai, who informs the guards because his need of special medicine. 451 discovers his betrayal, and later, in retaliation, pours lighter fluid on him and sets him on fire.  After being locked in a cell with prison fighter Valya overnight one night, Billy is beaten to within an inch of his life after he spits in Valya's face. Billy later succumbs to his injuries, but before he dies, he whispers to Kyle, "Don't let them make you become something you're not." With this advice, Kyle now knows he must fight another battle: the fight for inner peace, as it is the only way he can become the man he once was. Kyle refuses to fight in the next match, and as a result, is hung by his arms outside for all to see. However, seeing Kyle's courage and his ability to stay strong during his punishment, the other inmates begin to follow suit by refusing to fight. Kyle is released soon from his restraints and is forced into a fight with Miloc, a gargantuan prisoner kept separate from the general population who Kyle kept hearing through the walls from his time in solitary confinement. During the fight, Kyle knocks on a door repeatedly, making Miloc recognize him, as this was his only form of communication, and he embraces him as a friend. The two then turn on the guards and ignite a full-scale riot, during which Miloc is killed by gunfire.  Soon, 451 gives Kyle the evidence of all the murders and corruption that have happened in this prison for the past 20 something years that he has planned to expose to the US government. While the guards are getting the prisoners under control, 451 shows Kyle a secret passage to the prison garage for their next move. Kyle participates in one final fight, which he wins, but the guards have indicated they will kill him afterwards. When two guards take Kyle to the garage, 451 launches an attack and kills one of them while Kyle holds the other at gunpoint and pins him down to the ground. After taking the key to free himself, Kyle takes one of the guards' uniforms to disguise himself and drives off in one of their cars while 451 stays behind to assassinate the general for his misdeeds. His final fate is unknown, but Kyle successfully returns to the US and exposes the prison's crimes. Three months afterwards, the prison is shut down.  
Imperium: Augustus
  As Augustus lies on his death bed, he recalls the events that led to the exile of his daughter, Julia.  Following an assassination attempt on his life, Marcus Agrippa, Augustus's oldest friend and Julia's husband and father to her children, is called back to Rome for his protection. However, he dies of a fever on his way back to Rome. Upon hearing the news Augustus consoles Julia by recalling his rise to power along with Agrippa.   Following their success serving [[Julius Caesar]], Octavius's great-uncle, during the final battle of [[Caesar's Civil War]], they are sent to [[Macedon]]ia together along with [[Maecenas]] to continue their education as soldiers and diplomats. However, shortly after, they hear news of the [[Ides of March|Caesar's assassination]] and that Octavius has been named his heir, forcing them to return to Rome.   In the ensuing power struggle that follows Caesar's death, Octavius is forced to ally himself with [[Mark Antony]], Caesar's right-hand man. In their pursuit of [[Marcus Junius Brutus]], [[Gaius Cassius Longinus]] and their co-conspirators, a wave of executions spread across Rome, practically eliminates the old Roman ruling class, including Cicero and Livia's father. After the battle of [[Battle of Phillipi]], Octavius and Mark Antony divide government of the Empire between the two of them, with Antony taking Egypt and Octavius taking Rome. Octavius marries Scribona, while Antony marries Octavius's elder sister, Octavia. However, following Julia's birth, Octavius leaves her to marry Livia, which to present day Julia resents.  Governing Rome with Maecenas and Agrippa, they work to improve Rome's infrastructure by implementing Agrippa's skills as an architect and Maecenas's knowledge of law and politics. However, Antony becomes the lover of the Egyptian queen, [[Cleopatra]], and being taken in by the Egyptian culture of divinity, he abandons Octavia and declares war on Rome. Eventually, Egypt is conquered by Octavius, Agrippa, and Maecenas following the [[Battle of Actium]]. However, while Agrippa wishes to reinstate the Republic, Maecenas wishes for Octavius to become the emperor of Rome. Octavius is given the title Augustus and is acknowledged as the sole-ruler of the Empire but refuses the title of king.  In the present day, several months after Agrippa's death, Augustus and Livia force Julia to marry Livia's son, Tiberius. Neither are happy with the arrangement as Tiberius is happily married and Julia is in love with Iullus, Mark Antony's son whom Augustus spared following the conquest of Rome and was raised by Octavia. In order to spare Julia's feelings, Augustus sends Tiberius to Gaul while telling Julia that she can continue her relationship with Iullus provided they are discreet. Unbeknownst to either of them, Iullus is conspiring to assassinate Augustus along with Julia's half-brother, Scipio, as revenge for Augustus's crimes against their parents.  Upon learning of Julia's relationship with Iullus, Tiberius returns to Rome in a rage to confront her for dishonoring him. When she refuses to submit to him, he attacks and rapes her. Julia suffers a mental breakdown afterward, confiding in Iullus that she wishes her father would die so her suffering would end. Iullus and Scripo conspire to kill Augustus for Julia's sake as well as their own. Tiberius, who is planning to kill Iullus for infidelity with his wife, overhears the plot and informs his mother. Livia decides that they will catch Iullus in the act and in doing so would rid themselves of Julia, focusing Augustus to accept Tiberius as his successor.   The assassination plan is foiled when the noise alerts Livia, Julia and Tiberius to the scene. Tiberius fatally wounds Iullus and saves Augustus just as Julia enters. Before he dies, Iullus tells Julia, "I did it for you."  Although Julia was unaware of the plot, Augustus demands the Senate exile her for adultery. Informing her of his decision to banish her, he insists on keeping her children. Before she leaves Julia tells Augustus it would have been kinder to kill her at birth rather and that she, at least, loves her children enough not to use them as he has with her. Shortly after Julia is exiled, both her sons die of fever.  Back on his deathbed, Augustus calls out for Julia. She reveals that she has returned to Rome in disguise and goes to his bedside though she refuses to take his hand. However, when he asks her "Did I play my part well in the comedy of life?" she takes the death mask from Livia, kisses his forehead and places it herself over Augustus's smiling dead face.

Infernal Affairs II
  In 1991, Hong Kong police inspector Wong Chi-shing meets his informant, Hon Sam. At the same time, Lau Kin-ming, Hon's prospective [[mole (espionage)|mole]] within the [[Royal Hong Kong Police Force]], assassinates Hon's [[triad (underground society)|triad]] boss, Ngai Kwun. Lau is later greeted by Hon's wife, Mary, who casually ascertains whether he has any reservations about his mission for Hon. While giving him cash, Mary advises Lau to maintain a low profile. She also confesses that she was the person who ordered the hit on Ngai Kwun, admitting that Hon has no knowledge of this transgression and urges Lau to remain silent. Mary wants Hon to replace Ngai Kwun as the triad boss.  Meanwhile, instructors at the police academy discover that Chan Wing-yan, a promising but troubled cadet, is the half-brother of Ngai Kwun's heir, Ngai Wing-hau; he is subsequently discharged from the police force. Chan is later approached by Wong, who asks him why he wants to be a cop; Chan replies, "I want to be a good guy." Wong subsequently makes Chan an undercover cop, sending him to prison to get close to one of Hon's men, Keung. Meanwhile, Ngai Wing-hau replaces his father as the triad boss; he is the only Ngai child directly involved in the family business. With Ngai dead, four other underbosses, the "Big Four", dismiss Ngai and debate on whether to continue paying their dues to his family. However, Ngai forces them to pay up by blackmailing them individually with his knowledge of their mutual betrayals. Hon acts as an ''[[agent provocateur]]'' for Ngai in this affair.  By 1995, Chan has become a small-time gangster while Lau rises as a rookie cop. Chan's continual association with Hon and Ngai causes his girlfriend to have an abortion because she does not want their child to follow in Chan's footsteps. Ngai wishes the troubled Chan to be integrated into the Ngai family and invites him to his daughter's birthday party, where he announces that he wants to retire in Hawaii and divide his business among the Big Four. He also gives Hon control over a Thai cocaine smuggling ring. Meanwhile, Hon leaks information about criminal dealings to Lau, who is able to apprehend many local gangsters and earn a promotion in rank.  During Ngai's next drug deal, Chan tips off the police with a [[Morse code]] message about an abrupt change of plans for the meeting. The police show up and arrest Ngai as the deal is taking place. However, no drugs are found in the suitcase, which instead contains a videotape showing that Wong conspired with Mary to have Ngai Kwun murdered. Caught off guard by the sudden turn of events, the police release Ngai. Wong is relieved of his police authority pending an investigation for [[Police misconduct|misconduct]]. While Ngai is taken in for questioning, his men assassinate the Big Four and set into motion his plans for vengeance against his father's murderers. An ambush awaits Hon as he meets Ngai's contact in Thailand. A bomb is set off in Wong's car; while Wong is unharmed in the attack, his superior and friend, Chief Inspector Luk, dies in the blast. Lau saves Mary from an assassin and takes her to a safehouse, but decides to have her killed when she rejects his feelings toward her. He reveals to Ngai's men that she will be at [[Kai Tak Airport]], where she gets mown down by a car.  In 1997, Lau is picked as one of the officers to preside over the ceremony signifying [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Britain's handover of Hong Kong to China]]. Wong is cleared of misconduct by his superiors and reinstated to his former post. Ngai attempts to enter politics but his support disintegrates after Hon, who survived the shooting in Thailand, turns on him and provides evidence to [[Interpol]] about his illegal dealings. Wong brings Hon back to Hong Kong under [[witness protection]] after Hon agrees to testify against Ngai in court. In the meantime, Ngai sends his men to Thailand to take Hon's family hostage in an attempt to threaten Hon to back out. During the confrontation between Ngai and Hon, Hon reveals to Ngai that his Thai mafia friends are also holding Ngai's family hostage in Hawaii and that he has no real family in Thailand. Infuriated, Ngai holds Hon hostage at gunpoint just as Wong and the police show up. During the standoff, Wong fatally shoots Ngai, who dies in Chan's arms. Moments before succumbing to his wound, Ngai discovers the wire in Chan's jacket and realises that his half-brother is an undercover cop.  Hon's tactics against Ngai lead to a falling out between him and Wong. Shortly after their final meeting, Hon reluctantly lets his Thai friends murder Ngai's family in Hawaii. The pieces are set in place for the first film: Hon goes down the dark path of replacing Ngai as the triad boss, becoming Wong's new foe; Lau is a police inspector and Hon's mole; Chan is forced to remain undercover, returning to join Hon's triad. As the handover ceremony takes place, Hon sheds tears over the loss of Mary before hosting a party. Back at police headquarters, Lau handles a case involving a young woman, coincidentally also called Mary, who becomes his fiancée in ''[[Infernal Affairs]]''.  
Indigo (film)
 At the beginning of the story Ray Talloway ([[Neale Donald Walsch]]) is a construction manager whose business is near bankruptcy. His semi-estranged daughter Cheryl (Sarah Rutan) quarrels with him on the slightest pretext, while her husband Alex (Gregory Linington) is one of a small group of minor criminals. Cheryl and Alex have one daughter, Grace (shared role by Meghan McCandless as older Grace and Angelina Hess as younger Grace), who is the [[indigo child]] of the story, and who eventually reunites the family.  One night, Alex takes Cheryl to a "party" that promises something exciting to happen to the participants (presumably overuse of drugs). Cheryl is worried by leaving Grace alone in the car; therefore, Alex leaves to check on her. A few minutes later, a police detachment arrests every one of the criminals. Grace, who was asleep in the car, wakes and sees her mother taken to prison. Ray, who is asleep at home, receives a call from the police station informing him of his daughter's arrest. He goes to the police station, arriving deep in telephone conversation with one of his business partners, who warns him of protest by environmentalists at the site of one of his latest projects. This causes him to abandon his daughter at the station and drive to the site. The sight of the crowd protesting his efforts to eradicate a forest to make room for a new highway, combined with the effect of having his daughter arrested, causes him to experience a small nervous breakdown.  Here, the film jumps ahead five years. In the interim, Ray has lost his job and is living at home alone, as the owner of a very old car which is on the verge of disintegration. Cheryl has been in jail for possession of illegal drugs even though she is innocent. Ray has neither come to visit her nor bailed her out of prison. Grace is living in a children's home superintended by a nurse (Saffron Henke). Alex has fled, possibly to [[Canada]], and has not appeared since.  A visit by her lawyer leaves Cheryl afraid for Grace's safety, the lawyer having intimated that Alex might kidnap Grace in exchange for money he believes to be in Cheryl's possession. After this scene is over, viewers see the lawyer walking to a car and accepting a bribe. Cheryl, who has not seen this, calls Ray asking that he visit her. When he arrives, Cheryl tells him of the lawyer's information and asks him to retrieve Grace and take care of her until Cheryl is released on parole. Ray does so, out of a sense of duty towards his daughter and guilt at being an inadequate father and grandfather. Upon her reappearance, Grace is revealed to have developed her supermundane abilities to the point where they are unsettling to Ray, who unceremoniously kidnaps her with her consent and aid. Having escaped, the two meet with Ray's girlfriend Sally (Lynette Louise), who temporarily harbors them. Ray and Grace later drive north to [[Ashland, Oregon]], where they think to hide until Cheryl's parole takes effect. On the way, they spend the night in a hotel and begin to develop a bond. The hotel manager is astonished next morning when Grace brings his father, who suffers a severe case of [[Alzheimer's disease]], into waking consciousness. He reacts with the accusation that it is the work of the devil, whereupon Ray and Grace leave, while the father and son begin to reconcile.  At a park, Grace befriends a lonely boy called Nicholas, who like her is one of the [[indigo children]]. The nature thereof is explained to Ray (and thus to the viewer) by Nicholas' mother while the children play.  Further north, Ray's car finally fails to operate so that he and Grace are forced to walk. They are befriended by a group of teenagers who are on their way to Mt. Ashland, one of whom is played by Neale's son, Karus Walsch, with whom they spend the night in a cabin. Karus's character, Logan, is disturbed by Grace's telling of a story of his childhood that revives painful memories. According to her, he could communicate with angels when he was a boy but suppressed his ability when his older brother beat him whenever he talked about it. Another one of the teenagers, Emma, expresses skepticism and anger at Grace's powers, especially when Grace claims to see the spirit of Emma's mother; later, Emma accepts Grace's ways and becomes grateful.  When Ray and Grace arrive at the arranged cabin, they find to Ray's surprise that it is occupied by Ray's long-estranged son Stewart (Dane Bowman). Stewart is there to collect the money that he thinks Cheryl hid and believes that Grace knows where it is. He takes her hostage; at this, Ray claims that Grace requires a medicine that is in his suitcase. Stewart allows Ray to open the suitcase, in which is no medicine but a pistol, with which Ray intends to frighten his son. As Ray reaches for the pistol, he suddenly recalls his past and reconsiders his decision. He attempts to apologize to Stewart, but Stewart refuses to accept this. An arrival of two police officers at the cabin surprises them all, with the exception of Grace, who had summoned them. Grace reveals that the younger of the two, Officer Whitfield, was one of the officers who had captured Cheryl, and that he has illegally been using the money Stewart sought.  The film ends with the reconciliation and reunion of the family.

Infernal Affairs III
 ''Infernal Affairs III'' uses parallel storytelling, flashing between the past and the present.  ===Six months before Chan's death===  Undercover cop Chan Wing-yan seeks to uncover the link between Hong Kong [[Triad (underground society)|triad]] boss Hon Sam and the mysterious Mainland Chinese gang leader Shen Cheng. Since Hon's ascension to the seat of triad boss was due to the death of his predecessor, Ngai Wing-hau, Hon is suspicious of all his men for fear they might usurp his position. He tests Chan's loyalty by ordering him to smash an ashtray on Shen's brother during a negotiation, resulting in Chan's arrest by Inspector Yeung Kam-wing. Yeung tells Chan that though Chan does not recognise him, he recognises Chan and he warns the latter to "be careful". Chan is released after both Hon and Shen fetch him at police headquarters.  Concurrently, Chan is prosecuted for violent behaviour. His superior, [[Police superintendent|Superintendent]] Wong Chi-shing, persuades the court to allow Chan to seek therapy, leading him to meet therapist Lee Sum-yee. Hon asks Chan to deliver arms to Shen, but he and other triad members do not show up. When Chan delivers the cargo, Shen's men discover that the boxes are empty and open fire on Chan; Shen and Chan shoot each other in the limbs during the crossfire. Shen finds out that Chan is an undercover cop when Yeung unexpectedly arrives on the scene. Yeung tells Chan that Shen is also an undercover cop working for the Mainland authorities. Yeung also tells Chan that he gained top honours when he was in the police academy due to Chan's "expulsion". The three shake hands, wait for the chaos to subside, then leave.  ===Ten months after Chan's death=== Lau Kin-ming, Hon's former [[mole (espionage)|mole]] in the [[Hong Kong Police Force]], has been demoted to administrative duty pending an investigation into the deaths of Chan and Inspector B. He falsely claims that B shot Chan in the head while holding him hostage, and that he killed B in retaliation. After months of investigation, Lau is transferred back to [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]], where he struggles to whitewash his past and cover his true identity. Lau later learns that Hon had previously planted five other moles in the police force, one of whom might be a fellow Security Division Inspector, Yeung. A battle of wits develops between Lau and Yeung, as each of them tries to discover the other's secret.  Meanwhile, Lau suffers from an identity collapse as he loses track of reality, wrestling with guilt over Chan's death and grappling with his impending divorce from his wife, Mary. His psychological trauma deteriorates to the point where he begins to see himself as Chan. As "Chan", Lau makes it a personal mission to apprehend Yeung, whom he sees as his former self. After witnessing an incident where Lau suffers a hallucination, Lee conducts a hypnosis on him and finds out that he was Hon's mole. Lau realises his folly and knocks Lee unconscious before escaping.  Lau steals tapes from Yeung's office safe, using [[spy camera]]s to determine the code. He thinks he hears recordings of Yeung relating information to Hon, and leads his team to the Security Division to arrest Yeung just as Shen arrives. Lau plays a tape recording, which is actually a conversation between him and Hon. When Lau's second-in-command tries to arrest him instead, Lau panics and draws his gun, killing Yeung. He is immediately shot by Shen and attempts suicide by shooting himself in the neck. During a search of Lau's office, a tape is found in his safe and played. It is a recording of the song sung by [[Tsai Chin (singer)|Tsai Chin]], given to him by Hon's wife.  ===Eleven months after Chan's death=== A series of flashbacks play: immediately after Chan's death, Shen and Yeung meet. Shen suspects Lau. Yeung breaks into Lau's office to find tape recordings of his conversations with Hon, proving that Shen is right.  Yeung is buried next to Chan in the police cemetery. Shen and Lee visit the graves and Shen says to Lee: "Events change men, but men do not change events. But these two men are extraordinary because they changed events."  Lau ends up crippled and [[Catatonia|catatonic]], lost inside his own mind, haunted by the spirit of Mary (Hon Sam's wife, whom he had a crush on in ''Infernal Affairs II'') and locked in his own "[[Avici|continuous hell]]". His divorced wife Mary visits and tells him, "Our baby can say "papa" now." Before the picture fades into the next scene, the camera pans down onto Lau's fingers tapping out in [[Morse code]], "H-E-L..." (and then the start of another 'L' as the picture dims).  Before the film ends, there is one final flashback to the hi-fi shop scene in ''Infernal Affairs'', where Lau is buying an audio system from Chan.

At this time, former billionaire businessman Dr. Claw ([[Tony Martin (Australian actor)|Tony Martin]]) escapes from prison by tunnelling. Mayor Wilson ([[Sigrid Thornton]]) takes this opportunity to create G2 ([[Elaine Hendrix]]), a female Gadget-type robot that can function normally. Gadget begins to fall in love with G2.  Claw, who had lost his fortune and empire as a result of him being arrested, begins a new plan to steal gold from the United States Treasury in order to rebuild his fortune and empire. Gadget makes repeated attempts to stop Claw, but is continually foiled by his own bumbling and gadgetry glitches. Gadget's bumbling allows Dr. Claw's men to steal components for Claw's latest scheme and get away with it. Chief Quimby becomes increasingly frustrated and eventually fires Gadget, despite that Gadget had enough evidence from scientists to prove that it wasn't his fault. When Penny realizes that her uncle was fired and asks if there's anything she can do to help, Gadget tells her that she is still too young and to not get involved.  Penny decides to examine the evidence on her own and eventually finds Claw's hideout at an abandoned bowling factory. She infiltrates the hideout, but Claw captures her. At the gala, Gadget gets a job as a limo driver who opens doors for the guests.

Afterwards, Claw and his minions escape after Gadget fails to recognize him. After G2's failure, Quimby is ordered by Mayor Wilson to deactivate the robot and end the Gadget program.  Gadget goes to the police department to reactivate G2. Brain tells them that Claw has kidnapped Penny and has used the three stolen supplies (ionic fuel cells, a protoid laser, and a ruby) to build a super-weapon. Outside, Claw activates his machine, which was hidden in a truck. The weapon freezes time in Riverton, allowing Claw and his minions to easily rob the Federal Reserve. Both Gadgets manage to avoid the weapon's blast and find Claw and his minions at the Federal Reserve.  At the treasury, Claw orders his minions to attack Gadget and G2 so he can get away. Gadget and G2 decide to switch chips in order to make Gadget work perfectly, leaving G2 to deal with the glitches.  Gadget chases after Claw, who is escaping in an ice cream truck, but Claw drops Penny off the truck with explosives attached to her so that Gadget has to go after her instead of stopping Claw. At the bridge, Gadget stops Claw's truck with a puddle of bubble gum. Claw's minions try to escape but get stuck in the smear of bubble gum and are arrested. When Gadget orders Claw to put his hand (and claw) up, Claw gets away in a rocket-like escape pod, proclaiming: "You may have won this round, but I'll get you next time, Gadget!"

Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem
   The main points of the story coincide with the Daft Punk tracks on their ''Discovery'' album. On an alien planet, a band is playing to a packed audience; keyboardist Octave, guitarist Arpegius, drummer Baryl, and bass player Stella. ("[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]"). A military force invades the planet and kidnaps the band ("[[Aerodynamic (instrumental)|Aerodynamic]]").  A space pilot called Shep is awoken from a dream about Stella by a distress call about the kidnapping and pursues the kidnappers through a wormhole, where he crashes on Earth ("[[Digital Love (Daft Punk song)|Digital Love]]").   The band is taken to an underground facility, where their memories are removed to disks and their blue skin changed to make them resemble humans. They are fitted with mind-control devices hidden in sunglasses ("[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]"). Their captor, Earl de Darkwood, poses as their manager and presents them as a new band called The Crescendolls, who take the world by storm ("Crescendolls"). The fame has its disadvantages as the exhausted members of the band are forced to sign large amounts of marketing material. Meanwhile, Shep finds his way to the city and discovers what has happened to the band ("Nightvision").   During a stadium concert, Shep flies in with a jet pack and fires a beam at each band member, freeing all of them from the mind control except Stella. In the escape, Shep is mortally wounded, and Darkwood's bodyguards are revealed to be androids ("Superheroes").   Still under the Earl's control, Stella finds a card with the address of the Earl's home, Darkwood Manor, which she hides in her dress. She is taken to a “Gold Record Award” ceremony, where the Crescendolls win the Gold Record. Baryl is concealed in the audience and frees Stella with the beam, and they make their escape with Octave's help ("High Life"). The band returns to Shep, who reveals their true identities before he dies ("[[Something About Us (Daft Punk song)|Something About Us]]"). They bury Shep and his spirit rises into space. While driving away, they use the card Stella took earlier to find their way to Darkwood Manor, and decide to investigate ("Voyager").   Whilst exploring Darkwood's mansion, the band finds their way into a secret room, in which they find a journal revealing Darkwood's plans. He has been kidnapping musicians from various worlds to acquire 5,555 gold records, with which he can rule the universe. Darkwood captures them and attempts to sacrifice Stella to complete the ritual, but Arpegius manages to throw the final gold record into a chasm, and Darkwood follows it into the abyss ("Veridis Quo"). The band travels back to the record company to retrieve the memory disks. Octave sneaks in to steal them, but while escaping from the building, he is tasered by a guard, and his skin reverts to its blue state ("Short Circuit").   The authorities find Shep's ship and mount an operation to return the Crescendolls to normal, and get the quartet back to their home planet ("[[Face to Face (Daft Punk song)|Face to Face]]"). On the way back to the wormhole, Darkwood's spirit appears and attacks the ship. Shep's spirit also appears and fights Darkwood, which frees them. The band returns to their home planet to great acclaim, and a statue of Shep is erected ("Too Long"). At the end, it is implied that the whole story was the dream of a young boy, inspired by the ''Discovery'' album and toys in his room.  During the end credits, a remix of "Aerodynamic" plays.  
Intolerable Cruelty
 Donovan Donaly ([[Geoffrey Rush]]) a TV [[soap opera]] producer, walks in on his wife Bonnie ([[Stacey Travis]]) being intimate with an ex-boyfriend. He files for divorce, and Bonnie hires Miles Massey ([[George Clooney]]), a top divorce attorney and the inventor of the "Massey pre-nup", a completely foolproof [[prenuptial agreement]]. Miles wins a large property settlement against Donaly, leaving him broke.  [[Private investigator]] Gus Petch ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]) tails the wealthy and married Rex Rexroth ([[Edward Herrmann]]) on a drunken night out with a blonde. When they stop at a motel, Gus catches their tryst on video. He takes the video to Rex's wife, Marylin Rexroth ([[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]), a marriage-for-money predator. She files for divorce, demanding a large property settlement. Unable to afford a divorce settlement, Rex hires Miles to represent him. Marylin's friend, serial divorcée Sarah Sorkin ([[Julia Duffy]]), warns Marilyn that Miles will be a dangerous opponent.  Marylin and her lawyer, Freddy Bender ([[Richard Jenkins]]), fail to reach an agreement with Miles and Rex. Bored Miles asks the fascinating Marylin to dinner, where they flirt. While they are out, Petch breaks in and copies her address book for Miles, who has his assistant search among the names for Marylin's accomplice in predatory marriage. In court, Marylin feigns an emotional breakdown over Rex's infidelity, professing that she loved Rex unconditionally at first sight.  Miles then calls "Puffy" Krauss von Espy ([[Jonathan Hadary]]), a Swiss hotel concierge located by his assistant. Puffy testifies that Marylin asked him to find her a marriage target who was very rich, foolish, and a philanderer whom she could easily divorce, and that he pointed her to Rex. The divorce is granted, but Marylin gets nothing, and Miles' ancient boss, Herb Myerson ([[Tom Aldredge]]), congratulates him.  Marylin wants revenge. She finds the now-penniless Donaly living on the street, still clutching his [[Emmy award|Emmy]] statuette. She offers him a chance to reclaim his lost glory if he helps her get revenge on Miles. Soon after, Marylin shows up at Miles' office with her new fiancé, oil millionaire Howard D. Doyle ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]). Marylin insists on the Massey prenup, which will make it absolutely impossible for her to claim any of her fiancée's assets in the event of a divorce, over both Howard and Miles's objections. However, Howard destroys it during the wedding, as a demonstration of love.  Six months later, Miles goes to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] to give the keynote address at a convention for divorce attorneys. He encounters Marylin, who has divorced Howard and presumably collected a sizable share of the Doyle Oil fortune. However, she admits that she is disenchanted with her wealthy but lonely life. Miles is thrilled, and marries her on the spur of the moment. To prove that he has no interest in her fortune, he signs the Massey prenup, but she tears it up. The next morning a disheveled Miles tells the convention that love is the most important thing, and that he is giving up divorce for ''[[pro bono]]'' work.  A short time later, Miles discovers that "Howard D. Doyle" was just an actor from one of Donaly's [[soap opera]]s. Marylin has tricked him, and now ''his'' considerable wealth is at risk. Miles' boss demands that something be done to save the firm's reputation, and suggests the hitman "Wheezy Joe" ([[Irwin Keyes]]). Miles hires him to kill Marylin.  Miles then learns that Marylin's ex-husband Rex has died without changing his will, leaving her his entire fortune. Since she is now the wealthier of the two parties, his assets are no longer at risk. A repentant Miles rushes to save Marylin from Wheezy Joe, but Marilyn has already offered to pay him double to kill Miles instead. There is a struggle; in the confusion Wheezy Joe mistakes his gun for his [[asthma]] inhaler, and kills himself.  Later, Miles, Marylin and their lawyers meet to negotiate a divorce. Miles pleads for a second chance and retroactively signs a Massey prenup. Realizing her own feelings for him, she tears it up, and they kiss. Marylin then tells Miles that to get Donaly's help for supplying Doyle, she gave him an idea for a hit TV show, restoring his fortunes in the process: ''America's Funniest Divorce Videos'', with Gus Petch as the host.

Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her the chance to get revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers to go out on a date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Steve is away on his supposed date, using three heavily modified [[Mini Cooper]]s to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and as the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan. Stella ends up having to meet Steve after all and inadvertently gives away her identity to Steve by using similar phrases her father used, but the team arrives to help protect her.

Napster overhears of this, and Charlie and his gang make a new plan to steal the gold en route to the airport by hijacking the city's traffic control system to force the armored car to a planned spot where they will execute the heist.  On the day of transport, they are surprised when three armored trucks leave Steve's mansion, but Napster is able to determine which one carries the bullion, and manipulates the traffic accordingly. Knowing that Steve is monitoring the transport by helicopter, they get the car to the target spot and then create a diversion as they detonate explosives to drop the part of the road with the car into the old subway tunnels below. After opening the truck, they find a different safe to the one that held the gold before. Although she struggles initially, Stella cracks the safe, and they load up the Coopers with the gold. They race from the subway to the [[Los Angeles River]] and through the city, pursued by Steve's henchmen on motorcycles, with Napster helping to create a [[green wave]] to evade traffic. Steve himself eventually leaves his helicopter and steals a truck to follow them to [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]].  At Union Station, the cars are loaded onto a train car with the help of Wrench. Steve arrives shortly thereafter and after bribing Wrench, is surprised to find Charlie and the others waiting for him. Steve brandishes a gun and demands his gold back, but Mashkov arrives; Charlie explains that he has offered Mashkov part of the gold and Steve in exchange for helping with security protection. Steve is punched in the face by Stella before being taken away by Mashkov, who reveals he will be tortured and killed. The group boards the train as it departs to New Orleans, and celebrate in John's honor. The epilogue shows them all having used their share of the gold for their own desired purposes; Handsome Rob purchases an [[Aston Martin Vanquish]], Left Ear buys a mansion in southern Spain, while Napster buys a powerful stereo capable of blowing a woman's clothes off.

English again encounters Lorna in a sushi restaurant as he recognized her motorcycle. During their meeting English is suspicious of her since he has seen her at two of their crime scenes and her records cannot be found on any government computer. English and Bough decide to break into Sauvage's headquarters via parachutes, but English lands on a visually identical tower, which turns out to be the City Hospital, by mistake.  Going to the correct building, the two learn Sauvage, who is a descendant of [[Charles Edward Stewart]], plans on making himself king, using an impostor to impersonate the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Lorna arrives, revealed to be an [[Interpol]] agent tracking Sauvage.

Bough rescues the two and they race to stop Sauvage's coronation.  English crashes the coronation and discovers the Archbishop is the genuine article. Undeterred, English orders Bough to play the DVD, only to find it is camera footage of himself dancing in his bathroom in his underclothes to "[[Does Your Mother Know]]" by [[ABBA]], Sauvage having bugged English's flat beforehand. English sneaks away but swings in on a wire to steal [[St. Edward’s Crown]] from Sauvage. Sauvage angrily shoots at English with a pistol, causing him to drop the crown.   Moments before Sauvage is crowned king, English drops from the wire after being shot, lands on the throne, and is crowned instead. Because of the crowning laws, English is now technically the King of England. In his singular act as king, English has Sauvage arrested and restores the Queen to the throne, simply requesting a [[knighthood]] as a reward.

Retired life is not easy for the ageing judge. The younger generation is bolder and quicker than he was in his time. He is invited as the guest of honour at many functions. But he finds that his stump speech about the venerable and time-tested legal profession falls flat. The youngsters wish to know when the law will relax its grip on their issues (principally around love, romance and sex). The judge admits that love makes the world go round and urges the youngsters to enjoy their youth but to do so responsibly. The judge also agrees (after some initial reluctance) to a suggestion from his family and visits Joggers Park to get some exercise. He finds that the Park moves at the pace of its younger regulars, much too quickly for him. He wonders if he will ever catch up.  Around this time he meets Jenny Suratwala at Joggers Park. Jenny is a young and vivacious freelance model and event planner. One of his speeches had made an impression on her young mind, and she wishes to learn more about him. They become friends. As their friendship deepens, they discover a new world in each other. Jenny learns from the judge's vast experiences, and the judge uses her perspectives to enter and appreciate the younger generation. Jenny brings an element of need. She is faced with a legal problem around the ownership of her late father's apartment, and the judge helps her fight and win her case.  The friendship deepens. The judge is taken by her exhilarating views and wishes to see more of her. She, too, pines for him when they are apart. Around this time, some of Jenny's younger male colleagues are perturbed by this relationship. It thwarts them from pursuing Jenny, and it is not socially acceptable because of the conspicuous age difference. They resolve to find a way to end it, and settle on stalking the couple and taking pictures of their intimate moments. (The film is not clear about any sexual activity, but the pictures are sufficient to destroy the judge's reputation and marriage.) On one occasion, Jenny discovers them taking pictures, and she angrily berates them and destroys some of the pictures. Jenny finally admits she is in love with the judge.  Meanwhile, the judge is faced with a family problem of his own. His son has been caught having an affair. His daughter exposes the incident and asks the judge, the vanguard of honour, to deliver judgement. The judge strongly reprimands his son and orders him to end the affair and seek forgiveness from his family. The family honour comes first.  Jenny has an upcoming birthday. One of her friends is planning the party. She invites the judge to attend the party and openly profess his love for her. If he truly meant his speeches, then he must act accordingly and express his feelings without fear or remorse.  On the day of the party, a strange man shows up at the judge's house. He is Tariq Ahmed, the editor and publisher of a local tabloid. Jenny's jealous colleagues brought the photos to his tabloid, and Tariq intercepted them just in time to avoid publication. It turns out that Tariq owes a debt of gratitude to the judge for having helped him with a difficult case several years ago. He turns the photos over to the judge's daughter. The daughter confronts the judge. This incident also involves the family honour. The judge is compelled to end his relationship with Jenny.  Several years later, the judge runs into Jenny at the airport. Jenny is now married and has a child. They greet each other warmly and Jenny introduces him (her fourth boyfriend, the one she loved very much) to her husband. They fondly remember their previous association as the film ends.

 The film opens with Tom and Sarah in the airport, then flashes back from the moment they met up to the present. Working-class Tom Leezak and upper-class Sarah McNerney meet up when Tom accidentally hits Sarah with a football. A few months later, despite opposition from Sarah's rich family, they get married. They have kept a secret from each other: Tom doesn't tell Sarah that he accidentally killed her dog and Sarah doesn't tell Tom that she slept with Peter Prentiss, a childhood friend and her family's friend, after she and Tom started dating.  Flying to Europe for their honeymoon, they attempt to consummate their marriage by joining the [[mile high club]], but fail rather publicly. They arrive at their classy hotel at the foot of the Alps to find that Peter has sent them a bottle of cognac "with love", while Tom's friend Kyle has sent them a ''Thunderstick A-200'' [[sex toy]]. Tom tries to force the toy's American plug into the European outlet and he shuts down the entire village's electricity. The newlyweds leave the hotel after Tom has a heated argument with the hotel owner and pays a large bill to repair the power. While trying to find another hotel they crash their undersized car into a snowbank, stuck until daylight and once again unable to consummate their marriage.

The couple secure a nice Venetian hotel with the grudging financial help of Sarah's father. They go sightseeing, but Tom quickly gets bored and abandons Sarah so he can watch sports in a bar. Sarah runs into Peter, who is staying at their hotel on business.

Ju-on: The Grudge 2
 Like the rest of the ''Ju-on'' series, the film takes place over a period of time, and is told in a non-linear order as six overlapping vignettes. The overarching plot involves the [[haunted house]] of the deceased Saeki family, whose brutal murders caused by [[Kayako Saeki]]’s crush on another man led to the creation of a vengeful [[curse]]. Anyone who enters the house will eventually be consumed by the ghosts of the Saeki family. The vignettes are presented in the following order: Kyoko (京子), Tomoka (朋香), Megumi (恵), Keisuke (圭介), Chiharu (千春), and Kayako (伽椰子). The plot will be told chronologically.  Pregnant film actress Kyoko Harase and her fiancé Masashi Ishikura drive home after Kyoko starred in a [[paranormal television]] show. Their car crashes when the ghost of [[Toshio Saeki]] appears. Masashi falls into a coma and Kyoko has a miscarriage. Kyoko encounters Toshio, who touches her stomach before disappearing, and she tells her mother that he must have been the spirit of her lost child. Three months later, Kyoko is shocked when a doctor announces she is three months pregnant. Her mother also suddenly dies.  The cause of her pregnancy is revealed in the other vignettes. Kyoko joins the film crew to record an episode of the paranormal show at the Saeki house in [[Nerima]], [[Tokyo]]. The crew includes director Keisuke Okuni, ambitious host Tomoka Miura, and hair stylist Megumi Obayashi. The filming goes well aside from some technical glitches caused by Kayako. At their office, Keisuke falls asleep and fails to notice supernatural phenomena on the footage. In the dressing room, Megumi is suddenly pinned to the floor, and a flashback reveals she is mirroring a dying Kayako. Kayako then kills Megumi.  Tomoka hears disturbing noises in her apartment, namely something banging against the wall every night at 12:27am. Her boyfriend Noritaka Yamashita goes to Tomoka’s apartment on the night after filming. When Tomoka arrives home, she finds he has been hanged by a curtain of black hair and is being pushed against the wall by Toshio, creating the banging noise. Kayako hangs Tomoka too, who dies exactly at 12:27am. In the present, Masashi comes out of his coma, mute and confined to a wheelchair, and seems to react badly at Kyoko’s new pregnancy.  Keisuke drives Kyoko home but they spot Megumi disappearing into the latter’s house. Inside, Keisuke encounters Megumi’s ghost, who offers him Kayako's diary. Keisuke suspects Kyoko surviving the car crash was deliberate. Kyoko and Keisuke are haunted by Kayako and Megumi’s ghosts until Kyoko returns to the house. There, she encounters a teenage girl Chiharu trying to escape, before going into contractions when Kayako claims Chiharu. In her own vignette, Chiharu, who appeared in ''Ju-on: The Grudge'', keeps phasing in and out of the house at different times until she dies in the arms of her friend, claimed by the curse.  Keisuke arrives at the house, witnessing Chiharu inside, but only finds an unconscious Kyoko. She is rushed to hospital and gives birth, only for pandemonium to occur – Masashi is implied to throw himself off the roof, Toshio appears during the delivery, and the delivery team all die of fright. Keisuke enters the delivery room, only to witness Kayako crawl out of Kyoko’s body and kill him. Kyoko awakens and finds her newborn baby waiting for her, which she embraces.  A few years later, a young boy in Nerima encounters a worn-out Kyoko with her daughter, who resembles Kayako. Kyoko is pushed off the bridge by her malevolent daughter, who departs with Kayako's diary.

 This movie starts with Anbuselvan ([[Suriya]]) getting thrown out of a house and falling into a stream of water. A badly injured Anbuselvan ([[Suriya]]) is lying on the bank of a stream, thinking about his wife Maya and how he needs to rescue her. The story moves quickly from this opening scene to a flashback of Anbuselvan’s time as a young policeman.  Anbuselvan was an honest, daring IPS officer with the Chennai police as the Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) in the Crime Branch. As he has no relations in life, he lived with no fear. Anbuselvan and his friends, Shrikanth ([[Daniel Balaji]]), Arul (Vivek Anand) and Ilamaran (Rajan), have been recruited for part of a special unit of police officers who are battling organized crime in [[Chennai]]. Violent and laconic, Anbuselvan finds little patience for a personal life. The unit is ruthless in its confrontation with criminals, going as far as assassinating gang members; the unit is finally disbanded by human rights authorities; Anbuselvan is posted to Control Room Duties.  One day a school teacher named Maya ([[Jyothika]]) rebuffs Anbuselvan's routine questions regarding safety, not knowing that he is a police officer. He meets her again when she and her friend are questioned for driving without a license. However, Anbuselvan lets them off with a warning. When one of Maya’s students has a problem with local kids, she asks Anbuselvan for help. Anbuselvan resolves this problem, a mutual respect grows between them and they begin seeing one another. When Maya gets into a road accident, Anbuselvan helps her to recover and they fall in love. Shrikanth and his wife, Swathi ([[Devadarshini]]), become good friends with Maya.  In response to rising levels of crime in the city, when the son of an influential movie producer is kidnapped and killed, the special unit is reassembled by commissioner with all four back in the crime branch. The unit tracks down and kills the head of the gang that was responsible. The brother of the gang leader, Pandiya (played by [[Jeevan (Tamil actor)|Jeevan]]), returns from [[Mumbai]] and takes over the gang, promising revenge over his brother’s death. Pandiya and his gang members target the families of the men in the special unit, but the police close in and a badly injured Pandiya barely escapes Anbuselvan.  Maya and Anbuselvan get married and leave for [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]]. But the next day, Pandiya and his thugs enter the cottage the honeymoon couple are staying in and attack Anbuselvan, leaving him for dead, and kidnapping Maya. This brings the viewer back to the opening scene of the movie, in which Anbuselvan is battling for life, but thinking only about rescuing Maya.  Shrikanth and Arul arrive at the cottage, discover Anbuselvan and take him to the Pondicherry Government Hospital. Shrikanth reveals that his wife Swathi was kidnapped earlier and confesses that it was he who gave away Anbuselvan’s location to Pandiya, for the safe return of Swathi. Shrikanth feels extreme remorse over what has happened. Whilst in the hospital, they receive a message from Pandiya to meet him at a particular location. When they go there, they find a package containing the severed head of Swathi. Shrikanth is distraught at seeing his wife's head and in an agony of grief and guilt at being responsible, he commits suicide by shooting himself. Anbuselvan tracks down Pandiya before he can escape from Tamil Nadu and fights with the gang. Pandiya stabs Maya to distract her husband and she dies in Anbuselvan’s arms. An enraged Anbuselvan tracks down Pandiya and, in a gripping encounter, brutally finishes him off.  An epilogue shows that Anbuselvan, after the death of Maya, continued his job as an IPS officer some weeks later. An alternative ending was shot and placed in the DVD version with a running commentary by Gautham Menon, in which Maya comes alive and he explains why this ending was not used in the version for cinema release.

Kaena: The Prophecy
 The film begins with an alien ship crash landing on a desert planet. The alien survivors, known as Vecarians, are quickly killed by the planet's predatory native inhabitants, the Selenites. The ship's core, Vecanoi, survives, and from it sprouts Axis, a massive tree reaching up into space.  600 years later, a race of human-like tree-dwellers have evolved living in the branches of Axis. One of them, a young girl named Kaena (voiced by [[Kirsten Dunst]]), is an adventurous daydreamer who longs to explore the world beyond the confines of her village. Kaena's inquisitiveness is opposed as heresy by the village elder, who commands his people to stay productive and toil for the villager's gods (who are, unbeknownst to them, the Selenites living in the planet below).

Kamen Rider 555: Paradise Lost
 In an alternate timeline, Smart Brain has accomplished its goal of world domination — with 90% of Earth's population being Orphnochs while the human race had diminished to near-extinction. Takumi Inui, the user of the Faiz Gear, was regarded as mankind's savior until he was presumed killed during an attack by Smart Brain's Riotroopers. Since then, his friend Mari Sonoda has formed a human resistance group that have staged attacks on Smart Brain's headquarters in an attempt to steal the top-secret "Emperor Belts", but to no avail. The Orphnochs Yuji Kiba, Naoya Kaido and Yuka Osada wish to see both Orphnochs and humans co-exist in peace, but they are not taken kindly by the humans while Smart Brain chief Kyoji Murakami (who is now reduced to a head in a water tank) reminds them that humans no longer have a place on Earth. Murakami then discloses the existence of the Emperor Belts by introducing the Orphnoch Leo, who changes into the powerful [[#Kamen Rider Psyga|Kamen Rider Psyga]].  Meanwhile, in a human refugee camp known as "Paradise", Takumi has been living a different life as a cobbler named Takeshi and shares a home with a girl named Mina. When Yuji, Naoya and Yuka approach the human resistance and notify them of Psyga's power, Paradise is suddenly invaded by Riotroopers. During the attack, Masato Kusaka battles Psyga as Kamen Rider Kaixa, but is quickly defeated and killed. Psyga attempts to take the Kaixa Belt, but he is warded off by the three Orphnochs allied with the humans. That night, Takeshi and Mari meet at a masquerade ball, but when Riotroopers ambush the party, Takeshi regains his memories as Takumi and once again becomes Kamen Rider Faiz - who is reunited with Auto Vajin while dispatching the attackers. Takumi, however, is not pleased that Mari had spread rumors of him being mankind's savior while he was away. Furthermore, members of the human resistance suspect he is an Orphnoch himself due to his ability to become Faiz. Mina reveals to Takumi that years ago, her father found him badly wounded from the previous Riotrooper attack and implanted false memories in him. Shortly after giving Takumi back his Faiz Blaster, Mina is fatally shot by resistance member Mizuhara - who steals the Faiz Belt. Yuji kills Mizuhara in self-defense and recovers the Faiz belt before handing it back to Takumi, but the resistance exile Yuji, Naoya and Yuka from the group until they prove themselves they can steal the Emperor Belts.  The next day, the three Orphnochs enter Smart Brain headquarters to fulfill their mission — only for Murakami to unleash the gargantuan Elasmotherium Orphenoch on them. Yuka is gored to death and Naoya is eaten alive by the large beast while Smart Lady tricks Yuji into thinking that Mari sold them out. Meanwhile, Smart Brain stages another attack on Paradise. Using a special serum devised by Professor Nomura, Keitaro Kikuchi manages to change into Kaixa and save Mari from an Orphnoch, but the Kaixa belt quickly dissolves into dust as a side-effect. In the ensuing chaos, Psyga kidnaps Mari; this causes dissension among the ranks of the resistance while Takumi races to Tokyo to rescue Mari. At Smart Brain Super Arena, Mari is to be fed to the Elasmotherium Orphnoch in front of millions watching the live execution, but Takumi interrupts the event, changing into Faiz and battling the behemoth. Auto Vajin is destroyed during the fight and Faiz is further outnumbered when Psyga interferes. As the Elasmotherium Orphnoch is caged to prevent it from destroying the stadium, Faiz slices Psyga in half with the Faiz Edge. Yuji suddenly appears in the arena, wearing the second Emperor Belt and changing into [[#Kamen Rider Orga|Kamen Rider Orga]]. Orga forces Takumi out of his Kamen Rider form but witnesses him transform into the Wolf Orphnoch, to everyone's surprise. Yuji is forced to change into Horse Orphnoch to battle Takumi before both combatants change back into their Kamen Rider modes while Mari is captured again to be fed to the Elasmotherium Orphnoch. Faiz changes into Blaster Form to defeat Orga. When Mari is about to be eaten, Orga sacrifices himself to save her while Faiz uses his Faiz Blaster to destroy the monster. A dying Yuji makes Takumi promise to fulfill his dream of peace between the humans and Orphnochs, while Smart Lady has Murakami's head crushed under executive orders. As the crowd stares at Takumi and Mari in silence, the pair walk out of the arena with Takumi telling Mari they will go anywhere until they find a place to live.

See </ref> a village in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab province]] of Pakistan, Ayesha (a middle-aged widow) lives with her son Saleem, a teenager in love with schoolgirl Zubeida. Ayesha supports herself and Saleem with her late husband's pension and by giving lessons in the [[Qur'an]] to village girls. She refuses to go to the village well, and her neighbor's daughters draw water for her. Villagers like Amin, the postman, are troubled by the recent hanging of former prime minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] by [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], the new military ruler who has promised to enforce [[Islamic law]] and encourages Islamic missionary and political groups. Two Islamic activists come to the village and, supported by the village [[choudhury]], spread their message of Islamic zealotry and gain recruits to fight the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. The older men in the village are disdainful of their intolerance and puritanism, cynical about Zia's postponement of elections and angry when the activists accuse them of being traitors. The activists gain a following amongst the village youth, including Saleem. They cajole and intimidate Saleem into attending a political meeting in [[Rawalpindi]], where the speakers exhort the audience to commit themselves to [[jihad]] for the creation of an Islamic Pakistani state. Attracted by their zeal and call to serve Islam and Pakistan, Saleem (who wants to be more than a village farmer) breaks up with Zubeida and becomes estranged from his mother. Ayesha unsuccessfully tries to discourage him from following the Islamists. Saleem helps build a wall around the girls' school to "protect" them and enforces the closing of village shops during [[Salah|namaaz]] in line with [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamisation]], and Ayesha and Zubeida are alarmed by his transformation.  After an agreement between the Indian and Pakistani governments, a group of [[Sikh]] pilgrims from India, arrives in Pakistan to visit Sikh shrines. They come to Charkhi, the village they were forced to flee when [[Partition of India|Pakistan became independent]]. A pilgrim wants to look for his sister, who he believes survived the violence. The visitors have a mixed reception: a warm welcome from the village barber and hostility from the growing number of young Muslim zealots. Saleem is embarrassed that his mother sent food to the pilgrims and teaches the village girls that non-Muslims can go to heaven. The pilgrim asks some villagers, including Amin, if they knew if a Sikh woman survived the riots. They say they do not know, but Amin later visits the pilgrim's hut and tells him to look for the woman who never goes to the well. Following the girls who bring water to her house, the pilgrim finds Ayesha. When he asks her if she knows a Sikh woman who survived the riots, she anxiously tells him to leave. Saleem sees the pilgrim talking to his mother, and hears him call her "Veero" and tell her that her father wanted to see her before he died. Saleem is shocked to learn that Ayesha was Veero, a Sikh; in a flashback, she was amongst a group of village Sikh women lined up to jump into the village well rather than be raped by a Muslim mob in 1947. The Sikh men (including her father) want her to jump, but Veero runs away and is later caught, raped and imprisoned. Her rapist, remorseful, offers to marry her and she begins life as a Muslim.  Saleem reports this to his friends, who demand that Ayesha make a public declaration of her Islamic faith; she refuses and is shunned by the villagers, including her best friends. For the first time in over thirty years, she must fetch her own water. Ayesha meets her Sikh brother at the well but refuses to accompany him, condemning her father for encouraging her to commit suicide and asking how he would feel knowing that she was living as a Muslim. Her isolation increases, with only Zubeida keeping in touch with her. Realizing that she cannot escape her past, Ayesha jumps into the well. Saleem buries her, gathers her papers and belongings and throws them into the river.  In 2002 in Rawalpindi, Zubeida remembers Ayesha. In the street she sees a bearded Saleem, secretary-general of an Islamist organisation, answering questions about the compatibility of Islamic law with democracy.

When Sean goes to collect his pay, however, he is double-crossed and when he insists that they pay him, he is kidnapped and taken to Ray's secluded farm.

When torture fails to make him disclose the whereabouts of the file, Sean is then brutally beaten about the head with golf clubs many times by Ray and his henchmen daily for weeks, in an effort to destroy his memory.

But after a few weeks, Susan finds his file describing the murder and, enraged, physically attacks him. Defending himself, Sean accidentally kills her.

After roughing Sean up to discourage him from pursuing his quest for payment, he disparagingly remarks that he's found which animal resembles Sean: an ant.

Kohtalon kirja
  The movie is divided into five distinct episodes, each representing a different [[genre]] and having their own subplot.  Opening narration explains how the Book of Fate came to be. It is a book that is somehow able to change reality. Another civilization beyond the stars got it, and made a pen to control the future - by writing to the book, things could change. This led to a war, but the book vanished. It later reappeared on Earth in order to give another chance to a chosen soul.  The movie starts with a horror episode in Transylvania, where brothers, one of whom is a priest, are looking for a cross that can cure their sister who has been bitten by a [[vampire]]. As they find the cross, the priest also finds an ancient, strange book. Then they are suddenly assaulted by vampires. Just as everything seems to be lost and the vampire is about to defeat him, the book gives the priest another chance, and the scene changes.  The next scene starts with a gunfight duel in a typical [[Western (genre)|Western]] setting. A lonesome bounty hunter - who quite resembles in appearance the priest - defeats a crook and finds the book again. He goes to a town to collect the money, and ends up in a gunfight where he's unable to save an innocent bystander who gets caught in crossfire. Three more crooks arrive to the town to pressure the sheriff to release their friend from the prison. The bounty hunter ends up in a massive gunfight, and it appears that he's getting killed, but once again, the book intervenes.  The next appearance of the book - and a soldier who again resembles the priest - is in the [[Winter War]] - [[Battle of Kollaa]], Christmas Day 1939, to be specific. The soldier tries to sneak past a Soviet post, but gets pinned down in an enemy fire. The book intervenes just as a hand grenade is thrown at him.  The next scene opens in modern-day [[Tampere]], in a typical [[action movie]] setting. A [[mad scientist|mad professor]] has developed a virus that kills everyone once released. The special agents, led by another familiar figure, steal it and its vaccine, but end up roughed up and detained in a distant manor where one of the mad professor's underlings is studying the Book of Fate. After a heroic escape attempt, and accidentally shooting his friend who was on the line of fire with an enemy, he gets stuck in [[Särkänniemi]] where the mad professor is about to release the virus.  The next scene, set on a space freighter, starts in virtual reality; a [[cyborg]], again resembling the priest of the past, is playing a video game. This time, however, the priest's spirit is able to appear in the VR projection, and tries to warn the cyborg that the book can be used to prevent the deaths of innocent people - as has happened before. The cyborg's job is to take the book to a group of aliens and he spends good time studying it as he prepares for the journey. As he goes in cryosleep, an alien lady appears in the ship, and the priest's spirit awakens the cyborg, and he is able to stop the alien lady from defacing the book. A representative of the aliens whom the book is being delivered to calls, and tells how dangerous this lady is, and the cyborg is to kill her by depressurizing the ship - sacrificing himself in the process to save millions of lives. The priest's spirit notes too late that, as the cyborg is about to die, he has made the wrong choice again. The alien representative who contacted them earlier were the true antagonists, and the book, and the pen, are about to fall in his hands. The cyborg is, however, able to write a change of reality to the book at the very last moment.  The story then unravels itself: The cyborg reunites with his long-dead wife who lives again, the special agent stops the mad professor, the soldier saves the day, the gunfight is won, and the priest is able to destroy the vampire and save his sister.

He later lectures his computer teacher for underestimating and insulting him and to understand the responsibilities of being a teacher. As a result, Rohit finds himself accepted by most of his peers and other students at the school.

Nisha and Rohit spend more time together, and Nisha begins to see Rohit in a romantic light. Rohit later proposes to her and she accepts. Jadoo's presence is kept a secret from everyone except Rohit, Nisha, Rohit's friends and Rohit's mother.  Raj and his friends later corner Rohit's friends on their supernatural performance at the basketball game. Rohit's friends are forced to flee and Jadoo accidentally falls from their grip. Inspector Sukhwani, ([[Johnny Lever]]) sees Jadoo in his bag and informs the other policemen about him. The policemen capture the bag, although Rohit arrives in time to rescue Jadoo, leaving the police behind. He is later confronted by Raj and his buddies. Rohit, now infuriated by the bullies, easily takes down Raj and his buddies but not before the police catch up to him. It is then revealed that Jadoo was not in the bag and had escaped when Sukhwani was busy calling the Police.  However, the policemen are suspicious of Rohit and confront him in his house. They take Jadoo and knock Rohit out. When he regains consciousness, Rohit uses his superhuman speed to catch up to the police cars and arrives just in time to save Jadoo from being taken to America by aeroplane. The spaceship, which he had summoned with his father's computer beforehand, arrives back and Rohit bids farewell to Jadoo. As Jadoo leaves, Rohit loses the physical and mental powers bestowed upon him and reverts to his childish, disabled self, which saves him from prosecution by the [[Indian government]]. After everything dies down, Raj and his buddies return to harass Rohit, causing the latter to kick Raj's ball into the bully's face with astounding force as Jadoo returns Rohit's powers permanently. Rohit and Nisha thank Jadoo and live a peaceful life thereafter.

Kontroll
 Bulcsú ([[Sándor Csányi (actor)|Sándor Csányi]]) is a [[ticket inspector]] on the [[Budapest Metro]]; he spends his nights sleeping on the train platforms, and hasn't left the underground ever since he started working there. His ragtag team of inspectors - consisting of the veteran Professzor ([[Zoltán Mucsi]]), the disheveled Lecsó ([[Sándor Badár]]), neurotic [[narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] Muki ([[Csaba Pindroch]]) and dimwitted greenhorn Tibi ([[Zsolt Nagy (actor)|Zsolt Nagy]]) - is routinely disrespected and assaulted by the commuters, who continue to evade paying fines in a variety of ways.  One of Bulcsú's company rivals, model employee Gonzó ([[Balázs Mihályfi]]) challenges him to a "rail run": after the last metro leaves a station, the two get on the tracks and try to make it to the next station on foot before the midnight maintenance carriage runs them over. Bulcsú wins the contest, barely saving Gonzó who wets himself as a result of the run. During a routine inspection, he is enamored by a girl dressed in a bear suit called Zsófi ([[Eszter Balla]]), the daughter of one of the veteran metro drivers, Béla ([[Lajos Kovács (actor)|Lajos Kovács]]). In another occasion, Bulcsú unsuccessfully attempts to talk to his colleague Laci ([[László Nádasi]]) after Laci gets into an altercation with a passenger and takes him hostage; Laci exclaims he can't take it anymore and slits the passenger's throat.  After chasing a repeat offending prankster called Bootsie (Gyalogkakukk, lit ''roadrunner'' in the Hungarian original; [[Bence Mátyássy]]), Bulcsú witnesses him being pushed on the tracks by a hooded figure, dressed in exactly the same attire as him; another incident in a long line of what people thought were apparent suicides. Because of his recurring nightmare of this figure, Bulcsú fails to apprehend the murderer, and when he's brought to questioning, he refuses to disclose details of the incident to the lead executive ([[György Cserhalmi]]) of the company. When the executive threatens to disclose the video footage of the incident, which only shows Bulcsú, he resigns his job. Muki later insinuates him being the murderer, citing his continual nightly absence and accusing him of having the same mental issues as Laci did; an infuriated Bulcsú almost pushes him on the tracks as well.  During an underground [[costume party]], Bulcsú spots and follows the hooded figure and they get into an altercation, after which they start rail running similarly to the contest with Gonzó earlier. Bulcsú manages to outrun the hooded figure and escape the train. The hooded figure never emerges from the tracks. Bulcsú then meets Zsófi, who is now dressed as a butterfly, and the two finally emerge back to the surface.  
Kopps
 The film concerns the police force of a small fictional Swedish village, Högboträsk. The village is so peaceful that [[crime]] has become nonexistent. The police spend their shifts drinking coffee, eating hot dogs and chasing down runaway cows. This is all well and good for the village's own police, but the police management board wants to discontinue the local police force for lack of crime. This would mean the loss of income for the policemen, so they begin to stage crimes in order to preserve their jobs. This includes burning down the local hotdog stand, hiring a drunk to steal a packet of sausages, thrashing a local car, faking a shootout and staging a kidnapping using their friends as actors.  
The Kite (film)
 The Kite is set in a village called [[Deir Mimas]] over the border of the pre-occupied territories in southern Lebanon (occupied by [[Israel]]). The 16-year-old Lebanese girl Lamia ([[Flavia Bechara]]) lives with her family in the village. Her family had promised to marry her off to her cousin Samy (Edmond Haddad), who lives on the Israel side. Lamia's mother, Amira (Randa Asmar) was dejected and unwilling to send her daughter away because that meant that Lamia could never come back because of the tense political situation at the border.  Lamia, too, is completely reluctant to agree to the marriage because she has never seen him nor does she love him. She is simply a naïve young teenager who has no idea about marriage. Similarly, Samy was not much interested in marrying his cousin either; however, he agreed to the marriage because he thought it would help Lamia escape her village.  To conduct the wedding, since there is a no-man's land between the Lebanon side and Israel side, they communicate with each other through megaphones and can only see each other through binoculars. Before the marriage, Lamia had to get a pass from the authorities to cross the border. The day of the wedding, the entire village gathers at the border gates to witness Lamia being sent across the border. On the Israeli side, people wave a white flag as a signal to start. Lamia hugs her family and starts her long walk towards the Israeli border in her majestic wedding gown and a lone bouquet. She keeps looking back, knowing that she may never return.  Meanwhile, the movie reveals that an Israeli soldier, Youssef (Maher Bsaibes), stationed at the border is in love with Lamia. After Lamia comes to live in Samy's house, she barely eats or sleeps or talks; this goes on for 20 days. Later, during an argument with her husband, Lamia tells him that she loves someone else, who turns out to be Youssef. Samy's family gets frustrated with Lamia and takes her to the border so that she can talk to her mother. Lamia is given binoculars, but instead of looking at her mother, she turns to look at Youssef and exchanges smiles with him. Both families fume at this and her binoculars are taken away.  Because of her continuous unpleasant behavior, Lamia becomes unwanted in Samy's house and she is forced to go back. Samy warns Lamia that no one else would want her anymore if he divorces her and she would be alone forever. Lamia faces a great dilemma because she does not want to be with her husband but she does not want to go back either (because of Youssef).  Unfortunately, Lamia returns to Deir Mimas, to her and the soldier's utter disappointment. She becomes a subject of insult in her home village, which is seen when a shop-owner does not accept money from her, calling it "money of dishonor".  The ending of the movie has been purposely left vague and open to interpretation. It appears like a dream or surreal scene where Lamia magically crosses the fence of the border and finally gets to be with Youssef.

 The plot follows Art Chew's (a pun of the sound one makes when [[sneeze|sneezing]]) quest to retrieve the ancient peach. The movie starts with Art Chew traveling to America, as well as showing Art's training at the Shur-li [[Temple (Chinese)|temple]] (a play on words with the child actor [[Shirley Temple]]), showing many kung-fu clichés such as grabbing the pebble from the masters hand (which Art succeeds without effort), fighting on [[tree]]s (in this case small potted palms) and "listing" for elements ([[Earth, Wind & Fire]] play a funky tune). After the montage is shown, Art meets up with his cousin Wayman (a parody on the way Chinese pronounce ''r'' as ''w''), a Chinese adult who tries to act American so he isn't embarrassed by stereotypes, and foster cousin Roy Lee, an [[African American]] who sincerely believes he is a reincarnation of [[Bruce Lee]].   Not long after Art arrives, Helen Hu, an MSG ([[Monosodium glutamate]]) dealing (portrayed like a [[cocaine]] dealer) restaurant owner, forces Art's stereotypical uncle into buying more MSG. Art intervenes and tries to fight Helen's muscle, the overweight and strong One Ton (perhaps a play on the Chinese dish [[wonton]] soup), the wise cracking "brains" of the outfit Lo Fat and the Kung-Fu fighter Non Fat. After blocking One Ton's attack, Art reels to attack showing a smiley face on his arm which Lo Fat points out as a symbol of a Shur-li monk and they run away. Art talks to his uncle and asks where the Ancient peach is and is told that it is in Helen Hu's restaurant (a brief humorous spectacle emerges in the conversation as Art and the others mix the name Hu with the article "who") that Art's uncle sold to her a few years ago. Art, Wayman and Roy Lee go to Helen's restaurant and are taken to her by a waiter that is badly [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] because "This is how all Hong Kong actors talk". Helen claims to know nothing about the peach and gets One Ton to escort Art and his friends to leave. On the way out, Roy Lee tries to kick Non Fat but misses and breaks a hole in the wall. After Art and crew are thrown out Lo Fat notices a glowing coming out of the hole in the wall and looks in and finds the ancient peach. Events lead to the peach being swapped around a couple of times and the appearance of a romantic interest, Sue Shi (sushi), who is later revealed to be an agent of the Shur-li temple.  
Laaj
 The story is set in old India under British rule, in the 1920s. The warring Pathans of the North West region of India had become more aggressive towards the ruling Britain. The Fakir of Ippy was already a living legend before he started a war that was fought over the love of a couple that knew no bounds of religion, cast, color or language.  A wealthy Hindu girl named Ram Kori, using the alias Chand Bibi, runs away from her home with a Pathan boy Noor Ali Khan and meets a mystic Muslim leader called the 'Fakir of Ippy'. The Fakir marries Noor Ali Khan and Ram Kori after she accepts Islam and agrees to be renamed as Islam Bibi.  The influential and rich Hindus of the area go to the British Court run by an English Political Agent involved in both the executive and the judiciary. The agent is, in actuality, against the warring Pathans, and he intends to teach them a lesson. In the court, the political agent decides against the couple's case. Since Islam Bibi had become a Muslim, she was to be tried under Muslim Law, where a girl of fourteen years is adult and can choose her husband. However, according to the political agent's decision, since under the English Law a girl is considered minor till she reaches the age of eighteen, both her acceptance of Islam as well as her marriage are made void.  The Muslim lawyers representing Islam Bibi insisted that the court also decree that the girl will not be taken away from the city [[Bannu]], which was granted. However, Islam Bibi was secretly taken away to [[Hoshiarpur]] where the girl's parents lived. Noor Ali Khan, at the behest of the faqir, goes to Hoshiarpur. He exchanges hot words with Islam Bibi's family, resulting in his stabbing a man and then his arrest. He eventually broke out of the jail, picked up Islam Bibi and come back to [[Waziristan]] area.  The British, after a failed dialogue, attack the village. The Fakir, unhappy with the attack, wages a holy war against the English. Backed by German aid, he starts [[Guerilla warfare]] against the British.

Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life
 On [[Santorini]] island, [[Greece]], a strong earthquake uncovers the Luna Temple. The temple was built by [[Alexander the Great]] to house his most prized treasures. Among these treasures is a glowing orb with a pattern resembling a code etched into it. [[Lara Croft]] ([[Angelina Jolie]]) finds this orb; but crime lord Chen Lo ([[Simon Yam]]) attacks her group, kills her two companions and takes the orb. Lara escapes with a strange medallion.  [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] approaches Lara with information about [[Pandora's box]]. It is an object from ancient legends that supposedly contains a deadly [[Pandemic|plague]] (the companion to the origin of life itself). They need to get it before Jonathan Reiss ([[Ciarán Hinds]]) - a [[Nobel Prize]] winning scientist turned bio-terrorist - does. The box, hidden in the mysterious Cradle of Life, can only be found with a magical sphere that serves as a map. The same sphere was stolen by Chen Lo, who plans to sell the sphere to Reiss.  Lara agrees to help them, with the condition that they release her old flame Terry Sheridan ([[Gerard Butler]]), who is familiar with Chen Lo's criminal operation. Together, Terry and Lara infiltrate Chen Lo's lair, where he is smuggling the [[Terracotta Army|Terracotta Soldiers]]. Lara defeats him in a fight and learns the location of the orb.  Lara and Terry then meet up with Kosa ([[Djimon Hounsou]]), the former's longtime African friend. They question a local tribe about the Cradle of Life, wherein the chief states that the Cradle of Life is in a crater protected by the "Bigfoots". As they set out on an expedition, Reiss' men ambush them and kill the tribesmen. Outnumbered, Lara surrenders.  Using her companions as hostages, Reiss forces Lara to lead him to the Cradle of Life. At the crater, they encounter the Bigfoots, cryptids apes that appear in and out of wet patches on dead trees. The creatures kill most of Reiss' men. Lara manages to find the "key hole" and drops the Orb in it. The Bigfoots melt and the entrance to the Cradle of Life opens.  Lara and Reiss are drawn into the Cradle, a labyrinth made of a strange crystalline substance. Inside, they find a pool of highly corrosive black acid (linking back to one of the myths about Pandora's box), in which the box floats. Normal laws of physics seem not to apply, as Lara and Reiss are able to walk upside down along the ceiling of the cave. Terry arrives, frees the hostages and catches up to Lara.  Lara fights Reiss, and knocks him into the acid pool, which kills and dissolves him. Terry then announces the intention to take the box for himself. When he refuses to back down, Lara regretfully shoots him dead, replaces the box in the pool and leaves.  
Last Life in the Universe
 Kenji is a lonely [[librarian]] in the [[Japan Foundation]] in [[Bangkok]]. Living in an apartment full of [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|precise stacks of books]], his half-hearted attempts to kill himself are continually interrupted by the people around him. Kenji's most notable obstacle is his self-absorbed brother, Yukio, a ''[[yakuza]]'', or Japanese gangster. Yukio fled from Japan to escape the wrath of his employer, with whose daughter he had had sex.<ref>Last Life in the Universe, English Sub, 13:18</ref> Yukio's friend Takashi suggests that if it were his daughter, he would have the despoiler killed, but Kenji's brother laughs this warning off. Yukio frequents a club where he can enjoy the attention of a bunny-eared [[Hostess bar|hostess]], a local girl named Nid. Nid's sister, Noi, is furious at her sibling for having slept with her boyfriend, Jon.  One day in the library, Kenji spies on Nid, clad in a school girl's uniform. Soon after, he discovers that his brother has hidden a pistol inside a teddy bear. He is about to shoot himself when Yukio is slain by Takashi, who was apparently hired by Yukio's employer. (During the library scene where Kenji first encounters Nid, a hanging poster for the [[Takashi Miike]] film ''[[Ichi the Killer (film)|Ichi the Killer]]'' is clearly featured. Tadanobu Asano was also the star of that film.)  Takashi sees Kenji, who appears hopeful at his impending death, but suddenly Kenji shoots and kills the assassin. Not long after that, Kenji is about to jump off a bridge when Noi and Nid, driving past, have an argument. Noi throws Nid out of the car, then reconsiders. Nid, distracted by Kenji sitting on the railing of the bridge, is struck by another car and dies.  Kenji and Noi, both having lost a sibling, form a tentative friendship. The introspective Kenji asks the extroverted Noi if he can stay with her, unwilling to spend time with the two corpses in his apartment. Noi agrees, and invites the fussy Japanese man into her disastrously unkempt beachside home. As Kenji begins cleaning, Noi prepares to leave for Japan to further her career. Surreal elements creep into the film; Noi sees the house magically cleaning itself, while Kenji watches Noi transform into her temptress sister. The couple, in some ways polar opposites and in some ways mirror images, form a semi-romantic relationship. Meanwhile, the abusive and promiscuous ex-boyfriend Jon begins calling, angry that Noi thinks she can leave him. Three ''yakuza'' are also dispatched to find out what has happened to Takashi.  In the final segments, Kenji drives Noi to the airport, then decides he will join her. He returns to his apartment to gather his things and purposely knocks over a stack of books. While he is in the [[bathroom]], first Jon, then the ''yakuza'' arrive. Jon is slain, and Kenji apparently escapes out the window. The movie then cuts back and forth between two scenes: one, in which Kenji has been arrested for some unspecified crime, and another in which he is re-united with Noi in Japan. The relationship between or canonicity of these two scenes is not made clear by the movie - particularly whether the reuniting scene is imagined or not.  Throughout the movie, images of the furtive [[gecko]] who lives in Noi's house, as well as ''The Last [[Lizard]]'' are shown, Kenji's children's book about a [[reptile]] who wakes up to discover he is the final member of his species. The fictional lizard realizes that even being with his enemies, the other lizards who picked on him, was preferable to being alone.  
The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration
 Littlefoot has nightmares involving the "Great Circle", and when he mentions it to his grandparents, they reveal they are sharing the experience, with Grandpa lamenting that they need to go somewhere. Led only by their instinct, they leave the next day. Out of curiosity, Cera, Spike, Ducky, and Petrie follow them. During their trek, Littlefoot is almost killed by a ''[[Sarcosuchus]]'' in a swamp, but a ''[[Supersaurus]]'' named Sue saves him and joins him and his grandparents, as she is driven on by the same sense as them. The group is joined by dozens of other Longnecks feeling the same instincts. Meanwhile, Littlefoot's friends are attacked by the ''Sarcosuchus'' in the same swamp as before, but they manage to escape. They are also attacked by a gray sharptooth (''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'') afterwards, which they had slept next to after escaping the crocodile. They soon escape into a small cave, and meet Pat, an elderly ''[[Apatosaurus]]''.  Littlefoot's herd reaches a large crater where hundreds of Longnecks have gathered. There, he meets his father, Bron, for the first time. After been separated from his mate in an [[earthquake|earthshake]], he has become guardian to a young ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'', Shorty, who becomes jealous of Littlefoot taking all of his father's attention. Meanwhile, Pat shares to Littlefoot's friends that the Longnecks are being driven by a tradition involving a [[solar eclipse]], which was taken as a sign that the Sun will be sent crashing down into the Earth. Every solar eclipse, Longnecks from all around the world gather in one location to stretch their necks up and "catch" the Sun, so they can propel it back up into the sky. Soon after, Pat steps into a pool of magma, which scalds his leg (burned severely), but he is still able to move.  On the day of the eclipse, Littlefoot wakes up to see Shorty traveling over the crater walls and running away, out of spite for being ignored by Bron. He catches up to Shorty and convinces him to stay; the two reconcile and agree to see themselves as brothers. Moments later, as Littlefoot reunites with his friends, an orange-brown colored Sharptooth (another ''Tyrannosaurus'') attacks the group. Pat defends the children but is slowed down by his burned leg (which he received earlier in the film). Bron rushes to their aid and defends them from the Sharptooth, and is nearly killed, but Pat returns and saves him. Soon, they both manage to knock the sharptooth unconscious, only for it to be joined by a green Sharptooth as well as the gray one from the swamp earlier. Littlefoot's grandparents assist in the fight as well and defeat the green individual. Bron fights the orange-brown one again while Pat fights the same gray individual that Littlefoot's friends had encountered earlier in the film. As soon as the three Sharpteeth are defeated, the eclipse occurs, and the sudden darkness scares away the Sharpteeth towards the end.  Littlefoot, his grandparents, Bron, and Pat take their place among the other Longnecks, who have all gathered on top of the crater walls. They succeed in "catching" the Sun, and everyone rejoices as the eclipse ends. With their mission completed, the different Longneck herds depart on their separate ways. Sue departs with an ''Ultrasauros''. Littlefoot's friends ask Pat to come live with them in the Great Valley, which he accepts. Littlefoot is initially hesitant in leaving Bron, as he is the leader of a migratory herd, but he eventually realizes that he belongs in the Great Valley. Accepting this, Bron leaves with Shorty and his herd, promising to keep in touch with Littlefoot and visit him. Littlefoot returns to the Valley with his friends, grandparents, and Pat.

  A simple, love story between a [[Sikh]] girl ([[Saima Noor|Saima]]) and a [[Muslim]] boy [[Shamyl Khan]].  In August 1947 in what was the final cynical act of a collapsing empire, the British left old India divided. Arbitrary lines were drawn on the map of India, dividing not only the country but also provinces, in particular the old [[Punjab Province (British India)]]. The results of partition were catastrophic. All in the name of religion and nationalism,  people who had lived together in harmony for centuries committed mindless acts of violence against each other resulting in over one million deaths that included [[Sikhs]], [[Muslims]] and [[Hindus]]. An estimated 75,000 women were raped and over twelve million people were uprooted. Hindus and Sikhs migrated to [[India]] and Muslims to [[Pakistan]].

The Last Horror Movie
  The film follows Max Parry ([[Kevin Howarth]]), a disturbed wedding video cameraman, and his unnamed assistant ([[Mark Stevenson]]) as they perform several murders that they have videotaped. The two have used a video store [[VHS|tape]] in order to record the proceedings, breaking the fourth wall and insinuating that the copy of the film being watched is the only existing version of the tape. Throughout the film Max uses meta-references in order to show off his gruesome activities as a serial killer. The film raises questions surrounding visceral pleasure, this can be seen in one scene in particular during which the audience cannot see the victims (two at once) being murdered, Max Parry then asks the audience "I bet you wanted to see that, and if you didn't, why are you still watching?"   At the end of the film the audience is left to believe that since they are watching the only copy of the film, that they will potentially become one of Max's victims.

The Last Samurai
  Former [[US Army]] Captain Nathan Algren, a bitter alcoholic traumatized by the atrocities he committed during the [[American Indian Wars]], is approached by his former commanding officer Colonel Bagley to train the newly created [[Imperial Japanese Army]] for a forward-thinking Japanese businessman Omura, who intends to use the army to suppress [[Satsuma Rebellion|a samurai-headed rebellion]] against Japan's new Emperor. Despite his hatred of Bagley for his role in the Indian Wars, an impoverished Algren takes the job for the money, and is accompanied to Japan by his old friend, Sergeant Zebulon Gant. Upon arriving, Algren meets Simon Graham, a British translator knowledgeable about the Samurai.  Algren finds the Imperial soldiers are actually conscripted peasants that have no knowledge of firearms or battle. Early in their training, Algren is informed that the Samurai are attacking one of Omura's railroads; Omura sends the army there, despite Algren’s protests that they are not ready. The battle is a disaster; the conscripts are routed and Gant is killed. Algren fights to the last before he is surrounded; expecting to die, he is taken prisoner when Samurai leader Katsumoto decides to spare him. Algren is taken to Katsumoto's village to live among his family. While he is poorly treated at first, he eventually gains the Samurai's respect and actually becomes friends with Katsumoto. Algren overcomes his alcoholism and guilt, and learns the [[Japanese language]] and [[Japanese culture|culture]]. He develops sympathy for the Samurai, who are upset that the pace of spread of modern technology has eroded the traditions of their society. Algren and Taka, Katsumoto's sister and the widow of a Samurai Algren killed, develop an unspoken affection for each other.  One night, as the village is watching a [[kabuki]] play, a group of ninja infiltrate the village and attempt to assassinate Katsumoto. Algren warns Katsumoto, saving his life, and then helps defend the village with the Samurai. Katsumoto requests a meeting with [[Emperor Meiji]] and is given safe passage to Tokyo. He brings Algren, intending to release him. Upon arriving in Tokyo, Algren finds the Imperial Army is now a well-trained and fully equipped fighting force. Katsumoto, to his dismay, discovers that the young and inexperienced Emperor has essentially become a puppet of Omura. At a government meeting, Omura orders Katsumoto's arrest for [[Haitorei Edict|carrying a sword in public]] and asks him to commit [[seppuku]] to redeem his honor. Algren refuses Omura's offer to lead the new army to crush the rebels; Omura orders him killed as well by sending assassins to kill Algren, but Algren kills the assailants. Algren assists the Samurai in freeing Katsumoto from the Imperial Army; in the process, Katsumoto's son Nobutada is mortally wounded, and he sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape.  As the Imperial Army marches to crush the rebellion, a grieving Katsumoto contemplates seppuku, but Algren convinces him to fight until the end, and joins the Samurai in battle. Citing the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], the Samurai use the Imperial Army's overconfidence to lure their soldiers into a trap and deprive them of artillery support. The ensuing mêlée battle inflicts massive casualties on both sides and forces the Imperial soldiers to retreat. Knowing that Imperial reinforcements are coming and defeat is inevitable, Katsumoto orders a suicidal charge on horseback. During the charge, the Samurai break through Bagley's line; Algren kills Bagley, but they are quickly mowed down by [[gatling gun]]s. The Imperial captain, previously trained by Algren and horrified by the sight of the dying Samurai, orders all of the guns to cease fire, disregarding Omura's orders. A mortally wounded Katsumoto commits seppuku with Algren's help as the soldiers at the scene kneel down in respect for the fallen Samurai.  Days later, as trade negotiations conclude, Algren, though injured, arrives and interrupts the proceedings. He presents the Emperor with Katsumoto's sword and asks him to remember the traditions for which Katsumoto died. The Emperor realizes that while Japan should modernize and continue to interact with other countries, it cannot forget its own culture and history; therefore he rejects the trade offer and chooses to seize the Omura family assets for the benefit of his subjects. Algren's fate is shrouded in mystery; while various rumors about him circulate, Graham concludes that Algren had finally found peace in his life and returned to the village to reunite with Taka.  
Latter Days
 [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|Elder]] Aaron Davis, a young [[Mormon]] from [[Pocatello, Idaho]], is sent to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] with three other missionaries to spread the Mormon faith. They move into an apartment next to openly gay party boy Christian Markelli and his roommate Julie, an aspiring singer. Christian and Julie work as waiters at Lila's, a trendy restaurant owned by retired actress Lila Montagne.  Christian makes a bet with his co-workers that he can seduce one of the Mormons, and  soon realizes that Aaron, the most inexperienced missionary, is a [[Coming out#Closeted|closeted]] homosexual. Aaron and Christian become acquainted after several encounters in the apartment complex. When Christian accidentally cuts himself on a metal hose reel and faints, Aaron helps him indoors and cleans his wound. Christian attempts to seduce Aaron, but the hesitant Mormon becomes upset by Christian's remark that sex "doesn't have to mean anything." Aaron accuses him of being shallow and walks out. Worried that Aaron is correct, Christian joins Project Angel Food, delivering meals to people with [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].  Aaron's fellow missionary, Paul Ryder, has a cycling accident. Returning to his apartment, a distraught Aaron encounters Christian, who tries to comfort him with a hug. Both men are overwhelmed by their feelings and end up kissing, failing to notice the return of Aaron's roommates. Aaron is sent home in disgrace, leading Christian to confront Ryder, who is angry that Christian corrupted Aaron for no reason. Christian admits that he initially just wanted to win a bet, but says "it's not about that" anymore. Recognizing Christian's distress, Ryder tells him that Aaron's flight has a five-hour [[layover]] in [[Salt Lake City]].  Christian finds Aaron standing in the snow outside the airport terminal. Christian confesses his love, and despite his misgivings, Aaron admits his own feelings of love. With all flights canceled due to a snowstorm, Christian and Aaron spend an intimate night in a motel. When Christian awakes, he finds Aaron gone. Aaron's pocket watch, a family heirloom, has been left behind. Christian returns to Los Angeles. In Idaho, Aaron is [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] by the church elders, led by his own father, Farron, who is the [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)#Stake officers|stake president]]. Aaron is rejected by his father and scolded by his mother, who tells him that he needs to pray for forgiveness. When Aaron suggests that he might be gay, his mother slaps him. Overwhelmed by despair, Aaron attempts suicide. He is subsequently sent by his parents to a treatment facility to be [[Ex-gay movement|cured of his homosexuality]].  Christian is desperate to find Aaron and locates his home address and phone number. Aaron's mother informs him that "Thanks to you, my son took a razor to his wrists; thanks to you I have lost my son." Believing that Aaron is dead, Christian spends the next few days thinking continually about Aaron. Julie discovers an entry about Christian's feelings in his cellphone journal and uses it as the basis for her new song. Christian travels to the Davis home in Idaho, where he tearfully returns Aaron's watch to his mother. During an encounter with Julie, she hesitantly shows him her new video, which upsets Christian, realizing that part of the lyrics came from his personal journal without his consent. Julie tells Christian that she hoped something good would come from it.  In the treatment facility, Aaron hears a female voice singing and investigates. He discovers a music video playing on television, the song performed by Julie. The video prompts Aaron to return to Los Angeles in search of Christian. Upon arriving at Christian's apartment, Aaron is heartbroken when a stranger answers the door. Thinking that Christian has returned to his party boy ways and moved on, and having nowhere else to go, Aaron makes his way to Lila's restaurant, having befriended the owner while on missionary work after her life partner died. Christian, who happens to be working there, comes out and is overjoyed to see Aaron alive. They reconcile and later celebrate [[Thanksgiving]] with Christian's co-workers. Lila tells everyone that, no matter what, they will always have "a place at my table, and a place in my heart".

The League travel for Venice in Nemo's submarine, the ''[[Nautilus]]'', but it soon becomes clear there may be a mole on board: A camera's [[flash powder]] residue is found in the wheelhouse, and one of Jekyll's transformation formulas disappears. Suspicion falls on the missing Skinner.  The ''Nautilus'' arrives in Venice just as the bombs go off, causing the city to start collapsing in a [[domino effect]].

Sawyer is taken hostage by an invisible Reed; Quatermain shoots the latter, only for Moriarty to fatally stab him. Moriarty flees outside, but Sawyer successfully shoots him, and the formulas sink into the icy water. Quatermain then dies.  Quatermain is buried beside his son in Kenya. The surviving League members recall how a [[witch doctor]] had blessed Quatermain for saving his village, promising that Africa would never let him die.

Leeches!
 Members of a college swim team take [[anabolic steroids]] to enhance their performance. While on a daytrip to a local lake, a couple of the members pick up some [[leech]]es, which feed on the steroids in their blood. The leeches end up washed down a shower drain, where they grow to enormous size and return for more feedings.  Following the deaths of several members of the team and a college administrator, the few surviving team members and one of their girlfriends hatch a plan to kill off the monster leeches. They will draw them to the campus swimming pool by having one of the swimmers act as bait. Then they'll electrify the pool, electrocuting the leeches. Tragically, the team coach, who's been infected by a leech, attacks them, delaying the electrification just long enough to allow the leeches to kill one last swimmer. Finally the coach is subdued and the switch is thrown, frying the leeches.  As the film ends, a surviving swim team member, in true mad scientist fashion, is revealed to have had a hand in creating the leeches and is shown to have breeding stock left.

Elle hires a detective to find Bruiser's mother, only to discover that the owner of her dog's mother is C'est Magnifique, a [[cosmetics]] company that [[Animal testing|uses Bruiser's mother for "testing"]]. She finds out that her law firm represents the C'est Magnifique Corporation.  Elle decides to leave [[Boston]], where she and Bruiser have settled with her fiancé Emmett, and go to [[Washington, D.C.]], to work on Bruiser's Bill. Elle is upset that her dog's mother is in a make-up testing laboratory, and decides to take it upon herself to be the "voice for those who can't speak" and to outlaw animal testing.  While working for Congresswoman Victoria Rudd, Elle is met with skepticism and other barriers common to Washington politics. Rudd's member of staff, Timothy, sarcastically calls her "[[Capitol Hill|Capitol]] [[Barbie]]". (There has even been a Barbie doll based on Elle Woods.<ref></ref>) After a variety of ups and downs including a failed attempt to improve her work environment by having her co-workers write compliments about one another and place them in the "snap cup", Elle starts to lose her faith in Washington politics.  As the story moves along, Elle discovers that Bruiser is actually [[Homosexuality|gay]], after she is paged by "The Paws That Refreshes: A Doggy Day Spa". Bruiser has been affectionate with Leslie, a [[Rottweiller]] owned by Congressman Stan Marks, the Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]] which has jurisdiction over Bruiser's Bill. Elle also finds that Congresswoman Libby Hauser, the [[Ranking minority member|Ranking Member]] of the same committee, was a member of Elle's [[sorority]] Delta Nu. As a result, both Marks and Hauser warm to Elle and eventually come to support Bruiser's Bill.  Elle also discovers that Congresswoman Rudd has actually been working against her. Rudd has been doing so in an effort to satisfy the interests of a major campaign donor named "Bob" (who is [[Unseen character|never seen]], but with whom Rudd has several telephone conversations). However, Rudd is eventually blackmailed into supporting Elle's petition, because Rudd's Chief of Staff, Grace Rossiter, eavesdrops on a recorded conversation during which Rudd admits to Elle that she has been working against Bruiser's Bill in order to help Rudd's sponsors who want to continue with tests on animals. As Grace is appalled that Rudd lied to Elle and blamed it on her, Grace and Elle eventually reach a place of mutual respect, especially after Grace admits she came to Washington D.C. with an enthusiasm not unlike Elle's, but later lost that idealism when she discovered how dirty politics could really be.  With the help of her friends, Elle's [[discharge petition]] is successful, and Bruiser's Bill is brought to the floor of the House. Bruiser's mother and the rest of the dogs are released by C'est Magnifique Corporation. Elle and Emmett get married in a park in D.C., albeit not at [[Fenway Park]] as they had planned, but standing on the home plate which has been delivered to D.C. by the UPS Guy.  In the final scene, Emmett asks Elle whether they want to live in [[Beverly Hills]], Washington D.C., or Boston. As Elle has many legal and political job offers after the successful discharge hearing, she responds, "Oh, I think I know just the place", and winks as they drive by the [[White House]].

Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood
  The film opens with an animated prologue revealing the origins of leprechauns, stating that they were summoned by a king to protect his gold. After the death of the king the Leprechauns returned to their places of origin, all except one ([[Warwick Davis]]) who through the ages slowly became corrupted and obsessed with the gold he still guarded. In the present, Father Jacob ([[Willie C. Carpenter]]) finds the leprechaun's gold and intends to build a youth center. Jacob manages to banish Lubdan the Leprechaun, summoning demonic hands which drag him underground, but soon after dies of injuries inflicted by the leprechaun during the fight.  One year later, two friends Emily Woodrow ([[Tangi Miller]]) and Lisa Duncan (Sherrie Jackson), have their fortune told when the [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] Esmeralda ([[Donzaleigh Abernathy]]) who warns them that they will attain great wealth soon, but it must be denied as it will come at a great price and summon a terrible evil. While having a barbecue at the abandoned youth center construction site with Lisa, their stoner friend Jamie Davis ([[Page Kennedy]]) and her ex-boyfriend-turned-drug dealer Rory Jackson ([[Laz Alonso]]), Emily falls through a hole and discovers the Leprechaun's gold in a tunnel where it was hidden by Father Jacob. Evenly splitting up the gold, the quartet of friends use it to fulfill their fantasies, unaware that by taking the gold they have released Lubdan the Leprechaun, who begins stalking the group (killing a guest by impaling his chest with a bong, taking one of his coins at a party held by Jamie, prompting the police to temporarily arrest him). At the [[Beauty salon|salon]] where Emily works the Leprechaun sneaks in and, after killing a regular customer, Doria, on the massage table by breaking her neck, attacks Emily, who barely escapes and warns Rory and the recently released Jamie, who rush to get to Lisa's. In her house, Lisa is attacked by the Leprechaun and manages to fight him off for a short while, but is killed when the Leprechaun claws her in the stomach, with her friends finding her body.  While Emily and Jamie want to return the gold, Rory does not and takes off with it; shortly after realizing Rory is gone, Emily is attacked and chased outside by the Leprechaun, but is saved when Rory has a change of heart and comes back for her. Searching for Rory, Lubdan stops by his house and kills Rory's [[profligate]] girlfriend Chanel ([[Keesha Sharp]]) by tearing out her jaw, reclaiming the gold she used to make a tooth while Rory and Emily are stopped and harassed by Officers Thompson ([[Beau Billingslea]]) and Whitaker (Chris Murray). After the Leprechaun appears and kills the two officers, Emily and Rory escape and regroup with Jamie, only to be confronted by a machine gun wielding group of Rory's drug-dealing rivals, led by Watson (Shiek Mahmud-Bey) and Cedric ([[Sticky Fingaz]]). Planning on killing Rory for infringing on their territory, Watson and his gang are all disposed of by Lubdan, while Emily, Rory and Jamie drive off in Watson's car (which Lubdan latches to the bottom of for a short while) and go looking for help from Esmeralda.  Told to use four-leaf clovers against the Leprechaun by Esmeralda, Rory laces the [[hollow-point bullet]]s of his gun with clovers Jamie finds in the [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] Rory had earlier sold him. When the Leprechaun arrives, Rory shoots him several times with the clover bullets, only for his gun to jam before he can finish the Leprechaun off. Rory and Emily are given the chance to run with the gold when the Leprechaun is distracted by Jamie, who is quickly wounded with a baseball bat to the leg, and Esmeralda dies in a magical duel with the Leprechaun. Followed to the roof of the building, Rory tries fighting Lubdan and is knocked out, though before the Leprechaun can kill him, Emily taunts him by throwing some of his gold into nearby wet concrete and lures him into the ruins of the youth center, where she tosses his gold into a furnace before knocking the Leprechaun in with it.  Believing the Leprechaun is dead, Emily returns to Rory, only for Lubdan to renew his attack on them. Knocking Emily off the roof and leaving her barely holding on, Lubdan taunts her, but is shot several times in the middle of his speech by Rory, who had fixed his gun. Shooting the Leprechaun repeatedly, Rory runs out of bullets, but distracts him long enough for Emily to hit Lubdan with the chest of coins, sending him off the rooftop and into the wet concrete below, where the Leprechaun sinks and becomes trapped with his gold.  The film then cuts back to the animated prologue like the one at the beginning, and Lubdan digs himself out of the ground, leaving on a [[cliffhanger]].

The Life of David Gale
 David Gale is a [[professor]] on [[death row]] in Texas. With only a few days until his execution, his lawyer negotiates a half-million dollar fee to tell his story to Bitsey Bloom, a journalist from a major news magazine. She has a reputation of keeping secrets and protecting her sources. He tells her how he ended up on death row, revealed through a series of lengthy flashbacks.  Gale is head of the philosophy department at the University of Austin and an active member of DeathWatch, an advocacy group campaigning against [[capital punishment]]. At a graduation party, he encounters Berlin, an attractive [[graduate student]] who had been expelled from the school. When Gale gets drunk at the party, she seduces him and they have sex. She then falsely accuses Gale of [[rape]]. The next day, he loses a televised debate with the [[Governor of Texas]] when he is unable to prove a demonstrably innocent man was executed during the governor's term. After losing the debate, Gale is arrested and charged with rape. While the rape charge against Gale is later dropped, the damage had already been done, and his family, marriage, university career and reputation are all destroyed.  Constance Harraway, a fellow DeathWatch activist, is a close friend of Gale who consoles him after his life falls apart, and the pair have sex. However, the next day, Harraway is discovered raped and murdered, suffocated by a plastic bag taped over her head. An autopsy reveals that she had been forced to swallow the key to the handcuffs used to restrain her, a psychological [[torture]] technique used by the [[Securitate]] under the communist regime of [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], which Gale and Harraway had both protested against. The physical evidence at the crime scene points to Gale, who is convicted of rape and murder and is sentenced to death.  In the present, Bloom investigates the case in between her visits with Gale. She comes to believe that the apparent evidence against Gale does not add up. She is tailed several times in her car by  Dusty Wright, an alleged one-time lover and colleague of Harraway, who she suspects was the real killer. Wright slips evidence to Bloom that suggests Gale has been framed, implying that the actual murderer videotaped the crime. Bloom pursues this lead until she finds a tape revealing that Harraway, who was suffering from terminal [[leukemia]], had committed an elaborate [[suicide]] made to look like murder. Wright is seen on the videotape, acting as her accomplice, implying that they framed Gale as part of a plan to discredit the death penalty by conspiring to execute an innocent person, and subsequently releasing evidence of the actual circumstances.  Once Bloom and her aide find this evidence, only hours remain until Gale's scheduled execution. She tries to give the tape to the authorities in time to stop the execution. She arrives at the [[Huntsville Unit]] just as the warden announces that the execution has been carried out. The tape is subsequently released, causing a media and political uproar over the execution of an innocent man. Later, Wright receives the fee that Bloom's magazine agreed to pay for the interview, and delivers it to Gale's ex-wife in [[Spain]], along with a postcard from Berlin in San Francisco apologizing, all but confessing that the rape accusation that derailed Gale's life and career was false. His ex-wife looks distraught, knowing Gale told the truth and that she effectively stole their child away from him.  Much later still, a videotape labeled "Off the Record" is delivered to Bloom. This tape picks up at the point where Wright confirmed that Harraway was dead. It continues, showing him stepping aside to allow Gale, also present and party to the suicide, to caress the body of his lover, deliberately leaving his fingerprints on the plastic bag in the process. He then stands up and ends the recording, leaving Bloom stunned with the truth that the couple deliberately sacrificed themselves to discredit capital punishment.

Summer in the Golden Valley
 At the traditional Muslim funeral service for his father Fikret Varupa, sixteen-year-old boy from Sarajevo, learns that his father owes money to Hamid, a man he does not even know. The debt is considerable and Hamid does not want it to go to the grave with the body, so the debt automatically passes from the father to the son. Since in Bosnia this way of collecting debts, at a funeral, is considered to be utterly humiliating, it is never, ever applied. Fikret and his entire family become subjects of ridicule. Fikret, who is practically still a child, is decisive to "redeem his father's soul". Wishing to repay his father's debt and to secure the forgiveness, Fikret wanders into the real world of Sarajevo, the world that is ruled by post-war chaos, misery and poverty and becomes an ideal target for two corrupted policemen who wish to "help" him: they plant the kidnapped girl on him.  
LOC Kargil
   The film opens with a dramatic shot of an Indian soldier's wireless set chirping frantic commands from one of the army bases, calling a patrol to report in while the radio operator lies dead in the snow. After frantic attempts from battalions to locate their lost patrols, the [[Indian Army]] HQ in [[Jammu and Kashmir]] decides to deploy more troops. Lts. [[Saurabh Kalia]] and Amit Bharadhwaj are sent on reconnaissance patrols along the [[Line of Control]] (LoC). Lt. Kalia's patrol is wiped out while Lt. Bharadhwaj's patrol suffers heavy casualties but manages to return to their base. Pakistani forces begin shelling across the LoC, targeting [[National Highway 1A]] (NH-1A). The Indian Army decides to deploy more troops but suffer a rude shock when company and even battalion-sized patrols are beaten back by the Pakistani intruders who have occupied peaks around the [[Mushkoh Valley]], [[Kargil district|Kargil]], [[Dras]], Kaksar and [[Batalik]]. After these terrible reverses, the decision is taken to go ahead with maximum mobilisation and move the army's best fighting units into the area of operations. However, orders from Delhi are that Indian soldiers are barred from crossing the LoC during their operations. Most mobilised battalions are completely unaware about the nature and size of the threat, thus the rationale behind maximum mobilisation is questioned by all the battalion commanders.  The first unit deployed is the 1st battalion, [[11 Gorkha Rifles]] (1/11 GR) who are specialists in high-altitude warfare. 1/11 GR's commanding officer is Col. [[Lalit Rai]] ([[Sudesh Berry]]), and the battalion has the charismatic and brave Lt. [[Manoj Kumar Pandey|Manoj Pandey]] ([[Ajay Devgn]]) leading one of its platoons. Subsequently, the 18th battalion, [[The Grenadiers]] (18 Grenadiers), which was in the Kashmir Valley guarding against terrorist infiltration, are deployed in Kargil. The battalion is led by Col. Khushal Thakur ([[Raj Babbar]]), and among the officers and soldiers are men like Lt. Col. R. Vishwanathan ([[Mohnish Behl]]), Maj. [[Rajesh Adhikari]] ([[Karan Nath]]), Lt. Balwan Singh ([[Akshaye Khanna]]), Capt. Sachin Nimbalkar (Vineet Sharma), and Grens. [[Yogendra Singh Yadav]] ([[Ashutosh Rana]] and [[Manoj Bajpai]]). 18 Grenadiers are followed by the 17th battalion, [[Jat Regiment]] (17 Jat) led by Col. Umesh Singh Bawa ([[Kiran Kumar]]) with Capt. [[Anuj Nayyar]] ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) leading one of its units. 17 Jat is followed by the 13th battalion, [[Jammu & Kashmir Rifles]] (13 JAK Rif) commanded by Lt. Col. [[Yogesh Kumar Joshi|Y.K Joshi]] ([[Sanjay Dutt]]) with Lt. Vikram Batra ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]) leading one of its units. Other battalions are subsequently inducted into the theatre of conflict. The [[Indian Air Force]] launches photographic reconnaissance missions in order to identify the intruders.  The first assault is by the 1/11 GR advance platoon, led by Lt. Pandey, who first capture Yaldar village and link up with a beleaguered and severely mauled company from the 3rd battalion, [[Punjab Regiment (India)|Punjab Regiment]] (3 Punjab). JCOs from 3 Punjab reveal that earlier patrols from 3 Punjab and 16 Grenadiers had gone missing in the Kukarthang sector. Lt. Pandey's platoon follow the patrol paths and launch an attack on Kukarthang post, a very heavily defended enemy position supported by mortar units and artillery batteries on the Pakistani side of the LoC. The Gorkhas capture Kukarthang after taking 9 casualties. It is later revealed that the size of the infiltration was much larger than previously thought. Indian Army planners believe that approximately 3,000 members of the [[Pakistan Army]]'s [[Northern Light Infantry]] are involved.  The second battle is at the strategic [[Battle of Tololing|Tololing]] mountain which sits astride [[National Highway 1D (India)|National Highway 1D]], the main supply route for the entire northern Kashmir sector including [[Siachen]] and [[Leh]]. 18 Grenadiers link up with a severely beaten 16 Grenadiers and get first hand knowledge of the situation. A company from 18 Grenadiers, led by Maj. Adhikari, attacks Tololing. The company is held up midway due to heavy fog; it waits for clear weather. Intense enemy shelling occurs while the men are resting, causing panic and casualties. They try to move up the mountain but are pushed down by heavy small arms fire from intruders who are well entrenched atop the feature. Subsequent attacks from the Indians are stifled by stiff resistance, and in the absence of artillery support, Maj. Adhikari and Lt. Col. Vishwanathan are killed. 18 Grenadiers make a total of 4 attempts to recapture Tololing but are repeatedly beaten back.  Meanwhile, a unit from 17 Jat lead by Maj. Deepak Rampal ([[Sanjay Kapoor]]) capture a Pakistani mortar position. They subsequently liberate an important peak, but suffer casualties. Col. Bawa tasks them to capture Pt. 4850.  18 Grenadiers are relieved by the 2nd battalion, [[Rajputana Rifles]] (2 Raj Rif), commanded by Col. Ravindranath ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), which moves in with an artillery battery of 110&nbsp;mm field artillery and acclimatised troops. They launch a multi-pronged attack with artillery support which ends in success but at a heavy cost, with Capt. Vijayant Thapar ([[Amar Upadhyay]]), Maj. Padmapani Acharya ([[Nagarjuna Akkineni]]) and Maj. Vivek Gupta ([[Himanshu Malik]]) killed. All this happens while 13 JAK Rif stands by in case 2 Raj Rif fails. Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force launches combat sorties ([[Operation Safed Sagar]]) and bombs enemy positions.  13 JAK Rif is blooded at Rocky Knob where they take the field after suffering heavy casualties. They follow it up with another victory at Point 5140 where Lt. Batra distinguishes himself by taking the south face of the peak without any casualties and is promoted to captain.  The decisive phase of the war has come. 18 Grenadiers are assigned to take [[Tiger Hill, Kargil|Tiger Hill]], 17 Jat to Three Pimple Complex feature, 1/11 GR to Khalubar Ridge and 13 JAK Rif to Bunker Complex. After a heavy artillery barrage 18 Grenadiers take Tiger Hill, spearheaded by a daring stealth attack by the elite Ghatak section, which includes both Grens. Yogendra Singh Yadav. However, only one member of the section, Gren. Yadav (Manoj Bajpai), survives (despite being shot several times) to link up with the rest of the battalion. 17 Jat suffers heavy casualties with Capt. Nayyar and several others killed and injured, but is able to secure Three Pimple Complex.  1/11 GR link up with 22 Grenadiers at the base of Khalubar Ridge after braving an intense creeping barrage of artillery. Lt. Pandey somehow keeps the sagging morale of the weary unit up till the battalion begins its attack. The plans go awry when Col. Rai, is injured by machine gun fire. Lt. Pandey volunteers to take out the bunkers which are holding up the attack. The machine guns are taken out, but Lt. Pandey and his platoon sergeant Hav. Bhim Bahadur ([[Puru Raajkumar]]) are killed.  The last battle is fought by 13 JAK Rif at Bunker Complex. The unit gets split up - Capt. Batra is sent to link up with Capt. Nagappa (Nagender Choudhary) who has captured one bunker and is surrounded by the enemy. Batra links up with Nagappa but is pinned down himself by heavy enemy fire. He single-handedly takes out two bunkers but is mortally wounded. 13 JAK Rif pursues the fleeing enemy to the LoC but stops due to orders not to cross it. Finally, India declares Operation Vijay a success and secures all its captured heights.  
The Long and Short of It
 It's another day in Wellington. The Grisely Painter ([[Andrew Lesnie]]) is putting up a poster, but has a bad back and his ladder is broken. He is about to give up when a small woman ([[Praphaphorn Chansantor]]) comes by and helps glue the lower part of the poster to the wall. This catches the attention of a very tall man (Paul Randall), who glues the top part of the poster to the wall.  When they finish, all three step back and admire the poster, which advertises a sports car that none of them can drive: it is physically unsuitable for the small woman and the tall man, and clearly unaffordable for the working-class painter. A bus pulls up behind them, the bus driver ([[Peter Jackson]]) lets them on, and they drive away. The camera pans to the bin and we see that there is the Grisely Painter's roller and pad.  
The Locals
  The film follows two best friends Grant and Paul who hit the road for a weekend of surfing, booze and hopefully . . . girls.

Lust takes the wheel and a game of cat and mouse begins leading them deep into the heartland of evil where they meet... The Locals.  
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King
  Two [[Hobbit]]s, Sméagol and [[Déagol]], are fishing when Déagol discovers the [[One Ring]] in the river. Sméagol is ensnared by the Ring, and kills his friend for it. He retreats into the [[Misty Mountains]] as the Ring twists his body and mind, until he becomes the creature [[Gollum]].  Centuries later, [[Gandalf]] leads [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], [[Gimli (Middle-earth)|Gimli]], and King [[Théoden]] to [[Isengard]], where they reunite with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. Gandalf retrieves the defeated [[Saruman]]'s ''[[palantír]]''. Pippin later looks into the seeing-stone, and is telepathically attacked by [[Sauron]]. Gandalf deduces that Sauron will attack [[Gondor]]'s capital [[Minas Tirith]]. He rides there to warn Gondor's steward [[Denethor]], taking Pippin with him.  Gollum leads [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] to [[Minas Morgul]]. The hobbits begin climbing a stair carved in the cliff face that will take them into Mordor via a 'secret way' - unaware that Gollum plans to kill them and take the Ring. Sauron's army strikes and overwhelms [[Osgiliath]], forcing [[Faramir]] and his garrison to retreat to Minas Tirith.  Gollum disposes of the Hobbits' food, blaming Sam. Frodo leaves Sam behind before they arrive at the tunnel leading to Mordor, where Gollum tricks him into venturing into the lair of the giant spider [[Shelob]]. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, telling him that he must destroy the Ring for both their sakes. Gollum attacks Frodo, but falls down a chasm. Frodo continues on, but Shelob discovers, paralyses and binds him. However, Sam arrives and drives her away. Sam hides as [[Orc]]s appear and take Frodo with them. Sam follows the Orcs into the Tower of [[Cirith Ungol]], and frees Frodo so they can continue their journey.  Aragorn learns from [[Elrond]] that [[Arwen]] is dying, having refused to leave Middle Earth after seeing a vision of [[Eldarion|her son with Aragorn]]. Elrond gives Aragorn [[Andúril]], [[Isildur]]'s sword [[Narsil]] reforged, so he can reclaim his birthright while gaining reinforcements from the [[Dead Men of Dunharrow]]. Joined by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels to the [[Paths of the Dead]], recruiting the Army of the Dead by pledging to release them from the curse Isildur put on them. Faramir is gravely wounded after a futile effort to retake Osgiliath; believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf is left to defend the city against the Orc army, led by [[Gothmog (Third Age)|Gothmog]]. As Gothmog's army forces its way into the city, Denethor attempts to kill himself and Faramir on a [[pyre]]. Pippin alerts Gandalf and they save Faramir, but Denethor leaps to his death from the top of Minas Tirith just before Théoden and his nephew, [[Éomer]], arrive with the Rohirrim. During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|ensuing battle]], they are overwhelmed by the [[Oliphaunt]]-riding [[Haradrim]], while the [[Witch-king of Angmar]] mortally wounds Théoden. Though Théoden's niece [[Éowyn]] destroys the Witch-King with Merry's help, Théoden dies of his wounds. Aragorn arrives with the Army of the Dead, who overcome the Orcs and win the battle; Aragorn then frees them from the curse. Aragorn decides to lead his army upon the Black Gate as a distraction, so Frodo and Sam can get to [[Mount Doom]].  Aragorn's army [[Battle of the Morannon|draw out Sauron's forces]] and empties Mordor, allowing Frodo and Sam to reach the volcano, but Gollum attacks them just as they reach Mount Doom. Frodo succumbs to the Ring and claims it as his own. Gollum attacks Frodo and bites his finger off to reclaim the Ring. Frodo fights back and knocks Gollum, who is holding the Ring, into the volcano, destroying the Ring and killing Gollum. As Frodo and Sam escape, Sauron is destroyed and Mordor crumbles. Gandalf flies in with [[Eagle (Middle-earth)|eagles]] to rescue the Hobbits, who awaken later in [[Rivendell]] and are reunited with the surviving Fellowship members. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and takes Arwen as his queen. The Hobbits return to the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]], where Sam marries [[Rosie Cotton]]. A few years later, Frodo departs Middle Earth for the [[Undying Lands]] with his uncle [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], Gandalf, and the Elves. He leaves Sam the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], which details their adventures. Sam then returns to the Shire, where he embraces Rosie and their children.

Looney Tunes: Back in Action
 Tired of playing [[Double act|second banana]] to [[Bugs Bunny]], [[Daffy Duck]] demands his own cartoon from [[Warner Bros.]], but is promptly fired. Aspiring [[stuntman]] DJ Drake is asked to escort Daffy off the studio lot, but the ensuing chase leads to the [[Batmobile]] demolishing the studio [[water tower]]. DJ is also fired in the process, and returns home with Daffy hitching a ride, discovering his father,  [[action film]] star, Damian Drake, is actually a [[espionage|secret agent]]. Damian instructs his son to travel to [[Las Vegas]], find his associate Dusty Tails, and gain the mystical "blue monkey" [[diamond]], but he is shortly thereafter captured by the [[Acme Corporation]], led by the childish Mr. Chairman. DJ and Daffy head for Vegas. Meanwhile, Bugs' routines fall apart without Daffy, so "Vice-President of Comedy," Kate Houghton, is sent to rehire Daffy or face being fired herself. Bugs informs Kate of the situation, so they steal Damian's spy car, and pursue DJ and Daffy.  In Las Vegas, DJ and Daffy meet Dusty in a [[casino]] owned by Acme operative [[Yosemite Sam]]. Dusty gives them a strange playing card, but when Sam attempts to kill them, they flee in the spy car with Bugs and Kate. The spy car, which can also [[flying car (aircraft)|fly]], crashes in the Nevada desert. The group eventually stumbles upon [[Area 51|Area 52]], run by a woman called 'mother', who informs them of the situation, and plays a video recording, which reveals that Acme intends on using the blue monkey to transform mankind into monkeys to manufacture their products, before turning them back into human beings to purchase them. [[Marvin the Martian]], imprisoned in the facility, escapes and leads a group of fellow alien inmates to obtain the playing card, but the heroes escape. Seeing that the card has [[Mona Lisa]]'s face on it, the group conclude they must view the painting in the [[Louvre]], located in [[Paris]].  At the Louvre, they discover that the card contains a viewing window, and looking through it, the window reveals that the Mona Lisa has a map of [[Africa]] hidden beneath. [[Elmer Fudd]] appears, and, revealing himself as an Acme operative, chases Bugs and Daffy through the gallery for the card whilst Kate is kidnapped by Mr. Chairman's [[bodyguard]], Mr. Smith, to obtain a photo of the African map. DJ rescues Kate. Elmer is disintegrated by Bugs after jumping out of a pointillism artwork. Bugs and Daffy reunite with DJ and Kate, and they leave Paris.  DJ, Kate, Bugs, and Daffy travel to Africa, meeting Granny, Sylvester, and Tweety, who escort them to the ruins of a jungle temple where they find the blue monkey. Granny and company reveal themselves to be Mr. Chairman, Smith, and the Tasmanian Devil in disguise. Mr. Chairman uses a [[Duck Dodgers in the 24½th Century|disintegration gun]] to transport himself and the heroes to the Acme headquarters where he forces DJ to give him the diamond,  when Damian is revealed to be his prisoner.  Marvin is sent to place the blue monkey on an Acme satellite which will emit an energy beam around the world to turn everyone, except Mr. Chairman, into monkeys. DJ and Kate rescue Damian from a death trap, whilst Bugs and Daffy pursue Marvin into space. Bugs is incapacitated, prompting Daffy to become [[Duck Dodgers]], in order to destroy the blue monkey. The transforming energy beam only strikes Mr. Chairman, turning him into a monkey.  Bugs and Daffy return to Earth, where Daffy discovers the whole adventure was staged to make a film. However, Bugs promises Daffy they will be equal partners, but just as Daffy's luck seems to be improving, he is flattened by the Looney Tunes iris, where [[Porky Pig]] attempts to close the film with "That's all folks!" only for the studio to shut down before he can finish, and he tells the audience to go home.

Love Actually
 The film begins with a voiceover from David ([[Hugh Grant]]) commenting that whenever he gets gloomy about the state of the world he thinks about the arrivals terminal at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]], and the pure uncomplicated love felt as friends and families welcome their arriving loved ones. David's voiceover also relates that all the messages left by the people who died on the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] planes were messages of love and not hate. The film then tells the 'love stories' of many people:  ===Billy Mack and Joe=== With the help of his longtime manager Joe ([[Gregor Fisher]]), [[rock and roll]] legend Billy Mack ([[Bill Nighy]]) records a Christmas variation of [[The Troggs]]' "[[Love Is All Around]]". Although he thinks the record is terrible, Mack promotes the release in the hope it will become the [[Christmas number-one singles in the UK|Christmas number one single]]; it does and after briefly celebrating his victory at a party hosted by Sir [[Elton John]], Billy discerns that Joe is in need of affection and suggests that he and Joe celebrate Christmas by getting drunk and watching [[pornography|porn]].  ===Juliet, Peter and Mark=== Juliet ([[Keira Knightley]]) and Peter's ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]) marriage is videotaped by the [[Groomsman#Best man|best man]], Mark ([[Andrew Lincoln]]). Although both Juliet and Peter believe that Mark dislikes Juliet, he is in love with her. When Mark evades Juliet's requests to see the video he made at the wedding, Juliet visits Mark. She says she wants them to be friends and when she finds and views the wedding video, it turns out to be just adoring close-ups of her. After an uncomfortable silence, Mark blurts out that he snubs her out of "self-preservation." On Christmas Eve, Juliet answers the doorbell to find Mark, carrying a boombox playing Christmas songs and large [[cue cards]] on which he has written, without expectation of reciprocation, that he loves her. As he walks away, Juliet runs after him to give him a quick kiss before she returns inside.  ===Jamie and Aurélia=== Writer Jamie ([[Colin Firth]]) is pushed to Juliet and Peter's wedding by his girlfriend ([[Sienna Guillory]]) as she feigns illness. He returns between the ceremony and the reception to check on her, and discovers that she is having an affair with his brother. Crushed, Jamie withdraws to his French cottage where he meets Portuguese housekeeper Aurélia ([[Lúcia Moniz]]), who does not speak English. Despite their inability to communicate, they become attracted to each other. When Jamie returns to England, he realises he is in love with Aurélia and begins learning Portuguese. He returns to France to find her and ends up walking through town, gathering people as they walk to her job at a restaurant. In his broken Portuguese he declares his love for her and proposes. She says yes in broken English as the crowd erupts in applause.  ===Harry, Karen and Mia=== Harry ([[Alan Rickman]]) is the managing director of a design agency; Mia ([[Heike Makatsch]]) is his new secretary. Harry is comfortably married to his wife, Karen ([[Emma Thompson]]), who stays home to raise their children. Harry becomes increasingly aroused by Mia's overtly sexual behaviour at the office and does nothing to dissuade her. At the company Christmas party held at Mark's gallery, he not only inquires if Mark is her boyfriend, but dances closely with her. While at the shops, he calls Mia to find out what she wants for Christmas and ends up almost caught by his wife purchasing an expensive necklace from the jewellery department thanks to the salesman Rufus ([[Rowan Atkinson]]). Later on, Karen discovers the necklace in Harry's coat pocket and happily assumes it is a gift for her. When he hands her a similarly shaped box to open on Christmas Eve, she is heartbroken to find it is a [[Joni Mitchell]] CD, meaning that the necklace was for someone else. She confronts Harry and asks him what he would do if he was her. Harry begs her forgiveness. She responds that he has made a mockery of their marriage and of her.  ===David and Natalie=== Karen's brother, David ([[Hugh Grant]]), is the recently elected [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Natalie ([[Martine McCutcheon]]) is a new junior member of the household staff at [[10 Downing Street]]. During a meeting with the U.S. President ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]), they run into Natalie and the president makes some inappropriate comments to David about Natalie's body. Later, David walks in on Natalie serving tea and biscuits to the president, and it appears that something untoward is happening. Natalie seems ashamed, but the President has a sly grin on his face. At the following joint press conference, David is uncharacteristically assertive while taking a stand against the President's intimidating policies. Finding that his relationship with Natalie has become strained and a distraction, David has her moved to another job. However, he is spurred to action on Christmas Eve when he finds a Christmas card from Natalie declaring that she is his and no one else's. After a door to door search of her street, he comes across Mia, who informs him that Natalie lives next door. The entire family is on their way out the door to a multi-school Christmas play and he offers to drive them so he can talk to her. After Natalie sneaks him in to the school, he runs into his heartbroken sister who believes he is there for his niece and nephew. As the two try to keep from being seen and watch the show from backstage, they finally kiss. All their hiding was for nothing because as the curtain rises, they are seen kissing by everyone.  ===Daniel, Sam, Joanna and Carol=== Daniel ([[Liam Neeson]]), Karen's friend, mourns the recent death of his wife Joanna, as he tries to raise his stepson Sam ([[Thomas Brodie-Sangster|Thomas Sangster]]) alone. Sam has fallen for an American classmate, also named Joanna ([[Olivia Olson]]), and, after discussion with his stepfather, decides to learn the drums so that he can accompany her in the big finale for their school's Christmas pageant (the same one that David's nephew and Karen and Harry's children are in). After Sam feels that he missed his chance to make an impression on her, Daniel convinces Sam that he must go catch Joanna, who is returning to the US, at the airport that night and show her how he feels, lest he regret it. Sam runs away from the airport security and says hi to Joanna, who then kisses him on the cheek. Meanwhile, Daniel meets Carol ([[Claudia Schiffer]]), the mother of one of Sam's schoolmates.  ===Sarah, Karl and Michael=== Sarah ([[Laura Linney]]) first appears at Juliet and Peter's wedding, sitting next to her friend Jamie. She is an American who works at Harry's graphic design company and has been in love for years with the company's creative director, Karl ([[Rodrigo Santoro]]). They finally connect at the firm's Christmas party and he drives her home. They kiss, but before more can occur, they are interrupted by her [[Mental disorder|mentally ill]] brother, Michael, phoning from a mental care facility. Sarah and Karl's evening tryst is aborted and Karl leaves. Both are working late on Christmas Eve and when Karl leaves, he just wishes her a Merry Christmas. Michael phones Sarah and she goes to stay with him, sharing her Christmas scarf.  ===Colin, Tony and the American girls=== After unsuccessfully attempting to woo various English women, including Mia and Nancy ([[Julia Davis]]), the caterer at Juliet and Peter's wedding, Colin Frissell ([[Kris Marshall]]) informs his friend Tony ([[Abdul Salis]]) he plans to go to America, where he is convinced that his Britishness will be an asset. Landing in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], Colin meets Stacey ([[Ivana Miličević]]), Jeannie ([[January Jones]]), and Carol-Anne ([[Elisha Cuthbert]]), three stunningly attractive women who fall for his [[Basildon]] accent and invite him to stay at their home, where they are joined by roommate Harriet ([[Shannon Elizabeth]]).  ===John and Judy=== John ([[Martin Freeman]]) and Judy ([[Joanna Page]]) are professional body doubles for films. They meet for the [[sex scene]]s in a film for which Tony is a production assistant. John tells Judy that "It is nice to have someone [he] can just chat to." While the two are perfectly comfortable being naked and simulating sex on-set, they are shy and tentative off-set. Carefully pursuing a relationship, they attend the Christmas pageant (involving David and Natalie, Harry and Karen's children, Daniel and Sam, [[et alii|et al.]]) at the local school with John's brother.  ===Rufus=== Rufus ([[Rowan Atkinson]]) is the jewellery salesman, whose obsessive attention to gift-wrapping nearly results in Harry being caught buying a necklace for Mia by Karen. Also, it is his distraction of staff at the airport which allows Sam to sneak through to see Joanna. In the director and cast commentary, it is revealed that Rufus was originally supposed to be a Christmas angel; however, this was dropped from the final script.  ===Epilogue=== One month later, all of the characters are seen in [[Heathrow Airport]]. Billy tells Joe that his Christmas single has spurred a comeback. Juliet, Peter, and Mark meet Jamie and his bride, Aurélia. Karen and the kids greet Harry, but Karen's reaction suggests that they are struggling to move past his indiscretion. Sam greets Joanna, who has returned with her mother from America, and Daniel is joined by his new girlfriend Carol and her son. Newlyweds John and Judy, heading off to their honeymoon, run into Tony who is awaiting Colin as he returns from America. Colin returns with Harriet and her sister Carla ([[Denise Richards]]) who greets Tony with a hug and a kiss. Natalie welcomes David back from his flight in view of the press, indicating that their relationship is now public. These scenes dissolve into footage of actual arrivals at Heathrow, as the screen is divided into an increasing number of smaller segments which form the shape of a heart.  
Love Me If You Dare
 The film begins in [[Liège (city)|Liège]]<ref>[http://movieraccoon.com/2004/love-me-if-you-dare/]  </ref> in Belgium, where a little girl, Sophie, is being bullied by other children. Only a bus driver and a boy, Julien, help her collect her books that the others have thrown into a puddle.  To cheer Sophie up, Julien gives her a small tin box, a gift from his fatally ill mother. Because it is important to him, he asks her to lend it back to him from time to time. As Julien wants the box back at the moment he gave it to her, Sophie demands proof of how important it is to him. Julien disengages the handbrake of the bus without hesitation, and the bus full of children rolls down a hill. Their game has begun: the box changes its owner after each completed dare.  Between the son of wealthy Belgian parents and the daughter of poor Polish immigrants a lasting friendship develops. As children, they misbehave in school, wreak havoc on a wedding, and request silly tasks of each other.  As teenagers their romantic relationships with others suffer as a result of their dares. Meanwhile, the two friends ignore any consequences or punishment during their game.  While they are always looking for the next kick, a love is slowly evolving between the protagonists. Not wanting to admit it, they divert their attention from it by even more extreme dares.  As young adults, Julien tells Sophie that he wants to get married, only later revealing that he means to someone else.  The climax is reached when Sophie interrupts Julien's wedding, after which he is cast out by his father and Sophie is nearly killed during another game. Julien returns to marry his wife, and Sophie declares that they will not see each other for ten years.  Ten years pass, and Julien is married with two children.  Sophie has also married her husband, a famous soccer star. A successful Julien admits that he has not forgotten Sophie, though he assumes that she has forgotten him.  On the night of Julien's tenth wedding anniversary, Sophie sends a message to him, indicating that the game is back on.  Julien and Sophie meet for a brief moment in the midst of another dare, yet it is enough to remind Julien that their game is "better than life itself."  After a dramatic accident, Julien and Sophie finally reunite, despite the protestations of their spouses.  The film has two [[alternate ending]]s, which are shown consecutively. In the first, Julien and Sophie decide as an ultimate dare to finally share their dream together, their "dream of an eternal love" – the pair embrace while they stand in a construction pit that is about to be filled with concrete. The couple kiss as they are pulled beneath the cement, and both drown in the sludge. The other ending has the now aged Julien and Sophie spending time together in a garden and carrying on playing their game with milder dares. However, the opening scene of the film (an overhead view of a building site and a pit filled with concrete in which the upper side Julien's tin box rests partially sunk) replays, suggesting that the two friends actually did bury themselves and drown beneath the concrete.

Two years late, Luther is a monk at [[St. Augustine's Monastery (Erfurt)|St. Augustine's Monastery]] in [[Erfurt]]. During his time at the monastery, he is constantly troubled by viewing God as a God of hate and vengeance. Martin is encouraged by [[Johann von Staupitz]], an elder monk who is his supervisor and mentor. Staupitz tells Luther to look to [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] instead of himself.  Later, Luther delivers a letter for Staupitz to [[Rome]], where he becomes troubled by the wicked lifestyles of those in the city. He also views the skull believed to be that of [[John the Baptist]] and purchases an [[indulgence]]. It is during this time that Luther begins to question the veracity of indulgences. Returning to Germany, Luther is sent to [[Wittenberg]], where he begins to teach his congregation that God is not a God of hate, but a God of love. Luther begins to emphasize the love of God instead of his judgment.  [[Johann Tetzel]] then comes close to Luther's town, where he scares the people into buying indulgences. The proceeds will be used to rebuild and renovate [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome, and to recover the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] bribes to the [[Holy See]], advanced by [[Jakob Fugger|Fugger]], for the [[investiture]] of [[Archbishop]] [[Albert of Mainz|Albert of Mainz and Magdeburg]]). In his church, Luther denounces the indulgences, calling them "just a piece of paper". He then posts his [[Ninety-five Theses|95 theses]] on the door of the church, calling for an open debate regarding the indulgences. For this act, Luther is called to [[Augsburg]], where he is questioned by church officials.  After his excommunication, [[Pope Leo X]] orders Luther to be delivered to Rome, but [[Prince-elector]] [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony|Frederick the Wise]] of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] protects him by moving him into [[Wartburg Castle]]. Frederick and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] decide that Luther will be tried at the [[Imperial_Diet_(Holy_Roman_Empire)|diet]] of [[Diet of Worms|Worms]].  After his trial at Worms, Luther is forced into hiding by Frederick the Wise at Wartburg, while his former professor, [[Andreas Karlstadt]], encourages the [[German Peasants' War|Great Peasants' Revolt]] against the oppressive nobles.

After Luther marries [[Katharina von Bora]], a former nun, Charles V summons the evangelical [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Princes]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] to the [[Diet of Augsburg]], so he can force them to outlaw [[Protestantism]] and the German Bible. The nobles refuse, and Charles is forced to allow the nobles to read their [[Augsburg Confession]].  The film ends with the following words: <blockquote> [[Diet of Augsburg|What happened at Augsburg]] pushed open the door of religious freedom. Martin Luther lived for another 16 years, preaching and teaching the Word. He and Katharina von Bora enjoyed a happy marriage and six children. Luther's influence extended into economics, politics, education and music, and [[Luther Bible|his translation of the Bible]] became a foundation stone of the [[German language]].

After Bill's campaign manager Tom Gibbons ([[Blair Underwood]]) gets irritated with B-Rad's constant interruptions with the election, Bill decides that B-Rad must see a psychiatrist,  Dr. Feldman ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]). Dr. Feldman tells B-Rad's parents Bill and Bess ([[Bo Derek]]) that B-Rad has the most serious case of "[[Wigger|gangstaphrienia]]" that he has ever seen. Tom then has an idea to hire two actors, PJ ([[Anthony Anderson]]) and Sean James ([[Taye Diggs]]) to try to scare B-Rad back to normal. Although Bill thinks it could get dangerous, he reluctantly agrees. With the help of PJ's cousin Shondra ([[Regina Hall]]), they kidnap B-Rad and take him to the ghetto.  Shondra tries to convince B-Rad that if he stops acting like a gangster, they will let him go. B-Rad tries to tell Shondra he cannot, it is who he is. The actors then try plan B, forcing B-Rad to rob a convenience store owned by a [[Korean American]] family. Later, realizing they forgot to call to tell the owner that the robbery was fake, after sending B-Rad in, PJ and Sean begin to worry the plan will fail and they will go to jail. B-Rad finds his emergency stash of cash in his pants and pays for the alcohol he was supposed to steal for the two gangsters. B-Rad then lies to them and says he stole it. When they find a receipt in the back, B-Rad says he stole that, too.  The actors try taking him to a scary movie to get him to stop trying to be a gangster. All B-Rad does is get scared and screams and throws popcorn all over the place, ruining the movie. At this point, PJ and Sean are frustrated and decide to take B-Rad to a club and have him compete in a rap battle. B-Rad ends up getting thrown off the stage for saying the [[Nigger#The N-word euphemism|N word]] in one of his rhymes. He is thrown in a dumpster while the actors laugh at him hysterically. B-Rad feels as if he never could rap, until Shondra changes his mind.  After she cheers him up, they kiss. B-Rad takes it too far and gets on top of Shondra, only to be thrown off the bed by her. She storms out of the room and B-Rad takes a nap. He dreams about a rat by the name of Ronnie Rizzat (voiced by [[Snoop Dogg]]) and he tells to just be himself, but the rat "would rather eat garbage than listen to his tired-ass rhymes". His dream ends and B-Rad hears the actors on the phone with Tom. B-Rad then realizes the whole thing was a joke, including Shondra.  Angry, B-Rad storms out of the house. Sean and PJ follow him outside, only to be held hostage by a real gangster Tec ([[Damien Dante Wayans]]), who is also Shondra's ex-boyfriend, whom B-Rad encountered at the club. Tec and his crew kidnap B-Rad and the actors and take them to an empty parking lot. Tec calls Tom and tells him if Bill wants to see his son again, they have to give him $500,000. Tom has another plan, if they kill B-Rad, Bill will get more votes for his campaign.  Tom tells Tec there is no deal. Tec points a gun at B-Rad and a pack of other gangsters pull up and start shooting at B-Rad and the others. B-Rad then takes two Uzis, hops on the roof of a car, and starts aiming fire at all of them. Scaring them away, Tec realizes B-Rad is gangster himself. He then makes B-Rad one of them, leaving the actors tied up and brought to a party. While at the party, everyone sees B-Rad on television shooting at the gangsters with a security camera catching everything.  Worried and realizing he needs to be a better father to B-Rad, Bill tells Tom what happened and asks Tom to help him. Tom, though, is more focused on the campaign, but Bill says he would rather lose the election than his son. Tom, now frustrated with Bill, yells at him and says that if anything happens to B-Rad, he can turn it around to make Bill the victim, instead. Bill realizes that Tom is hoping that something bad will happen to B-Rad to get votes and fires Tom before driving to South Central Los Angeles to find his son. B-Rad's crew Hadji ([[Kal Penn]]), Mocha ([[Nick Swardson]]), and Monster ([[Keili Lefkovitz]]) also see the news and grab their best weapons (a musket, a spear gun, and an RPG) to save him.  Shondra shows up to the party, after seeing the news as well. Shondra sees PJ and Sean and asks where B-Rad is; they tell her, only to be shut up by other gangsters there. Shondra enters a bedroom, where B-Rad and two other woman are taking off his pants. Shondra acts like his baby mama to get them to leave. B-Rad gets mad and shoots his foot, not thinking the gun is real. Realizing it is, he jumps around the room in pain. Shondra tries to help him as Tec walks in, thinking Shondra is hooking up with B-Rad. Tec is furious and threatens to shoot them both.  Bill crashes through the wall and tries to reason with everyone, only to be held at gunpoint. B-Rad's crew members crash through the wall, as well, and point their guns at Tec and his crew. Bill apologizes to B-Rad for not always being there for him and accepts B-Rad for who he is. Accepting his apology, they hug. Tec is still angry, and ruins the moment with his crew and him pointing their guns at B-Rad's crew. B-Rad decides to rap, only annoying Tec.  B-Rad then begins to take the weapons, not wanting to have any violence. Mocha, agreeing with B-Rad, throws his gun to the ground which accidentally fires, hitting Monster in her chest armor, causing her to accidentally shoot B-Rad in the buttocks with her spear gun, resulting in him dropping Hadji's rocket launcher, which fires right into the oven. Everyone runs out of the house just before it blows up. B-Rad is treated for his wounds while Shondra talks to him. B-Rad had trouble telling what was real and what was not, so Shondra kisses him to help him. Shondra also ends up opening her own salon, and B-Rad and she get back together. Bill wins the election for Governor of California, and is glad to have his son with him.

In pursuit, Kurt searches a vacant garage on the property before entering a house, which is dilapidated and filled with degraded furnishings. Inside, he is clobbered with a metal [[pulley]] and stabbed to death by an unseen assailant.  After burying Max's body in a field, Julian and Marylin drive to the abandoned house to meet with Kurt and divide the money. Arriving at nightfall, they find Samantha tied up and sleeping on the floor, and Kurt nowhere in sight. Julian takes his car to search for Kurt, leaving Marylin alone at the house with Samantha. From the foyer, Samantha watches as a man wearing Kurt's sack mask descends the stairs, but is unable to warn Marylin as her mouth is taped shut. The man drags Marylin into the dining room and stabs her to death. Meanwhile, while driving on backroads, Julian catches the attention of a parked police officer, and quickly retreats to the house, where he finds the entryway floor soaked in blood, and Samantha hiding in a closet. Samantha tells him that Kurt returned to the house and killed Marylin.  Julian and Samantha leave on foot to search for Courtney, and also stumble upon the adjacent farm property. While investigating the house there, they find Courtney locked in an upstairs closet with Kurt's corpse. As Samantha unties Courtney's arms, the man in the sack mask attacks Julian and incapacitates Samantha and Courtney. Samantha awakens in the basement hanging from the ceiling. As the killer approaches her with a knife, she manages to pull down the metal piping from the ceiling, freeing herself, and flees with Courtney. The killer pursues them, and Julian is left alone in the farm, where he discovers numerous corpses in various states of decay, and finds Marylin's body posed against an arrangement of human and animal bones.  Samantha and Courtney return to the adjacent house to retrieve the van keys. As they are about to leave, Samantha sees the killer coming toward the house, and the two retreat to a bedroom upstairs to hide, but the killer finds and attacks them. Julian arrives and shoots him, but he does not die immediately. Samantha smashes a chair over the killer's head, knocking him unconscious. Julian removes his mask, revealing a young man with a scar across his face; the killer is Martin Bristol, now a teenager. The three flee, and the police officer arrives at the house just as Samantha and Courtney exit. Julian stumbles out after them holding a gun, and the officer to shoot him to death. When the officer goes upstairs to locate Martin, he has vanished.  The following morning, forensic investigators remove numerous bodies from the farm property, and uncover journals from the serial killer who abducted Martin and groomed him to be a killer himself. The journals suggest that Martin, who gained strength as he grew into adulthood, killed his abductor in the manners in which he was taught. That evening, Samantha prepares to go to bed; on the floor is the duffel bag full of the money that Kurt left in her van. While she and Courtney lie down to sleep, the closet door behind them opens.  
The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular (film)
 On John Conroy's property, the 2-year-old colts and fillies are mustered and brought to the homestead for [[horse breaking]]. Two of the colts are of very good stock, especially the beautiful and spirited colt from the famous racehorse Regret (John Conroy says that the colt is worth a thousand pounds (£1000) and that he wants the colt to eventually be the [[stud (animal)|stud]] horse for the property).   Jim Ryan arrives at John Conroy's property following the death of his father. When he and Conroy's daughter, Kate, see each other, it is love at first sight for them both.  Jim, however, finds resentment at his presence at the [[Station (Australian agriculture)|station]], both from John Conroy, the owner of the property, and the station's [[Stockman (Australia)|stockmen]] and [[Station (Australian agriculture)#Personnel|station hands]], with Dan Mulligan (the leading hand), disdainfully commenting "''We don't want any [[Swagman|swagmen]] here''". Saltbush and McGinness McGee also make [[Wiktionary:disparaging|disparaging]] remarks about Jim Ryan's horse, with Saltbush sarcastically asking Jim if he bought his horse from a [[Mark Foy's]] catalogue, and McGinness McGee commenting that it was more likely that the horse had been saved from a [[Animal glue|glue factory]].  John Conroy also comments that they have enough men working on the property already. Kate pleads with her father to give Jim a job at the property, and he finally relents, saying that Jim can help break the horses. John Conroy resents it when Jim Ryan says that he knows of a better way to break horses than the horse-breaking method being used at the property. However, John Conroy says that Jim could prove his expertise in horse-breaking by breaking the colt from Regret.  During the night, the [[Brumby]] herd gallops close to the homestead, and the colt from Regret breaks free from his tethers and joins them. John Conroy is furious at the loss of his prized colt, and unfairly blames Jim for what has occurred. Conroy decides to get all the crack riders (expert horse riders) from the stations near and far to muster at the homestead and hunt for the Brumbies, offering a reward of £1000, and angrily orders Jim to leave the property first thing in the morning.  The crack riders gather at the homestead the following morning, including Harrison, who made his fortune when Pardon won the cup (a reference to the President's Cup, a lesser known race held in Manindie, New South Wales). Another crack rider at the homestead was [[Clancy of the Overflow]] (who was a friend of Jim). Jim shyly turns up to join in the ride to hunt for the colt and Brumbies, but finds that, apart from his friend, Clancy, he is not wanted by anyone on the ride. Clancy convinces the others that, as both Jim and his horse were mountain-reared, they would be of great help in the ride.  The Brumbies are too quick for the riders and, when it becomes too steep and dangerous with [[wombat]] holes (burrows, where a horse could break a leg), all riders stop short of the dangerous descent &mdash; apart from Jim, who continues to chase the Brumby herd - finally bringing the herd (including the colt) back to John Conroy's property.  John Conroy is delighted to have his colt back again, and gives his approval to Jim marrying Kate. A concert and country dance, as well as a superb [[equestrianism|equestrian]] pageant, are then held in celebration and recognition of Jim's deed, and all ends happily.

The only problem is that they never told him they were coming.  However, luck is on their side because he will be going out of town that afternoon.  Uncle Benny forbids that there be any parties, saying that the last time he trusted a neighbor to house sit, they threw a wild party, and that he hates parties. Meanwhile, he is having an affair with a next door neighbor.  When Michelle and Brian get there, they meet the not-so-preppy Gloria, who is filling in as maid because her mother is sick. She immediately clashes with Michelle and Brianne.  Later, Michelle's nerdy cousin Denise flies out to Malibu. Although they don't get along all that well, Denise is happy to see her cousin Michelle. At this point, Michelle, Brianne, Denise and Gloria decide to team up and throw a party as a bet to see who could get more people to come. The teams are Brianne and Michelle against Denise and Gloria.  Randy and Jeff, two workers at a local hotel, get word of this. Randy is perceived as a "man whore", while Jeff is more of a sensitive guy. Jeff later meets Denise, and has an immediate attraction to her even though Randy refers to her as "plain" and an "ugly duckling."  Word of the party spreads quickly, and it soon becomes out of control. Randy (who had earlier been rejected by Michelle) goes after her again. She takes him upstairs, but leave him there naked, where he is later found [[masturbating]] by Denise and Jeff.  Before the party, while the girls were getting ready and giving Denise a makeover to make her less frumpy, they missed a call from Uncle Benny, saying he will be home early.  He comes home in the midst of the party, but has to sneak in because he refuses to pay the bouncer for his entry. He clears everyone out, and finds Michelle passed out with a hangover in his bed. He discovers that his neighbor, whom he was dating, knew about the party. She convinces him that the girls are just kids, and it is okay.  With the money they raised at the door, the girls pay for all the damages. In return, Uncle Benny buys all four of them tickets to Hawaii for next spring break, to ensure that they won't be back for more parties.

He elects to take Terry's punishment for him and is badly beaten by the hoodlums. Word of Jimmy's release soon reaches Donnie McGlone ([[James Cosmo]]), the [[Boss (crime)|crime lord]] he once served, and he is taken to McGlone's home by two henchman for a meeting with his former boss who tries to bring him back into his crew. Jimmy explains that he wishes to leave crime behind, see out the rest of his probation and move to [[Greece]] but McGlone suspects his reform is a feint to disguise personal ambition and has [[Detective Inspector|D.I.]] Walter "Pancho" Villers ([[Kenneth Cranham]]), a corrupt policeman with whom he is in league, rough Jimmy up in an attempt to gauge how much criminal mentality he has left. The villains also recruit the disillusioned Terry as a paid informant to report Jimmy's movements to them.  As part of his parole, Jimmy is forced to join a [[Passion Play]] run by Father Gabriel Flynn ([[Tom Georgeson]]) at the local church. Though reluctant at first, he soon commits to the project and embarks on something of a crusade to save people around him and bring them into the play; he forces Terry to go [[cold turkey]] after finding him shooting up in the toilets of [[The Garage (nightclub)|The Garage]] nightclub, and rescues abused prostitute Maria Gallagher (Jenny Foulds) from her brutal pimp Des Airlie ([[Gavin Mitchell (actor)|Gavin Mitchell]]), one of McGlone's men. This sparks a change of mood on the estate as two of Maria's fellow ex-prostitute friends seek refuge with Jimmy and the play, and the locals refuse to be mistreated by Donnie McGlone's gangsters.  In an attempt to halt his efforts, McGlone persuades Villers to arrest Jimmy on the grounds of pimping, claiming that he has in fact poached Airlie's girls and is now procuring them himself. However, when the police seek to apprehend him at the church hall, they find that he has organized an anti-crime movement and is holding a press conference. Jimmy sarcastically thanks Villers and his men for their assistance in helping the community in front of the local journalists and, fearing a loss of face, Villers backs off. The more defiant Jimmy and the local community become of organized crime, the more McGlone's gang try to break their spirit. Firstly, the church hall is firebombed and then Johnny "Bus Stop" ([[Tam White]]), a blind local musician, is killed in a vicious hit and run attack. Father Gabriel subsequently intends to disband the play, but Jimmy convinces him that the church group can raise enough funds to continue it by singing for charity at the local shopping centre. The group travel in a van ironically painted with the [[Ulster Banner]] which was given to them by Billy Maddison ([[Ron Donachie]]), an [[Ulster loyalism|Ulster loyalist]] gangster and old acquaintance of Jimmy, who wanted to assure the Catholic community that the church attack was not an act of [[sectarian violence]].  Incensed at Villers' failure to eliminate Jimmy, McGlone has his henchmen abduct him, give him what they think is a fatal heroin overdose and leave him for dead. He survives, however, and begins an escape to [[City of Sunderland|Sunderland]] in the church's van alongside Terry, Maria and Lenny Quinn, his longtime friend and a former employee of Donnie McGlone. In an act of betrayal, Terry informs McGlone of their journey who then sends his right-hand man Flex to make chase. Finally catching up to them at to the ''[[Angel of the North]]'' in [[Gateshead]], Flex shoots Jimmy dead but allows the others to live. In the closing scene, the church group is shown continuing with the Passion Play despite Jimmy's demise.

Leaving the club, Andre boards a bus and sees Silvia, wanting to make small talk, he promises to buy the robe at next opportunity.  Still believing that Cardoso is rich, André visits him at his place of work and finds that he sells junk for a living.

A relationship blossoms between André and Sílvia, and eventually, André asks for her hand in marriage. Sílvia says yes, however, André tells her that they cannot get married right away; André feels as though he needs more money in order to provide for Sílvia – more money than he can get from counterfeiting.

Meeting at a restaurant, and while the other party is not present, André learns that Silvia hates Antunes, who she believes isn't her real father, Antunes reveals to André that while he recognizes him, he will not turn André in nor does he want any of the heist money, but half of the lottery money.  Leaving the restaurant, André is accosted by Feitosa, who had been arrested earlier when he tried to spend some of the counterfeit money given to him by André but managed to get released quickly due to having underworld connections. Feitosa had figured out that André is the bank robber, having been questioned about the gun that he sold André, and demands the heist money. André agrees to pass the money to Feitosa the following day.   That night, Silvia confronts André, having learnt about his part in the bank heist from Antunes. André initially proposes to pay off Antunes with the heist money, but Silvia proposes to kill him instead.  The next day, André double crosses Feitosa and leads him into a trap, killing him. Later, André, Cardoso, Marinês and Silvia set a trap for Antunes. Initially, the plan goes awry, but they succeed in killing him and framing him for the bank heist.

Maqbool
 The film is based on William Shakespeare's ''Macbeth'', with the Mumbai underworld as its backdrop. Maqbool ([[Irrfan Khan]]) is the right-hand man of Jahangir Khan (alias Abba Ji) ([[Pankaj Kapur]]), a powerful [[Indian mafia|underworld don]]. Maqbool is grateful and feels a close connection and personal indebtedness to Abba Ji. Seeing their close relationship, but also sensing Maqbool's ambition, two corrupt policemen ([[Om Puri]] and [[Naseeruddin Shah]]) predict that Maqbool will soon take over the reins of the Mumbai Underworld from Abba Ji.    Nimmi ([[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]]) is Abba Ji's mistress, but she and Maqbool are secretly in love. Nimmi encourages Maqbool's ambitions and persuades him to kill Abba Ji to take over as Don. Maqbool is torn between his love for Nimmi and his loyalty to Abba Ji, but he begins to prepare the ground for becoming a Don, by ensuring that others in the line of succession cannot interfere. Finally, Maqbool murders Abba Ji in cold blood while he is in bed at night, with Nimmi next to him.  Maqbool gets away with the murder and takes over as Don, just as planned; but both he and Nimmi are haunted by guilt, seeing Abba Ji's ghost and unable to wash the blood from their hands. There is also suspicion, within the gang, of Maqbool's role in the death of Abba Ji, and eventually the lovers meet a tragic end.  In addition to the portrayals of the three tragic heroes, the film offers performances by supporting cast members, in particular [[Om Puri]] and [[Naseeruddin Shah]]. The two open the film in their roles as black comic relief corrupt police inspectors-cum-astrologers, predict the fall of Abba Ji—who has them on his payroll—and the rise and fall of Maqbool. Contrary to the original play, the corrupt cops are not just passive soothsayers. In an effort to sustain what they refer to as "balancing forces," they are also actively involved in shaping events, like aiding in providing information to Abba Ji's enforcers to wipe out a rival gang, using subtle nuances in coercing Maqbool to shift loyalties, deliberately botching an "encounter" attempt on Riyaz Boti (Macduff) and subsequently setting up an alliance between a rival politician (the incumbent one was backed by Abba Ji) and a fleeing Guddu (Fleance) and Riyaz Boti against Maqbool.

The Matrix Reloaded
 Six months after the events of [[The Matrix|the first film]], [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] ([[Keanu Reeves]]) and [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] ([[Carrie-Anne Moss]]) are now romantically involved. [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) receives a message from Captain [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]] ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]) of the ''Logos'' calling an emergency meeting of all of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]]'s ships. Zion has confirmed [[The Animatrix|the last transmission of the ''Osiris'']]: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Lock|Commander Lock]] ([[Harry Lennix]]) orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain in order to contact the [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]] ([[Gloria Foster]]). The ''Caduceus'' receives a message from the Oracle, and the ''Nebuchadnezzar'' ventures out so Neo can contact her. One of the ''Caduceus'' crew, [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]] ([[Ian Bliss]]), encounters [[Agent Smith]] ([[Hugo Weaving]]), who absorbs his avatar whilst killing him in the process. Smith then uses this avatar to leave the Matrix, gaining control of Bane's real body.  In Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. Neo receives a message from the Oracle and returns to the Matrix to meet her bodyguard [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]] ([[Collin Chou]]), who then leads him to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that it is his decision. The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix by finding the [[Keymaker (The Matrix)|Keymaker]] ([[Randall Duk Kim]]), a prisoner of the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]] ([[Lambert Wilson]]). As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted, and is now a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the Matrix, including other Agents, as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo as a host, but fails, prompting a battle between Smith's clones and Neo. Neo manages to defend himself, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers.  Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity visit the Merovingian and ask for the Keymaker, but the Merovingian refuses. His wife [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]] ([[Monica Bellucci]]), seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity, betrays him and leads the trio to the Keymaker. The Merovingian soon arrives with his men. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker escape, while Neo holds off the Merovingian's servants. Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker on the freeway, facing several Agents and [[Twins (The Matrix)|the Twins]], the Merovingian's chief henchmen. Morpheus defeats the Twins, Trinity escapes, and Neo flies in to save Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agent Johnson. In the real world, Zion's remaining ships prepare to battle the machines. Within the Matrix, the crews of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', ''Vigilant'' and ''Logos'' help the Keymaker and Neo reach the door to the Source.  The crew of the ''Logos'' must destroy a power plant to prevent a security system from being triggered, and the crew of the ''Vigilant'' must destroy a back-up power station. The ''Logos'' succeeds, while the ''Vigilant'' is bombed by a Sentinel in the real world, killing everyone on board. Although Neo asked Trinity to remain on the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', she enters the Matrix to replace the ''Vigilant'' crew and complete their mission. However, her escape is compromised by Agent Thompson, and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus, and the Keymaker try to reach the Source, the Smiths appear and attack them. The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source, allowing Neo and Morpheus to enter and escape from the Smiths, but the Smiths shoot the Keymaker dead while he tries to close the door to the Source. Neo enters a door and meets a program called the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]], the creator of the Matrix.  The Architect explains that Neo is an intentional part of the design of the sixth iteration of Matrix, designed to combine the anomalies and stop the fatal system crash that naturally occurs due to the concept of human choice. As with the five previous Ones, Neo can choose either to return to the Source with his unique code to reboot the Matrix and pick survivors to begin to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion, or cause the Matrix to crash and kill everyone connected to it; combined with Zion's destruction, this would mean mankind's extinction. Neo learns of Trinity's situation and chooses to save her instead. As she falls off a building, getting shot in the process, Neo flies in and catches her; Thompson is killed in the process. He then phases his hand into her body and removes a bullet from her body, restarts her heart and revives her from death. Back in the real world, Sentinels destroy the ''Nebuchadnezzar''. Neo displays a new ability to disable the machines with his thoughts, but falls into a coma from the effort. The crew are picked up by another ship, the ''Hammer''. Its captain, Roland, reveals the other ships were wiped out by the machines after someone activated an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] too early, and that they found only one survivor afterwards—revealed to be the Smith-possessed Bane.  
The Matrix Revolutions
  [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] and [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]] lie unconscious in the medical bay of the ship ''Hammer''. Meanwhile, Neo finds his digital self trapped in a virtual [[subway station]]—named, "Mobil Ave.", "mobil", being an anagram for "[[limbo]]"—a transition zone between the Matrix and the Machine City. In that subway station, he meets a "family" of programs, including a girl named Sati, whose father tells Neo the subway is controlled by the Trainman, an exiled program loyal to the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]]. When Neo tries to board a train with the family, the Trainman refuses and overpowers him.  [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]] contacts [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] and [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] on behalf of the [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]], who informs them of Neo's confinement. Seraph, Morpheus and Trinity enter [[Club Hel]], where they confront the Merovingian and force him to release Neo. Troubled by visions of the Machine City, Neo visits the Oracle, who reveals that [[Agent Smith|Smith]] intends to destroy both the Matrix and the real world. She states that "everything that has a beginning has an end", and that the war will conclude. After Neo leaves, a large group of Smiths assimilates Sati, Seraph and the unresisting Oracle, gaining her powers of [[precognition]].  In the real world, the crew of the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]'' and the ''Hammer'' find and reactivate [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]]'s ship, the ''Logos''. They interrogate Bane, who says that he has no recollection of the earlier massacre. As the captains plan their defense of Zion, Neo requests a ship to travel to the Machine City. Motivated by her [[Enter the Matrix|encounter with the Oracle]], Niobe offers him the ''Logos''. Neo departs, accompanied by Trinity. Bane, who has stowed away on the ''Logos'', takes Trinity hostage. Neo realizes that Bane has been assimilated by Smith and a fight ensues. Bane [[Cauterization|cauterizes]] Neo's eyes with a power cable, blinding him; however, Neo discovers an ability to perceive the world as golden light. Neo kills Bane, and Trinity pilots them to the Machine City.  Niobe and Morpheus set out for Zion with the ''Hammer'' to aid the human defenses against the Sentinels. In Zion, the fatally wounded [[Captain Mifune]] instructs [[Kid (The Matrix)|Kid]] to open the gate for the ''Hammer''. When it arrives, it discharges its [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]], disabling the Sentinels but also the remaining defenses. The humans are forced to retreat and wait for the next attack, thinking that it will be their last stand. Near the Machine City, Neo and Trinity are greeted by thousands of missiles which Neo attempts to destroy, but is overwhelmed by their numbers. The ''Logos'' is attacked by the Sentinels forcing them to fly above the missiles for a few seconds. They breach the cloud layer and see Earth's real sky, to which Trinity whispers the word "Beautiful". Upon descent, they lose control causing them to crash the ''Logos'' into the Machine City. The crash kills Trinity. Neo enters the Machine City and encounters "Deus Ex Machina", the machine leader. Neo, warning that Smith plans to conquer both the Matrix and the real world, offers to stop Smith in exchange for peace with Zion. The machine leader agrees, and the Sentinels stop attacking Zion.  The Machines provide a connection for Neo to enter the Matrix. Inside, the Smith with the Oracle's powers steps forth, saying that he has foreseen his victory against Neo. After a protracted battle, Neo—finding himself unable to defeat Smith—allows himself to be assimilated. The machine leader sends a surge of energy into Neo's body in the real world. Because Neo is connected to the Source, the energy surge causes the Neo-Smith clone and all other Smith clones in the Matrix to be destroyed; deleting Smith once and for all, though Neo's life is sacrificed in the process. The Sentinels withdraw from Zion, Morpheus and Niobe embrace, and Neo's body is carried away by the machines. The Matrix is rebooted, and the Architect encounters the Oracle in a park. They agree that the peace will last "as long as it can", and that all humans will be offered the opportunity to leave the Matrix. When questioned about Neo's fate, the Oracle tells Sati that she thinks they will see Neo again as Sati reveals she created a beautiful sunrise over the horizon in Neo's honor. Seraph asks the Oracle if she knew this would happen; she replies that she did not know, but she believed.  
Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World
 During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Captain Jack Aubrey of [[Her Majesty's Ship|HMS]] [[HMS Surprise (1796)|''Surprise'']] is ordered to fight the French [[privateer]] ''Acheron''. ''Acheron'' ambushes ''Surprise'', causing heavy damage, while remaining undamaged by the British guns. The ship's boats tow ''Surprise'' into a fog bank to evade pursuit. Aubrey's officers tell him that ''Surprise'' is no match for ''Acheron'', and that they should abandon the chase. Aubrey points out that the ''Acheron'' must not be allowed to plunder the British whaling fleet. He orders the ''Surprise'' refitted at sea, rather than returning to port for repairs. Shortly afterwards, ''Acheron'' again ambushes ''Surprise'', but Aubrey slips away in the night by using a decoy raft and ship's lamps.  Following the privateer south, ''Surprise'' rounds [[Cape Horn]] and heads to the [[Galapagos Islands]], where Aubrey is convinced that ''Acheron'' will prey on Britain's whaling fleet. The ship's doctor, Maturin, is interested in the islands' unique flora and fauna, and Aubrey promises his friend several days' exploration time. When ''Surprise'' reaches the Galapagos, however, they recover the survivors of a whaling ship destroyed by ''Acheron''. Aubrey hastily pursues the privateer, dashing Maturin's expectation of more time to explore.  ''Surprise'' is becalmed for several days. The crew becomes restless and disorderly. Midshipman Hollom, already unpopular with the crew, is named a "[[Jonah#Cultural influence|Jonah]]" by the sailors (someone who brings bad luck to a ship). As the tension rises, crew member Nagle refuses to salute Hollom on the deck, and is flogged for insubordination. That night, Hollom commits suicide by jumping overboard with a cannonball. The next morning, Aubrey holds a service for Hollom. The wind picks up again, and ''Surprise'' resumes the chase.  The next day, Marine officer Captain Howard attempts to shoot an albatross but accidentally hits Maturin instead. The surgeon's mate informs Aubrey that the bullet and a piece of cloth it took with it must be removed soon, otherwise they will fester. He also recommends the delicate operation be performed on land. Despite closing on ''Acheron'', Aubrey takes the doctor back to the Galapagos. Maturin performs surgery on himself using a mirror. Finally giving up the pursuit of the privateer, Aubrey grants Maturin the chance to explore the Galapagos islands and gather specimens before they head for home. While looking for a species of flightless cormorant, the doctor discovers ''Acheron'' on the other side of the island. Maturin abandons most of his specimens and hurries to warn Aubrey. ''Surprise'' readies for battle once more. Due to ''Acheron''s stronger hull, ''Surprise'' must be at close quarters to damage her. After observing the [[camouflage]] ability of one of Maturin's specimens, Aubrey disguises ''Surprise'' as a whaling ship; he hopes the French will be lured in to capture the valuable ship rather than destroy it. The ''Acheron'' falls for the disguise and ''Surprise'' launches her attack. With the back wheels of the cannons taken off, the cannons are able to fire upon the ''Acheron'''s mainmast while Captain Howard's Marine sharpshooters pick off the crew of the ''Acheron'' from above. The ''Acheron'' is disabled when the mainmast snaps and falls into the sea. Aubrey leads boarding parties, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat. Upon capturing the ship, Aubrey is informed by the ship's doctor that the French captain is dead and is given the Captain's sword.  ''Acheron'' and  ''Surprise'' are repaired; while ''Surprise'' remains in the Galapagos, the captured ''Acheron'' is to be taken to [[Valparaíso]]. As ''Acheron'' sails away, Maturin mentions that their doctor had died months ago. Realising the French captain deceived him by pretending to be the ship's doctor, Aubrey gives the order to change course to intercept the ''Acheron'' and escort her to Valparaíso, and for the crew to assume battle stations. Maturin is once again denied the chance to explore the Galapagos, but Aubrey wryly notes that since the bird he seeks is flightless, "it's not going anywhere", and the two play ''[[Musica notturna delle strade di Madrid]]'' by [[Luigi Boccherini]] as the ''Surprise'' turns in pursuit of the ''Acheron'' once more.  
Masked and Anonymous
 An iconic rock legend, Jack Fate ([[Bob Dylan]]), is bailed out of prison to perform a one-man [[benefit concert]] for a decaying future North American society. The film touches on many subjects from the futility of politics, the confusion of loosely strung government conspiracies, and the chaos created by both [[Anarchism|anarchy]] and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''-styled [[totalitarianism]]. It further reflects on [[life]], [[dream]]s, and [[God]]'s place in a seemingly increasingly chaotic world.  In some ways, the film is political: it describes how Fate sees the political landscape – people fighting for no reason, a nation without hope, governments that cannot be trusted – but at the same time Fate makes it clear that he "was always a singer and maybe no more than that". He produces no solutions to any of the problems the film presents. Rather, he makes it clear that he "stopped trying to figure everything out a long time ago."  
Matchstick Men
 Roy Waller is a con artist residing in Los Angeles with severe [[tourette's syndrome]] and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. Alongside his partner and protégé Frank Mercer, Roy operates a fake lottery, selling overpriced water filtration systems to unsuspecting customers. After Roy experiences a violent [[panic attack]], Frank suggests he see a psychiatrist, Dr. Harris Klein.  Klein provides Roy with medication, and in therapy has Roy recall his past relationship with Heather, his ex-wife who was pregnant during the time of the divorce. At Roy's behest, Klein informs Roy that he called Heather and found out that Roy has a 14-year-old daughter, Angela. Roy and Angela meet, and her youthful energy rejuvenates him. Roy thus agrees to work with Frank on a long-con: their target is Chuck Frechette, an arrogant businessman whom the pair plans to con with the [[Pigeon drop]].  One night, Angela unexpectedly arrives at Roy's house, saying that she has had a fight with her mother, and decides to stay for the weekend before returning to school. She explores his belongings and causes him to rethink his life, which he mentions during therapy with Klein. Angela returns home late one night, leading to an argument between the two. During dinner, Roy admits that he is a con artist and reluctantly agrees to teach Angela a con. The two of them go to a local laundromat and con an older woman into believing she has won the lottery, and she shares half of her expected winnings with Angela; however, Roy then forces Angela to return the money.  Roy goes bowling with Angela but is interrupted when Frank reveals that Chuck's flight to the [[Caymans]] has been updated to that day instead of Friday as planned. With little time left, Roy reluctantly chooses to let Angela play the part of distracting Chuck midway through the con; however, after the con is finished, Chuck realizes what has happened and chases the two into a parking garage before they escape. Roy then learns that Angela was arrested a year earlier, and asks that she stop calling him.  Without Angela, Roy's myriad phobias resurface, and during another panic attack, he ultimately learns that the medication given to him by Klein is a placebo. Roy proclaims that he needs Angela in his life but that he would have to change his lifestyle, much to Frank's disappointment. Roy and Angela return from dinner one night to find Chuck waiting for them with a gun, alongside a badly beaten Frank. Angela shoots Chuck and Roy sends her off with Frank into hiding until the matter can be sorted out. As Roy prepares to take care of Chuck's body, Chuck suddenly springs to life and knocks Roy unconscious.  Roy awakens in a hospital, where the police inform him that Chuck died from the gunshot and Frank and Angela have disappeared. Klein appears and Roy gives him the password to his large safety deposit box, ordering him to give the money to Angela when she is found. Later, Roy awakens to find that the "police" have disappeared, his "hospital room" is actually a freight container on the roof of a parking garage, "Dr. Klein's" office is vacant, and his very substantial cash savings have been taken. As he begins to realize that Frank pulled a long-con on him, Roy drives over to Heather's (whom he hasn't seen for years) looking for Angela. Roy learns the truth: Heather miscarried their child. There is no "Angela": the young girl he thought was his child was actually Frank's accomplice.  One year later, Roy has become a salesman at a local carpet store, which Angela and her boyfriend one day wander into. Roy confronts Angela, who is much older than he had thought, but ultimately forgives her, realizing that he is much happier as an honest man. Angela reveals that she did not receive her fair share of the cut from Frank, and that it was the only con she ever pulled. Angela says “I’ll see you,Dad” when she and her boyfriend depart. Roy returns home to his new wife Kathy, who is pregnant with his child.

The Medallion
 Eddie Yang ([[Jackie Chan]]) is a [[Hong Kong Police Force|Hong Kong police]] inspector co-operating with [[Interpol]] in the capture of a crime lord named AJ "Snakehead" Staul ([[Julian Sands]]). Snakehead procures an ancient book from a Chinese bookstore keeper, which tells the story of a boy being chosen every thousand years to bind the two-halves of a legendary medallion. In Hong Kong, Eddie and Interpol agent Arthur Watson ([[Lee Evans (comedian)|Lee Evans]]) lead a raid to capture Snakehead and his men, who are about to kidnap the boy, named Jai (Alex Bao). Eddie and the agents fight off Snakehead's men, infiltrating the temple containing Jai. Jai is saved but Snakehead eludes them. Two weeks later Snakehead captures Jai aboard a cargo boat in Hong Kong. Eddie and a team of Hong Kong police engage and defeat several of Snakehead's men, but Snakehead escapes with Jai to [[Dublin]], Ireland.  In Ireland, Eddie is assigned to help Interpol with the investigation, much to Watson's chagrin. Eddie is also reunited with his girlfriend, a British Interpol agent named Nicole James ([[Claire Forlani]]). By chance Eddie later encounters and apprehends one of Snakehead's top men, who confesses Jai is being held in the harbour. Eddie, Watson, and Nicole move to rescue Jai, defeating several Snakehead agents in the process. Eddie and Jai end up trapped inside a container, which is knocked into the water by one of Snakehead's men before they can be released. Eddie keeps Jai alive by finding an inflatable tent, and securely putting Jai inside but Eddie dies from drowning. After being rescued, Jai uses his medallion on Eddie's body.  In the morgue, Watson is grieving over Eddie's body and is prepared to say his last words, when Eddie suddenly appears beside him. Eddie realises Jai used the medallion to resurrect him, and his former body vanishes into nothingness. Jai splits the medallion into its two-halves, giving one of them to Eddie. Snakehead's men appear in the hospital to recapture Jai and during the fight, Eddie discovers the medallion has also granted him superhuman strength and immortality.  Nicole looks after Jai but he is captured again by Snakehead. At his castle hideout, Snakehead forces Jai to activate the medallion so he can gain its power, but with only one half of it, Snakehead only gains superhuman strength and remains mortal. To steal the other half, Snakehead and his men attack Watson's family. Watson's Chinese wife is revealed to be a police operative like him, much to Watson's surprise as he kept his job secret from his family. Together they fight off the attack from Snakehead's men.  Eddie, Watson, and Nicole learn the location of Snakehead's castle lair and go to finish him once and for all. The operation runs smoothly at first, but Snakehead kills Nicole and becomes immortal. He and Eddie engage in a vicious fight, until Eddie uses the medallion to take away the life it gave, which leads to the two dragons from the medallion appearing and taking Snakehead, which traps him in the medallion. Jai allows Eddie to use the medallion to resurrect Nicole, who also gains super-strength and immortality. The two then run at superhuman speed into the distance as Jai enters another dimension through a portal, frightening Watson.

Memories of Murder
    In October 1986, a young woman is found [[rape]]d and murdered in a ditch near a field. Soon after, another woman is found raped and murdered in a field. Local detective Park Doo-man, not having dealt with such a serious case before, is overwhelmed; key [[evidence]] is improperly collected, the police's investigative methods are suspect, and their [[Forensic science|forensic]] technology is near non-existent. Park claims he has a way of determining suspects by [[eye contact]]. He learns from his wife that a scarred [[Mental retardation|mentally handicapped]] boy, Baek Kwang-ho, resides in the town, and decides to question him first. He finds him and uses his eye contact method, instinctively thinking Baek is responsible. Park has his partner Cho beat confessions out of Baek and secretly record him talking about one of the murders.  Seo Tae-yoon, a detective from [[Seoul]], volunteers to assist them. However he and Park's methods apparently clash, and they get into a fight during a party. Seo looks at Baek's hands and deems them too weak and scarred to be able to commit such an elaborate crime, clearing his name. After more murders are committed they realize that the killer waits until a rainy night, and only kills women wearing red. A female police officer Kwon Kwi-ok realizes that a local radio station is always requested to play a particular song during the nights the murders are committed. Park continues to search for the killer, but finds nothing. At the latest crime scene, Park, Cho and Seo all arrive to investigate in different ways, but then a local man arrives, pulls out undergarments, and masturbates in a woman's red lingerie. Cho accidentally steps on a twig, prompting the man to run. They chase him into a crowd. Seo attempts to find a way to get everyone's attention, but Park identifies the man first after seeing him bend over and partially exposing the red lingerie underneath his pants. He uses his eye contact method once more, and has Cho apprehend him.  Park and Cho continue their tactic and brutally beat the man. Upon learning from a survivor of the killer that his hands were soft, Seo manages to clear the man as his hands are very rough. Infuriated that they lost their suspect, Park scuffles with Seo, until Kwon alerts them that the same song the murderer requested is playing. They realize it's raining, and arrive too late to find another woman murdered. Park and Seo and Cho decide to all work together. Upon doing an autopsy of the latest victim, they discover pieces of what looks like a peach in the body. Seo talks to a school girl about a possible suspect, and supplies her with a distinct bandaid after she gets a shot on her waist. They follow a trail of clues to a factory worker Park Hyeon-gyu who had only moved to the area a short time before the first murder. They track the song using documents (a source that Seo always trusts, saying, "The documents never lie.") to his address. The detectives are initially unable to pin anything on him. However, Seo notes that his hands are soft, like the survivor he questioned earlier had described. Hyeon-gyu begins to show discomfort when Seo presents the peaches, and thinks he's found the killer. Before he can question more, Cho loses control and beats Hyeon-gyu, prompting their superior to fire him.   Park and Seo listen to Baek's earlier confession to a previous murder. Seo points out that he talks as if someone else did it, and they realize he is a witness. They go to Baek's father's restaurant, only to discover a drunken Cho there. As people make fun of Cho on the TV, he beats everyone in the restaurant until Baek arrives and stabs Cho's leg with a rusty nail. Park and Seo chase Baek and question him, but he gets frightened and runs into the path of an oncoming train, where he is hit and killed.  Park learns that Cho's leg will have to be amputated, because the rusty nail caused [[tetanus]], leaving Park feeling guilty about what he had gotten his partner and best friend into.  They discover a trace of semen on one of the bodies, but because of lack of forensic technology, the sample has to be sent to the [[United States]] to confirm suspect Hyeon-gyu with [[DNA profiling|DNA evidence]].  Seo tries to follow Hyeon-gyu, but he dozes off and misses his chance. That night, Park's wife walks through the forest, watched by an unknown figure in the shadows, but a younger girl passes by and she is captured and killed instead. The next morning, her body is discovered. When Seo sees a bandaid on her waist, he recognizes her as the same school girl that he met on account of the murders and personalized with. Enraged at the loss of his new friend, Seo's frustrations finally flow over and he snaps. He attacks Hyeon-gyu, but Park brings documents from America regarding the semen sample. However, the papers state the sample does not match Hyeon-gyu's DNA. Seo decides to ignore the documents and chooses to believe Hyeon-gyu is the murderer. Seo attempts to shoot the suspect, but Park stops him and lets Hyeon-gyu go.  In the end, the crimes remain unsolved. While visiting the crime scene years later in 2003, Park Doo-man, now a businessman, learns from a little girl that the scene had recently been visited by another, unknown man, with a 'nondescript' face. The little girl had asked the man why he was looking at the ditch, and was told that he was reminiscing about something he had done there a long time ago. Park Doo-man, apparently having an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], looks directly at the screen; he uses his same method by making eye contact with the audience to search for (or actually find) the eyes of the killer sitting among them.  
Michel Vaillant (film)
 For decades, the Vaillant family has been successfully involved in various kinds of motor racing competitions. Their most notorious driver is Michel, the son of the team's founder and owner Henri and younger brother of Jean-Pierre, the team's manager. One night, Michel's mother Elizabeth has a nightmare involving his death in an accident at the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]], racing against a car bearing the number 13 from Leader, a team with which the Vaillants had a historic rivalry for more than a quarter of a century. Henri conforts her, assuring that they are not planning to race at Le Mans, that Leader has been out of competition for 5 years and that no one has ever used the number 13 at the race. Meanwhile, in [[Canada]], Michel and his best friend and teammate Steve Warson are both competing in [[World Rally Championship|WRC]] cars. Michel's victory spikes the wrath of Bob Cramer, a ruthless competing driver who is blocked by Vaillant's cars during the race. Cramer ends up threatening Michel's co-pilot, David. A few days later, Henri announces that Vaillant will have an engine at time for Le Mans, and promotes David to the driver's seat at the Rally of Italy, promising him a seat at Michel's car in the 24 hour race if he does well. In Italy, Cramer forces David out of the road, causing him to crash. David is caught in the car's explosion and dies. At the funeral, Michel meets Julie Wood, David's wife. She asks him for his husband's place at Le Mans, and Michel convinces his brother to let her on the team. Meanwhile, the Leader team returns to the competition, by the hand of Ruth, Leader's daughter. They announce that they will race at Le Mans with the number 13, hiring Bob Cramer as one of the drivers. Élisabeth worries that her nightmare can become a reality and tries to dissuade Henri from competing, but he refuses to do so. The weekend at Le Mans starts, and Ruth is determined to stop Vaillant from winning, so she sabotages the car delivery. The Vaillants barely make it on time to compete. This doesn't stop Ruth, and she kidnaps Henri, threatening to kill him if his team wins. Michel initially complies, losing a lot of time each lap. He finally tells Jean-Pierre about Ruth's plan and decides to go and save his father, asking Julie to pose as him during the race. Michel tracks his father's location through the GPS in Ruth's car, but she finds him. Michel is forced by Ruth to drive the Leader, posing as Bob Cramer after an accident puts him out of competition. Ruth and Michel find each other on the track and end up colliding violently, just like in Élisabeth's nightmare. Even though the crash was horrific, they both come out of the wreckage unharmed, and Michel goes with Steve and Julie to rescue Henri from Ruth's henchmen, who start shooting as they flee and injure Steve. The race ends with Steve's Vaillant crossing the line with a flat tire, inches before Leader's car, which had an engine failure and is being pushed by its driver. Unbeknownst to everyone, Michel was posing as Steve in the final laps. They all celebrate yet another Vaillant victory, while Ruth stares blankly in defeat.

Mickey's PhilharMagic
 The theater doors open. [[Mickey Mouse]] is performing with his PhilharMagic Orchestra at the Fantasyland Concert Hall. Inside, there are posters advertising the Concert Hall's past productions and performers, such as [[List of Disney's Hercules characters#Hades|Hades]] from ''[[Hercules (1997 film)|Hercules]]'', [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'', [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] from ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', Wheezy from ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', Willie the Whale from ''[[Make Mine Music]]'', [[The Three Caballeros]], [[The Big Bad Wolf (film)|The Big Bad Wolf]] and [[Three Little Pigs (film)|The Three Little Pigs]]. Upon entering the theater's lobby, guests pick up their "opera glasses" (3D glasses). During their wait, guests hear orchestral music from ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', ''[[Fantasia 2000]]'', and other Disney animated films.  [[Goofy]], the Concert Hall's stage manager, admits the guests into the main theater, where final preparations for the performance are underway. [[Minnie Mouse]] then tells the guests to put on their "opera glasses." Minnie then realizes that [[Donald Duck]] has gone missing and goes to tell Mickey. Goofy then raises the curtain to reveal that the stage is empty, except for a conductor's podium and Donald, who is sleeping in a box. Mickey races onto the stage in a hurry, quickly telling Donald to unpack the instruments. Mickey places his famous Sorcerer's hat on the podium, then leaves, telling Donald, "Don't forget the orchestra. And don't touch my hat!" [[File:Angry Donald.jpg|thumb|Donald seen at the exit of the Magic Kingdom version.]]  After Donald unpacks all the instruments, including a [[grand piano]], from the small box, he is tempted to try on the Sorcerer's Hat himself. He does so, which causes the magical instruments to come to life and play an extremely unpleasant melody. However, when Donald picks on and taunts a small [[flute]], the other instruments rise up against him, creating a chaotic whirlwind of magic and music. Donald loses the hat in the storm and passes through different scenes from different movies while trying to retrieve the hat. After the whirlwind passes, Donald finds himself in the dark with [[List of Disney's Beauty and the Beast characters#Lumière|Lumière]], the candelabra, who begins to sing "[[Be Our Guest]]" from Disney's ''Beauty and the Beast''. Guests can smell the food, triggering hidden smell cannons in the theater, and when the bottles pop, they feel a quick blast of wind in their faces surrounded by cakes, which triggers hidden air cannons in the back of the seats. The dark comes back for a second. When the light focuses, the guests find themselves in ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'', where Donald has shrunk. The walking brooms come in, spilling water on Donald. Guests feel the water on their laps, which triggers hidden water sprayers in the back of the seats. A broom Donald's size comes in, carrying a big bucket. Donald snatches the bucket away, but only gives it back when a giant broom comes in. The giant broom spills water on Donald, taking guests to ''The Little Mermaid'', where Ariel is singing "[[Part of Your World]]" from Disney's ''The Little Mermaid''. At the end of the song, an electric eel shocks Donald while trying to kiss Ariel. Guests are now in ''The Lion King'', where [[Simba]] is singing "[[I Just Can't Wait to Be King]]" from Disney's'"The Lion King". After that, guests go to ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', where the chorus is singing "You Can Fly" from Peter Pan. Peter sprinkles pixie dust on Donald, which gives him the ability to fly. Finally, guests go to ''Aladdin'', where [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] and [[Princess Jasmine|Jasmine]] are singing "[[A Whole New World]]." This time, Donald retrieves the hat, by Jasmine placing it on his head. Unfortunately, the hat gets knocked away by [[Iago (Aladdin)|Iago]], and Donald jumps after it. He encounters the magical whirlwind from earlier. Donald gets sucked inside, finding himself back onstage, still in the whirlwind. Mickey returns, puts on the hat, and uses its powers to restore order. As Mickey conducts the orchestra, Donald gets stuck in a tuba, which launches him across the theater so that he lodges headfirst in its back wall. Donald, in audio animatronic form, is stuck in a hole in the back of the theater. Only his legs are visible. After struggling from falling in, he eventually falls into the hole and is no longer seen. In the end, Goofy tells the audience to return their "opera glasses" in the bins outside of the theater and says goodbye to the viewers.  
The Middle of the World (2003 film)
 Romão ([[Wagner Moura]]) and Rose ([[Cláudia Abreu]]) are a poor couple living in [[Paraíba]] and in search of a job that pays R$1,000 a month, the sum Romão believes to be the minimum necessary for him to feed his children. They decide to make a trip by bicycle to Rio de Janeiro with their five children: teenager Antônio (Ravi Ramos Lacerda); children Rodney (Manoel Sebastião Alves Filho), Clévis (Felipe Newton Silva Rodrigues) and Suelena (Cícera Cristina Almino de Lima); and newborn Cícero (Cícero Wesley A. Ferreira).  Along the way, they make some money washing cars and performing [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]] songs. They also give a chance to some promising opportunities, but all of them fail. They are first offered a job by a criminal, who warns them that he can only give work for "sons of a bitches". They are later promised jobs by Severino, a councilman of [[São Bento, Paraíba|São Bento]], but since it takes too long for him to fulfill it, they decide to leave.  Later, they pray by the [[Statue of Father Cícero]] in [[Juazeiro do Norte]], where Romão hears an announcement about the "table of Padre Cícero", one that will grant a blessing for the one who manages to lift it. Romão gives it a try, lifts it, but faints just afterwards. Later, they meet a lone traveler called Gideão (Cláudio Jaborandy), who tells them to go to [[Filadélfia, Bahia|Filadélfia]] and search for Neguiça ([[Fábio Lago]]). That night, Antônio and Clévis find a church nearby and accidentally smash a cash box full of money. Antônio gives in to temptation and takes all the bills. In Filadélfia, the family meets Neguiça, who offers them shelter, but says he has no jobs. Antônio tries to go to the local night party, but flees as soon as he gets there, unable to feel comfortable.  In [[Feira de Santana]], Antônio goes to the local [[bus terminus]] and buys tickets to Rio de Janeiro for everyone. When his parents ask where he got the money, Antônio admits it was taken from the church and Romão tears all the tickets apart. Later, the family stumble upon Panamá ([[Sidney Magal]]) and Callado (Franciolli Luciano), a pair looking for men, women and children from all ages for a "great opportunity", with no skills required. Romão reluctantly agrees and convinces Panamá to allow him to take the bikes with them on the truck that'll take them to the opportunity, as well as three members of the family that weren't selected for the job.  The opportunity turns out to be a fake [[Pataxó people|Pataxó]] [[quarup]] ritual in a club in [[Porto Seguro]], where Romão and three of his children are dressed as supposedly legit Pataxó and Panamá poses as a foreign entertainer, owner of a park called Caminho das Nuvens (the original title of the film; could be translated as "Path of the Clouds"). Antônio sneaks in the club and when Romão sees him, he leaves the place mid-ritual, and so do his children. Frustrated, he orders Rose never to arrange them such jobs anymore.  Still in Porto Seguro, Antônio meets Sereia ([[Carol Castro]]), who is giving out some Caminho das Nuvens flyers. Soon after, he meets Neguiça and Gideão again, and they take him to a local party, where he meets Sereia one more time and takes an [[Instant camera|instant picture]] with her. The morning after, Rose reprehends him for disappearing without any warning and he announces he will stay in Porto Seguro. Romão accepts and leaves with the rest of the family. That night, he searches for Sereia, but she is hooking up with Panamá. Antônio spills some beverage on Panamá's face, and Sereia responds by pushing him to the ground. Later, he meets his family again by case.  Upon arriving in the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]], Romão arranges Antônio a job as a [[bricklayer]] in a city far from Rio de Janeiro. He agrees to stay and says the real last goodbye to his family. As Romão and his family arrive in Rio de Janeiro, they visit the [[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]] and Romão asks a man for directions to [[Brasília]]. Rose listens to it and says she is definitely not going back to the road.  
A Mighty Wind
 The film is a [[mockumentary]] about a memorial concert for fictional folk music producer Irving Steinbloom. Upon his death, his children organize a concert, which they hope to feature his three most famous acts: The Folksmen, The New Main Street Singers, and Mitch & Mickey.  [[The Folksmen]] trio — Mark Shubb ([[Harry Shearer]]), Alan Barrows ([[Christopher Guest]]), and Jerry Palter ([[Michael McKean]]) — were once the most popular of the acts but have not appeared together in decades. They had several minor hits, and their most famous song was "Old Joe's Place." Despite not playing or seeing each other for many years, their reunion (a cookout) is a very positive affair as the Folksmen give each other big hugs and are happy to see one another.  The New Main Street Singers are the second generation of the original Main Street Singers, formed by George Menschell ([[Paul Dooley]]), the only living member of the original group. Menschell sings and holds a guitar he cannot play. Performers include Terry Bohner ([[John Michael Higgins]]) and his wife Laurie Bohner ([[Jane Lynch]]). Laurie, a former [[pornographic film|adult film]] star, and her husband are founders of Witches in Nature's Colors (WINC), a coven of modern-day [[witch]]es that worships the power of color. Another member is Sissy Knox ([[Parker Posey]]), a former juvenile delinquent and daughter of one of the original Main Street Singers.  They are managed by Mike LaFontaine ([[Fred Willard]]), whose fifteen minutes of fame came by way of a failed 1970s [[sitcom]], ''Wha' Happened?''. The show lasted for less than one season and has largely been forgotten, but LaFontaine is constantly quoting the titular [[tagline]] to the puzzlement of others. The group, which is otherwise entirely white, includes one [[Filipino Americans|Filipino American]] member, Mike Maryama (played by [[Mark Nonisa]]), and is known for their needlessly complex nine-part harmonies.  Mitch Cohen ([[Eugene Levy]]) and Mickey Crabbe ([[Catherine O'Hara]]) comprised Mitch & Mickey, a former couple that released seven albums until their dramatic break-up years before the setting of the film. Mickey seemingly moved on and has married a medical supply salesman, but Mitch had an [[nervous breakdown|emotional breakdown]] and has never fully recovered. Their most famous song was "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow," at the end of which the pair would kiss on stage.  The three groups, which had sunk to various levels of musical irrelevance since their respective heyday, agree to the reunion performance, to be held at [[The Town Hall]] in New York and televised live on PBN (a reference to [[PBS]]). The film features rehearsals for the show along with interviews with the performers discussing their activities over the previous years and their feelings about performing again. The Folksmen are very enthusiastic, and work hard to relearn their songs, and hope to wow the audience.  Mitch and Mickey (particularly Mitch) are very apprehensive about how it will go.  The show itself goes off with only two hitches: The song that The Folksmen intend to open their set with is played first by the New Main Street Singers (a song called "Never Did No Wanderin'", which the Folksmen sing in a rugged, emotional manner consistent with the spirit of the song, while the New Main Street Singers perform it in their usual peppy, upbeat way), and Mitch temporarily disappears minutes before he and Mickey are to perform. It turns out that Mitch had gone to buy a rose for Mickey, which she accepts with gratitude as they go on stage. Mitch and Mickey perform "A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow", and after a suspenseful pause, they do the much-anticipated kiss at the end. In the finale, all three acts join together to sing "A Mighty Wind."  The film then jumps to interviews with many of the performers six months after the concert in which they detail subsequent events. Mickey is performing "The Sure-Flo Song" (about a medical device used for bladder control) at her husband's [[trade show]] booth. Mitch is writing poetry again, claiming to be in a "prolific phase." Mickey claims that Mitch overreacted to their onstage kiss, while Mitch insists that Mickey's feelings for him returned.  LaFontaine is trying to drum up interest for a sitcom starring the New Main Street Singers. He wants to call it "Supreme Folk" and have each play Supreme Court judges by day, folk singers sharing a house by night. The Folksmen have reunited, but with Mark Shubb now a [[transgender]] woman, she continues to sing in her deep bass voice.  
The Missing (2003 film)
 In late 19th-century New Mexico, Samuel Jones reappears hoping to reconcile with his adult daughter Magdalena "Maggie" Gilkeson. She is unable to forgive him for abandoning the family and leaving her mother to a hard life and early death. This situation changes when Pesh-Chidin and a dozen of his followers (who have left the reservation) pass through the area, ritualistically killing settlers and taking their daughters to be sold into sex slavery in Mexico. Among those captured is Maggie's eldest daughter, Lilly. Maggie's rancher boyfriend Brake Baldwin was among the settlers killed.   The [[U.S. Cavalry]] refuses to help retrieve the captive women as its resources are tied up conducting forced relocation of captive [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. This leaves Maggie, her father, and her younger daughter Dot alone in tracking the attackers. The group unexpectedly meets up with Kayitah, a [[Chiricahua]], and an old friend of Jones, who also happens to be tracking the attackers with his son Honesco, because among the captives is a young Chiricahua woman who is engaged to Honesco. After the two agree to join the group, and Maggie treats Honesco's injuries, Kayitah informs Maggie that Jones had been a member of their Chiricahua band where he gained the name Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan ("shit for luck") during his wanderings.  It is finally with the combined efforts of the two families that they are able to free the women, at the cost of Kayitah's life, and immediately flee to the mountains with the kidnappers behind them. Knowing they have no other choice but to stand their ground, the group fights off the remaining kidnappers. During the battle, Jones fights El Brujo, the one responsible for kidnapping his granddaughter. When Brujo attempts to kill Maggie with a shotgun, Jones sacrifices his life to save his daughter as both he and Brujo fall off a cliff to their deaths. Maggie shoots at the last remaining kidnappers to scare them off. She realizes her father's love for her and finally forgives him.  Then she goes home with her father’s body, her daughters and the other kidnapped girls.  
The Miracle of Bern
 Richard, a coal miner from [[Essen]], returns after eleven years of being a [[German prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|Soviet prisoner of war]] in [[Siberia]]. In the meantime, his wife, two sons, and one daughter have reached a minimum standard of living without him. When he is unexpectedly repatriated in 1954, he has severe problems in reintegrating himself with his family and country. His wife is running a small business, his elder son has become a [[Communism|Communist]] challenging his father's ideals of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] time, his daughter flirts with British soldiers who are his former enemies, while his 11-year-old son Matthias, who never knew his father, admires a local football hero instead, [[Helmut Rahn]] of [[Rot-Weiss Essen|Rot-Weiß Essen]].  While Richard is initially very stern about Matthias' love for football, he gradually softens such that, on the night before the final game, father and son drive to Bern to see the match.  An additional plot of the movie is the personal triumph of Helmut Rahn, for whom Matthias becomes a lucky mascot. Rahn, nicknamed "The Boss", has a successful record at club level, though is rarely chosen to play at national level in trainer [[Sepp Herberger]]'s team.  A third more light-hearted comic relief story line revolves around the fictional sports reporter Paul Ackermann and his wife, who travel to the World Cup despite their fundamentally different views on the importance of football.  There are several miraculous events in the film. For Richard, it is the sudden joy of scoring a goal with an abandoned football. For Rahn, it is seeing Matthias on the sideline that spurs him into scoring the winning goal. For Sepp Herberger, however, the miracles are more mundane: the sudden rain that slows down the Hungarians (however, German captain [[Fritz Walter]] tended to perform better in stormy conditions), but not so much the Germans fitted with [[Adolf Dassler]]'s revolutionary screw-in football studs. For all Germans, it's the unexpected euphoria of a win that heals many wounds, becoming a symbol of the ongoing economic "miracle".

Mona Lisa Smile
 In 1953, Katherine Ann Watson ([[Julia Roberts]]), a 30-year-old graduate student in the department of [[Art History]] at UCLA and Oakland State, takes a position teaching "History of Art" at [[Wellesley College]], a conservative [[Women's colleges in the United States|women's]] [[Private school|private]] [[liberal arts college]] in [[Massachusetts]]. At her first class, Katherine discovers that her students have already memorized the entire textbook and syllabus, so she uses the classes to introduce them to Modern Art and encourages discussion about topics such as what makes good art. Katherine comes to know her students and seeks to inspire them to achieve more than marriage to eligible young men.  Betty Warren ([[Kirsten Dunst]]) is highly opinionated and outspokenly conservative. Betty doesn't understand why Katherine is not married and insists that there is a universal standard for good art. She writes editorials for the college paper, exposing campus nurse Amanda Armstrong ([[Juliet Stevenson]]) as a supplier of contraception, which results in Amanda being fired; another editorial attacks Katherine for advocating that women should seek a career instead of being wives and mothers as intended. Betty can't wait to marry Spencer ([[Jordan Bridges]]) as their parents have arranged and expects the traditional exemptions from attending class as a married woman: Katherine insists she will be marked on merit and attendance, resulting in more conflict.  Connie Baker ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]) begins dating Betty's cousin, Charlie ([[Ebon Moss-Bachrach]]) but Betty persuades her that he is only using her as his parents have arranged for him to marry Deb MacIntyre.  Connie ends the relationship, believing Betty's story to be true. However, some weeks later, Connie and Charlie reconnect, with Charlie saying he has already decided for himself that he is not going to marry Deb, so he and Connie get back together.  Joan Brandwyn ([[Julia Stiles]]) dreams of being a lawyer and has enrolled as pre-law, so Katherine encourages her to apply to [[Yale Law School]].  She is accepted, but decides not to go because she wants to start a life with her new husband Tommy ([[Topher Grace]]).  She tells Katherine that choosing to be a wife and mother does not make her any less intelligent.  Giselle Levy ([[Maggie Gyllenhaal]]) has several lovers and liberal views about sex. She admires Katherine for encouraging the students to be independent. Giselle earned the enmity of Betty, whose conservative views conflict with her liberal ones.  Katherine declines a proposal from her California boyfriend ([[John Slattery]]) because she doesn't love him enough and begins seeing the Wellesley Italian professor, Bill Dunbar ([[Dominic West]]). Bill is charming and full of stories about Europe and his heroic actions in Italy during the war. He has also had affairs with students (including Giselle), and Katherine makes him promise that it will never happen again. The relationship progresses but when Katherine learns that Bill spent the entire war at the Army Languages Center on Long Island, she decides to break up with him because he is not trustworthy. Bill responds that Katherine didn't come to Wellesley to help the students find their way, but to help them find her way.  Within six months of the wedding Betty's marriage falls apart as Spencer has an affair and failing to find solace with her mother, she visits Katherine. Eventually, influenced by her, Betty files for divorce and looks for an apartment in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. When Mrs. Warren confronts Betty for what she's done, she reveals her frustration with her mother for not supporting her when she went to her for help when she found out about Spencer's affair and that the only person who cared about her was Katherine. Therefore, Betty reveals she's going to have a life of her own, has applied to [[Yale Law School]] and will room with Giselle.  Katherine's course is highly popular, so the college invites her to return but with certain conditions: she must follow the syllabus, submit lesson plans for approval, keep a strictly professional relationship with all faculty members, and not talk to the girls about anything other than classes. Katherine decides to leave in order to explore Europe. In the final scene, Betty dedicates her last editorial to Katherine, claiming that her teacher is "an extraordinary woman who lived by example and compelled us all to see the world through new eyes." As Katherine's taxi speeds up, all her students follow on their bicycles and Betty is seen struggling to keep up with the taxi as a last effort to thank Katherine for changing her life.  
Moon Child (2003 film)
 In the year 2014, Japan suffers a major economic collapse and people are forced to emigrate to mainland China. The movie introduced the story with two vampires, Kei and Luka, of whom the first was probably made a vampire by the former, and in later Kei's flashback is revealed that Luka decided to end his existence by watching the sunrise. Three orphaned boys live in a fictional Chinese city called Mallepa, a 'melting pot' of different Asian groups. They are named Shō (Gackt), Shinji (Susumu Terajima) who is Sho's brother, and Toshi (Tarô Yamamoto). All three survive through pickpocketing. During a theft gone wrong, Sho meets Kei (Hyde) - a vampire who appears to be a young man - sitting amidst a pile of debris and brings him back to the orphan's hideout. When the orphans are attacked by a man they previously robbed Kei attacks, kills, and feeds off of their attacker thereby revealing his status as a vampire to the orphans. However, Sho approaches him, unafraid.  Several years later, Sho is in his twenties, leading a band of thieves consisting of Kei and Toshi. During one of the robberies against another gang, they cross paths with a Taiwanese named Son (Leehom). Son is going after the gang because their leader raped his sister, Yi-Che (Zeny Kwok). Sho, Kei, Son and Toshi all become friends, and Sho quickly and awkwardly falls in love with Yi-Che though it is implied that she in turn harbors feelings for Kei. Toshi is murdered by the local mafia for helping Sho and Kei in their heists by using drugged pizza to sedate their targets. Soon, through this experience, Son and Yi-Che learn that Kei is a vampire.  Nine years later, Kei has left the band and Sho is head of his district in Mallepa and is married to Yi-Che. Son has joined Mr. Chan, the leader of the opposing mafia of Mallepa and is now Sho's enemy. Kei, who is revealed to be in prison for murder, makes several death sentence pleas; Sho goes to visit him in prison after seeing a news report about him on TV. During Sho's visit at the prison, he reveals to Kei that he had to propose to Yi-Che several times before she agreed because she was really in love with Kei. The couple now have a daughter together whom they named "Hana". After spending the entire conversation in silence, Kei states that he feared Sho, who had been reckless, was dead and that he is glad he is not.  Yi-Che develops a fatal cancerous brain tumor. Soon after the diagnosis, Sho's men are killed on the streets in broad daylight while Sho is away. Sho's brother, Shinji, is also killed when he points at gun at Mr. Chan while in a drug induced haze. Sho calls Kei and begs him to return. After speaking to Kei he is told that Kei had been sentenced to death, something Kei had actually requested. Kei, however, escapes his execution and returns to help his friend. Sho asks Kei to turn Yi-Che into a vampire so she will be around for the sake of Hana (their young daughter). Kei refuses angrily, but agrees to face Mr. Chan with Sho. He promises Sho that if anything happens to him, he will take care of Hana.  When they go to face Mr. Chan, Mr. Chan is shot by two of his own while Sho faces off with Son. Their battle comes down to a 'count to three and shoot' match when they are both down to only one bullet. Sho's gun misfires and he is shot in the chest by Son. Kei arrives on the scene and Son faces his own death by pointing his empty gun at Kei, who is enraged at the sight of his injured friend and fires at Son. Kei goes to Sho, who appears to die dramatically in Kei's arms.  In 2045, Hana is grown up and heading off to college. She says goodbye to Kei, who raised her in Sho's absence and it is implied that she is aware of Kei being a vampire. Before she leaves she mentions the feeling of someone watching her, and after her departure Sho appears as a vampire, thanking Kei for taking care of her all these years because he couldn't face what he had become. Together the two men drive to the beach and await the rising sun together to face death. The movie concludes with the entire gang back together at the beach in the daylight (something not possible for Kei in the past), presumably reunited in the afterlife or as reincarnations of themselves in another life.  
Momentum (2003 film)
 Physics professor Zach Shefford ([[Grayson McCouch]]) has regarded his [[telekinetic]] gifts as a curse rather than a blessing. This sentiment is obviously not shared by ruthless [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] agent Raymond Addison ([[Louis Gossett Jr.]]), who recruits Shefford for a dangerous mission in which his "second sight" talents will be taxed to the utmost. It seems that, back in 1977, Addison had overseen Project Momentum, wherein dozens of telekinetics were brought together ostensibly for the purpose of benefiting mankind. But the project got out of hand when the participants' powers became too powerful and deadly, forcing Addison to kill them all.  However, one of the participants, Adrian Geiger ([[Michael Massee]]), managed to escape, and is now at large, with a vast telekinetic army at his beck and call. It is Shefford's job to infiltrate Geiger's camp and finish the job that Addison had started. Upon falling in love with fellow telekinetic Tristen Geiger ([[Nicki Aycox]]), Shefford finds that his loyalties are wavering—and begins to suspect that the villains in this particular melodrama may in fact be the heroes, and vice versa.  [[FBI]] agents Jordan Ripps ([[Teri Hatcher]]) and Frank McIntyre ([[Carmen Argenziano]]), who have been investigating an armored-car hijacking, follow Zach to Geiger. A telekinetic tug-of-war leads to a psychic showdown at the complex where Project Momentum was developed. Zach must finally choose the side to be on when telekinetic war breaks out. With Tristen prepared to follow in her father's footsteps and telekinetic sleeper cells in place across the nation, the momentum is building.  
Monster Man (film)
 Adam ([[Eric Jungmann]]) and Harley (Justin Urich) drive across the country so Adam can tell his ex-girlfriend he still loves her before she gets married. After an encounter with a hearse, the two stop at a pub. They see a monster truck rally on TV and Harley mocks the people watching it. As they are driving away, a giant [[monster truck]] drives them off the road. Later on, they have to siphon gasoline from an abandoned RV. However, it is revealed that the RV has a mutilated body inside and the RV is surrounded by truck tracks that form a [[pentagram]]. Adam sees the strange-looking driver and Harley urinates in the cab of the monster truck before they speed away. At a hotel, Adam and Harley wake up with roadkill in their beds; they find a hitchhiker named Sarah ([[Aimee Brooks]]) sleeping in the backseat when they get to the car. Sarah eventually has sex with Adam.   Later, they witness the monster truck run over a man, and they meet a man missing an arm who tells them the creature in the monster truck takes people's limbs, but lets the victims live. Afterwards, the three drive through a [[ghost town]] with many scarecrows. They find a diner at the end of the town and begin to eat, but Adam finds they are eating human flesh. They panic and run away. After being chased by the man in the monster truck, their car is destroyed. Adam, Harley, and Sarah run into the woods and the man follows them. He finally catches up with them and shoves Harley into a tree, supposedly killing him, and kidnaps Sarah. Adam follows him to a shack covered with pentagrams, severed limbs, and a man whose entire middle section has been crushed. Adam finally finds Sarah and tries to escape, but Sarah knocks him unconscious. Sarah and the man, Bob, are brother and sister. They tie Adam to a table while the "corpse" with the crushed midsection, Fred, explains that Bob accidentally ran him over, crushing his midsection and sending Bob through the windshield. Sarah says she stitched Fred up and used black magic to bring him back to life. Fred explains that they can use other people's limbs to add to his own body as long as the donor stays alive and they could only transfer entire bodies if the body was prepared correctly.   Sarah says that they needed someone easy to prepare and Adam was the right person. Previous events begin to make sense to Adam. Everything that happened to Adam and Harley before was preparing Adam so that Fred could have his body: stepping into a pentagram with a mutilated body, sleeping with roadkill, Sarah having sex with him, and eating human flesh. Adam manages to escape and kills Sarah by slashing her throat. He also cuts Fred in half when he gets up and starts to attack him. Meanwhile, Bob locks the door.  Outside, Bob chases Adam, but is run over by his own monster truck driven by Harley. Harley remarks he was [[Apparent death|playing dead]] and apologizes to Adam for everything he did to him since the beginning of the film. He offers Adam the chance to drive Bob's monster truck, to which Adam happily agrees. Adam then runs over Bob with the monster truck repeatedly for hours. In the end, Adam thanks Harley for not only his help but the whole trip calling him a good friend. When Harley mentions finishing the trip to Betty-Ann's wedding, Adam gives up on getting Betty-Ann to fall in love with him, and with that Harley then decides to get some food with Adam and they drive away.

Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.
 Murli Prasad Sharma ([[Sanjay Dutt]]), nicknamed Munna Bhai (literally Brother Munna), is a ''bhai'' or ''gunda'': a good-natured [[Crime boss|don]] in the [[Mumbai underworld]]. Given that his father had wished him to be a medical doctor, he creates the [[wikt:faux|faux]] Sri Hari Prasad Sharma Charitable Hospital (named after his father) and pretends to live in accordance with this wish whenever his father ([[Sunil Dutt]]) and mother ([[Rohini Hattangadi]]) visit him in [[Mumbai]].  One year, however, Munna's plan goes awry when his father meets an old acquaintance, Dr. Asthana ([[Boman Irani]]) and the two older men decide to betroth Munna to Asthana's daughter, Dr. Suman "Chinki" ([[Gracy Singh]]). At this point the truth about Munna is revealed. Asthana insults Munna's parents and calls them "fools" for being ignorant of Munna's real life. Munna's father and mother, aghast and later heartbroken, leave for their village.  Munna, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Ashthana is to become a doctor. He decides to go to a medical college to obtain an [[Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery#India|MBBS]] degree.  With the help of his right-hand man Circuit ([[Arshad Warsi]]) and others, Munna "gains admission" to a medical college, where he again encounters Dr. Asthana, who is the dean. His success there becomes dependent upon the (coerced) help of faculty member Dr. Rustam Pavri ([[Kurush Deboo]]).  While Munna Bhai's skills as a medical doctor are minimal, he transforms those around him with the "Jadoo Ki Jhappi" ("magical hug")&nbsp;– a method of comfort taught to Munna by his mother&nbsp;– and the compassion he shows towards those in need. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, Cartesian, impersonal, often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Munna constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic, almost holistic, regimen. To this end, he defies all convention by treating a brain-dead man called "Anand bhai" (Yatin Karyekar) as if the man were able to perceive and understand normally; interacts on familiar but autocratic terms with patients; humiliates school bullies; effusively thanks a hitherto underappreciated janitor; and encourages the patients themselves to make changes in their lives, so that they do not need drugs or surgery.  Dr. Asthana, who perceives all this as symptoms of [[Chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]], is unable to prevent it from expanding and gaining ground at his college. He becomes increasingly irrational, almost to the point of insanity. Repeatedly, this near-dementia is shown when he receives unwelcome tidings and he begins laughing in a way that implies that he has gone mad. This behaviour is explained early on as an attempt to practice "laughter therapy", an attempt that seems to have backfired&nbsp;– Asthana's laughing serves more to convey his anger than diffuse it. Meanwhile, his daughter becomes increasingly fond of Munna, who in his turn becomes unreservedly infatuated with her. Some comedy appears here, because Munna is unaware that Dr.Suman and his childhood friend "Chinki" are one and the same; an ignorance that Suman hilariously exploits. Asthana tries several times to expel Munna but is often thwarted by Munna's wit or the affection with which the others at the college regard Munna, having gained superior self-esteem by his methods. Asthana keeps a challenge that Munna can stay in college only if he passes the exam under his supervision. Munna and other mates accept it. Meanwhile, cancer patient Zaheer ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) is in a dying state seeking help from Munna. But unfortunately he dies in Munna's arms.  Eventually, Munna is shamed into leaving the college: his [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] over not being able to help Zaheer gets the better of him. In the moments immediately following Munna's departure, Anand miraculously awakens from his vegetative state; at this point Suman gives a heartfelt speech criticising her father for having banished Munna, saying that to do so is to banish hope, compassion, love, and happiness from the college.  Asthana eventually realises his folly. Munna later marries Dr. Suman, learning for the first time that she is "Chinki". The medical college&nbsp;– under Rustam Pavri's management since Asthana's retirement&nbsp;– begins to imitate Munna's radical methods of treatment. Munna and Suman open a hospital in Munna's home village, where they implement Munna's ideas daily. This, in addition to the birth of their offspring, earns Munna the nickname "Munnabhai&nbsp;– M.B.B.S.&nbsp;– Miya Biwi Bachhon Samet" (literally "Husband Wife with Children"). Munna's parents reconcile with him. His sidekick Circuit marries and has a son, who is nicknamed "Short Circuit". As the film concludes, Anand, restored to normal mental health, narrates the story to children as he is about to leave for [[Kolkata|Kolkata, West Bengal]].

Once Duncan's work is done for the afternoon, his father dismisses him. He visits Perry, who has a cut on his lip from his abusive father. Perry takes him swimming in a lake below a support bridge he comes to relax in. Duncan touches Perry's arm when he is distracted by a train above them, to which he first reacts with resentment, but then eases up. Back at the farm, Perry asks about Duncan's parents, and talks about his lack of a role model growing up. Duncan then shows Perry a way his mother taught him to soothe a chicken by putting its head into his mouth. Perry shames him for it, and goes home. After moving hay bales, Duncan goes with Perry's friends to an outdoor party. Perry is later watched by Duncan while receiving fellatio from April. After the party, they examine his mother's belongings in the barn. Perry convinces him to put on his mother's wedding dress as a joke, which he does reluctantly.

In the morning, Duncan stops digging a plot and is reprimanded by his father for his behavior. His father resorts to burning his wife's things. At night, Duncan meets Perry in a tractor where Perry says they shouldn't be hanging out anymore. Duncan asks if he thought about kissing him, before Perry angrily does so. Duncan kisses him again, but more affectionately. Perry calls him a "faggot" and tells him to stay away. Perry's father confronts him when he comes home late, and beats him. At the convenience store, Perry and his friends steal Duncan's chicken and taunt him with it. Perry, who is seen with bruises, gives it back and tells him to put the chicken's head in his mouth. He does this, and while being insulted and tormented, he bites off the chicken's head. His father sees him coming home with the dead chicken, to which he responds by hugging him as Duncan breaks down in tears.

He is unsure how to act in this role, but as time progresses their relationship matures into an affectionate one.  Lao Yu is not the most dependable of men, however.  He gambles, engages in small-time black market business transactions, and spends a great deal of time at a bar associating with other men who live similar lives.  This culminates finally in his arrest, and he spends some time in prison.  In his absence, Xiao Yu graduates from high school and begins her university studies, and begins living with her boyfriend, a hot-tempered student from [[Hunan]].  When her father is released, he finds his relationship with his daughter strained, due in no small part to her frustrations over his absence and lack of dependability, along with his fatherly concerns about her living arrangement.  She and her boyfriend leave Beijing for [[Shanghai]], where she becomes pregnant.

Mystic River (film)
 Three boys, Jimmy Markum, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle, play hockey in a [[Boston]] street in 1975. Spotting wet concrete, they start writing their names into it when a car pulls up with two men, pretending to be police officers.  One gets out and berates the boys for their actions, and tells Dave to get into the car. The men hold Dave captive and [[child sexual abuse|sexually abuse]] him for four days, until he escapes.  Twenty-five years later, the boys are grown and, while they still live in Boston, have drifted apart. Jimmy is an ex-con running a neighborhood store, while Dave is a [[blue-collar]] worker, still haunted by his abduction. The two are still neighbors and related by marriage. Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter Katie is secretly dating Brendan Harris, a boy Jimmy despises. She and Brendan are planning to run away together to Las Vegas.  Katie goes out for the night with her girlfriends and Dave sees her at a local bar. That night, Katie is murdered, and Dave comes home with an injured hand and blood on his clothes, which his wife Celeste helps him clean up. Dave claims he fought off a mugger, "bashed his head on the parking lot", and possibly killed him. Sean, now a detective with the [[Massachusetts State Police]], investigates Katie's murder. His pregnant wife, Lauren, has recently left him.  Over the course of the film, Sean and his partner, Sergeant Whitey Powers, track down leads while Jimmy conducts his own investigation using his neighborhood connections. Sean discovers that the gun used to kill Katie was also used in a liquor store robbery during the 1980s by "Just Ray" Harris, the father of Katie's boyfriend. Harris has been missing since 1989, but Brendan claims he still sends his family $500 every month. Brendan also feigns ignorance about Ray's gun but Sean believes it was still in the house. Sergeant Powers suspects Dave as a possible perpetrator because he was one of the last people to see Katie alive. He also has a wounded hand and, although he continues to tell his wife he got it while being mugged, he tells the police a different story—soon Jimmy becomes suspicious of it. Dave continues to behave strangely, which upsets his wife to the point she is afraid he will hurt her. While Jimmy and his associates conduct their investigation, Dave's wife eventually tells Jimmy about Dave's behavior, the bloody clothing, and her suspicions.  Jimmy and his friends get Dave drunk at a local bar. When Dave leaves the bar, the men follow him out. Jimmy tells Dave that he shot "Just Ray" Harris at that same location for ratting him out and sending him to jail. Jimmy informs Dave that his wife thinks he murdered Katie and tells Dave he will let him live if he confesses. Dave repeatedly tells Jimmy that he did kill someone but it was not Katie: he beat a child molester to death after finding him having sex with a child prostitute in a car. Jimmy does not believe Dave's claim and threatens him with a knife. When Dave finally admits to killing Katie thinking he can escape with his life, Jimmy kills him and disposes of his body in the adjacent Mystic River.  While Dave is being killed, Brendan (having found out about his father's gun during questioning) confronts his younger brother Ray Jr. and his brother's friend John about Katie's murder. He beats the two boys and threatens to kill them if they do not admit their guilt, but when John takes the gun and is about to shoot him, Sean and Powers arrive just in time to stop it.  The next morning, Sean tells Jimmy the police have Katie's murderers—who have confessed. She was killed by Brendan's brother, "Silent Ray" Harris, and his friend John O'Shea in a violent prank gone wrong: The kids got hold of Just Ray's gun and saw a car coming which happened to be Katie's. John aimed the gun just to scare her but the gun went off by accident. The car veered onto the curb and Katie got out and ran into the park. Silent Ray and John pursued her so she wouldn't tell anyone. The beating Katie received was from Silent Ray, who had a hockey stick. Once she was beaten, John shot her again, killing her. Sean asks Jimmy if he has seen Dave, because he is wanted for questioning in another case, the murder of a known child molester. A distraught Jimmy thanks Sean for finding his daughter's killers, but says, "if only you had been a little faster." Sean asks Jimmy if he's going to "send Celeste Boyle $500 a month too?"  Sean reunites with his wife and his daughter Nora, after apologizing for "pushing her away". Jimmy goes to his wife, Annabeth, and confesses. She comforts him and tells him he is a king and kings always make the right decision. At a town parade, Sean sees Jimmy, and mimics shooting him, to let Jimmy know he is watching.

Inside the truck, Hank and Earl find the [[Ford Econoline|thieves' van]]. After a brief [[shootout]] with the thieves, Hank and Earl drive the van out of the truck and escape. Inside the van are what look like ordinary [[beer keg]]s; Hank has them examined by a friend who works at a [[foundry]], who informs them that the kegs are actually made of an atomic [[aerospace materials|aerospace alloy]], which is worth millions. Hank takes the van and the kegs to the house of his ex-girlfriend Denise. They broke up after Hank was arrested, and Hank orders Earl to tell Denise the truth about the "assault." Earl promises, but when he sees that Denise is an attractive woman (and, like himself but not Hank, black), he breaks his promise and starts hitting on her, by [[victim playing|playing the victim]] again, which causes another fight between them, leading to her throwing both of them out of the house. After a heated argument, Hank brutally [[punch (combat)|punches]] Earl in the face, before storming off. Later, Earl and Hank are cornered by police, learning that they are suspects in the bridge shootout. After they escape, Hank realizes that the thieves must have an inside man in the police department to help them frame the duo for the shootout.  That night, after tracing the van's owner to an address, Hank and Earl [[stakeout|stake out]] the place, but Earl rushes inside on his own and is confronted by Nash. Hank gets Earl to safety, but Earl is shot in the leg and forced to lend Hank his favorite gun, "[[Glock 17|Earl Junior]]" after Hank uses up the ammunition in his own gun. When Hank takes Earl to Denise to get his wound treated (which turns out to be a graze), a bee flies into the house and Earl runs for cover, making Denise realize that Hank's story about the "assault" on Earl was actually true. She punches Earl for lying and imprisoning Hank, and reconciles with Hank (which was cut from the final film, possibly for time constraints.)  Based on something overheard from Nash, they follow him to a meeting at a yacht club and witness him talking to McDuff, who is revealed to be Nash's inside man. Hank and Earl share everything they know with Hank's former boss, Lieutenant Washington (at various points of the conversation, Earl asks Washington for one of his [[potato chip]]s, but Washington continuously refuses), and then pretend to approach McDuff, offering to sell him back the "beer kegs" for $1 million. However, Nash overhears their plans and takes Washington hostage first. During the confrontation the next day, Earl and Hank meet with McDuff, Nash and their men near the coast, rescuing Washington and accidentally starting a shootout, but the trio manage to kill or apprehend most of Nash's gang, including McDuff. Hank survives a gunshot wound while Earl fights Nash. Eventually, Hank kills Nash by dropping a [[lifting hook]] onto an unstable slab of rock that Nash is standing on, [[catapult]]ing him into the [[ocean]].  Six more months later, in honor of their heroic actions, Hank is reinstated in the LAPD and Earl is admitted to the force, and they are made partners a short time later. The two encounter a situation similar to where they met, in which a man is apparently locked out of his car. Earl helps the man, but learns afterwards that the man is actually stealing the car from a lady who is shopping. While attempting to stop the man by shooting out the car's tires with Earl Junior, Earl accidentally destroys the car, much to the lady's anger and dismay.

 In 1974, Rod Blue is a surfer with shoulder-length hair in [[Sydney, Australia]] who also stages rock concerts, unsuccessfully most of the time. Needing a big idea, he decides to fly to [[Los Angeles]], make himself more presentable and try to persuade [[Frank Sinatra]] to come to Australia to sing.  Sinatra takes a liking to the kid, overhearing him express why Sinatra's music means so much to him and to everyone. With his lawyer Mickey Rudin and right-hand man [[Jilly Rizzo]] in assent that a trip like this would be a good thing at this point for the singer's career, Sinatra agrees to go.  At the airport in Australia, members of the media ask blunt and impolite personal questions as soon as Sinatra and his companion, [[Barbara Marx]], step off their private jet. One of the prying reporters is Hilary Hunter, who angrily claims that Sinatra or someone in his entourage spat on her as they went by.  Rod and his new assistant, Audrey Appleby, who has known him since their youth and long had a crush on him, do their best to make Sinatra's party comfortable in the penthouse of a Sydney hotel. Audrey strikes up a fast friendship with Barbara, who praises Sinatra as a lover but doesn't wish to rush him into marriage.  Before going to [[Melbourne, Australia|Melbourne]] for the tour's first show, Rod suggests to Sinatra that the Australian press can be very sensitive to criticism, so the singer should try to avoid the subject. Doing it his own way as usual, Sinatra proceeds to further insult the woman reporter from the airport, calling her nothing more than a "two-dollar whore." A restaurant needs to be his way, too, with its chef insulted by Barbara's meddling about how Frank's food needs to be prepared.  Trade unions instantly react. Banding together, they decide to cut off all services to Sinatra immediately, including food, drink and maid service at his hotel. Newspapers mock the singer with headlines like "Frankie, Go Home," but even that is problematic, inasmuch no one is willing now to supply fuel for his jet, either.  An apology is demanded, but the best Sinatra is willing to do is permit Rudin to try to work out a satisfactory compromise with [[Bob Hawke]], the trade union's leader (and Australia's future prime minister). Audrey, meantime, becomes furious at finding Rod kissing reporter Hilary, after which Rod gets into a bloody fistfight with Sinatra's sidekick, Rizzo, who refuses to release tapes of the concert that Rod has already pre-sold.  It is ultimately proposed that Sinatra will do a benefit concert for the trades people, but as soon as he gets back on stage, rather than apologize for calling the reporter a two-dollar hooker, he says: "I overpaid." Enjoying himself nevertheless, the singer calls Barbara up to the stage, introducing her to Australia as "the girl I'm going to marry."

Noi the Albino
  Nói Kristmundsson is a 17-year-old living in a small unnamed remote fishing village in western [[Iceland]] with his grandmother Lína ([[Anna Friðriksdóttir]]). His father Kiddi ([[Þröstur Leó Gunnarsson]]), an alcoholic taxi driver, also lives in town, but Nói appears to have a distant relationship with him. As an [[alopecia totalis]] his appearance is strikingly different from others in the village. Much of his time is spent either wandering the desolate town, at the town bookstore, or in a hidden cellar at his grandmother's house, which serves as his private sanctuary. The town is a sort of purgatory for Nói, surrounded by mountains and attainable only by boat during the winter, when the roads through the mountain passes are snowed over. There are signs that Nói is highly intelligent, but he is totally uninterested in school and seems to have an adversarial relationship with the faculty, particularly his math teacher. More often than not he cuts class to go to the local gas station, where he frequently breaks into the slot machine and rigs it for an assured jackpot. The bleak town seem to offer few prospects for the future, and Nói doesn't seem to fit in there.  Things begin to change for Nói when he encounters the new gas station attendant, an attractive young woman who is new to the village. He asks about the new girl to Óskar ([[Hjalti Rögnvaldsson]]) the bookstore owner, who informs him that she is his daughter Íris ([[Elín Hansdóttir]]), up from the south to escape the city, and to stay away from her. Nói instead begins a tentative romance with Íris. One night they break into the local natural history museum, and are almost caught by a night watchman. They hide in a storage closet, where they discover a light-up map of the world. Nói comments that Iceland looks like a spitwad on the map, and Íris suggests that they run away together. Nói asks where, and Íris suggests he press a button on the map and the Hawaiian Islands light up. This is when Nói begins to dream of leaving the village and Iceland altogether. He receives a [[View-master]] as a present from his grandmother, which comes with slide disc of tropical island images. He is particularly transfixed with an image of a tropical beach, the total opposite of his immediate surroundings.  One day at school, he is asked by the principal to meet with a specialist. The specialist asks him a series of questions, including "How many times a day do you masturbate?" Nόi responds by asking the specialist the same question, simultaneously solving a [[Rubik's Cube]]. The specialist becomes embarrassed, states that he is the one asking the questions, and gives him an [[Intelligence_quotient#Current_tests|IQ test]] to complete. Later, Nói uses a tape recorder to take his place in math class, which enrages the teacher. The teacher goes to the principal, insisting that Nόi is a disruptive influence and must be expelled immediately. The principal is hesitant, but he is forced to expel Nόi after the teacher gives the ultimatum that either Nόi goes or he will resign. Nόi angrily leaves the school, knowing that his father will be upset with him. He tells him, and a small altercation between them results. Afterwards his father takes him out to a local bar, where he is kicked out for smuggling liquor and underage drinking. He goes to Óskar's house in search of ĺris, climbing up onto the roof, where he is discovered by Óskar. Óskar tells him he's sent her back, at which point Íris comes down the stairs. Íris insists that Nói stay the night, over Óskar's objections.  His grandmother goes to a local fortune teller, Gylfi ([[Kjartan Bjargmundsson]]), and requests that he give Nói a fortune reading, to maybe give him some direction. Nói is working as a grave digger at this time, and goes to see Gylfi on a lunch break. After [[Tasseography|reading the tea leaves]], Gylfi becomes visibly upset, informing Nói that his future is filled with death. Nói, thinking that Gylfi is teasing him, calls him a moron and leaves.  Soon after, Nói leaves his job, getting his grandmother's shotgun.  He attempts to rob a bank, but is thwarted when the bank teller doesn't take him seriously and has the gun taken out of his hands by the bank manager, who angrily pushes him out on the street. He comes back inside the bank thoroughly humiliated and withdraws all of the money in his account, using it to buy a nice suit. He then steals a car, intending to run away with Íris. She is confused by his arrival and instead looks blankly at him. He realizes that she is not coming with him, and leaves. His car becomes stuck in the snow, and he is quickly apprehended by the police. His father bails him out of jail and takes him home. On the way back they stop at the gas station, where Íris is pumping gas. The father comments that she seems to have gained weight, a ploy he has taught to Nói as a sure way to get women to sleep with you. Nói shrinks down in his seat, embarrassed.  Nói arrives home and descends into his cellar sanctuary. Suddenly, the earth shudders violently, and the light goes out. Nói finds his lighter and tries to escape out of the cellar, but is unable to open the overhead door, and lies down on the floor, watching his lighter until the fuel runs out. He is eventually awoken by the door above him being ripped open. He discovers that there was an [[avalanche]], which has destroyed the house and killed his grandmother and father. At a rescue shelter, he watches the news report and discovers that nearly everyone he knows has been killed in the avalanche, including Íris. Gylfi, his prophecy fulfilled, has also perished. He later returns to the rubble of his grandmother's house to retrieve the View-Master. The movie ends with Nói looking at the tropical beach scene slide as it slowly becomes a vision of a real tropical beach.

Dave is fired from his job after his girlfriend frames him for [[embezzlement]], Andrew is falsely accused of attempted [[sexual harassment|child molestation]], and their house is to be demolished by day's end. Both of them hide inside the house as police, city officials, and outraged neighbors surround it.  Dave and Andrew open their front door and discover that the entire world beyond their house is gone, replaced with a featureless white void.  Eventually, after a simple test reveals that the nothingness surrounding them holds a flat, featureless, and somewhat springy surface "like tofu", they set out across the empty plane in order to explore their new surroundings, leaving items behind as a means of getting back.  After running out of items to leave as a trail, they lose track of their path.  Wandering leads them to what appears to be another house, but they have simply wandered back home.  Panic begins to set in again when Andrew realizes that the house is completely out of food.  Andrew glances around the room, eventually stopping and glaring at a noisy clock on the wall; within a few seconds it disappears.   Andrew drops a stack of overdue bills in front of Dave, and within seconds the bills abruptly disappear. Dave puts one last theory to test, managing to hate away his need for food.  Dave still expresses some concern over Andrew's remaining phobias, questioning why the phobias still exist when there is nothing left to fear.  Reluctantly, Andrew reveals that he was abused and tormented by his parents as a child.  With some urging from Dave he hates away the memory of each traumatic childhood event as he recounts it; when he is finally done he is no longer phobic and much more confident in himself.  Unfortunately this change alters Andrew's personality and leads to friction between the two friends, finally building into an outright confrontation.  They decide they can no longer share the same house, and opt to determine who keeps it by playing a match of their favorite fighting game.  Dave loses, and is exiled with his possessions to reside out in the nothingness.  Things become very tense with Dave's departure.  Dave attempts to engage Andrew in conversation repeatedly, even performing the national anthem for his self-created nation (its borders marked by a line of his possessions), all to no avail.  After several days Dave comes into Andrew's house much happier and explains his sudden change of mood: he has hated away his anger at Andrew; all Andrew needs to do is hate away his anger at Dave and things will be back to normal.  Andrew refuses, quite content to be angry at Dave.  Dave hates away his anger several times as Andrew rebuffs and outright insults him, but his patience finally wears thin, leading Dave to hate away one of Andrew's possessions.  Andrew retaliates by hating away one of Dave's possessions, and the situation escalates until everything including the house is hated away.  Dave walks away, assuming the argument is finished, but falls over suddenly as his feet begin to disappear; Andrew is hating them away.  He turns and retaliates, hating away Andrew's legs, and the situation escalates again until all that is left of the two are their disembodied heads.  Refusing to give up the fight, Andrew and Dave manage to turn themselves and (by bouncing) charge at each other, headbutting each other repeatedly until they finally stop, exhausted.  Their anger abated, Dave and Andrew make up, agree to be best friends again, and set off to explore the nothingness.  As they bounce away into the white void they remark how they both had always thought that their bodies were somehow holding them back.  In a [[post-credits scene]], an obviously older Dave and Andrew – still disembodied heads – are sleeping when they are awakened by a popping sound, followed by a loud clamoring of voices and noise.  As the unseen source of the clamoring gets louder and closer the two scream.

Outdoors, in any town square, in a park or in the city's most commercial street, Alfredo and his troupe NOVEMBER start the show: demons to provoke passers-by, displays of social conscience, actions taken to the extreme to put the forces of law and order on full alert.

Later, he moves into a house located near the campus of the fictional Harrison University in [[Upstate New York]].  Mitch's other friend Bernard ([[Vince Vaughn]]) throws a housewarming party at Mitch's house, dubbed Mitch-A-Palooza, which is a huge success. Frank gets drunk and is seen [[streaking]] by his wife Marissa and her friends, putting a strain on their new marriage. The following morning, the trio run into an old acquaintance whom they used to ridicule at school: Gordon Pritchard ([[Jeremy Piven]]), who is now the college dean. He informs them they must vacate the house because it's exclusively for campus housing. Bernard proposes starting a fraternity that is open to anyone to meet the housing criteria. The new fraternity carries out several [[hazing]] events throughout campus, attracting the attention of Pritchard and other faculty members.  At a birthday party for one of Bernard's children, Nicole brings her boyfriend Mark and Mitch later walks in on him in the bathroom as he's hooking up with another girl. While initially discreet, Mitch is forced to recount the incident to Nicole when Mark lies that the girl was with Mitch instead of himself. Later, the oldest fraternity member, Blue, has a heart attack and dies during a "[[K-Y_Jelly|KY lube]] wrestling" match with two college girls at his birthday celebration.

By video, he claims that the group is violating university policies, subjecting the students in the non-sanctioned fraternity to expulsion.  Mitch learns that the group has the right to bypass the Pritchard's ruling if all of their members complete various activities to prove their legitimacy. Frank is able to defeat [[James Carville]] in a debate session. Next, the fraternity successfully navigates its way through an academic exam largely due to the assistance of two of Mitch's co-workers, who help everyone cheat. In the school spirit evaluation, the fraternity loses points when Frank unsuccessfully attempts to jump through a ring of fire while dressed as the school mascot. Badly burned and humiliated, Frank rallies to give a strong performance in the floor exercise routine of the gymnastics competition. Bernard manages to complete the rings routine, leaving only the vault exercise remaining. Pritchard chooses Weensie, an obese member of the fraternity, to perform the vault. Amazingly, Weensie executes a perfect landing, allowing the fraternity to pass gymnastics.  The fraternity completes the activities with an 84% average. However, Pritchard tells them that their average has dropped to a failing 58% after accounting for the absence of Blue. While the students are in despair, Megan arrives with tape recorded evidence of the Pritchard's bribery. After a chase throughout campus, Frank obtains the tape and uses it to get Pritchard fired. The fraternity's charter is reinstated and moves into Pritchard's former residence.  Nicole visits Mitch as he's moving out of the old fraternity house, and tells him she dumped Mark after catching him cheating. The two reconcile, intent on moving their relationship forward.  Mitch and Bernard decide to withdraw from the fraternity. Frank, now divorced, takes over the leadership role.  In the closing credits, Mark accidentally drives his car over a bridge and lands on Pritchard, who is fly fishing. The car explodes, killing them both. Meanwhile, Frank runs into Heidi at a grocery store, who invites him to her house to hang out with her "internet friends." He excitedly accepts.

Meanwhile, single mother Senga and her 15-year-old daughter Natasha 'Nat' are on a six-hour overnight drive home, following a visit to Marek, Nat's father, for her birthday. En route, they pass by the crash, and Senga notices a strange man and woman photographing the scene; as Senga watches them, the man turns his camera and photographs her.   Unnerved and exhausted, Senga nearly falls asleep while driving, and decides to stop at a [[truck stop]] diner. Outside, Nat meets a young female backpacker and offers her a ride. Senga is visibly disturbed by the backpacker and the strange [[ambient music|ambient]] CD she plays in the car. They drop her at a picnic area and when they return seconds later to return the CD she left behind, she seems to have disappeared. Shortly after, Nat convinces her mother to return to the diner, so that she can get her birthday present from her father. Already stressed from the long drive, Senga is furious when she discovers that Marek has bought Nat tickets to a concert that she has refused to allow her to attend. After a heated argument, Nat gets into an [[RV]] with the backpacker and a strange couple.  Senga solicits the assistance of a police officer, but when she seems unhelpful, goes after the RV herself, tailing the officer who had just left the diner. The police officer meets up with the inhabitants of the RV. Senga breaks into their RV and discovers a number of strange things, including thermoses full of blood and videos of young girls talking about their past lives. She escapes the RV before anyone returns, but once back on the road, The Backpacker reveals herself to be hiding in the backseat. She strangles Senga, causing her to crash.  In the back of an oil tanker, Nat parties with the Backpacker and a young man, who tell her about their group and their enigmatic leader. Senga is woken by the recovery man, a disturbed drifter who cruises highways in his tow truck, who insists that Senga come with him. In his car, she finds a picture of a girl she saw in a video in the RV. The recovery man informs Senga that the girl is Christine, his dead sister. Senga is taken to a police station, where she reports Nat's disappearance. The police are less than helpful, and, in frustration, she asks them to call Marek. The man who answers Marek's phone tells the police that Senga is on medication, and that Nat has been with him all weekend.  Back at the truck stop, Senga sees the man and woman she had seen earlier photographing the car accident. As her paranoia mounts, she suspects them to be involved with Nat's disappearance, and attacks the woman, resulting in her being kicked out of the diner. While hiding in a hallway, she encounters the woman with two male cult members, and flees outside. As they leave the truck stop, the recovery man follows them in his truck; Senga follows behind, ending up at an abandoned research facility.  While Nat meets the Father, the recovery man detonates a bomb, killing several of the cult members. Before the Father can initiate Nat, Senga attacks him. Mother and daughter flee in different directions, with Senga being pursued by the backpacker and Nat being placated by the Father, who uses a loudspeaker to talk to her. During the fight, the Father reveals that Senga wanted to have an [[abortion]] when she discovered she was pregnant with Nat. The shock of this revelation leaves Senga in a near [[catatonic]] state.  The recovery man pulls her out of her stupor by showing her Marek's body. Senga uses this information to try to demonstrate to Nat how evil her new friends are. While mother and daughter try to escape, the recovery man and the Father wrestle; when the Father bites the recovery man's tongue and spits it out, Senga detonates his last bomb, killing them both. Senga and Nat leave, continuing their drive home in daylight. When they stop at a gas station, they return to their car to find a razor blade &mdash; the Father's calling card &mdash; attached to the rear view mirror.

Once Upon a Time in Mexico
 El Mariachi is recruited by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Sheldon Sands to kill General Emiliano Marquez, a corrupt [[Mexican Army]] officer who has been hired by Mexican drug lord Armando Barillo to assassinate the [[President of Mexico]] and overthrow the government. Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past. Furthermore, AFN operative Ajedrez is assigned by Sands to tail Barillo.  While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down. Sands' assistant, Cucuy, originally hired to keep an eye on El Mariachi, instead tranquilizes El Mariachi and turns him over to Barillo, also offering to reveal the details of Sands's plan. Cucuy, however, is promptly killed by Chambers while El Mariachi escapes from captivity and calls his friends Lorenzo and Fideo to assist him in his mission.  While monitoring Barillo's activity outside a hospital, Ramírez notices armed men storming the building and follows suit. He discovers that a group of doctors have been gunned down and Barillo has bled to death as a result of a botched [[plastic surgery|facial reconstruction]], but realizes that the corpse on the operating table is a [[body double]] before he is knocked out and kidnapped by the real Barillo and Ajedrez, who reveals herself to be Barillo's daughter. Sands realizes his mission has been compromised, but is too late, as he is captured by Barillo and Ajedrez — who drill out his eyes before sending him out. Despite his blindness, he manages to gun down a hitman tailing him with the aid of a chiclet boy.  As the village celebrates the [[Day of the Dead]] during the President's visit, Marquez and his army storm in and attack the presidential palace. Marquez's troops, however, are met with resistance from not only the President's bodyguards, but the villagers and the Mariachis. Sands had instructed El Mariachi to allow the President to be killed before attacking Marquez, but the Mariachis, agreeing that the President is a good man, intervene early and protect him.  Marquez enters the presidential palace, only to once again confront El Mariachi, who shoots out his kneecaps before finishing him off with a headshot. Ramírez, who was released from captivity by Chambers, faces Barillo. After Barillo guns down Chambers, Ramírez and El Mariachi kill the drug lord. Sands manages to shoot the sadistic Ajedrez dead outside the presidential palace. Ultimately, Lorenzo and Fideo walk away with the cash that Barillo was using to pay Marquez, and escort the president to safety. Ramírez says goodbye to Sands and walks away, having avenged his partner's death. El Mariachi then gives his share of the cash to his village before walking into the sunset.  
Oldboy (2003 film)
 In 1988, a businessman named Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik) is arrested for drunkenness, missing his daughter's fourth birthday. After his friend Joo-hwan (Ji Dae-han) retrieves him from the police station, they go to a phone booth for Dae-su to call home. While Joo-hwan is talking to Dae-su's wife, Dae-su is kidnapped, and wakes up in a sealed hotel room where food is delivered through a trap-door. By watching the television, Dae-su learns that his wife has been murdered and that he is the prime suspect. Dae-su passes the time shadow-boxing, planning revenge, and attempting to dig a tunnel to escape.  In 2003, 15 years after he was imprisoned, and just before digging himself to freedom, Dae-su is hypnotized and wakes up on a roof-top with a suit. After interacting with a jumper on the rooftop, Dae-Su tests his fighting skills on a group of young thugs and is mysteriously handed a cell phone and money by a beggar. He receives a taunting phone call from his captor, who refuses to explain the reason for his imprisonment. Later he collapses at a sushi restaurant and is taken in by Mi-do (Kang Hye-jung), the restaurant's young chef. After he recovers, Dae-su tries to find his daughter and the location of his prison. He discovers that his daughter was adopted by a Swedish couple, and gives up trying to contact her. Dae-su locates the Chinese restaurant that made food for his prison, and finds the prison by following a delivery man. Apparently it is a private prison where people can pay to have others incarcerated. Dae-su enters the prison and tortures the warden, Mr. Park, who doesn't know the identity of Dae-su's captor but reveals that Dae-su was imprisoned for "talking too much." While leaving the prison, Dae-su is attacked by a large number of guards but manages to defeat all of them.  Dae-su's captor, a wealthy man named Lee Woo-jin (Yoo Ji-tae), contacts Dae-su again and gives him the following ultimatum: if Dae-su discovers the motive for his imprisonment within five days, then Woo-jin will kill himself. Otherwise, Woo-jin will kill Mi-do. As Dae-su and Mi-do become intimate, they have sex. Meanwhile, Joo-hwan tries to contact Dae-su with some important information about Woo-jin's sister, but is murdered by Woo-jin, who was secretly following him. Dae-su eventually recalls that he and Woo-jin had gone to the same high school, and that he had witnessed Woo-jin committing incest with his own sister. After Dae-su told his classmates about the event, Woo-jin's sister committed suicide, leading a grief-stricken Woo-jin to seek revenge. Back in the present day, Woo-jin cuts off Mr. Park's hand, fulfilling an earlier threat by Dae-su, causing Mr. Park and his gang to seemingly join forces with Dae-su.  Dae-su leaves Mi-do with Mr. Park and leaves to face Woo-jin.  At Woo-jin's penthouse, Woo-jin reveals the truth: that Mi-do is Dae-su's daughter. Woo-jin had arranged their meeting by using hypnosis to guide Dae-su into the sushi restaurant, carefully arranging for them to fall in love so that Dae-su might experience the same pain that Woo-jin had. Dae-su attempts to attack Woo-jin but is beaten badly, until Woo-jin intervenes, killing his own bodyguard. Woo-jin proceeds to threaten to tell the truth to Mi-do, who is being held by Mr. Park in his new prison. Dae-su apologizes for his role in the death of Woo-jin's sister, willfully humiliates himself by imitating a dog and begs Woo-jin not to tell Mi-do. When Woo-jin is unimpressed, Dae-su cuts out his own tongue as a symbol of penance. Woo-jin accepts Dae-su's apology and tells Mr. Park to keep the truth from Mi-do. Woo-jin then boards the elevator and, recalling the events of his sister's suicide, shoots himself in the head with a [[Derringer]] pistol. In the aftermath of the event, Dae-su finds the hypnotist from the prison to erase his knowledge of Mi-do being his daughter so that they can stay together and have a happy relationship. Mi-do then finds Dae-su and confesses she loves him while the two embrace. Dae-su breaks into a wide smile, which is then slowly replaced by a look of pain, bringing into question whether the hypnosis worked.

The reason he needs Om is because his daughter Sandali has been kidnapped by Ghotia Bhai, Dhariwal's associate.  Ghotia Bhai wishes for Sandali to marry his son, Brandy.  However, Dhariwal and Sandali do not want this so Om comes back to rescue the girl he cares for.  When Om arrives in the city, he is able to free Sandali and disposes of Brandy in the process.  Inspector Nasir Pathan is the new chief of police in the district and since Om is not supposed to be back for 2 years, pursues him.  He catches Om, arrests and puts him into jail and returns Sandali to her father.  Upon further investigation though, Nasir Pathan uncovers an evil conspiracy against Om and his family.  Not only had Om been unfairly banished for 2 years, his sister had also been murdered by Inspector Katkar.  Om and Sandali had fallen in love when they met a few months before.  However, Mr. Dhariwal didn't want this marriage because in his wife's will, the boy that Sandali marries will get her wealth and Dhariwal would be left penniless.  The reason she had stipulated this is because she did not trust her husband's ability to control his gambling and habit of vice.  Dhariwal murdered his wife but no one found out.  So he waited for years until Sandali grew up and he started looking for a boy he could manipulate into giving him half of his daughter's endowment.  He asks Om to share the money with him upon his marriage to Sandali but the former refuses.  This alarms Dhariwal so he turns to Inspector Katkar and along with Dhariwal's new wife, the cunning Celina, they both hatch an evil plan to ruin Om's name in the city, thereby making it difficult for Sandali to marry him.  Katkar arranges for Darren, Celina's secret paramour, to go to Om's house and act as if his younger sister was a prostitute and Darren was frequenting the house for this purpose.  Om's sister is taken to jail and killed but Katkar disguises it as a suicide.  Om gets to know of their plan to ruin his family's name (but not his sister's murder) and confronts Dhariwal, Darren and Katkar.  Because he attacks Katkar, the inspector is able to exile Om for 2 years from Mumbai as a dangerous criminal.  When Sandali is returned to her father after Om rescues her, he is furious to find out that Om and she have consummated their marriage by exchanging vows.  He quickly ignores this and wants her to marry Darren.  However, before this can happen Celina divulges that Darren is her secret lover and she was simply using Dhariwal for his money.  Dhariwal is incensed and shot to death by Celina with no remorse.  Darren then disposes of Celina and prepares to marry Sandali so he can control all her wealth.  Om breaks out of jail where, after a thorough investigation, Inspector Nasir Pathan has just realised the truth about the conspiracy against him.  Om also finds out that Katkar had killed his sister and confronts him.  After a furious struggle, Om kills him.  He then sets off to rescue Sandali from Darren, with Inspector Pathan in hot pursuit as well.  Darren and Om have a long and intense fight but Om perseveres.  He and Sandali then set off to marry, with Inspector Pathan watching and knowing that Om has been vindicated.

The village falls in despair after thieves from [[Bangkok]] decapitate the statue and take the head with them. Ting, a villager extremely skilled in [[Muay Thai]], volunteers to travel to Bangkok to recover the stolen head of Ong-Bak. His only lead is Don, a drug dealer who attempted to buy the statue one day earlier.  Upon arriving in Bangkok with a bagful of money donated by his village, Ting meets up with his cousin Humlae, who has dyed his hair blond and begun calling himself "George". Humlae and his friend Muay Lek are street-bike racing hustlers who make a living out of conning [[Yaba (drug)|yaba]] dealers. Reluctant to help Ting, Humlae steals Ting's money and bets all of it in an underground fighting tournament at a bar on [[Khaosan Road]]. Ting tracks down Humlae and gets his money back after stunning the crowd by knocking out the champion in the ring with one kick. His extraordinary skill grabs the attention of Komtuan, a gray-haired crime lord who uses a wheelchair and needs an [[electrolarynx]] to speak. It is discovered that Don had stolen Ong-Bak's head to sell to Komtuan, who sees no value in it and orders him to dispose of it.  The next day, Humlae and Muay Lek are chased all over town by drug dealer Peng and his gang after a botched [[Baccarat (card game)|baccarat]] game scam at an illegal casino. Ting fights off most of the thugs and helps Humlae and Muay Lek escape in exchange for helping him find Don. They return to the bar, where Ting wins the respect of the crowd after defeating three opponents consecutively. The trio find Don's hideout, triggering a lengthy [[Auto rickshaw#Thailand|tuk-tuk]] chase. The chase ends at a port in [[Chao Phraya River]], where Ting discovers Komtuan's cache of stolen Buddha statues submerged underwater.  After the statues are recovered by local police, Komtuan has his thugs kidnap Muay Lek and have Humlae tell Ting to fight his bodyguard Saming near the Thai-[[Burma]] border in exchange for Muay Lek and the Ong-Bak head. Ting is forced to throw the match against the drug-enhanced Saming, and Humlae throws in the towel. After the fight, Komtuan reneges on his promise to release Muay Lek and return Ong-Bak, and he orders his henchmen to kill the trio. Ting and Humlae subdue the thugs and head for a mountain cave, where Komtuan's men are decapitating a giant Buddha statue. Ting defeats the remaining thugs and Saming, but is shot by Komtuan. Before the crime lord attempts to destroy the Ong-Bak head with a sledgehammer, Humlae jumps to protect it, taking the brunt of the hammer blows. The giant Buddha statue head suddenly falls, crushing Komtuan to death and critically injuring Humlae. Humlae gives Ting the Ong-Bak head, and with his dying breath, asks him to look after Muay Lek and make sure she graduates from college.  The head of Ong-Bak is restored in Ban Nong Pradu. Humlae's ashes, carried by an ordained monk, arrives into the village in a procession on an elephant's back while the villagers and Muay Lek celebrate the return of Ong Bak's head.

One Piece The Movie: Dead End no Bōken
 In a port town pub, the once again flat broke Straw Hats witness a suspicious exchange between a customer and the proprietor. Nami immediately senses money and endeavors to convince the host to give her whatever information he had given him. The other Straw Hats join in and soon he is persuaded. He shows them to a backdoor, behind which they find a long and winding tunnel. That tunnel leads to a large underground chamber, where a number of pirate crews have a gathering. The island they are on, turns out to be the starting point of an irregularly occurring, anything-goes sailing competition. For a moment, the Straw Hats weigh whether it is wise to join in the race, considering that two giants and a crew of fish-men, who were once the rivals of [[Arlong]]'s gang, were participating as well. But once they learn the height of the price money, not entering is out of the question. From the bookmaker they receive an [[eternal pose]], to lead them to the goal of the race.

A fight arises, and after Luffy and Shuraiya beat up his men, they find themselves standing before the general himself. He is impressed with their skill and offers both of them to work under him. Of course they refuse, but Luffy finds some insulting words to do it and is caught off guard by Gasparde's right-hand man, Needles. Luffy's courage impresses Gasparde even more. He renews his offer, orders Needles to let go of the rookie pirate, and leaves the room. The next morning, a strong ocean current starts the race, by pushing the ships upstream over the island. As soon as they are over the top, the various crews start shooting broadsides, board each other's ships, and ram their competitors out of the water. But once the island is left behind, the field quickly clears up, leaving the Straw Hats time to eat.

With all their competitors taken out, the Straw Hats are about to arrive at the goal of the race, when a fleet of navy ships appears and forces them to abandon their prize money.  
One Missed Call (2003 film)
 While out at a pub with university friends, Yoko Okazaki misses a call on her cell phone, but the ID is from herself. She and her friend Yumi Nakamura listen to Yoko's voice message, dated two days in the future, where she says it's starting to rain, followed by a horrendous scream. Two days later, Yumi receives a call from Yoko and realizes that she is on exactly the same routine as the voicemail. Yoko screams as she is violently tossed and then thrown off an overpass onto a speeding commuter train; her severed hand is seen dialing a number. Although authorities assume suicide, her schoolmates recall other similar deaths that were preceded by the voicemails. Yoko's boyfriend Kenji Kawai tells Yumi he got a voicemail from himself dated two days after, but disbelieves it. Yumi watches as Kenji is pulled into an elevator shaft. A red [[Gobstopper|jawbreaker candy]] falls out of his mouth as his phone dials another number by itself.  Yumi invites her friend Natsumi Konishi to stay at her apartment when she hears the same cursed ringtone. A video message dated two days later shows Natsumi with a ghastly arm behind her. Natsumi's attempt to discard the phone proves futile as she gets the same ringtone and voicemail message from an unrelated phone. Desperate, she agrees to a television producer's offer to meet with an exorcist. Yumi meets Hiroshi Yamashita, a detective who has been investigating the curse that had also claimed his sister Ritsuko. Yamashita shares that the next victim is called a minute after the death, and that the victims have red jawbreakers in their mouths.  Yamashita and Yumi trace a number common to the victims' phones to a hospital which has since changed its building and number. Yumi recognizes a sound she heard before Kenji's death: a spritz from an [[asthma inhaler]]. They trace the autopsy records to a girl Mimiko Mizunuma who had died from an asthma attack, with her mother Marie going missing. Ritsuko's journal shows that whenever Mimiko had an attack, her sister Nanako would suffer some injury at the same time. They suspect [[Munchausen syndrome by proxy]], where a parent purposely makes a child sick so she can take care of her and be praised for it. Natsumi's exorcism goes horribly wrong and she is killed when her body horribly contorts. Yumi then gets the cursed voicemail on her phone where she says "Why me?" and then screams. The same night, she reveals to Yamashita that her mother abused her as a child.  At the Mizunuma residence, Yumi finds a torn-up family photo, but screams when she sees a figure in a cupboard. There, Yamashita finds an old camcorder. At an orphanage, Yamashita meets Nanako, who is unable to talk, but possesses a teddy bear that plays the same song as the ringtone. At the old abandoned hospital building, Yumi is haunted by the spirit of Mimiko in her attempt to escape. Yamashita finds Yumi and they lock themselves in a room. Yumi's cellphone messages that she will die in one minute. Yamashita finds an arm nearby clutching an active cellphone, and stops its call. After the minute elapses, Yamashita comforts Yumi, but when he uncovers a crate holding Marie's body, it comes to life when Yumi approaches it. With Yamashita locked out, Yumi sees her own abusive mother's image in Marie and apologizes for leaving her. She tearfully embraces her, and Marie's body returns to a corpse.  Yumi returns home, as Yamashita returns to the orphanage. The Mizunuma videotape reveals that Marie did not abuse her children, but that Mimiko abused her sister. The tape shows her cutting Nanako, then suffering an asthma attack. Marie found out the truth and rushed Nanako to the hospital, leaving Mimiko to die. Nanako tells Yamashita that she would get a candy from Mimiko if she stayed silent. Yamashita rushes to Yumi's apartment as Yumi is being haunted by Mimiko; Yumi says "Why me?" and screams. When Yamashita arrives, he finds Yumi acting like nothing happened, but is stabbed by her with a kitchen knife when they embrace, and sees Yumi appearing as Mimiko in the mirror. After a brief dream where he helps the dying Mimiko with an inhaler, Yamashita wakes in a hospital where a possessed Yumi, brandishing the knife behind her back, feeds him a candy with her mouth and smiles, revealing that Mimiko found "a new Nanako" in Yamashita to care for.

The Order (2003 film)
  The film's premise is that there is another way to [[heaven]] than adherence to the practices of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. A secular [[Sin Eater]] can remove all taint of [[sin]], no matter how foul, from the soul just before death. The purified soul can then ascend into heaven. The Roman Catholic Church, according to the film, considers this [[heresy]].  [[Heath Ledger]] plays an unhappy and disillusioned priest, Alex Bernier, a member of a fictitious religious order ''The Carolingians'' which specializes in fighting [[demon]]s and other hell spawn. Father Dominic, the head of the Carolingians, has died in [[Rome]] under suspicious circumstances and Alex leaves the United States to investigate. In Rome, Alex visits the morgue and sees strange markings on Dominic's corpse.  After some investigation, he comes across a book that explains the markings as being the sign of a Sin Eater's work. He heads to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], where an official tells him that Sin Eaters don't exist and that Dominic may not be buried on sacred ground because he had been [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] for his beliefs. Alex, moving ever farther from his vocation, defies his superiors and secretly reads a holy service over the body and buries Dominic in the Carolingian cemetery (the service takes place off screen but is referred to later).  Thomas Garrett, another Carolingian (there seem to have only been a total of three including Dominic), arrives in Rome to help investigate Dominic's death.  Early in the film we meet Mara Williams, an artist Alex once [[exorcism|exorcised]], who has escaped from a mental hospital and come to Alex at his church in the USA because she has a feeling that something terrible is going to happen to him. The police come looking for her, but Alex lies and denies that he's seen her and through this exchange we learn that Mara was in the hospital because she had tried to kill Alex during the exorcism. Mara goes to Rome with Alex after promising that she won't try to kill him again.  [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] Driscoll ([[Peter Weller]]), who is introduced at the beginning of the film and who is tipped to be the next [[Pope]], arrives in Rome from the USA and gives Alex a special dagger. According to a fragment of parchment Alex and Thomas find among Dominic's books, the dagger is to be plunged into the Sin Eater while reciting a text in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. Alex and Thomas take these instructions to mean that the dagger and incantation will kill the Sin Eater and they begin hunting for the Sin Eater and the remainder of the parchment instructions.  Thomas leads Alex to a nightclub where they are taken to the underground base of operations of a masked man called Chirac, the 'Black Pope.' The Black Pope owes a favor to Thomas and Alex asks where to find the Sin Eater. The Black Pope then hangs three people and tells Alex to ask his question of the dying men who can see what the living cannot. One of the dying tells Alex a [[riddle]] that leads to a rendezvous with the Sin Eater.  On the way out of the Black Pope's headquarters, demons attack and injure Thomas, but Alex saves him and gets him to a hospital.  Alex leaves Thomas in the hospital and meets the Sin Eater, William Eden, at St. Peter's Cathedral who explains that he has been a Sin Eater for centuries, taking over for an earlier Sin Eater (a Carolingian priest) who ate the sins of Eden's brother. Eden is very charismatic and talks with Alex about the priest's desires, and Alex admits he wants Mara. He then goes and presumably tells Mara this, and they make love. Afterward, Alex leaves Mara asleep and goes to Eden, who tells Alex that he is tired and ready to die and asks Alex to take his place. Alex has the dagger with him, but is curious and so doesn't use it to kill Eden. Instead, he assists Eden with a sin eating ritual. But in the end, Alex refuses Eden's offer because he has decided to leave the priesthood to be with Mara.  Later Alex returns to their lodgings and finds Mara near death, an apparent [[suicide]]. In actuality, Eden slit her wrists and left her for Alex to find. Mara is beyond medical help and Alex quickly performs the sin eating ritual so that she can go to heaven. After absorbing Mara's sins, though, Alex sees that there is no sin of suicide on Mara's conscience and realizes Eden's deception. Alex goes after Eden to kill him.  The rationale that leads Alex to perform the sin eating ritual instead of giving Mara Roman Catholic Last Rites is that Alex has already made the decision to leave the priesthood to be with Mara and he has broken his vows of obedience and of [[sexual abstinence]]. He therefore considers himself ineligible to offer Mara Last Rites.  Meanwhile, the injured Thomas is out of the hospital and goes to see the Black Pope who reveals himself to be Cardinal Driscoll. Driscoll shows Thomas the second half of the parchment which instead of being instructions on how to kill a Sin Eater is actually instructions on how to become a Sin Eater. The entirety of Alex's and Mara's lives have been a plot among Dominic, Eden and Driscoll to entrap Alex. Eden wants to die, Driscoll wants to be Pope and Dominic wanted the financial resources to pursue arcane knowledge.  Driscoll prevents Thomas from leaving to warn Alex.  Alex cannot find Eden and returns to the Black Pope to learn where Eden is. The Black Pope (face hidden) tells Alex again to ask the dying. Alex recognizes that Thomas is the man being hanged, and frees him using a pistol. However, Thomas's throat is too injured by the noose to tell Alex the truth of the parchment.  Alex finds Eden and stabs him with the dagger while reciting the incantation. He quickly realizes what is actually happening but it is too late, Eden's powers are transferred to Alex, and Eden, happy to be free of his burden of the sins of others, dies. In the mean time, [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome crumbles around them.  Thomas, who arrives at the scene too late to prevent the transfer, vows he will find a way to save Alex, even if it means killing him.  Alex informs the church about Driscoll's activities and Driscoll is ruined. Driscoll then decides to kill himself and calls on the Sin Eater, now Alex, to remove his sins. Driscoll slits his wrists and when he is near death, Alex tells him that he knows that Eden and Driscoll caused Mara's death. Alex does not eat Driscoll's sins but forces them down Driscoll's throat. Driscoll dies a painful death and presumably goes straight to [[hell]].  The Sin Eater William Eden used his power to accumulate wealth. The Sin Eater Alex Bernier decides to act as a power for good, saving only those who deserve it and allowing evildoers to die in sin.  
Open Water (film)
 Daniel Kintner ([[Daniel Travis]]) and Susan Watkins ([[Blanchard Ryan]]) are a couple frustrated that their hard-working lives do not allow them to spend much time together. They decide to head out on a [[scuba-diving]] vacation to help improve their relationship. On their second day, they join a group scuba dive. A head count is taken, and the passenger total is recorded as 20. Daniel and Susan decide to separate briefly from the group while underwater. Half an hour later, the group returns to the boat. Two members of the group are inadvertently counted twice, so the dive master thinks everyone is back on board, and the boat leaves the site. However, Daniel and Susan are still underwater, unaware that the others have returned. When they resurface, the boat has gone. They believe the group will soon return to recover them.  Stranded at sea, it slowly dawns on Daniel and Susan that their boat is not coming back for them. They bicker, battle bouts of hunger and mental exhaustion, and realize that they have probably drifted far from the dive site. They also realize that [[shark]]s have been circling them below the surface. Soon, [[jellyfish]] appear, stinging them both, while sharks come in close. Susan receives a small shark bite on the leg, but does not immediately realize it. Daniel goes under and discovers a small fish feeding on the exposed flesh of her bite wound. He does not tell Susan. Later, a shark bites Daniel and the wound begins to bleed profusely. Susan removes her weight belt and uses it to apply pressure to Daniel's wound. He appears to go into shock. The tight-fitting neoprene wet suits are apparently keeping them from fully realizing they have been sustaining small bites. After night falls, sharks return and attack Daniel during a storm, killing him. The next morning, Daniel and Susan's belongings are finally noticed on the boat by a crew member. He remembers the couple and realizes they must have been left at the dive site. A search for the couple begins.  Susan realizes Daniel is dead and releases him into the water, where sharks attack and pull him down in a feeding frenzy. After putting on her mask, she looks beneath the surface and sees several large sharks now circling her. Susan looks around one last time for any sign of coming rescue. Seeing none, she removes her scuba gear and goes underwater to drown before the sharks can attack. Elsewhere, a fishing crew cut open a newly-caught shark's stomach, finding a diving camera, apparently that of Daniel and Susan. One of the fishermen asks offhandedly to another, "Wonder if it works?"  
Open Range (2003 film)
 In Montana in 1882, "Boss" Spearman is an [[open range]] cattleman, who, with hired hands Charley, Mose, and Button, is driving a herd cross country. Charley is a former soldier who fought in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and feels guilty over his past as a killer.  Boss sends Mose to the nearby town of Harmonville for supplies. The town is controlled by a ruthless [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrant [[land baron]], Denton Baxter, who hates open-rangers. Mose is badly beaten and jailed by the marshal, Poole. The only friendly inhabitant is Percy, a livery stable owner.  Boss and Charley become concerned when Mose does not return. They retrieve him from the jail but not before getting a warning from Baxter about free-grazing on his land. Mose's injuries are so severe that Boss and Charley take him to Doc Barlow. There they meet Sue Barlow. Charley is attracted immediately, but assumes that Sue is the doctor's wife.  After catching masked riders scouting their cattle, Boss and Charley sneak up on their campfire in the night, and disarm them. At the same time, another attack results in Mose's death. Button is badly injured and left for dead. Charley and Boss vow to avenge this injustice. They leave Button at the doctor's house and go into town, where they lock Poole in his own jail. Boss knocks him out with chloroform he has stolen from the doctor's office. The deputies are locked up as well.  Charley learns that Sue is the doctor's sister, not his wife. He declares his feelings for her, and she gives him a locket for luck. Charley leaves a note with Percy, in which he states that if he should die, money from the sale of his saddle and gear are to be used to buy Sue a new tea set, having accidentally destroyed her previous set during a "flashback" episode.  Boss and Charley are pitted against Baxter and his men. Charley shoots Butler, the gunman who shot Button and killed Mose. An intense gun battle erupts in the street, with Boss, Charley and Percy outnumbered before the townspeople begin to openly fight against Baxter. After an intense firefight, Baxter's men are dead and Baxter ends up wounded and alone, trapped in the jailhouse. Boss rushes to the jail, mortally wounding Baxter.  Sue's brother tends to the wounded townspeople and open-rangers. Charley speaks to Sue in private, telling her he must leave. She counters that she has a "big idea" about their future together and that she will wait for him to return. He does return, and proposes to Sue. Charley and Boss decide to give up the cattle business and settle down in Harmonville, taking over the saloon.  
Osama (film)
 [[Image:Khwaja Nader -2006-07-12-.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Khwaja Nader in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], July 2006.]] In the film, the Taliban are ruling Afghanistan. Their regime is especially repressive for women, who, among other things, are not allowed to work. This situation becomes difficult for one family consisting solely of three women, representing three successive generations: a young girl, her mother, and her grandmother. With the mother's husband and uncle dead, having been killed in battle during the Soviet invasion and their civil wars, there are no men left to support the family. The mother had been working as a nurse in a hospital, but the Taliban cut off funding to the hospital, leaving it completely dysfunctional with no medicines and very little equipment. One foreign woman working as a nurse in the hospital is arrested by the Taliban. The mother does some nursing outside the hospital and receives payment from the caretaker of a patient, but after the patient dies the mother cannot find any more work.  The mother and grandmother then make what they feel is the only decision they can to survive: they will have their preteen daughter disguise herself as a boy so that she can get a job to support the family. Osama's grandmother tells a story to Osama about a boy who changed to a girl when he went under a rainbow, to help persuade her to accept the plan. The daughter, feeling powerless, agrees despite being afraid that the Taliban will kill her if they discover her masquerade. Partly as a symbolic measure, the daughter plants a lock of her now cut hair in a flowerpot. The only people outside the family who know of the ruse are the milk vendor who employs the daughter – he who was a friend of her deceased father – and a local boy named Espandi, who recognises her despite her outward change in appearance. Espandi is the one who renames her Osama. The masquerade becomes more difficult when the Taliban recruit all the local boys for school, which includes military training. At the training school, they are taught how to fight and conduct ablutions, and an ablution is taught to boys that should be done when they experience nocturnal emission or come in contact with their wife when they grow older. Osama attempts to avoid joining the ablution session, and the master grows suspicious of Osama's gender. Osama realises it can only be so long before she is found out. Several of the boys begin to pick on her, and although Espandi is at first able to protect her, her secret is eventually discovered when she menstruates.  Osama is arrested and put on trial, along with a Western journalist, and the foreign woman who was arrested in the hospital. The journalist and the nurse are both condemned and put to death, but, as Osama is destitute and helpless, her life is spared; she is instead given in marriage to a much older man. Osama's new husband already has three wives, all of whom hate him and say he has destroyed their lives. They take pity on Osama, but are powerless to help her. The husband shows Osama the padlocks he uses on his wives' rooms, reserving the largest for Osama. The film ends with the new husband conducting an [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]] in an outdoor bath, which the boys were earlier taught to conduct after coming in contact with their wives.  
Oseam (2003 film)
 [[Image:Gami and Gilson from Oseam movie.jpg|left|thumb|Gilson and Gami]] ''Oseam'' follows two [[orphan]]s, Gami (감이) and her younger brother Gilson (길손). Gami is a gentle and reserved [[blindness|blind]] girl, while Gilson is hyperactive and often gets into mischief. The two seek refuge at a [[Mahayana]] Buddhist temple, helping with the chores, as they cope with the loss of their mother and home several years ago due to a fire accident, which is also how Gami lost her sight. Gilson, too young to understand, still believes they will find their mother someday as Gami has never told him she died in the fire. Gilson accompanies a monk to go meditate in the mountains and find a cure for his sister's blindness, but ends up sacrificing his life for Gami's sight.  The movie is very slowly paced, often quite [[slice of life story|slice-of-life]] in its approach, though dotted with moments of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] and briefly intense scenes. A lot of emphasis is placed on the characters, particularly the orphans.

Meanwhile, his little Italo-American cousin Sara discovers what happened thanks to Rocco's cat and runs after him into the Crib's world, but doesn't manage to find and she's found by a young Saint Peter and his family. Rocco finally finds Sara who finally convinces him, with the help of an Angel, that he was wrong, so they send away the three devils. Satan's furious with them and decides to kill Mary by hypnotizing Rocco and devouring Sara's soul, but his spell fails after the boy looked at Mary's aureole and the three devils, who are tired of getting bossed and feel sorry for the little girl, wake her and encourage her to sing a song her grandmother taught her which could send away the devil, and so Satan is sucked back in Hell forever.

Out of Time (2003 film)
 Matthias "Matt" Lee Whitlock ([[Denzel Washington]]) is the respected [[Chief of Police]] of the fictional [[Florida Keys]] small town of Banyan Key, [[Florida]]. He has recently executed a successful, high-profile drug bust that turned up $450,000 in drug money.  Although he enjoys his job, his drinking while on duty is an obvious character flaw, exacerbated by his pending divorce from his wife, homicide detective Alex Diaz Whitlock ([[Eva Mendes]]).  Matt is currently seeing local resident Anne Merai-Harrison ([[Sanaa Lathan]]), an old flame from high school whose husband Chris ([[Dean Cain]]), a former professional quarterback turned security guard, abuses her.  Matt then learns that Anne has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Anne intends to reward Matt's loyalty to her by making him the sole beneficiary of her $1,000,000 life insurance policy. Matt tries to find a way to give Anne some hope and suggests that she should travel to [[Switzerland]] to undergo a newly-developed, groundbreaking treatment. The problem is that Anne has been living beyond her means and does not have any money. Desperate to help her, Matt bends the rules and lends her the $450,000 so she can make the trip.  When the $450,000 goes up in flames in a suspicious house fire that supposedly kills Anne and Chris, Matt finds himself in a great deal of trouble. Not only is the money now gone, but Matt knows that even though he is innocent, circumstantial evidence &ndash; such as the insurance policy and the fact that he had been seeing Anne &ndash; could make him the prime suspect.  The [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] agents call the next day to get the payment in order to bust a higher drug lord using currency serial numbers, Matt responds erratically. He also finds about a person whom Anne has been visited by. He finds out that the money is now with this new person and that Alex is about to bust him. He rushes to the hotel and accidentally kills the stranger, takes the money and flees. Although Matt is seen by the police, he is thought to have come to protect Alex.   Later that evening, Alex finds that Matt is Anne's sole beneficiary and also that he has been visiting her. At the same time, Matt receives a distress call from Anne and unofficially goes to save her. Chris and Matt fight, Anne shoots and kills Chris. Then Anne reveals that she had planned all of this and shoots Matt in the leg.  When Anne is about to kill Matt, Alex kills her as she had traced him using a GPS tracker and asks him whether he planned to elope with the money. But Matt reveals that he has not brought the money with him. When the irritated DEA agents come to arrest Matt as he had promised the money delivery by noon and it was 7pm, he says that his man was sent to Miami, and simultaneously Chae appears with the money, telling a wrong address and that he could not find the DEA office. So the DEA agents leave with the money and Matt has no charges on him.   Later, when Matt is on medical leave, Chae visits him with news that Matt now owns $1 million USD, which is Anne's insurance money. But Alex says that, "as his wife," she knows that Matt has to reject it, meaning that she has decided to drop the divorce and move back in with Matt. Overjoyed, Matt seemingly forgets about the life insurance money, though Chae is amusingly adamant that Matt must take it.

Realizing the danger of sticking around, Burns and his assistant, Luo Yi ([[Elaine Tan]]), make a run for it, but in the resulting gunfight, Yi is killed.  When Burns reaches the border, he finds that Wong's smugglers have set him up for smuggling the drugs. Burns lands in a Chinese prison, framed for drug running.  Burns is questioned by Chinese narcotics cop Tommie Ling ([[Michelle Goh]]) and DEA agent Ed Gray ([[Corey Johnson (actor)|Corey Johnson]]), who want to release him and use him as bait to nail the drug smugglers.  Burns, referred to by the Chinese drug barons as the "[[gweilo]] Professor", is quickly released and sent to the USA, where he promises Yi's father Luo Dazhong ([[Vincent Wong (UK actor)|Vincent Wong]]) that he will get revenge for Yi's murder, but Wong is not done with Burns yet.  Wong sends hitmen to Burns's house in New Haven, Connecticut to plant a bomb, which explodes and kills Burns's wife Maya ([[Kata Dobó]]).  With the two people closest to him dead at the hands of Wong and his minions, and with Tommie and Gray shadowing his every move, Burns is out for revenge.

He changed his name and married Maya after he was released.  With his determination to exterminate those who killed Maya, Burns tells Tommie and Gray to stay out of his way, as he cuts a bloody path through Chinatown and across Europe on his way to a confrontation with Wong.

Perl is seeking to be granted citizenship after passing the New York State Medical Licensing Board examinations, wishing to begin practicing in New York. She recounts her early life when she aspired to be a doctor despite the admonishments of her father, her time practicing as a gynecologist before the [[Operation Panzerfaust|German invasion]], and her experiences as prisoner #25404, where she provided what medical care she could to fellow prisoners. Her most controversial actions included providing late-term abortions to pregnant women in order to save their lives.

Perl is accused of "colluding" with the Nazi doctor [[Josef Mengele]] who directed experiments on pregnant female inmates at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].  As the review board questions her over several days, she becomes increasingly emotional and questions her own determination to survive, as well as her guilt at having lived while so many others did not. She testifies that despite her intention to keep herself and others alive, she unknowingly became part of the Nazi efforts to kill, but she held on to the hope that the lives of the women she saved would undermine the efforts of the Nazis to exterminate the Jewish race. After she is granted citizenship and begins to practice in New York, she gets a call to attend one of the women whose first baby she had aborted in the camp. She delivers the baby and sees her wish that the Jewish race will survive fulfilled.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311210/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl IMDb Plot summary]</ref>

 In 1982, [[Toronto]] bank employee Dan Mahowny (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is given access to bigger and bigger accounts with his promotion to assistant branch manager. His boss trusts him, but is unaware that Mahowny is a compulsive gambler. Mahowny is soon [[embezzlement|skimming]] larger and larger amounts for his own use and making weekly trips to [[Atlantic City]], where he is treated like a king by a competent [[casino]] manager (John Hurt).

The love story between Mahowny and Belinda and the inclusion of other finely drawn characters such as hapless casino employee Bernie ([[K. C. Collins|Chris Collins]]) put the emphasis squarely on the [[gambling]] [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]], not on the flash and sizzle of big casinos or multimillion-dollar [[fraud]]s. 
Overnight
 In 1997, bartender Troy Duffy-- an aspiring screenwriter and member of the band "The Brood"-- successfully sells his script for ''[[The Boondock Saints]]'' to [[Miramax]] chief [[Harvey Weinstein]] for $300,000 and is taken on by the [[William Morris Agency]]. Weinstein agrees to let Duffy, who has never made a movie or attended film school, direct the $15 million film. Moreover, The Brood will produce the soundtrack and get a recording contract from [[Maverick Records]], and Weinstein will buy ''J. Sloan's'', the [[Los Angeles]] bar where Duffy works, and hire Duffy to run it. Meanwhile, Duffy asks friends Tony Montana and Mark Brian Smith to manage The Brood and document his activities on film.  Duffy initially enjoys his new success, entertaining celebrities in his bar, dining at hotel restaurants, and moving into a production office where he holds teleconferences with major Hollywood producers. The movie deal, however, quickly turns sour, largely due to Duffy's own arrogance and increasingly abusive behavior. Believing himself to be the next power-player in Hollywood, Duffy insults actors who are in consideration for ''Boondock'' (including [[Ethan Hawke]], [[Keanu Reeves]],<ref name="ebert"/> and [[Kenneth Branagh]], whose name Duffy repeatedly mispronounces before simply calling him "[[cunt]]"), as well as producers such as [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]. When the film fails to go into production as quickly as Duffy would like, he threatens to leave William Morris in favor of a rival agency, and alienates both Weinstein and his own production team through his abrasive behavior. Ultimately, Duffy receives word of rumors that Weinstein, one of the most powerful producers in Hollywood, has had him [[blacklist]]ed. Miramax puts the film in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], conference calls are refused, and soon Duffy is without any film industry contacts at all.   Duffy's musical efforts are equally ill-fated. Famed guitarist [[Jeff Baxter|Jeff "Skunk" Baxter]] expresses interest in producing The Brood, singling out lead vocalist Taylor for particular praise. However, during recording sessions with Baxter and producer [[Ron Saint Germain]], Duffy attempts to wrest control away from them, ignores any advice that contradicts his own opinions, and refuses to listen to Baxter's concerns about the band's heavy alcohol consumption. After being dropped by Maverick Records, Duffy and his band are signed to [[Atlantic Records]]. Renaming themselves The Boondock Saints, their debut CD sells only 690 copies, and they are dropped from the label shortly before disbanding.  In 1998, Duffy is finally able to obtain financing for the film through [[Franchise Pictures]], although it totals less than half of Miramax's offer. ''The Boondock Saints'' is promoted at the [[1999 Cannes Film Festival]], but all the major American distribution companies pass on it. The film manages to receive a limited release in five cities, but performs poorly and is pulled after a week before being released on DVD and VHS. On the night of the film's screening at the Palm Springs Film Festival, Duffy and producer [[Chris Brinker]] are almost killed by a car jumping the curb and speeding off; the car and its driver remain unidentified. Although positive reviews of the movie begin to spread via word-of-mouth and the film becomes a financial success, Duffy's contract with Franchise Films stipulates he cannot profit from the film's television, home media, or foreign sales. He eventually spends all of the money he earned from his film and record deals, his bar closes, and he is unable to secure any work in Hollywood within six years after the production of ''The Boondock Saints''.

Paycheck (film)
 In the near future, Michael Jennings (Affleck) is a [[reverse engineering|reverse engineer]]; he analyzes his clients' competitors' technology and recreates it, often adding improvements beyond the original specifications. To protect his clients' [[intellectual property]] and himself, Jennings, with the aid of his friend Shorty (Giamatti), undertakes a [[Mindwipe|memory wipe]] to remove knowledge of his engineering.  Jennings is approached by his old college roommate, James Rethrick (Eckhart), the CEO of the successful Seattle technology company Allcom. Rethrick proposes a lengthy three-year reverse engineering job to Jennings, requiring him to live on Allcom's secured campus until its conclusion but rewarding him handsomely with company stock. Jennings agrees and, after arranging for his long-term absence, arrives at Allcom, turns in his personal possessions, and is given a brief tour of the facility where he meets and flirts with [[botanist]] Dr. Rachel Porter (Thurman). He is injected with a long-term memory marker for the post-job memory wipe.  Three years later, at the conclusion of his memory wipe, Jennings is sitting in Rethrick's office, being thanked for a successful job. On returning home, Jennings finds that, although his Allcom shares would have been worth around $92 million, he had signed them away near the end of his tenure. Furthermore, he finds that his personal possessions have been replaced with an envelope containing a random assortment of everyday items. Soon after, the FBI detains him, and Agent Dodge (Morton) accuses him of filing patent applications based on classified designs they suspect Rethrick purchased from [[physicist]] William Dekker, who was subsequently murdered.  Jennings is able to escape from custody, finding that items in the envelope can be used at the right time to evade capture. More than that, a [[fortune cookie]] message with winning lottery numbers indicates that these items are based on information from the future.  After warning Shorty of his plight, Jennings finds items pointing him to a café meeting with Porter. Rethrick, who has been watching Jennings' movements, discovers a message to Porter about this meeting and sends a [[body double]] to take her place to try to recover the envelope. The real Porter shows up and helps Jennings escape from both the FBI and Rethrick's men.  The two take shelter at a local school, examining the remaining items in the envelope while Porter tries to convince Jennings of the relationship they shared during his tenure at Allcom. One of the stamps holds a [[microdot]] that, on enlargement, reveals several pictures of newspaper headlines taken from a machine's display: Allcom becoming financially successful with a device that can depict future events, but the world reacting to the catastrophic forecasts in ways that [[self-fulfilling prophecy|fulfill their outcomes]], resulting in financial panic, political strife and America launching a [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]]. Jennings realizes he must have built this device based on Dekker's invention and, on realizing the horrors that will come, prepared the envelope, using the forecasts from the machine to allow his future self to return to Allcom and destroy the machine. Furthermore, as Rethrick discovers, Jennings rigged the device to malfunction, preventing Rethrick from anticipating Jennings' actions.  Jennings and Porter return to Allcom and make their way to the machine room detected but not interrupted, jamming the door behind them. Jennings determines the location of the defective circuit and removes it, subsequently rigging the machine to explode in a few minutes. Jennings uses the machine one last time, seeing a vision of himself being shot by an FBI agent in the catwalks above the machine. Soon, Rethrick's men storm the room and, after a brief [[shootout]], Jennings and Porter escape to the catwalks. Rethrick is waiting there, holding them at gunpoint, the same [[Tableau vivant|tableau]] from the machine. When Jennings' watch, taken from the envelope, beeps, Jennings ducks in time to avoid the FBI Agent's bullet that then kills Rethrick. The machine is destroyed, and Jennings and Porter escape in the chaos. Agent Dodge, surveying the destruction, shows sympathy for Jennings by reporting him killed in the explosion.  In the film's conclusion, Jennings, Porter, and Shorty have opened a greenhouse nursery. Jennings recalls a fortune cookie note from the envelope and discovers one last act he had done with the machine, foreseeing the results of a $90 million lottery and leaving the winning ticket in Porter's birdcage.

Peter Pan (2003 film)
  In the nursery of the Darling household located in [[Edwardian era]] London, Wendy Darling tells her younger brothers John and Michael the story of Cinderella, who went to the ball and found herself surrounded by pirates. Life is disrupted when their Aunt Millicent arrives to visit. Judging Wendy to be an "almost" full-grown woman, Aunt Millicent advises Mr. and Mrs. Darling to think of Wendy's future, saying that Wendy should spend less time in the nursery, and more time with herself, to become a grown woman. The very idea frightens the children.  At school, Wendy daydreams about having seen Peter in the night, and, after being caught with a drawing of him over her bed, is in trouble with the teacher, who sends a letter by a boy messenger to Wendy's father at the bank, and as she tries to stop him, along with the family's "nurse" dog Nana, embarrasses her father in front of his superiors. As a punishment, Mr. Darling chains Nana outside and declares it time for Wendy to grow up. Peter visits the nursery again looking for his shadow, which Nana had bitten off, and introduces himself. After being acquainted, Wendy sews his shadow back on and is enchanted by Peter's ability to fly and his description of Neverland and how nicely he talks about girls. She asks Peter if she can kiss him, but because he does not know what a kiss is, ends up giving him a thimble instead. He returns the "kiss" by plucking an acorn from his shirt and giving it to her. Peter invites her to tell stories to his gang of Lost Boys. She asks to bring her brothers, John and Michael, to which Peter agrees. He grabs Tinker Bell and shakes fairy dust on the children and tells them to think of happy thoughts. Nana, having escaped her chain, leads Mr. and Mrs. Darling back home from a party, but they arrive too late to stop the children.  The children fly over London and then to Neverland. They observe Captain Hook's (Isaacs) ship from a cloud. The pirates spot them and attack with their cannons. One knocks Wendy far away and the other causes Michael and John to fall towards the island below. Peter tells Tinker Bell to find Wendy while he takes care of Hook. But Tinker Bell reaches the hideout as Wendy is still falling from the sky, and out of jealousy, tricks the Lost Boys into shooting Wendy with an arrow. The boys learn the truth and confess to Peter but Wendy is revealed not to have been killed as the arrow hit the acorn necklace hung around her neck. Angry, Peter banishes Tinker Bell and ends their friendship. When Wendy finally awakens she finds the Lost Boys on their knees begging her to be their mother, which she accepts. They blindfold her and lead her to their hideout, and she finally realises her brothers are missing. Michael and John stumble across the crocodile that ate Hook's hand then encounter the Native American princess Tiger Lily (Carsen Gray). All three are then captured by Hook and taken to the Black Castle to use as bait for Peter Pan. Wendy and Peter visit the mermaids' lagoon to ask the dark and mysterious creatures to help in locating John and Michael, and learn that Hook has her brothers. Peter and Hook engage in a duel but it is stopped when the ticking crocodile arrives and tries to eat Hook, allowing the children to all escape.  That night, after a celebration at the Native American camp, Peter shows Wendy the fairies' home and the two share a dance. Hook spies on the two and soon comes across Tinker Bell, who is still hurt and upset from being banished, and charms her into telling him more about Peter and Wendy. Peter becomes upset with Wendy after she tries to get him to express his feelings and that he will never love and never grow up, and tells her to go home and grow up if she's not happy. Wendy, hurt, leaves to be alone. Hook has the sleeping Wendy carried to his ship. There, he entices her to become a pirate but sends a spy to follow her to the Lost Boys' underground hideout afterwards. Wendy soon comes to her senses and tells her brothers that the three of them will be going home, which upsets Peter. The Lost Boys ask if they can go too, upsetting Peter even more. Wendy tries to say goodbye to Peter but he turns away in sadness. She leaves him a cup of "medicine" and tells him not to forget to take it.  The pirates capture the boys outside and Hook goes down into the tree and puts a drop of poison in Peter's medicine. He is about to drink the medicine, but Tinker Bell intervenes and drinks the poison herself. Peter telepathically reaches out to children sleeping around the world, the Darlings, Aunt Millicent, the Lost Boys, and even the pirates to assert their belief in fairies, which brings Tinker Bell back to life.  Peter and Tinker Bell save Wendy and the boys from walking the plank by making the pirates think the crocodile is on board, and a battle soon breaks out. Hook sprinkles himself with Tinker Bell's fairy dust and fights Peter in a duel while flying. Hook taunts him about Wendy abandoning him and forgetting all about him when she grows up. Weakened by those thoughts and unable to fight, Peter gives in to his inevitable death. Seeing this as goodbye, Wendy gives Peter her hidden kiss, which gives him the strength to recover. Peter reengages Hook, who loses his confidence and falls into the waiting jaws of the crocodile.  With the ship covered in fairy dust, Peter flies Wendy and the boys back to London. Mr. and Mrs. Darling are overjoyed at the return of their children, and adopt the Lost Boys. Slightly, who got lost on the way to London and arrives at the house too late, is adopted by the lonely Aunt Millicent. Peter promises never to forget Wendy and to return someday before heading back to Neverland with Tinker Bell. According to the adult Wendy, she never saw Peter again, but she continues to tell his story to her own children and grandchildren so that his legacy will last forever.  
Phone Booth (film)
 Stuart "Stu" Shepard ([[Colin Farrell]]) is an arrogant [[New York City]] publicist who has been courting a woman named Pam ([[Katie Holmes]]) behind the back of his wife Kelly ([[Radha Mitchell]]). He uses the last remaining public phone booth in the city to contact Pam. During the call, he is interrupted by a [[pizza delivery]] man, who attempts to deliver a free pizza to him, but Stu rudely turns him away by insulting his weight. As soon as Stu completes his call to Pam, the phone rings. Stu answers, to find that The Caller, who knows his name, warns him not to leave the booth, and says he will say hello to Pam for him. He also says he will call Kelly, leaving Stu panicked.   The caller tells Stu that he has tested two previous individuals who have done wrong deeds in a similar manner (one was a [[child pornography|child pornographer]], the other was a [[insider trading|company insider]] who cashed out his stock options before the share price collapsed), giving each a chance to reveal the truth to those they wronged, but in both cases, they refused and were killed. To demonstrate the threat, the caller fires a suppressed sniper rifle at a toy robot sold by a nearby vendor; the damage is unseen by anyone but Stu, the caller, and the vendor. The caller demands that Stu confess his feelings for Pam to both Kelly and Pam to avoid being killed. The caller contacts Pam, and puts her on line with Stu, who reveals that he is married. The caller then hangs up, telling Stu to call Kelly himself.  As Stu hesitates, the booth is approached by three prostitutes demanding to use the phone. Stu refuses to leave, having been warned by the caller to stay in the booth and not reveal the situation. Leon ([[John Enos III]]), the prostitutes' pimp, joins his charges, smashes the side of the booth, grabs at Stu in a headlock and starts punching him. The caller offers to "make him stop" and asks if Stu can hear him, which Stu just answers positively, causing the caller to misunderstand Stu and shoot Leon. Leon staggers away before collapsing dead in the street. The prostitutes immediately blame Stu, making a scene over Leon's body, accusing him of having a gun as the police and news crews converge on the location.  Police Captain Ed Ramey ([[Forest Whitaker]]), already suspecting Stu of being the killer, seals off the streets with police roadblocks and starts trying to negotiate to get him to leave the booth, but Stu refuses, telling the caller that there is no way they can incriminate him; the caller proves him wrong, calling his attention to a handgun that was planted in the roof of the phone booth. Both Kelly and Pam soon arrive on the scene. The caller demands that Stu tell Kelly the truth, which he does. The caller then orders Stu to choose between Kelly and Pam, and the woman he does not choose will be killed.  While on the phone with the caller, Stu secretly uses his cell phone to call Kelly, allowing her to overhear his conversation with the caller. She, in turn, quietly informs Captain Ramey of this. Meanwhile, Stu continues to confess to everyone that his whole life is a lie, to make himself look more important than he really is or even feels. Stu's confession provides sufficient distraction to allow the police to trace the payphone call to a nearby building, and Ramey uses coded messages to inform Stu of this. Stu warns the caller that the police are on the way, and the caller replies that if he is caught, then he will kill Kelly. Panicked, Stu grabs the handgun and leaves the booth, screaming for the sniper to kill him instead of Kelly. The police fire upon Stu, while a smaller force breaks into the room that the caller was tracked to, only to find the gun and a man's corpse.  Stu regains consciousness to find the police fired only [[rubber bullet]]s at him, stunning but not harming him. Stu and Kelly happily reunite. As the police bring down the body, Stu identifies it as the pizza delivery man from earlier. Stu gets medical treatment at a local ambulance; as he does, a man with a briefcase ([[Kiefer Sutherland]]) passes by and says that he regrets killing the pizza deliverer and warns Stu that if his new-found honesty does not last, he will be hearing from him again. The man disappears into the crowd with Stu unable to call out because he has been sedated by the paramedics. As he does, someone else is being called from that same line. The audience could only hear him say, "Hello?" and the film ends.

Inside Max's house, Phileine meets his friends: the bespectacled Jules, the sick Leonard, the Flemish Gulpje, the terrible Joanna and weatherman LT (Louis Theodore). That same evening, a welcome party is held, but because of all the new impressions, drinks, and fatigue, Phileine goes to bed early.  In the morning, she finds a note from Max that he had to leave early for rehearsal but that the two of them will have dinner together in the evening. Phileine goes to the living room and meets Gulpje. Soon, they decide to be best friends and have lunch. After lunch, Phileine calls Fabian for a tour. During that tour, Fabian gets a little bit too personal so she reminds him that he has a wife.  Max can’t make it to diner because his rehearsal runs out. Phileine spends that night with the friends of Max. Together with Gulpje, she stirs the group up because they both like to joke around at the expense of others.  On day two, Phileine attends the premiere of Romeo and Juliet. The play shows the sexual side of society, so it is played naked and shows sex and masturbation scenes. Part of the audience is so shocked that after the break, they call out their displeasure and leave the theater. Phileine is astonished but remains still in her seat until the end.  At the after party, she tries to obtain explanations about what had happened on stage. She asks Max and the director Reginald, but neither gives her an answer. She quarrels with Max but settles the matter later in a pub. The next day, she goes with Gulpje to the restaurant where the scene from “When Harry Met Sally" was filmed. Phileine and Gulpje get the attention of two men and they invite them to their table. They want to show off their tricks and begin gently with panting and moaning. Initially the men find it funny, but when Phileine and Gulpje start screaming, the whole thing gets embarrassing and they run out the restaurant.  A little later the women run into Jules and start a conversation about sexual harassment from men. After an insulting remark by Phileine, Jules departs. Only then does she discover that Jules is not female but male. Phileine goes to meet LT, the boyfriend of 'terrible Joanna', on his boat on the water. They have sex in 'revenge' for the escapade between Joanna and Max on stage.  The next day, they decide to go to the last performance of the show. From the back of the theater, they see that Max is about to penetrate Joanna on stage. This time, Phileine will not let this happen and makes a huge scene by disrupting the play. Max tries to defend his action by explaining it as art. Phileine doesn’t accept this and gets the audience on her side in the argument.  The day after, the newspapers are filled with what happened in the theater and Phileine is requested for a number of TV shows. She goes to David Letterman's show where she takes control over the show and wins the support of the audience. She is provided with money so she can stay the night in a hotel. The next day, Max is at her door to take her to an AIDS Gala of his friend Leonard. She doesn’t want to go with him, so he lifts her up over his shoulder and takes her to a taxi.  The atmosphere between Phileine and the other people is hostile at the Gala. Except for Gulpje, Phileine has offended everybody else. Even Max is furious at her because he finds out she has slept with LT. Eventually Phileine realizes why everyone is mad at her. She gets on the stage and delivers a speech in which she says sorry for the first time in her life to everyone who she has treated rudely. She ends the speech with: "Sorry that I exist."

The Perfect Husband (2003)
 The Perfect Husband is the beautiful story of Jaya [21], who, inspired by the Shakespearean ideal of "the marriage of true minds" and heavily influenced by the American trend of "finding your own mate" rebels against tradition and family. She sets out to find a man who truly loves and values her – one who does not treat her like a vassal meant only to satisfy his needs, like some men do !!!  And it is the story of Uma [30] who resolves never to marry any willing, over the hill man, just because her family believes that an unsuitable alliance is better than no alliance at all !!!  The film is a funny, sad, satirical, serious, compassionate, wicked revelation of the follies and foibles of a society that considers the birth of a girl, "a curse", where abuse by the husband is taken for granted, and a woman's worth is judged by three factors alone—that she be married by the age of 25, that she should amply satisfy the monetary demands of her in-laws and that she produce a male heir within a year of holy matrimony!  The film, a romantic comedy cum social satire, predominantly in English with a smattering of Hindi and Punjabi, is a modern and thought-provoking look at the Indian marriage 'game' – the quest for the only security symbol that most Indian women possesses: a husband, perfect or otherwise!

[[Piglet (Winnie-the-Pooh)|Piglet]] wants to help too, but his friends tell him that he is too small. When the plan goes awry, Piglet saves the day by trapping the bees in a decoy hive; but nobody notices what Piglet has done. Feeling ignored and unappreciated, Piglet sadly wanders away just as the bees escape from the decoy hive.  After escaping from the bees, Piglet's friends realize that he is missing, so they decide to go on a search for him by using a special scrapbook that Piglet had made of their past adventures as a guide. On the way to Kanga's house, they reminisce about when Kanga and her son Roo arrived in the Hundred Acre Wood. Everyone is afraid of the newcomers and Rabbit concocts a plan to use Piglet as a decoy so they could kidnap Roo. Kanga pretends to believe Piglet is Roo and gives him a dose of fish oil and a bath. She gives him a cookie afterwards and Piglet realizes she is actually very nice. Roo and Rabbit have become best friends and everyone agrees Kanga and Roo should stay.  Back in the present, Roo joins the search party and they head to their next destination in the scrapbook: the North Pole. They remember the story of their expedition to find the Pole. Partway through the expedition, Roo falls into the river. Tigger, Rabbit and Eeyore try to save him but to no avail. Piglet uses a very long [[Branch|stick]] to catapult Roo out of the river and hands it off to Pooh as he runs to try and catch Roo. Christopher Robin arrives on the scene, sees Pooh holding the stick, and declares Pooh has discovered the North Pole; Piglet's role in both Roo's rescue and the Pole's discovery went unacknowledged.  Back in the present, Piglet's friends express their regrets for not celebrating Piglet's heroism. They become increasingly worried as a storm rolls in; to reassure Roo, Eeyore and Pooh tell him about the time Piglet built a house for Eeyore. Piglet has pointed out to Pooh Eeyore did not have a house to keep him warm. Pooh decides they should build Eeyore a house on that very spot, which he names "Pooh Corner." Pooh briefly considers calling it "Pooh and Piglet Corner" before deciding "Pooh Corner" sounds nicer. Tigger joins Pooh in trying to build the house while Piglet struggles to keep up; eventually, Pooh and Tigger give up. Then they learn Eeyore has already built himself a house out of sticks, though it has gone missing. Pooh and Tigger realize they were using Eeyore's old house to build Eeyore's new house. As they struggle to explain, Piglet arrives and leads them back to Eeyore's newly completed house. Once again, Piglet's contributions are overlooked as the wind gets the credit for moving Eeyore's house.  As the rain begins to fall, Tigger wants to skip to the end of the book to find where Piglet really is, but Rabbit insists they should read it in order; they begin fighting over the book, which falls in the river. The friends sadly return to Piglet's house to keep Roo from catching a cold. They draw new pictures of Piglet, then set out to look for him once again. They find the scrapbook [[Bookbinding|bindings]], suspended on a hollow [[Wooden log|log]], overhanging a raging [[waterfall]]; Pooh goes to retrieve it, but falls into a hole in the log.  Pooh's friends form themselves into a rescue rope, but it is not quite long enough and Pooh is stuck hanging precariously over the waterfall. Piglet appears and pulls Pooh to safety, but the log begins to break, which knocks Piglet's scrapbook into the river below. Rabbit, Eeyore, Tigger, and Roo all make it to solid ground, just in time to see half of the log plummet to the water below. Tigger, Rabbit, Roo and Eeyore begin to mourn for their apparent loss and almost fail to notice Pooh and Piglet emerging from inside of the other half of the log. Piglet's friends take him home and show him the drawings they have made of him, demonstrating their appreciation for everything Piglet has done. The film ends as the characters are throwing a party and Pooh shows Piglet the new sign for the renamed "Pooh and Piglet Corner."  
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl
  While sailing to [[Port Royal]], [[Jamaica]], Governor [[Weatherby Swann]], his daughter [[Elizabeth Swann|Elizabeth]], and Lieutenant [[James Norrington]] encounter a [[shipwreck]] and recover a boy, [[Will Turner]]. Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate medallion around his neck, and keeps it in order to protect him.  Eight years later, Norrington is promoted to [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]] and proposes to Elizabeth. Her [[corset]] makes her faint and fall into the sea, which causes her medallion to emit a pulse. [[Jack Sparrow|Captain Jack Sparrow]] comes to Port Royal to commandeer a ship, and rescues Elizabeth. Norrington identifies Jack as a pirate, and a chase ensues. Jack encounters Will, now a [[blacksmith]] and swordsman. They duel, and Jack is captured and imprisoned.  That night, ''[[Black Pearl]]'' attacks Port Royal in search of the medallion. The crew of the ''Pearl'' capture Elizabeth, taking her to meet [[Hector Barbossa|Captain Barbossa]] when she requests [[parley]]. Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner to conceal her identity as the governor's daughter. Barbossa takes her prisoner, believing her to be the daughter of [[Bootstrap Bill Turner]]. Elizabeth learns that her medallion is one of the gold pieces that Barbossa's crew took from a treasure of [[Hernán Cortés]] on [[Isla de Muerta]]. A curse condemns them to become [[undead]] corpses under moonlight, until they return all of the pieces and atone in blood, the medallion being the final piece.  Will frees Jack to rescue Elizabeth, whom Will loves. Jack, the original [[Sea captain|captain]] of ''Black Pearl'' before Barbossa staged a [[mutiny]], assists Will to reclaim his ship. The two commandeer HMS ''Interceptor'' and head for [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] to recruit a crew; en route, Jack reveals that Will's father, Bootstrap Bill, was a pirate who was thrown overboard for opposing the mutiny against Jack. At Isla de Muerta, Will and Jack witness Barbossa sacrificing Elizabeth's blood and the final gold piece. The curse is not lifted because the medallion belonged to Bootstrap Bill, making Will the owner by bloodline. Will rescues Elizabeth and brings her to ''Interceptor'', while Jack is captured by Barbossa and gets locked in the [[Military prison#brig|brig]] of ''Black Pearl''.  ''Black Pearl'' pursues ''Interceptor'', taking the crew hostage and destroying the ship. Will makes a deal with Barbossa to release Elizabeth in exchange for his blood, but Barbossa exploits a loophole in the agreement, [[marooning]] Jack and Elizabeth on a nearby island. Elizabeth makes a [[smoke signal]], and Norrington brings HMS ''Dauntless'' to rescue Elizabeth and arrest Jack. Elizabeth asks Norrington to return for Will, convincing him by accepting Norrington's marriage proposal.  That night, ''Dauntless'' arrives at Isla de Muerta. Jack plans to lure the pirates out to be ambushed by the crew of ''Dauntless'', but the plan goes awry when Barbossa's crew walks underwater to attack ''Dauntless''. Elizabeth escapes ''Dauntless'' and frees Jack's crew from ''Black Pearl''. They refuse to rescue Jack and Will, so Elizabeth sets out on her own while Jack's crew takes the ''Pearl'' and flees.  Jack reaches a deal with Barbossa to operate a pirate fleet, but suddenly frees Will and duels Barbossa, while Elizabeth and Will fight off Barbossa's crew. Barbossa stabs Jack, but the latter is revealed to be under the curse, having taken a piece of gold from the chest of Cortés. Jack shoots Barbossa, and Will drops both coins into the chest, with his and Jack's blood on them. The curse is lifted, causing Barbossa to die from Jack's gunshot; the rest of Barbossa's crew, realizing that they are no longer immortal, surrender and are arrested.  At Port Royal, Jack is led to the [[gallows]] to be hanged for piracy. Elizabeth diverts Norrington's attention and Will attempts a rescue, but Will and Jack are surrounded and held at gunpoint. Elizabeth intercedes and declares her love for Will, leaving Norrington crestfallen. Jack dives into the sea and escapes aboard the ''Pearl'', which is waiting nearby. Governor Swann pardons Will and gives his blessing for Elizabeth to marry him. Norrington permits Jack and the ''Pearl'' "one day's head start" before initiating pursuit.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Barbossa's pet monkey "Jack" steals a piece of gold from the chest and regains immortality.

He sets fire to the ganja fields, lets the Ganja producer experience the pain of his loss and then sets upon destroying him physically. He drives him through the street, taking his time breaking a few bones at a time till he is done toying with him. Then he kills him and offers his body as a tribute to Manju who now has lost her will to live.  Gomathi realises what Chithan has been through and tries to get him to stay. However, Chithan turns back to the world of the graveyard among the corpses that cannot hurt him any more.

Pokémon: Jirachi—Wish Maker
  ===''Gotta Dance!''=== The plot of the short centers on [[Team Rocket]] and their newest base. After building their base, the Pokémon of Team Rocket manage to successfully capture three [[Whismur]] to provide entertainment to [[Giovanni (Pokémon)|Giovanni]] when he arrives. To force the Whismur to cooperate, Meowth uses a baton that, when a switch was pressed on the end, made Pokémon dance uncontrollably.  Meanwhile, [[Pikachu]], [[Treecko]], [[Torchic]], [[Mudkip]] and [[Lotad]] stumble upon the base and attempt to free the Whismur. One of the running gags in the short is how the dancing baton is constantly activated or deactivated by accident. This leads to the accidental destruction of the base thanks to the uncontrollable dancing of the Pokémon, including a wild [[Ludicolo]] and [[Loudred]].  ===''Jirachi Wish Maker''=== The story revolves around the [[Millennium]] Comet, which appears in the night sky for seven days once every thousand years. This is also when the Mythical Pokémon [[Jirachi]] awakens from its long slumber to absorb the comet's energy. This energy, in turn, is released into the ground, bringing life to the area known as Forina where it rests. This time, however, a magician known as Butler and his long-time girlfriend Diane unearth the stone that encases Jirachi, and take it away from Forina.  Meanwhile, in celebration of the Millennium Comet's appearance, [[Ash Ketchum]] and his friends [[List of Pokémon anime characters#Protagonists|May]], [[List of Pokémon anime characters#Protagonists|Max]] and [[Brock (Pokémon)|Brock]] arrive at a wide crater, which is where the festival of the Millennium Comet is meant to be. Upon seeing nothing where the festival should be, they decide to wait until morning and go to sleep. While they're sleeping, the festival arrives; Pikachu, Ash's Pokémon companion, notices first and wakes all the others, and they watch the festival being set up.  At the festival, [[May (Pokémon)|May]] buys a seven-panelled novelty that is said to grant a person one wish if a panel is closed for each night the comet appears and is visible in the sky. Later, Ash and Max accidentally volunteer for one of Butler's magic tricks because Max hears a voice coming from the rock Diane is holding, and runs down to the stage. Max is introduced to Jirachi, who he hears talking from inside the rock. Butler lets Max take the rock, from which Jirachi emerges later that night. Hoping its wishing ability is true, Max wishes for lots of candy, and it appears - but it is revealed that instead of creating the candy, Jirachi teleported it from a stall in the festival.  The intentions of Butler are soon revealed: he was a former scientist for [[Team Magma]] who was seeking to resurrect the Legendary Pokémon [[Groudon]]. Butler had devised the perfect system, but could not find the necessary amount of power to fuel and was fired from Team Magma, to his humiliation. To try and fuel his machine again, he hoped to use Jirachi's energy for his own purposes. Seeing this danger, the Pokémon [[Absol]], whose presence usually indicated impending disaster, arrives to help Jirachi and alert the group.  Butler attempts to harness Jirachi's power, but is interrupted inside the circus tent by Ash and his friends. With the help of Diane and Absol, they take Butler's bus to Forina so that Jirachi can go home; unknown to them, Butler's [[Mightyena]] places a tracking device on the bus as it is leaving. As Ash and his friends travel along bumpy terrain, the device falls off, but Butler still discovers where they are headed. Before the day Jirachi has to return, Max feels upset about losing his new friend, so Ash tells him about one of his friends, [[Misty (Pokémon)|Misty]]. He explains that even though they don't see each other anymore, they will always be friends. Before the group can make it back to Forina, they realize that Butler had followed them there and set a trap. Butler manages to once again steal Jirachi in an attempt to take its power again.  When Butler sets his plan in motion, however, a fake Groudon monster is created instead of the real thing. Absorbing the energy from the surrounding area, the monster begins to turn Forina into a wasteland, killing all plants in sight and absorbing all living creatures, including May, Brock and Team Rocket, who had followed them the whole way. When Diane is absorbed by the fake Groudon, Butler realizes his long-time relationship with her is what is more important, and with Ash and Max's help he is able to distract the fake Groudon.  Eventually, Jirachi reabsorbs the energy used to create Groudon, and uses Doom Desire to destroy it for good, before leaving for another thousand years of slumber. As it disappears, Jirachi reminds Max that they will always be friends, and promises to remember him. May, in all the excitement, forgets to close the last panel of her novelty, but simply brushes it off. Though she never reveals what she wished for, she is confident it will still come true.  During the end credits, May gets tired of walking until the man who sold her the wishing star gives them a lift on his truck. Then they look at stars, the group sees constellations which form Pokémon from Teddiursa to Pikachu. After that they all watch the festival's fireworks before continuing their adventure.

A Problem with Fear
 Laurie Harding ([[Paulo Costanzo]]) is a small shop clerk in the local [[Calgary]] mall. His world is full of tragic accidents - crosswalks, elevators, escalators and virtually anything associated with [[commercialism]] or technology is parodied as objects of fear and tragedy.  An elevator plunges 30 stories. A woman's scarf is caught in an escalator, strangling her to death. A man is struck by a car, right before Laurie had the premonition to not cross.  His own world is full of fear of these very events, his predictions of them, and his dependence on his less-than-sympathetic sister, Michelle ([[Camille Sullivan]]).  Michelle heads product development at the company Global Safety Inc., whose mission is to provide products to combat the "Fear Storm" which assails the city. With their "Early Warning 2 Safe System tm", the PDA-like device warns you of danger ahead of time and the "Safe Bracelet tm" senses your fear and allows you to beep for help.  Along with Laurie's prophetic powers, and the endless onslaught of accidents, the movie is full of absurd events: a mall announcer who continually requests a speaker of x foreign language - without any apparent reason; the same mall's population which slowly dwindles, being virtually empty by the film's end; an entire classroom population which is accosted simultaneously by hiccups;  Some of these are more apparently [[satire|satirical]] of [[popular culture|pop culture]]: to comfort himself, Laurie repeats commercial refrains, such "[[Rice-A-Roni]], the [[San Francisco]] treat"; his girlfriend, Dot ([[Emily Hampshire]]), does a survey on "how the clothes you wear define you" - one she both detests and is obsessed by.  These events are framed by the pretextual plot of Laurie conquering his fears &mdash; and by extension, the fears of those around him. However, by the film's end, it is doubtful that anything has been changed or achieved.

Teja was sure this man was a writer when he gave Teja four books ready to be published. After a short conversation Teja found out that these books were actually his. Teja thought this was a joke when stranger finally introduced himself as Luka Laban (played by [[Bora Todorović]]), a former officer of State Security. He also found out that Luka followed him for ten years, day after day, in order to make the daily report about his movements. After Luka retired he put all his daily reports together and wrote four books about Teja's movements for last ten years.  Teja was surprised when he heard that wherever he was, Luka was behind him. As they continue to talk, the last ten years of their lives begin to appear. Teja heard that Luka intended to kill him during the [[March 9, 1991 protest|anti-regime demonstrations in March 1991]].

In the New Year eve of 1997 Luka found out that his daughter Ana, who was Teja's student, was dating Teja, what gave him personal interest to ruin Teja's life. He made photos of these two which he used to ruin his marriage. Because of these photos Teja lost his job as a university professor. Teja reminded Luka that his daughter finished in a hospital after she suffered nervous breakdown and left university. When he asked Luka why he did that Luka answered: "Yes, she left the university but she also left you." After that Ana went to live in Canada and Luka promised to her that one day he is going to have a friendly conversation with Teja.  Luka than opened the suitcase he brought with himself. The suitcase was full of ordinary things Teja lost during last ten years mostly when he was completely drunk. Luka than started telling him stories related to things he lost. The more he was talking Teja started to remember the miserable moments of his life for last ten years.

Puppet Master: The Legacy
 The film begins with a rogue agent, Maclain, in one of the rooms in the [[Hotel Green|Bodega Bay Inn]], reading Toulon's [[diary]], hoping to find some secret to the [[formula]]. The diary bursts into flames. As  Maclain enters the basement, she finds a man named Eric Weiss talking to the last Toulon puppets: [[Blade (Puppet Master Character)|Blade]], [[Pinhead (Puppet Master)|Pinhead]], [[Jester (Puppet Master)|Jester]], [[Tunneler (Puppet Master)|Tunneler]], and [[Six Shooter (Puppet Master)|Six-Shooter]]. Eric explains that he knew Toulon before he died, and that he swore he wouldn't pass it to anyone else. Maclain threatens Eric with a gun. Eric then takes out a tape recorder, and plays a recording that Toulon left him.  Cut back to present day, Eric reveals that his real name is Peter Hertz, the boy who was saved by Toulon in [[Puppet Master III: Toulon's Revenge]]. After the conversation, Maclain, stressed out, shoots Eric in the [[knee]], knowing he knows more about Toulon and his puppets' bloody legacy, such as Toulon's suicide. Eric believes that Toulon only killed those who deserved to die. Maclain, however, brings up the subject of the murders that happened with the [[parapsychologists]] in ''[[Puppet Master II]]''. After the argument over whether Toulon was good or bad, Maclain still threatens to shoot Eric with the gun. Eric tells her that the puppets fought a war that was a hell of a lot tougher than anything they ever known, and then he plays another tape recording of Toulon, which tells about Sutek's attempt to steal the [[elixir]] formula to kill the Puppet Master.   After the recording finished, Maclain tells Eric that she knows everything about Rick, because before she came to the hotel, she went to Rick's house where she found Toulon's diary. When Rick didn't cooperate to give up the diary, she shot him and his friends four times and took the diary with her. Seeing that there's one last recording, Maclain threatens him to play it. The recording talks about how there's always someone discovering Toulon's secret, even after his supposed [[death]], always someone who didn't fully understand what a gift, or a ''[[Curse of the Puppet Master|Curse]]''...the formula for the puppets really was. After the recording, Pinhead throws a mallet at Maclain's head and Eric shoots her in the heart with her own gun, for trying to take over the puppets. Maclain, minutes away from death, explains that's not what she wants, and she tells Eric that when the puppets brought Toulon back to life, he resumed his final experiment, the one he started before he committed suicide: Soul Transference.   Maclain then explains that she's not here for the secret of bringing the puppets to life to sell it to the open market, she's there to know what makes them die for good. Maclain finally explains: Toulon and ALL of the Puppet Masters that followed in his footsteps created immortals, souls trapped in wooden bodies, living every day in agony, wanting revenge on their Puppet Master, whose title now belongs to Eric. After explaining, Maclain drops dead on the floor. Eric hears something behind, turns around, and sees the immortals that the Puppet Masters have created (off-screen). He points the gun at them and pulls the trigger. Then a note appears: ''"The producers would like to thank all the cast and crew that helped make the Puppet Master series a tremendous success over the years"'', ending the series with the puppets themselves to fight off the Puppet Masters' unholy creations.

The R.M.
 Jared Phelps returns home from his mission in [[Wyoming]] to find a world very different from the one he left two years ago.  This movie opens with a send-off at the [[airport]] full of family and friends of Elder Phelps.  He serves a two-year mission in the Wyoming, [[Evanston, Wyoming|Evanston]] South Mission.  The opening credits are shown by using instant photographs.  They also show Elder Phelps going from a greenie (new missionary), to district leader, to zone leader and finally to an assistant to the mission president.  Upon returning home, things don't go so well.  His parents thought that he was coming home the following month, so no one is there to meet him at the airport.  He didn't receive the letter that his family had moved, so he is surprised by the greeting of the new homeowner in the form of a [[karate]] kick while he is in the shower. (He later refers to this as being, "Kung-fued by a naked ninja" )  His bed is now occupied by a [[Student exchange program|foreign exchange student]] from [[Tonga]]. When he is reunited with his parents, he discovers his mother is pregnant. Jared's girlfriend, who promised to wait for him to return, is getting married in two weeks.  The jewelry store where he bought the ring won't take it back.  And his former employer who promised to give him a job upon his return has sold the business and started an [[Internet]] enterprise and the only job opening is to mine [[diamond]]s in [[South Africa]].  Things get worse from there. He is rejected from BYU. He quickly goes through a series of jobs, and even considers selling knives.  He develops a romantic relationship with Kelly, the daughter of H. Ronald Powers, a [[general authority]] that, to his embarrassment, he is unfamiliar with (despite the fact that he gave a "great talk" last October in [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]], whom everyone seems to refer to). On a date with Kelly, Jared's mother goes into labor and has a boy. He also gets [[boil]]s, and eventually gets arrested due to the actions of a friend.  Because of the arrest, he is fired from his job and released from his church calling as [[Quorum (Mormonism)#Local Priesthood Quorums|elders quorum]] president.  He has to seriously consider whether to lie and keep him and his friend out of jail, or to tell the truth and send himself and/or his friend to jail. In the end, he decides to tell the truth, and is ultimately cleared of all charges, but his friend must face some time in jail.  Later, Jared gives a talk at church about how his mission blessed his life in ways he didn't expect. He decides to take night classes and reapply for BYU in the fall. After some time dating Kelly, the two are seen in a jewelry shop to exchange Jared's old ring for a new one, as they are now engaged.  
Pyar Hi Pyar Mein
  The plot, though interesting and certainly a change from the normal which tends to be either slapdash comedy or highly predictable stuff, is perhaps too radical for the digestion of the still largely conservative public. Unknown faces, a couple of which often wear deadpan expressions, expounded the problem.  The opening scene is impressive enough with a well-executed dance-tableau performance of The story of life by students of an art academy. Sara ([[Anchal]]) and Ashal ([[Ashal]]) are partners in the academy and in love with each other. Ashal has dreams of striking it rich before settling down to marital bliss and fate brings him face-to-face with the one person that is determined to make his dreams become a reality - Nisha ([[Nisha (Pakistan actress)|Nisha]]).  Nisha, enamoured by Ashal, sweeps him off to Dubai to establish a branch of the academy there. Ashal gets involved with her, although he still loves Sara, and Nisha manages to create enough hurdles between them to make Sara marry a loving business tycoon, Akhter. [[Meera (actress)|Meera]] makes a guest appearance as a dancer. Ashal spots her dancing at a nightclub and begins to pursue her. And all this before the interval!  After a couple of dance sequences, Ashal discovers that the woman he has been pursuing is not Sara, but her twin sister Anchal. Before he can think of starting with her where he had left off with Sara, he discovers she has a fiance, Sameer. He brings her to Pakistan, fiance in tow, to reunite with her mother and sister and discovers that Sara has become a widow. She gives birth to a son and her step mother-in-law gets her kidnapped to coerce her to marry her younger son, so as to keep the wealth in the family.  Some of the developments that take place are totally unnecessary and one is left wondering why they were incorporated to begin with, except perhaps to give the required footage to the film. For instance, the sole reason for Anchal's presence seems to be an excuse to choreograph two glamorous songs on the twin sister, since they couldn't possibly be depicted on her as a widow. The presence of a villain, Grenwich, also appears to be superfluous, for he arrives and disappears without making any difference to the plot.  Other than the fact that there is simply too much happening, the one aspect that detracts from the film is that some of the concepts introduced are largely unacceptable. Nisha could well have played the role of 'the other woman' without having to resort to drinking, smoking and sleeping with the hero, or for that matter, kidnapping him, brief as it may have lasted. And similarly, there were no justifiable reasons for Ashal to be drinking and sleeping around - other than the fact that he didn't have to strive hard for either.  While it is heartening to see new and attractive faces finally gracing the silver screen, and Nisha and Sameer definitely have talent, both Ashal and Anchal need to be groomed further. Anchal has a tendency to speak with her eyes shut and both of them have frequently delivered their lines sans expression. [[Anchal]]'s make-up, especially as Sara, is horrendous, while she looks considerably better in her role as the twin sister.  The costumes are pleasing to the eye and the only grouse one has is Anchal's insistence on wearing heavy walking shoes under most of her slinky, sexy outfits. The songs are well choreographed and have catchy lyrics, especially Dharak dharak keh kehta hai dil and the cinematography is slick. One does wonder why there was such hype about leading film stars for a guest role, as [[Faheem Burney]] stated. A dance sequence in the film that eventually went to [[Meera (actress)|Meera]], though it was an enjoyable number, didn't strike one as anything particularly spectacular.  On the whole, one feels that the basic fault with [[Fahim Burney]]'s direction lies in his treatment of the film as a bold television play. Otherwise, the film is packaged well and other than the one time when Ashal and Nisha are shown as speaking on stage without mikes, he has been quite meticulous about details and logical sequencing of events. Maybe he'll be wiser the next time round.  
Qayamat: City Under Threat
 The [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI) has assigned the case of three terrorists to Akram Sheikh ([[Sunil Shetty]]). The three terrorists are two brothers Ali and Abbas Ramani ([[Sanjay Kapoor]] and [[Arbaaz Khan (Indian actor)|Arbaaz Khan]]) and their common girlfriend Laila ([[Isha Koppikar]]). As a part of a plan hitched by a corrupt Pakistani general, Ali, Abbas, and Laila hitch a plan to extort money from the Indian government. They take control of Elphinston Jail, in the city of Mumbai and using the help of a corrupt scientist, Gopal ([[Chunky Pandey]]) (a part of a team headed by Rahul ([[Aashish Chaudhary]]), investigating the effects of a deadly virus which could kill any living organism within a 3-kilometer radius.), they load three missiles with the virus. They then take a group of 213 tourists hostage in the jail and demand a ransom of 1500 crores from the government within 24 hours, failing which they will release the missile into major water bodies in Mumbai, thus creating an apocalypse (Qayamat).  Akram asks the Chief Minister to allow him to release Rachit ([[Ajay Devgn]]), a man who has previous experience of escaping from Elphinston Jail, a feat which has never been accomplished in history, to get help in entering the jail, through the very route which he had used to escape. Rachit is a man who has been silent for a long time now, owing to the fact that the love of his life, Sapna ([[Neha Dhupia]]) was killed the night he was arrested. The main point of note here was that Rachit was an associate of Ali and Abbas and had been double-crossed by them, leading to his arrest. In turn, they had killed Sapna. However, unknown to Rachit, she was still alive. Akram and his team, which includes Rahul use all the help, they can to enter the jail through, first, an underwater route, and then a maze of tunnels through which Rachit had escaped. they successfully get to the septic tank of the jail but a mole in the CBI gives the news of the team's arrival to Ali and Abbas, whose men kill the whole team in a brutal gunfight, resulting in Akram's death as well. Rahul and Rachit are the only ones that are alive.  Rachit suffers from severe mental trauma, the effects of which can be seen every 12 hours, whereby he starts hallucinating and sees odd shadows everywhere. He has even lost his power of speech due to this.  These effects are taken away, when Sapna, who is now at the CBI headquarters, calls him on a walkie-talkie and assures him of her true love and the fact that she is indeed alive. This is enough for Rachit as he gets up and single-handedly takes out all of Ali and Abbas's men, one by one.  Meanwhile, Rahul is also able to disarm the missiles one by one. However, while Rachit is taking out some more of the men, Ali gets to the last missile and tries to release it. Laila captures Rahul on gunpoint saying she will kill Rahul if Rachit does not leave Abbas. Rahul asks Rachit to let him die, but, Rachit shoots Rahul in the leg. Rahul falls down and Rachit shoots Laila in the head. Laila dies. Rahul disarms the missile and kills Ali after firing the rocket straight at him. Thus, the city is saved in the nick of time. At the end of the film, Rachit reunites with Sapna and reveals that he can talk.

He is attracted to a high school football team and often passes by their practices. One day, a football flies outside the field and lands near Radio. Radio takes the ball, deaf to the demands to return it by a student athlete on the other side of the fence. Sometime later, the team members tie up Radio and lock him inside the gear shed. The team's coach, Harold Jones, hears the team members throw balls at the shed and goes to comfort Radio. He punishes the team for their actions. Upon meeting Radio on the streets another day, Coach Jones asks Radio to visit and help at training. Coach Jones returns Radio to his home, where he meets Radio's mother. It is revealed that Radio has a brother named Walter, who does not live with them, and that their father died a few years prior.  Coach Jones begins spending more and more time with Radio, which concerns the fathers of many of the team members. One of the fathers in particular, Frank Clay, suggests that the coach should stop associating with Radio as he could be a distraction to his own son's success on the team. Coach Jones resists, and he later reveals to his daughter that this resistance was partially due to a childhood incident in which Jones did not do anything to help a mentally disabled boy who was locked under a house.  While distributing Christmas presents to nearly everyone in the town, Radio is questioned by a police officer as to where he got the presents. The officer, seeing that Radio is unable to communicate properly and unaware of his mentally disabled state, places him under arrest on charges of possession of stolen property and takes him down to the police station. In fact, the presents had been given to Radio by the townspeople. After the officer roughly locks up Radio in a jail cell, he looks for his information. The other officers, taking pity on Radio after seeing him cry, take him into the staff-room to watch a basketball game together. Coach Jones soon arrives, releasing Radio. The offending officer is punished by having to spend the day with Radio to deliver the rest of the presents.  Radio eventually takes classes in the high school, and it is apparent that he never completed a formal education. After struggling, Radio eventually learns to read. Though well-liked by most of the students at school, Radio is still ridiculed by Frank's son Johnny and his friends. On one occasion, Johnny tricks Radio into entering the girls locker room. This triggers an incident with the School Board that puts Radio's ability to attend the high school at risk. However, Radio refuses to tell Coach Jones who told him to do it, leading Jones to say, "You're a better man than me, Radio." Coach Jones later figures out that it was Johnny who told Radio to go into the girls locker room, and punishes Johnny for his actions by ordering him to sit out from the basketball team for an indefinite time. After Coach Jones tells Johnny that Radio did not rat him out, Johnny begins to respect Radio and doubt his father's impressions. Radio's mother suddenly dies of a heart attack bringing severe agony to Radio, who destroys his bedroom in a fit of grief. However, with continued support and consoling from Coach Jones, Radio eventually heals from the loss.  After the football team's season ends, Frank places the blame for the team's inability to win on Radio being a distraction, and demands for Jones to end his association with him. In a meeting with the townspeople, Jones talks about how Radio has really been a blessing for the community, showing how people should treat one another.

Raining Cats and Frogs
 Ferdinand Bauer lives with his wife Juliette on a farm on a hill with their adoptive son (actually his grandson), Tom.  The film begins when they agree to care of Lili, his other granddaughter, whom they will look after while Lili's parents travel by car and trailer to Africa on a safari. Lili's parents own a zoo, which they also leave in the care of Ferdinand and Juliette.  On the farm, there is a small pond. The frogs in the pond are restless, as their calculations have shown that the Earth is about to be flooded for forty days and forty nights. The frogs initially are reluctant to thell them, since they cannot change anything but decide to tell Tom and Lili, so that they can warn people.  Suddenly the flood starts, apparently washing away all live on Earth. The zoo animals escape to the barn which is on top of a hill, the foundations of the building are torn away by the flood and floats on a huge tractor tire on the water. Ferdinand, an experienced sailor, takes on the role of the captain and every one agrees that they will only survive if they stick together. When the rains finally stop all the animals are very hungry. Ferdinand has stored 28 tons of potatoes which he uses to make French fries, but the carnivores are unhappy because they cannot survive only on French fries but Ferdinand convinces the carnivores to yield in view of the greater good of everyone on the floating barn.  A tortoise appears, injured by a crocodile attack and has lost a leg. Lili befriends the tortoise and Tom notices that she has kept her distance from him ever since. The fox and the lion grudge about their lot of having to feed on potatoes when a voice tells them that they should raise against such decision but the lion prevails in that they should respect the captain's law, however after a few days their huger gets the best of them and they attack a sheep and Ferdinand vanishes the carnivores to a bathing tub that floats behind the barn. In the meantime, Ferdinand and Tom talk about his father, who was the machinist at Ferdinand's boat, who was very handy with them. Ferdinand manages to "motorize" the barn by modifying an old tractor engine to oars at the side of the building.  The tortoise tells Lili her story of how she saved her life and three of her eggs despite losing her limb to the crocodiles, who attacked everyone, including humans, at the time of the flod and convinces Lili that her parents died. Ferdinand and Juliette adopt Lili as their own. At night the carnivores notice that the tortoise is actually in cahoots with the crocodiles to feed the entire barn to them, but she must get rid of the captain. The carnivores are initially unconvinced, but they latter agree to mutiny and in the ensuing fight they throw Ferdinand off the board in a barrell and Juliette jumps off after him. The rest of the animals and the children are locked away at the bottom of the barn. Lili sees now that she fell into the tortoise's trap, who had told her that she would not be her friend if she continued being friends with Tom.  The children and the animals hear a commotion upstairs, which is the result of the carnivores feeding on the poultry, so the children decide to climb on the giraffe's neck, but are overcome by the others. The tortoise convinces most of the carnivores to eat the children next, only the lion and one of the cats are reluctant to do it, but the majority decision is that they are next. The tortoise explains that she is taking revenge on humans because they have pursued and killed her family and her kind for their flesh, eggs and to make luxury items with their carapace, telling the children that the eggs that she keeps in her carapace are not her own but the crocodiles' who believe that the humans had eaten them and thus prompting the attacks on them. Meanwhile, one of the cats convinces the other to help the children, since humans had taken them in when they had no home and if this senseless flesh-eating frenzy continues, there is no guarantee that the kittens inside her womb will be safe.   The tortoise signals the crocodiles to start the attack, the cat frees the children who manage to start the tractor engine and escape from the crocodiles, who are in pursuit of the barn. In the meantime Ferdinand finally manages to wake up and sees that the barn is coming at them at full speed. The tortoise finally manages to break the engine down and the barn seems finally at the mercy of the crocodiles, but the elephants manage to rip the carapace off the tortoise and everyone sees that it is not a female but a male, therefore the eggs cannot be his. As the tortoise is trying to explain his way out the situation, the eggs hatch and out of them come little crocodiles, proving the case against the tortoise. The tortoise is at the mercy of the angry animals who are about to throw him off to the crocodiles, but Ferdinand arrives at the last minute and berates everyone for their violent conduct. He resumes his command as captain, crocodiles leave after acknowledging that they were duped by the tortoise, who remains caparaceless in the barn.  A few days go by and the kittens are born. The general happiness is interrupted when the elephants, who have been unable to move during all their time in the barn, appear at the door to congratulate the proud mother. Ferdinand walks out of the barn and sees that the water has finally gone and that dryland is finally there. There is a lot of mist and as it lifts, all the people and animals at the barn see that there are more boats on the top of other mountains and that there are many survivors. Later that night all celebrate but a huge light interrupts the festivities, it is a large car driven by Lili's parents, who tell the rest that the flood did not take place in Africa.  
The Rain Children
 Since the Great Sundering, the world has been divided into two parts : the land of fire, a vast desert inhabited by the people of the Pyross, and the land of water, inhabited by the Hydross. The Pyross have red skin, and stocky, muscular features; water burns their flesh and rain is lethal to them. They use sunstones (shining crystals) as both money and energy source. During the rainy season, they stay locked in their city of stone and cannot get out; they protect themselves from the rain and from the wild water dragons who wander into Pyross territory during the rainy season. The Hydross, on the other hand, have curvy features and blue or turquoise skin, and water is vital to them. In summer, the Hydross turn into stone statues and are thus vulnerable, while the Pyross can get out and venture into Hydross territory to destroy as many Hydross statues as they can before the rainy season starts again. The two people know very little about one another, and they cannot even touch one another, as the contact of Hydross skin burns the Pyross, and vice versa.  Peace between Hydross and Pyross seems impossible, but two young people, a Pyross named Skan and a young Hydross, Kallisto, meet one another in improbable circumstances and try desperately to stop the eternal war.  
Recess: All Growed Down
 In this movie, the ''Recess'' gang remembers how they all met back in [[kindergarten]]. It begins with T.J. and four of his gang looking forward to starting a game of [[croquet]] with Mikey's new set, but they needed an empty space to do so.  They find a nice quiet piece of ground, and are about to set up when they are abruptly captured by Kindergartners. They are surprised that the Kindergartners seem to no longer like the gang. The reason is that the Kindergartners have a new leader called Chief Stinky who despises Big Kids and because of being bigger, Chief Stinky orders the other Kindergartners around and forces them to hold the gang as prisoners.  Desperate to be released, the gang starts telling stories of past episodes to make the Kindergartners remember how well they used to get along. T.J. tells the first story about when he encountered the Kindergartners which is from the episode "The Legend of Big Kid." After that Gretchen tells them the story about the "pee wee pals" from the episode "Wild Child." After that Mikey asks Tubby to remember how the two became friends in the episode "The Kindergarten Derby." But despite all three stories being told, the Kindergartners are still too afraid of Chief Stinky to admit that they remember.  After a while Gus comes outside from the nurse's office and starts looking for the gang, only to get captured as well. To convince Hector (the Kindergartner in pajamas) about how he was his "safety man", he tells a story about when he first went to Kindergarten. At first the other gang members remind him that he didn't come to the school until the gang was in 4th grade (a reference to their memories in the episode "The New Kid"), and besides, none of them even want to think about when they were savage Kindergartners. But Gus points out that long before, he briefly had been a Kindergarten student.  In his story, his parents bring him to [[Third Street Elementary School]]. Gus is a wild child and thinks that the other students he meets will be just like him, but to his surprise everyone is acting well behaved in class, and Ms. Finster reads them a story. When Recess begins all the children are quiet and nobody acts like they do in the future. Gus notices Gretchen just plays with rocks and never gives anyone ideas, Vince just runs around quietly, the digger twins just play in a sandbox, the Ashleys do not laugh or say "Scandalous!" roughly or hang upside down and Spinelli is a timid little girl with a doll. Gus then meets one little boy with a red cap whose name is Theodore Jasper Detweiler. Gus befriends him  and gives him his nickname: T.J.  Shortly afterward, Gus realizes that everyone is being neat and behaved because they are afraid of Mikey who acts as a monstrous bully, and Randall is the one who tames him. Gus is enraged and he later reveals the reason that Mikey acted like a monster is because Randall told him lies and said he was his only friend. Mikey is actually friendly and explains that Randall was behind everything because he wanted to take control of the whole grade and have everything belong to him.  Then Gus convinces all the Kindergartners that they should be like him and be wild like a normal Kindergartner, then all the kids begin to act like their future selves, Vince becomes more active, Gretchen starts passing her theories to other kids, Spinelli realizes that she is a very tough girl and T.J. becomes brave and adventurous. Randall is horrified and quickly tells Ms. Finster that everyone is all messy. Miss Finster is furious and demands to know who did this. When she finds that it was Gus, she takes him to Principal Prickley's office. However, T.J. and the gang form a plan and rescue Gus, leaving Spinelli's doll in the chair he was sitting in. Gus is forced to leave the school the next day.  After he finishes his story, Gus tells Hector that he and all the other Kindergartners should stand up to Stinky. So Hector quickly trips Stinky, making him cry and as the others rejoice, Captain Sticky makes Hector the leader. The Gang are then released. T.J. and the gang tell Gus that it was brilliant to make up such a story. The others find it hilariously implausible. Gus begrudgingly agrees that he just imagined it all and then the gang starts to spend the rest of the recess having fun together.  However, Ms. Finster, who is watching, tells Randall to keep an eye on Gus, and then vows that someday she will get her revenge on him for what he did, hinting that Gus' story was true, after all.

The Recruit
 When James Clayton was young his father was killed in 1990 in a Peruvian plane crash for unknown reasons. In college, Clayton has computer interests and analytical skills that when he goes job hunting are sought by industry and government. A software program he has helped developed is called "Spartacus". It can hijack nearby computers through a wireless network. Senior [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] instructor Walter Burke attracts Clayton's interest in the agency by saying that his father worked for the agency.  He starts being evaluated and trained at the [[Camp Peary|Farm]], a CIA training facility, in skills that would be needed by agents. He comes in contact with another trainee, Layla Moore. During one of the exercises Clayton and Moore are kidnapped. He is tortured by men that say Moore is also being tortured. The torture stops when Clayton is about to give up identities of people associated with the farm. The program trainees have seen the torture exercise Clayton was subjected to on closed-circuit television. The trainees are cautioned that the lesson to be learned from it is that they should not be caught.  Burke makes contact with Clayton and shares with him his suspicion that Moore is a [[sleeper agent|sleeper]] and that Burke is hoping the friendship between Clayton and Moore can be used to catch her. Clayton finds that she is removing the software program in pieces. Burke arranges for Clayton to work at CIA Headquarters to monitor Moore. Clayton finds that Moore is taking the software offsite on a [[USB flash drive]] hidden in a secret compartment in her coffee pot.  Clayton watches Moore as she passes a note to her contact, and then he follows the contact through [[Union Station (Washington, D.C.)|Union Station]]. When the contact fires at Clayton, shots are returned that kill him. Clayton finds out that the contact is Zack, another trainee and non-official cover. Clayton pursues Moore and confronts her about what he knows is going on. Moore tells him that she is a CIA agent assigned to see if the software she sought could be removed from Headquarters. Clayton is confused but eventually accepts what Moore has said.  Clayton reports back to Burke, who congratulates Clayton on passing the final test. Clayton responds by demanding to know why Zack was killed. Burke tries to pass off the killing as staged since Clayton's gun was loaded with blanks. Clayton fires his gun at the back window of the car to verify what Burke has said and when the window bursts Clayton knows that Burke is lying. Burke chases Clayton through an abandoned building, and boasts that he organized the scheme to sell the virus for $3 million.  Clayton escapes long enough to set up a laptop and load the "Spartacus" software with the intent to broadcast Burke's confession. When the CIA comes to arrest Clayton for Zack's death, Burke, believing that he is finally caught, rails about his dissatisfaction with his career. The agents conclude that Burke is the real traitor and instruct the officers on site to target him instead. Burke realizes too late that Clayton did not have the time to set up the Spartacus software and that the agents were targeting Clayton until he made his speech. Having incriminated himself, he reiterates that he was an excellent recruiter, having correctly determined that Clayton was CIA material. He then draws his gun, forcing the agents to kill him. Moore consoles Clayton before he rides back with the agents for debriefing. In the van, Assistant Director of Operations Dennis Slayne makes a comment suggesting that Clayton's father was an NOC agent when he died, and Clayton now realizes that some of Burke's statements had in fact been true.

The Reckoning (2003 film)
 In 1380 England, the priest Nicholas ([[Paul Bettany|Bettany]]) flees his village when found [[in flagrante delicto]] with a married woman. During flight he witnesses a group that has [[Euthanasia|euthanased]] a member to give relief from his long recurring internal pain. He becomes known to the group and is captured. The group is a travelling acting troupe who think he is a robber and they explain the killing. Reluctantly, they allow him to join their troupe to replace the member killed. On their journey to the next town they are forced to travel to a new district after a collapsed bridge stops them taking their normal route and to mend the cart that carries their goods although they have no money. The troupe reach a strange town with castle under reconstruction and find a woman being sentenced to death for killing a boy upon the testimony of [[Benedictine|Benedictine Monk]] Simon Damian ([[Ewen Bremner]]). The troupe perform a biblical [[passion play]], but, as told by the group's leader Martin ([[Willem Dafoe]]), so few attend they are unable to bury the dead troupe member and fix their cart.  Martin makes the decision to perform a new play based on the events surrounding the child murder. He and Nicholas visit the condemned mute woman in the dungeons coming away with the strong belief she is innocent. The woman is portrayed a seductress which infuriates the crowd and the parents of the dead boy since he was virtuous and too physically strong to be overtaken by the woman. [[Norman people|Norman]] Lord de Guise ([[Vincent Cassel]]) watches from the castle and sends the sheriff to clear the square by force. Crowds people on leaving the square tell the troupe about more details of the death or disappearance of boys.  The troupe is told to leave town by first light, but Nicholas's convictions urge him to first hand determine what happened to the boy. So in the night the body is uncovered, and it is found subjected to sodomy before death and exposed to [[Bubonic plague|the plague]]. [[Richard II of England|the King]]'s [[High sheriff|Justice]] and his squire come upon Nicholas and they share some of their suspicions. Nicholas is then forced to leave town but before long returns under disguise as a monk. The troupe remains on their journey to [[Durham, England|Durham]] but Martin relinquishes his role as troupe leader and returns.  Nicholas is aware of the transitions in death from limber to rigor and return. He visits the monk who testified at trial to say all that he is aware. The monk reveals he had nothing to do with the death, intimating he is protecting someone else. Nicholas leaves and is found by Martin. The two of them then learn from the King's Justice that the monk has been found dead, and with it, any chance evidence concerning de Guise proclivity and also is planning a revolt to seize the English throne.  The sheriff reveals that it seems that wherever de Guise goes, boys disappear. Nicholas then obtains more evidence to prove that the woman is not the real killer (the body was found with [[rigor mortis]], which meant the killing was more recent). The execution is set but before it can be carried out the troupe has returned and seized the scaffold as stage for their new play based on the most recent information. The crowd is incensed toward de Guise and the guards are called out again to clear the town square forcing the actors to the church and unknown to them, de Guise is there performing an act of penitence.  Nicholas presents the evidence to de Guise, who admits everything with an air of invulnerability knowing that he is untouchable under the [[feudal system]]. When de Guise asks Nicholas about his sins, Nicholas confesses he murdered the husband of the woman he was caught with after he attacked Nicholas. When leaving, de Guise learns from Nicholas he has been exposed to the plague. De Guise then stabs Nicholas, who stumbles outside the church. De Guise walks back to his castle through the throng of townsfolk, unaware of the revelations of the new play. He reaches the gate to find that the [[portcullis]] is down and he is surrounded by the crowd, who lynch him and set fire to the castle.  The new authorities in the town hope the reason for the deaths will be forgotten. The King's Justice promises the work of Nicholas will be told to the king, but Sarah replies the sheriff that Nicholas didn't act for the king's sake, but for the wrongly accused, and his own redemption. Martin announces that Nicholas will live on in their new play, which will be presented when they reach Durham. The troupe then departs while the castle is burned to the ground.  
Recess: Taking the Fifth Grade
  The movie is divided into three different episodes/sections.  ===No More School=== The first episode begins with the Recess gang starting the fifth grade. At first thought to be the best year ever, they soon discover otherwise. First, Ms. Finster becomes the fifth grade teacher instead of the desired Mrs. Milkie, who had transferred. This is combined with their lockers being taken away, the cafeteria food being substandard, and the playground being removed.  In response to these atrocities, T.J. goes to see Principal Prickly, who says that he couldn't do anything because it was the school board's decision. Consequently, T.J. claims that he would stay in his room and never go to school again. Word soon gets out, compelling every student at Third Street to gather at T.J.'s house. Prickly tries to compel T.J. to come down, but the school board finds out and dispatches Mr. White (from the episode "The Story About Whomps").  Mr. White claims that he'll allow T.J. to remain in his room, but promises that his friends will suffer for it. T.J. then seemingly concedes, allowing Mr. White in his room, only to find that T.J. climbed on top of the roof. Unfortunately, T.J. almost falls off the roof, but Prickly saves him. It is then that Prickly decides to join T.J.'s protest.  The board members find out that nobody likes the policies, but they were just things that the board members were too afraid to stand up to. They then vote to alleviate the policies, much to the dismay of Mr. White, having been beaten a second time not only by a kid, but by the same kid. Afterwards, things at Third Street are returned to normal, aside from having Ms. Finster as a teacher.   ===Grade Five Club=== In the second episode of the movie, the gang is introduced to the fifth and sixth graders' club, where both grades can interact. At first T.J. and the gang think that they are going to like it (in part because Randall is banned for being a snitch), but they soon start getting sick of it. However, Mikey and Gus still like to hang out with the other fifth graders. T.J., Spinelli, Gretchen, and Vince start getting tired of the jokes everyone makes about the younger students. In response, they get King Bob (the former King) to get them into the fifth and sixth graders' club before everyone else arrives. But T.J. and the gang bring two first graders, Tubby and Hector, who were Mikey and Gus' respective friends. King Freddie II bans them from the Fifth and Sixth graders club, but they are glad that everything is back to normal.  ===A Recess Halloween=== In the third and final episode of the movie, Spinelli and her parents go to a pumpkin patch where Spinelli picks an ugly pumpkin for Halloween. Lawson and his gang are also at the patch, telling Spinelli that she is too old for Halloween and that they are only there to throw the pumpkins, not make them into lanterns. She too believes that she is too old for Halloween, and consequently asks her parents to leave. However, her parents tell her that they have to get a picture of her sitting on a giant pumpkin like they have done since she was a baby. Guilted into it by the baby pictures, Spinelli sits on the pumpkin, but it gives way and bursts under her weight. Seeing this, Lawson begins to laugh at Spinelli.  Back at school, T.J. and the gang are talking about Halloween, Gus stuck on what he is going to wear. Spinelli comes in and says that she is too old for Halloween, eating her lunch and going away. The gang remembers all the good times they had with her on Halloween.  Halloween finally comes and Spinelli's parents are going out while she is staying home. While she is watching a movie, the Diggers knock on the door, see her expression, and tell her that they will tell the other tweens to skip her house because she is not in the Halloween spirit. They shortly tell her about the experience they had with the Gordons. Spinelli explains to them that the Gordons are from Massachusetts. However, she tells them not to warn the other tweens so that she can pretend she is scared. When the next lot of tweens come and she pretends to be scared, the tweens are not meant to be scary. In return, she scares them by wearing a scary mask and screaming "Take candy and go to the next house". She then closes the door smiling. When the next group of tweens comes, she gives them tips for being dinosaurs by putting ketchup over their suits and telling them to roar from the stomach. The next trick-or-treater is a werewolf who howls and actually scares Spinelli. However, the werewolf takes off its mask and it is actually Miss Finster. She comes in looking for Spinelli's parents, giving her advice about Halloween and that some people, like her, never get too old for it. She then gives Spinelli her phone number in case her parents come home early, and then goes out trick-or-treating.  Meanwhile, T.J. and the gang are out trick-or-treating, Gus wearing toilet paper as a costume. Their worries over Spinelli have ruined the magic of Halloween, along with the discoveries that someone is giving out sugar-free sweets, a building they thought was a haunted jail is really a closed down [[Department of Motor Vehicles|DMV]], a zombie is really a robot, and gravestones are really just wood. They go home disappointed until Spinelli finds them and brings them to a home which they used to believe vampires inhabited. She persuades them to go in and the door locks behind them. Spinelli then goes into a door and screams while various monsters advance on T.J. and gang. One of them is the werewolf, who is once again Miss Finster in disguise and the other monsters are all the other teachers. They give the gang a heap of candy and the gang's Halloween spirit is restored, while outside Lawson and his gang are scared off by Miss Finster's wolf howl.  The film cuts later to another day of school where T.J. and the gang play a calm game of kicking the ball to each other during recess until the bell rings. As T.J. and his friends, along with Miss Finster and the other children, go inside the school to their classes, T.J. narrates that even though things change as they grow up, sticking to what they believe and staying true to themselves will make everything okay. And as Miss Finster is about to close the doors, T.J. says he's got a feeling that it'll be the best school year yet, waving to the audience and saying he really means it.

 This documentary from Robin Shou—who also hosts and participates in the film—takes a behind-the-scenes glance inside the stunt industry of Hong Kong, which is known for being riskier and less trick-oriented than its American counterpart.

Red Roses and Petrol
 Amid a haze of cigarette smoke and uneaten food, the family of Enda Doyle ([[Malcolm McDowell]]) gathers in Dublin for his wake.  A university librarian, poet, and complicated man, he has left behind a trail of unresolved issues, a [[dysfunctional family]], and a disturbing mystery.  Red Roses and Petrol, a darkly comic feature film by director Tamar Simon Hoffs, explores the emotional twists and turns of familial relationships.  Enda’s dazed widow, Moya (Olivia Tracey), anxiously prepares for the next day’s funeral with her still stuck-at-home, twenty-something daughter Medbh (Maeve) ([[Heather Juergensen]]), lending a loving hand.  Moya’s desperation to keep her family together and Medbh’s sharp tongue provide the backdrop for the arrival from New York of headstrong older sister Catherine ([[Susan Lynch]]), with her handsome but awkward boyfriend Tom ([[Greg Ellis (actor)|Greg Ellis]]) in tow.  They doubt that London-based Johnny ([[Max Beesley]]), the angry black sheep brother of the family, will appear at all.  Sorting through boxes of Enda’s books, the women discover a cache of self-recorded video diaries that might shed light on who Enda Doyle really was, and some of the secrets of his life that he was never able to share with them.  At the funeral, the daughters see a distraught young woman from the university, Helen ([[Catherine Farrell]]), rumored to be having an affair with Enda.  They’re stunned that she would show up so brazenly at a family gathering for the deceased Enda.  Returning home, they find Johnny emerging half-naked from the shower, after a quick tryst with a stewardess he met on his flight from London.  A brilliant, wounded slacker, Johnny manages to irritate everyone to the edge of violence with his biting and sarcastic recall of the family’s long buried memories.  Johnny’s confrontational behavior and bitter assessment of life with father, incite the clan into what can only be called unchecked family therapy.  Throughout the ensuing arguments, which reach a fevered pitch as the family gets inebriated waiting for guests to arrive for the wake, we learn about the powerful and ambiguous force that was Enda Doyle.  Finally, Catherine cannot contain herself and accuses Moya of being blind to her husband’s infidelity and by extension causing great harm to herself and her children.  In a surprising twist, Enda’s own videotapes give the family the answers they returned home to find.

Remake (2003 film)

Before the onset of war in the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], he sends a screenplay to a literary competition in [[France]].   In a parallel plot, we see the dramatization of Tarik's script: the true story of his father Ahmed Karaga, who is unprepared for the outbreak of World War II and ends up in a concentration camp, but manages to survive. In the present plot, Ahmed's drama is almost identically replayed in the fate of Tarik. Only the era and the conditions of suffering have changed.  In Sarajevo, Tarik is captured by the [[Army of Republika Srpska|Serbian army]] and is subjected to the cruel conditions of a labour camp, which differs little from a concentration camp. After an unsuccessful attempt to escape, a French film producer helps exchange Tarik for another prisoner and ensures transportation to [[Paris]].  There, where few know of the great tragedy that has struck [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], Tarik meets one of his tormentors.  The film explores the theme of revenge versus forgiveness, as well as the idea that history repeats itself and that those who do not learn from it are doomed to repeat it.

 The film is divided up to four short stories:  ===My Robot Baby=== A young Marcia hides in the closet from her parents' fighting due to a mistake she has made. Marcia apologizes when her mother finds her in the closet; her mother tells Marcia to never fall in love, get married, and have children. Twenty-five years later, Marcia is married to Ray and they are looking towards adopting a child. After going to an adoption clinic, they apply for an adoption trial where they take care of a robotic baby before they can adopt a human child. Marcia begins to struggle when she is alone to take care of the robot baby, as she becomes flustered with what to do when the baby cries. Marcia brings the robot baby to her father, a handyman, and sees if he can tamper with the electronics of the robot. However, Marcia’s father worries that the doctors of the adoption clinic will detect the alteration of the robot. Nonetheless, Marcia persists on getting the baby reprogrammed and leaves the baby to her father while Marcia goes to work. As Marcia comes home to the robot baby now automated, she attempts to talk to the baby. However, the robot baby goes berserk and attacks Marcia. Marcia finds the robot baby in the closet, then remembers her young self hiding in the closet as her own mother was angry. Marcia then cries and is able to hug her robot baby, finding closure to her past.  ===The Robot Fixer=== Bernice witnesses her son, Wilson, in a severe accident that left him in a coma. Upset, she heads to Wilson's apartment and cleans up the place with her daughter, Grace. Bernice finds Wilson's old toy robot collection and attempts to find the missing parts through yard sales and hobby shops. Throughout the search, Bernice remembers flashbacks of how little she really knows of Wilson, as the young Wilson would play with his robot toys and not hear Bernice's callings. As Bernice learns that Wilson will inevitably die, Bernice scrambles to find the last robot, specifically, a missing wing from the only "girl" robot her son's collection. (In a flashback, Bernice remembers carelessly vacuuming up the now missing wing). She finds the complete female robot shop at a local hobby shop, only to find its not for sale, as it is very rare. In an act of desperation, she steals the wing, attaches it to Wilson's toy, and pretends to fly it through the air, perhaps as a way to accept that her son is now truly gone, and is making his way toward heaven. To apologize for the theft, she sends all of Wilson's toys to the shop/collector, but keeps the angel like female robot as a way to stay connected to her son, even thought she now finally accepts his death.  ===Machine Love=== An office worker android, Archie, arrives at a workplace to do computer work. As he attempts to make acquaintance with people in the office workplace, he is rejected and shunned because he is a robot. Bob, the technician in charge of Archie, forgets to turn off Archie one night, letting him wander about the empty office complex after he finishes his work.

As the two robots meet, they talk to each other and interact in a sexual manner.  ===Clay=== John, an old sculptor, is told that he has only one year left to live. The doctors have recommended him to merge his consciousness into the digital world so he can live forever. He goes home and talks about his life expectancy to his wife (who has died in the past and is now a virtual hologram). The following day, John's son asks him to merge his consciousness in order for John to assist him, but John refuses as he wants to keep using his physical senses to make sculptures.

The Rock n' Roll Cops
 This film follows its lead character, ''Detective Jake Blade'' (played by Shaw) who is pursuing the Russian crime lord ''Rinaldi'' (played by Smith).    This film is traditional of Scott Shaw's directorial work in that it follows a non-linear storyline that it riddled with strange dialogue and unexpected edits, where the central characters leave behind the storyline and interact solely by the presentation of visual images in association with [[Techno music]]. This film also possesses the obvious references to [[Blaxploitation]] Cinema apparent in virtually all Scott Shaw films.

Angry, he confronts Walker and tells him  that he wants out of the business. Walker talks him into one last bounty - retrieve Walker's son Travis ([[Seann William Scott]]) from a small mining town in Brazil and Walker will give him enough money to open his own restaurant.  Beck accepts and leaves for Brazil.  When Beck arrives in the town of El Dorado he meets with the man running the mining operation, Cornelius Hatcher ([[Christopher Walken]]).  Hatcher gives Beck his blessing to grab Travis, but reneges when he finds out that Travis has discovered a missing golden artifact called "O Gato do Diabo”.  Beck confronts Hatcher and his men in the local bar and leaves with Travis.  On the way back to the airfield, Travis forces their [[Jeep]] off the road and into the jungle.  There he tries to escape but is re-captured by Beck.  After an unfortunate encounter with some local monkeys, the two find themselves in the camp of the local resistance movement.  At the resistance encampment, Travis convinces the rebels that Beck works for Hatcher and was sent to kill them all. After a prolonged fight, Beck gains the upper hand before the rebel leader Mariana ([[Rosario Dawson]]) intervenes. She wants Travis, as the Gato can be used to ensure the locals can free themselves from Hatcher. Hatcher suddenly attacks the camp, killing many rebels. Beck, Travis, and Mariana escape the camp and Beck makes Mariana a deal:  she helps him get Travis to the airfield in exchange for the Gato.  After some searching, Travis leads them to a cave behind a waterfall where the Gato is located.  They retrieve it and begin the journey back.  On the way back, Mariana chastises Travis for wanting to sell the artifact, but Travis argues that he actually did want to give it to a museum. Mariana gives the two men Konlobos, a toxic fruit that temporarily paralyzes the eater. As she tells Beck which direction the airfield is, she leaves them with the fire to keep the animals away. After waking up able to move, Beck hauls Travis to the airfield. The local pilot, Declan ([[Ewen Bremner]]), tells Beck that Mariana was captured earlier by Hatcher and will probably be killed. Travis pleads with Beck to help, and the two head into town to rescue her. Using a cow stampede for cover, the two begin their assault on Hatcher's goons. Travis becomes trapped by gunfire in a bus, and Beck saves him before the bus explodes.  Hatcher tells his brother to take Mariana and the Gato and flee, but they are stopped by Travis. Hatcher confronts Beck, who offers him the chance to leave town, which Hatcher initially refuses. After he is shot by the townspeople, Hatcher agrees to leave town, but eventually dies from his gunshot wounds. Travis gives the Gato to Mariana before leaving with Beck, who tells him that despite all they've been through he must still return Travis to the United States. Travis is delivered to his dad who begins to verbally and physically abuse him. Beck asks to celebrate with them and gives Walker and his men Konlobos. As they are paralyzed, Beck uncuffs Travis and the duo leave together, with Travis continuing to jokingly annoy Beck.  
Runaway Jury
 In [[New Orleans]], a failed [[day trader]] at a stock brokerage firm shows up at the office and opens fire on his former colleagues, then kills himself. Among the dead is Jacob Wood. Two years later, with attorney Wendell Rohr, Jacob's widow Celeste takes Vicksburg Firearms to court on the grounds that the company's gross negligence led to her husband's death.  During jury selection, jury consultant Rankin Fitch and his team communicate background information on each of the jurors to lead defense attorney Durwood Cable in the courtroom through electronic surveillance.  In the jury pool, Nick Easter tries to get himself excused from jury duty. Judge Frederick Harkin decides to give Nick a lesson in civic duty and Fitch tells Cable that the judge has now given them no choice, and that he must select Nick as a juror. Nick's congenial manner wins him acceptance from his fellow jurors, but Frank Herrera, a [[Marine (military)|Marine]] veteran, takes an instant dislike to him.  A woman named Marlee makes an offer to Fitch and Rohr: she will deliver the verdict to the first bidder. Rohr dismisses the offer, assuming it to be a tactic by Fitch to obtain a mistrial. Fitch asks for proof that she can deliver, though, which Nick provides. Fitch orders Nick's apartment searched, but finds nothing. Marlee retaliates by getting one of Fitch's jurors bounced. Nick shows the judge surveillance footage of his apartment being searched, and the judge orders the jury sequestered. Fitch then goes after three jurors with blackmail, leading one, Rikki Coleman, to attempt suicide.  Rohr loses a key witness due to harassment, and after confronting Fitch, decides that he cannot win the case. He asks his firm's partners for $10&nbsp;million. Fitch sends an operative, Janovich, to kidnap Marlee, but she fights him off and raises Fitch's price to $15&nbsp;million. On principle, Rohr changes his mind and refuses to pay. Fitch agrees to pay Marlee to be certain of the verdict.  Fitch's subordinate Doyle travels to Gardner, Indiana, where he discovers that Nick is really Jeff Kerr, a law school drop-out, and that Marlee's real name is Gabby Brandt. Gabby's sister died in a school shooting. The town sued the gun manufacturer and Fitch helped the defense win the case. Doyle concludes that Nick and Marlee's offer is a set-up, and he calls Fitch, but it is too late.  Nick receives confirmation of receipt of payment and he steers the jury in favor of the plaintiff, much to the chagrin of Herrera, who launches into a rant against the plaintiff, which undermines his support. The gun manufacturer is found liable, with the jury awarding $110&nbsp;million in [[general damages]] to Celeste Wood.  After the trial, Nick and Marlee confront Fitch with a receipt for the $15&nbsp;million bribe and demand that he retire. They inform him that the $15&nbsp;million will benefit the shooting victims in Gardner.  
Rugrats Go Wild
 The Rugrats go on an adventure through the safari. Tommy impersonates Nigel Thornberry, who is his role model and spoofs his nature show. However, the babies' broadcast is cut short when they come across a [[Siberian tiger|tiger]] and then a [[crocodile]], both of which threaten them.

When the families arrive at the dock, they miss the Lipschitz cruise. Tommy's father, Stu, has rented a ramshackle boat called the S.S. Nancy which he reveals to be their real mode of transportation, and their real vacation. The families are angered that Stu did not consult them on his plans, and soon the boat is flipped over by a wave during a tropical storm. Everyone is forced to abandon the ship and board a life raft as the ship sinks. Everyone blames Stu for causing all of this and lose hope of being saved. Things start looking up when Angelica sings about having hope on her karaoke machine (which resembles a toy piano) she brought, until Spike's tail accidentally knocks both her Cynthia doll and karaoke machine into the ocean,   The next morning, they arrive on a small, seemingly uninhabited island (possibly in [[Southeast Asia]]) and Angelica eventually finds her Cynthia doll on the beach. The adults argue about who should be the leader. When it gets out of hand, Betty suggests a test: she draws a circle around the fighting adults and tells everyone to step out of the circle, saying that it is the bad circle. They all step out and say that they all feel better, except Stu, and make Betty the leader, much to Stu's chagrin.  On the opposite side of the island is the famous globe-trotting family the Thornberrys (out to film a [[clouded leopard]]). Tommy, Chuckie, and the rest of the kids, except for Angelica, set off to find them, for they suspect they are somewhere on the island. Along the way, Chuckie gets lost and runs into the Thornberry's [[Tarzan]]-like child Donnie, who steals Chuckie's clothes.  Meanwhile, Eliza, the gifted Thornberry, is exploring about the [[jungle]] with Darwin, her [[chimpanzee]] companion and runs into Spike, the Pickles' dog. Since Eliza can talk to animals, Spike (now voiced by [[Bruce Willis]]) talks for the first time (although he spoke in Chuckie's dream sequence in the episode "In the Dreamtime"); he informs her that his babies are lost somewhere on the island. Under the impression that Spike means he is looking for puppies, Eliza (and a reluctant Darwin) agree to help him find them. Following a close encounter with Siri, an angry [[clouded leopard]] whom Spike believes to be just a regular [[Cat|domestic cat]], they learn that he meant the human babies.  Simultaneously, Eliza's father, Nigel, finds the lost babies. He heads in their direction but ends up tumbling down a hill and suffers [[amnesia]] after a coconut falls on his head. Angelica (going by "Angelitiki, the Island Princess") runs into Debbie, the teenage Thornberry, and takes off with Debbie in the Thornberry's all-purpose mobile communication vehicle (commvee). While distracted, the two girls accidentally sink the commvee.  With the other parents' help, Marianne Thornberry, the mother of Eliza and Debbie and the wife of Nigel, raises the commvee and uses the automatic-retrieval system to rescue Nigel, who has regained his memory, and the babies. They are reunited with their families and forgive Stu, and everyone finally gets on board the Lipschitz cruise. Spike vows never to lose his babies again.

Rosenstrasse (film)
 In the present day, a widow mourns the death of her husband. She covers up the TV set and all the mirrors in the house.  Her grown children are baffled by this behavior, asking why their mother has suddenly gone [[Orthodox Jewish]]. The mother will not discuss her past, but her daughter wants to know what happened. Learning of a woman (Lena) who "saved" her mother during the war, she goes to Germany to learn the whole story.  She finds Lena, who willingly reminisces about [[World War II]], about her situation and the mother's childhood as a [[Jew]] growing up in [[Germany]] during the war. Lena herself is a German woman whose Jewish husband was persecuted by the Nazis while the little girl (the widow mother) loses her own mother to the [[Nazi]] [[concentration camps]]. The principal focus of the film addresses what happened to those who were in a [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|mixed marriage]] ("[[Aryan]]"/Jewish).

A Rózsa énekei
 Autumn 1944. Yellow star, ghettos, Arrow Cross terror. The inhabitants of Hungary's capital, Budapest, await the tragic fulfilment of their fate with helpless resignation. However, above one of the city's villas, once a week in the evening the stars of hope sparkle, if only for a few minutes. This short time gives fresh heart to those hiding here and kindles hope in their tortured souls to live for another day. This mysterious power is none other than a beautiful song that can be heard at such times from the villa's tower room. Géza Halász, the villa's always jovial caretaker, believes no Jew has reason to fear while the owner of the voice, Imre Rose, the world-famous opera singer and a Jew himself, remains in Budapest and does not flee from the country in spite of his American, British, Swiss, Swedish and Vatican connections. Halász visits the singer every Friday to dine with him. After a while the marvellous, hope-inspiring concert starts, which is listened to by the hiding inhabitants of the house with enraptured faces through the villa's open dumb waiter. Already in the "palmy years of peacetime" Rose had competed with Csortos, the famous actor, for the title of "Budapest's Greatest Misanthrope". Thus it does not surprise anybody that the eccentric singer never, not even once, tries to make contact with his fellow Jews who took refuge in his house. And when Halász recounts that the singer swore within an hour of the Arrow Cross's seizing power that he would not utter a single word nor cross the threshold of his tower room until "Andrássy Avenue has been purged of this Arrow Cross scum", even the slightest suspicion about Rose's "invisibility" vanishes. Only a fourteen-year-old boy, Tommy, the caretaker's son, listens to the weekly song with curiosity combined with suspicion, and tries to find out about the secret of the tower room. As a result of the adolescent's persistent and undaunted inquiries, the opera singer's mystery is unveiled. Meanwhile, however, almost unnoticed, the events of the calamitous days, filled with excitement and cheerfulness, turn the boy into a truly adult man. The story of THE SONGS OF RÓZSA is based on true events.<ref name="imdb.com"></ref>  
Running on Karma
  Big ([[Andy Lau]]) was a [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist Monk]], but he gave up this occupation when he realized he could see a person's past life, which would mean he would be able to predict what would happen to that person because of Karma. Big then became a bodybuilder and worked in a [[strip bar]] when he ran into Lee Fung-yee ([[Cecilia Cheung]]). Lee was working as an undercover cop in the [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] which busted Big in his strip show, but Big became entangled in another police case to catch a murderer when he tried to escape.  While Big was running away from Lee's pursuit, he saw a police dog and has visions of the dog's previous life. The dog was previously a child who beat up dogs, and the dog was shot by a stray bullet meant for the criminal. This was the first time that Big showed his ability to see the past, and later saw the past life of Lee, a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] soldier killing civilians.  Big (after realizing that Lee was kind-hearted), decided to help her in the investigation of a homicide, but also swore to leave her after they solved the case. After Big had inspected the corpse, he saw the deceased's previous life. The deceased had betrayed the murderer in his previous life and hence killed by him in this life. Big also saw that in the previous life of the murderer, before the murderer died, he cut off a one-horn beetle's left arm and hence deduced that in the current life, there would be someone without a left arm who would help to find the present murderer. Big successfully helped the police to arrest the murderer and saved Lee's life in the process as well. Her karma gets broken as well but subsequently returned, as seen through Big's vision. He also stopped an angry police sergeant who was beating the murderer by saying to him, "One thought Heaven, One thought Hell"(一念天堂，一念地獄).  Lee, now realizing that she was, in her previous life, a Japanese soldier, made efforts to compensate for the atrocities she committed in her previous life. Deciding to repay Big before she dies, Lee decided to find Big's childhood friend's killer, and she thinks the killer is hiding the mountains somewhere. She went to the mountains and on the sixth day of her journey, she encounters the killer at a part of the mountains where Big never went to find his friend's killer. The killer runs away from her while she tries to help him. Then, the killer comes behind her, and drags her to a rocky place where she was hit by a rock in the head, and beheaded by the murderer. The whole incident was recorded by her video camera. The video camera was retrieved after a search party to look for her. Big saw the video after a police officer showed it to him and he gets angry and went to the mountains. When he was on the mountains, he heard Lee's watch. He followed the sound to her buried body in the ground and her head in a tree. He became enraged and pursued a man, presuming he is Lee's killer into an underground temple. Big, expecting to find the killer in the temple but found his future self, a killer, bloodthirsty and vengeful. They argued and fought and came to terms peacefully in meditation.  Big becomes a monk again and lives on the mountain. After five years, he meets his childhood friend's killer again, and in forgiveness, escorts him kindly to the police. In the end, at the "place where Big couldn't jump over," we see the positive karma that Lee cultivated and radiated ultimately saved Big.  
Saamy
 Aarusaamy  ([[Vikram (actor)|Vikram]]) is the Deputy Commissioner of Police of Tirunelveli who efficiently brings the city under control. Aarusaamy arrives at Tirunelveli after being in exile for some years after being wrongly accused of bribery by corrupt politicians. In an early scene in the film, he eats [[idli]] with beer and performs some drunken antics, which had a negative impact on the viewing public. At the outset, he pretends to be a corrupt cop by accepting bribes from the very influential Annachi. Later Saamy starts to rebel against him and the rest is about how he succeeds in overcoming the corrupt politicians.  Aarusaamy's father ([[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]]) who wanted to become a cop was unable to become due to corruption and takes care of agriculture for his living. But he wanted to make his son a cop. Vikram too passes the IPS examinations in merit, but was asked for bribe. His father mortgages his properties and makes him get the desired job. Being an honest cop, Aarusaamy is honoured with transfers all over Tamil Nadu due to political pressure. Finally, in Trichy, he is accused of bribery by a politician and he gets suspended. It takes him six months to prove himself and he is posted in Tirunelveli now.  In Tirunelveli, he adapts a new policy of adjusting with the local goons so that he can serve the people in an effective way. Perumal Pichai ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]), is an underworld don who has the total control of Southern Tamil Nadu, both in politics as well as rowdyism but he is less known in the media. He bribes Aarusaamy so that he will not disturb his business because both Perumal Pichai and Aarusaamy belong to the same caste. Saamy also accepts it but requests him to make some changes which he in turn accepts. As a result, the city is under the control of Law and Order. He is always accompanied by "Punctuality" Paramasivam ([[Ramesh Khanna]]), who is an inspector.  Saamy falls in love with a college-going Brahmin girl, Bhuvana ([[Trisha Krishnan]]) and they get engaged. Bhuvana's father, ([[Delhi Ganesh]]) is a straightforward government officer who never got bribe and leads a noble life. Saamy and Bhuvana meet each other when Saamy goes in search of a home for rent to Bhuvana's home. Bhuvana misinterprets Saamy and Paramasivam as thieves and locks them in a room.  The ruling party has called for a one-day strike all over the state and Perumal Pichai is handed with the responsibility of Tirunelveli on the eve of [[Pongal]] festival. But Saamy takes steps to maintain law and order and the strike becomes a failure. This makes Perumal Pichai angry. He was waiting for a chance to take revenge on Saamy and they attack the market on the day of Saamy's marriage since all the policemen would be attending the wedding. Besides this, Saamy also 'seals' the petrol bunk (gas station) of Perumal Pichai because the workers there they assaulted a woman and others when they challenged very less distribution of petrol than being promised. This incident was the last straw that broke the camel's back and started the revolution of Saamy against Perumal Pichai.  This incident marks the start of direct clash between Saamy and Perumal Pichai. Both challenge to get rid of the other in 7 days time. Perumal Pichai uses his influences and gets Saamy transferred but Saamy is given a time of 7 days to take charge. Saamy also loses his father in a bomb blast in his home which was targeted to kill him. He plans accordingly and takes revenge on Perumal Pichai by the eve of 7th day.  
The Saddest Music in the World
 During the Great Depression in 1933 in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], Canada, baroness Helen Port-Huntley ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) announces a competition to find the saddest music in the world, as a publicity stunt to promote her company, Muskeg Beer, as Prohibition is about to end in the United States. The prize is $25,000 "Depression-era dollars" and musicians from all over the world pour into Winnipeg to compete. Chester Kent ([[Mark McKinney]]), a failing Broadway producer, decides to enter the contest representing America, even though he is Canadian and originally from Winnipeg. An old fortune teller predicts his doom, but Chester mocks this prediction by having his nymphomaniac amnesiac girlfriend Narcissa ([[Maria de Medeiros]]) masturbate him. Also entering the contest are Chester's father Fyodor ([[David Fox (actor)|David Fox]]), representing Canada, and his brother Roderick ([[Ross McMillan]]), representing Serbia as "Gavrilo the Great" (even though he is also Canadian).  It is revealed that Fyodor is in love with Helen, who he had once hoped to marry. However, Helen and Chester had an affair, and an accident involving the three occurred when Fyodor stepped out in front of Chester's car as Helen was performing oral sex on Chester. Helen's legs were both amputated as a result, and Fyodor became an alcoholic, while Chester left for Broadway. With Chester returned, and his relationship with Helen renewed, Fyodor swears off drink and fashions prosthetic legs filled with beer in an attempt to earn Helen's love.  Roderick meanwhile discovers that Chester's girlfriend Narcissa is his missing wife, who has forgotten both their marriage and their son after the boy's death (Roderick carries the boy's heart in a jar, preserved in his own tears). Helen rigs the contest to favour Chester/America, and Fyodor/Canada quickly loses after singing "Red Maples Leaves," although Roderick/Serbia advances. Although Roderick and Narcissa have sex, she still doesn't remember their marriage, and he accidentally breaks the jar containing his son's heart (which is pierced by a glass shard), and although Helen loves her new glass beer legs, she still hates Fyodor. Fyodor then drinks a leg's worth of beer and falls through the concert hall rooftop to his death.  Helen appears in Chester's final performance, but her legs leak and explode when Roderick plays. Roderick then changes his tune to play "The Song Is You," which he had sworn not to perform until reunited with his wife. The song recovers Narcissa's memory and Chester, meanwhile, is stabbed to death by Helen (using a long shard from her glass legs). Chester refuses to let this sadden him, and staggers away, accidentally setting the building on fire with his victory cigar. Chester dies playing "The Song Is You" on the piano as the building burns.

When malaria strikes India on the Burmese border, pregnant Maya rushes over to help, despite Akki's disapproval. Akash soon receives the news of her death caused by a bus crash. The bus crashed into water at heavy rains.  Akash believes that on looking at the face of the corpse, one would be able to trace out the mentality of that person at the time of death; and so he desperately searches for the corpse of Maya. However he could not succeed. Akash cannot accept Maya's passing away and believes strongly that she did not die. Akash himself has paranormal experiences where he feels that Maya's soul is trying to communicate with him. He tries to communicate with her through the hospital patients who have faced a near-death experience. Every patient draws a strange symbol, and one corpse starts talking to Akash when he is alone. Tanya ([[Mahima Chaudhry]]), a close friend of Maya, tries to console Akash, because when her lover died in an accident it was Akash who treated her. Now, she believes it is her turn, and she believes he is [[hallucinating]].  With the help of a nun called Sister Martha and clues, Akash decides to go back to where it all began — the border. There, with the help of a guide, he tries to find out about Maya but is not very successful, following which Akash jumps off a waterfall near the crash site and finds the sunken bus. He sees Maya's spirit beckoning him, and she shows him her accident and the incidents that followed. He goes to the nearby village tribe and asks if they saved Maya. They say she died, but they saved her soul. They take Akash inside and show him a surprise — though Maya died, she gave birth to their daughter. Akash thus realises that Maya was teaching him to trust, because their baby survived among the tribe without any medical attention despite being premature. He also realizes that Maya's spirit was trying to reach him so that he could meet their daughter. He takes their child home and lives happily ever after.

Saints and Soldiers
 In 1944, Allied troops have defeated the Germans after the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. In [[Malmedy]], [[Belgium]], they find and uncover the frozen bodies of over 70 American soldiers who were held prisoners and killed by their German captors. Three weeks earlier, the prisoners, members of the [[101st Airborne Division]] and [[285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion]] are rounded up and searched by the German troops while medic Steven Gould ([[Alexander Polinsky|Alexander Niver]]) tries to help a seriously wounded American soldier. One soldier tries to escape, and is shot dead, causing confusion and fear from the prisoners. The Germans open fire on the prisoners, in what is known as the [[Malmedy massacre]], killing many troops as they try to run away. The soldier Gould tried to save is shot dead and Gould manages to escape with Corporal Nathan 'Deacon' Greer ([[Corbin Allred]]). Deacon disarms a German but doesn't shoot him, even at Gould's insistence.  Gould and Deacon are joined by two other survivors, Shirl Kendrick ([[Larry Bagby]]), a member in Gould's division, and Deacon's close friend Sergeant Gordon Gunderson ([[Peter Holden|Peter Asle Holden]]). Gunderson explains it would be better to hide out until the Allies retake the area and the four hide out in an abandoned building. When a German patrol comes along, the soldiers hide under the floor. While there Deacon loosely translates a German message about a downed plane in the area. Leaving after the Germans, the Americans find [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] pilot [[Flight Sergeant]] Oberon Winley ([[Kirby Heyborne]]).  Winley explains he has important [[military intelligence|intelligence]] photographs he has to get back to the Allies and the group decide to try and reach the Allied lines some 20 miles away. While on point, Deacon has a [[hallucination]] and breaks down. Gunderson explains that Deacon had inadvertently, when clearing a building during an earlier mission, killed two women and six children recently. Gould begins to criticize Deacon for not shooting the German and for being religious. Deacon offers him his [[Book of Mormon]], which Gould refuses. Deacon says that Gould is asking too many questions for someone who is not interested in religion.  Shortly afterwards, Kendrick falls through the roof of an old building that had been covered by the snow. Looking for shelter, Gunderson enters a house and finds a woman and girl who speak [[French language|French]], Catherine and Sophie Theary. A coming snow storm causes Gunderson to surmise that the Germans will be pinned down and immobilized. He suggests staying the night but Winley insists that he must get the information to the Allied troops and leaves during the storm. The others are sure he will die in the cold.  Catherine brings some bread to the soldiers. While she is with the soldiers, two Germans arrive and Catherine talks to them. One German starts scouting the building while the other attempts to rape Catherine. She yells and Deacon kills one German and misses the other as he runs into the woods. Winley returns with this German as his prisoner. Deacon recognizes the German as Rudolph, a convert during his mission serving as a minister for his Church in [[Berlin]]. Deacon understands then why he, who was well known for never failing to hit what he aimed at, missed Rudolph.  In the morning, Deacon has let Rudolph go, after Rudolph had told him where the Germans lines were and how to get through them. With captured weapons they set out but soon encounter a small group of German soldiers. Gunderson is fatally shot by a sniper, whom Deacon then kills. More Germans attack and Winley is hit in the leg. During the firefight the Allied group is split in two. While carrying Winley, Kendrick is shot in the stomach and dies. Winley kills the German and, trying to hobble away, falls into a river. Deacon and Gould find him. While they care for Winley, Rudolph finds them and tells them where there is a jeep, and an escape route they could use with it closer to the Allied lines, then goes off in the direction of the pursuing Germans.  The three remaining Allied soldiers, now dressed as German soldiers, get in the [[Willys MB|jeep]] and head toward the German lines. They manage to talk their way past a German guard (as Deacon speaks fluent German) but when they veer towards the American lines the Germans open fire. Speeding toward the safety of the American lines (where observers work out they are Allied soldiers) the jeep is overturned by mortar fire. Deacon gives covering fire as Gould and Winley head for safety. Deacon is killed by a sniper, and before he dies, he sees the spirits of the women and children he killed one last time. Gould and Winley make it through and the important intelligence is passed on to headquarters. Winley is then transported to a medical station because of his injuries.  As Gould sees Deacon's body being carried away, he takes out Deacon's Book of Mormon, places the photo of Deacon's wife into Deacon's hands and keeps the book, which Deacon had offered to him earlier, and wishes him to rest in peace. After this, he looks up and sees a [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51 Mustang]] fighter flying over, signaling that the weather is improving, and the turning of the tide in the Battle. Gould encounters a now captured Rudolph, nods to him, with Rudolph answering back in kind, and then helps an injured German soldier whom he recognizes from the massacre at the start of the film.

Plus, even the suspects with motives were not near the crime scenes. Suddenly Malvika realizes that somebody is stalking her. Malvika accosts her stalker, but he reveals that he was just doing it for a criminal named Suleman Bhai.

But when Malvika goes to Suleman's house, she finds Suleman dead.  Again out of leads, Malvika starts going through case files of all 3 victims. She finds 4 connections:- 1] All were best people in their fields. 2] All had a poor eyesight with eye power -2. 3] All ordered their spectacles from the same shop. 4] The position of their hands on the crime scene indicated their time of death (12 pm, 3 pm, and 6 pm).

Later, she finds out from the list of customers that a person named Amod Parekh ([[Jackie Shroff]]), also with eye power -2, visited the same optical shop on the days when all the three murdered persons visited the shop, and believes him to be the killer.

He explains that his credentials were much better than Malvika's, but he was toppled, as he had poor eyesight with power -2.  Amod vents out his anger by saying that this same fault did not affect the lives of his victims, in fact they became famous. He also goes on to say that he did not want to kill them, but time was not on their side as somebody else too had motive to kill them. Malvika thinks that he is trying to prove that she has lost and he has proved himself a genius, if not as a cop, then as a killer.  Malvika asks why Amod did not kill the musician. Suddenly her associate arrives with a broken pair of glasses retrieved from Amod's house. Amod tells her that her daughter was a perfect daughter of a best cop. He clarifies that he killed her daughter instead (9 pm) who also has an eyesight power of -2 and came to the same optical shop in the same evening. He again taunts Malvika that her eyesight is perfect, but her vision is very weak as she didn't notice her daughter's name in the customers' list. Malvika's associate begs her to not to kill the killer, as he wants her to do the same. However, an angry Malvika shoots the killer dead (12 am).

Saraband
 :The film is structured around ten acts with a [[prologue]] and [[epilogue]]. It opens with the camera on Marianne standing by a table covered with photographs. It is a well-lit room, and she addresses the viewer. She picks one picture up after another; they are in no particular order, being just heaped all over the table. Some make her smile, or elicit a comment or a sigh. But then she picks up a photograph of her husband, prompting her to reminisce about how they had been more or less happy, and how they'd broken up. She goes on to recall how his second marriage failed, while she was already married to a second husband herself, and then when her second husband died (by flying a glider off somewhere and disappearing), she reflects that it would be nice to see her first husband again.  Marianne travels into the country to the home of her ex-husband, and father of her daughters Martha and Sara, Johan. Johan is undergoing a family crisis with his insolvent and needy son, Henrik, and granddaughter, Karin. Karin is 19, and Henrik asks Johan for an advance on his inheritance so that Henrik can buy Karin an old [[Annibale Fagnola|Fagnola]] cello, to make a better impression at the audition for the European music conservatory. The elderly Johan decides to consider the offer and to contact the cello dealer himself. While Henrik is away tending to the orchestra he conducts in [[Uppsala]], Johan has a private meeting with Karin, informing her of a proposal from Ivan Chablov, head conductor in the [[St. Petersburg]] orchestra and an old friend of Johan, that Karin join him at the prestigious [[Sibelius Academy]] in [[Helsinki]].  While considering this offer Karin also finds an old letter from her departed mother Anna written to Henrik a week before her death. In the letter, Anna asks Henrik to relieve Karin of the unhealthy control he holds over her as her cello teacher. When Henrik encounters Karin again upon his return from Uppsala, where he no longer holds a position as concertmaster, he attempts to convince Karin into performing a concert of ''Bach's Cello Suites'' with him. She finally confronts him about his control over her and tells him of her decision to take an opportunity to study with her friend Emma in [[Hamburg]] under [[Claudio Abbado]]. The final request by Henrik is that Karin play the sarabande from Bach's 5th Cello Suite, which she already knows.  We encounter Marianne and Johan some time later, after Karin has already left for Hamburg. Marianne receives a phone call stating that Henrik has been found in the hospital having attempted suicide with pills and by cutting his wrists and throat. In the next scene a pained Johan suffering from a sort of anxiety attack seeks out Marianne and eventually disrobes along with her and joins her in bed. Next, Marianne is holding a still of the couple in bed and explaining what happened after that episode. She explains how she and Johan had kept in contact until one day she was no longer able to reach him. She thinks again of the departed Anna and recollects a visit to her ill daughter Martha who is in a [[Sanatorium|sanatorium]]. She explains the contact she shared with her daughter and how she had never really been able to touch her before this moment.  
Save the Green Planet!
 The film's main character is Byeong-gu, a man who believes that aliens from Andromeda are about to attack Earth and that he is the only one who can prevent them. With his childlike circus-performer girlfriend, he kidnaps a powerful pharmaceutical executive whom he believes to be a top ranking extraterrestrial able to contact the Andromedan prince during the upcoming eclipse. After imprisoning the man in his basement workshop, Byeong-gu proceeds to torture him.   It soon appears that the executive's company poisoned Byeong-gu's mother in a pharmaceuticals test, and that it is vengeance fueled psychosis that causes Byeong-gu to believe the executive is an alien.   When a detective comes calling to investigate the disappearance, the executive tries to escape but is thwarted by the psychotic Byeong-gu. The detective at first finds nothing unusual but on his way out sees Byeong-gu's dog (appropriately named Earth) gnawing on the bones of his master's past victims. After contacting a partner in the police force he is killed by Byeong-gu's bees, is hacked up and fed to the dog. Byeong-gu then crucifies the executive and breaks his leg with the back of his axe, to punish him for his attempted escape. In a desperate move, the executive convinces Byeong-gu that the bottle of [[benzene]] in his car trunk is the antidote for his comatose mother.   As Byeong-gu races to the hospital to deliver the antidote, the executive frees himself by pulling his hands through the nails. He then travels deeper into his captor’s lair, finding evidence of his grim research. Photos of mutilated corpses are littered with blood scrawled notebooks, while hands and brains of past ‘subjects’ reside in jars. Reading through the journals the executive discovers Byeong-gu's traumatic past: his father was a coal miner who lost one of his arms due to his dangerous work and was killed by his wife when he attempted to attack her and his son. The child was beaten in school and was a victim of the sadistic whims of his cruel teachers. He showed early signs of violence, such as stabbing a fellow school mate with a kitchen knife. His mother was then poisoned in the aforementioned incident and at a protest his former girlfriend was beaten to death. He slowly went mad from the violence that surrounded him.   As this is happening, the dead detective's partner arrives and finds the frantic executive. And Byeong-gu, after desperately rushing to the hospital to give the 'antidote' to his comatose mother, killing her, becomes ever more enraged. He returns home to kill the alien, only to find the detective there as well.  After a brief struggle and a bizarre turn of events, he captures both of them and plans on killing them both.  The frantic executive then admits to being an alien and proceeds to spin an outlandish tale which stretches back to the time of the dinosaurs, about how his race was originally trying to save humanity by experimenting on the genetic code of his mother. He also agrees, in what appears to be a time-buying move, to contact the alien prince at the pharmaceutical company factory.   Byeong-gu leaves the detective all his notes, saying that if he does not make it, he will have the responsibility of saving the planet. At the factory, the executive triggers a computer controlled robotic arm to kill Byeong-gu's girlfriend, and after a long struggle, he beats his captor almost to death. When the police arrive, they shoot Byeong-gu, and as he bleeds to death he wonders aloud, "Now who will save the earth?"  When the aliens do arrive and beam up the executive aboard their ship, we learn he is in fact the alien king himself. Disgusted and angered by the torture and corruption and evils of the world, he deems Earth a failed experiment and blasts it from creation. As the credits roll still photographs recap the entire journey of Byeong-gu's life, focusing instead on the beautiful, happy moments of a young boy and man with his father and mother and girlfriend.

Sansa is charming and careless, living the bohemian life. His encounters are numerous, mostly with feminine characters, until he gets attached to an old and eccentric orchestra conductor ([[Ivry Gitlis]]) who becomes a kind of father figure.  Sansa's peregrinations start in Montmartre, then follow with a succession of international clichés. In Italy, we "learn" that women have dark hair and are beautiful while men are machos; we even to get to enjoy a [[Vespa]] chase. Russia is the land of chaos and organized crime where everybody gets drunk with vodka. Africa is corrupted, India is about people going naked in the river and Egypt has pyramids. Meanwhile, our hero Sansa, who is the victim of police abuse anywhere he goes, is unstoppable, seducing women around the world, like a backpacking James Bond, jumping from one train to another, escaping trouble, running into friends everywhere he goes, and walking, his hands in his pockets, through the great icy lands of Russia and the Moroccan desert.  In the end, despite following him for thousands of miles around the world, Sansa didn't go anywhere.<ref>Fred Thom.

School of Rock
  No Vacancy, a rock band, performs at a nightclub three weeks before auditioning for the [[Battle of the Bands]]. Guitarist Dewey Finn creates on-stage antics, including a failed [[stage dive]] that abruptly ends the performance. The next morning, Dewey wakes in the apartment he lives in with Ned Schneebly and his girlfriend, Patty Di Marco. They inform him he must make up for his share of the rent or move out. When Dewey meets No Vacancy at a rehearsal session, he finds out that he has been replaced by another guitarist named Spider. Later, while attempting to sell some of his equipment for rent money, Dewey answers a phone call from Rosalie Mullins, the principal of the Horace Green [[University-preparatory school|prep school]], inquiring for Ned about a short-term position as a substitute teacher. Desperate for money, Dewey impersonates Ned and is hired. On his first day at the school, Dewey adopts the name "Mr. S" and spends his first day behaving erratically, much to the class's confusion.  The next day, Dewey overhears a music class and devises a plan to form them into a new band to audition for Battle of the Bands. He casts Zack Mooneyham as lead guitarist, Freddy Jones as drummer, cello player Katie on bass, Lawrence on keyboard, and himself as lead vocalist and guitarist. He assigns the rest of the class to various roles of backup singers, groupies, roadies, security, with Summer Hathaway as band manager. The project takes over normal lessons, but helps the students to embrace their talents and overcome their problems. He reassures Lawrence, who feels nerdy, and is worried about not being cool enough for the band; Zack, whose overbearing father disapproves of rock; and Tomika, an overweight girl who is too self-conscious even to audition for backup singer, despite having an amazing voice. During one eloquent lesson, he teaches the kids that rock and roll is the way to "Stick it to the Man" and stand up for themselves. Band "groupies" Michelle and Eleni, with Summer's approval, pitch the band name "The School of Rock."  Two weeks into his hiring, Dewey sneaks his key band members out of school to audition for a spot in the Battle of the Bands competition, while the rest of the class stay behind to maintain cover. When Freddy wanders off, Dewey retrieves him, but the group is rejected because the bill is full. After the band, with Summer's help, tricks the staff into thinking that they have a terminal illness, the band is auditioned. The next day, Mullins decides to check on Dewey's teaching progress, forcing Dewey to teach the actual material. Mullins explains that a parents' night will take place at the school the day before Battle of the Bands, rendering Dewey somewhat concerned.  As Dewey prepares for the parents' night, Ned receives a paycheck from the school via mail, soon realizing that Dewey impersonated him. During the parents' meeting, the parents question what Dewey was teaching the kids until Ned, Patty and the police confront Dewey. With Mullins bursting in to question what is going on, Dewey reveals his true identity, admits he's not a licensed teacher and flees to his apartment where he and Patty later argue. Ned intervenes to wind the argument up. Dewey apologizes to Ned and admits he can't give up music. Understanding, Ned opens up to Dewey, stating that he misses his old life being part of a rock band called Maggot Death, but he had to quit since he couldn't keep kidding himself anymore. Ned then suggests that Dewey should move out.  The next morning, the parents get angry at Mullins in her office, while the kids decide not to let their hard work go to waste. When the new substitute discovers that the kids are missing, she informs Mullins, and Mullins and the parents race to the competition. A school bus comes to pick up Dewey, who leads the kids to the Battle of the Bands and decides that they will play the song written by Zack earlier in the film. Initially dismissed as a gimmick, the band wins over the crowd. Much to Dewey's dismay, No Vacancy wins, but the audience chant for School of Rock and demand an encore.  Ned, like all of the parents, is impressed and proud of Dewey and the band, much to the dismay of Patty, whom Ned breaks up with. Some time later, an after-school program known as the School of Rock has opened, as Dewey continues to coach the students he previously played with, while Ned teaches beginners as the credits roll.  
Scary Movie 3
 Katie ([[Jenny McCarthy]]) and Becca ([[Pamela Anderson]]) talk about what Katie believes is a sex tape, but Becca calls it a cursed tape. After several odd occurrences, they both die. Meanwhile, in a farm outside Washington, D.C., widowed farmer Tom Logan ([[Charlie Sheen]]) and his clumsy brother George ([[Simon Rex]]) discover a [[crop circle]], saying "Attack Here!"  Cindy Campbell ([[Anna Faris]]), now a blonde news reporter, announces the crop circles on the news. She picks up her paranormally endowed nephew Cody from school, where her best friend Brenda Meeks ([[Regina Hall]]) is his teacher. George picks up his niece Sue, who is in the same class. Cindy and George fall in love, and George invites her and Brenda to a rap-battle with his rapper friends Mahalik ([[Anthony Anderson]]) and CJ ([[Kevin Hart]]). George proves to be talented but is disqualified for unintentional racist blunders.  After watching the cursed videotape, Brenda asks Cindy to keep her company. After playing several pranks on Cindy, she gets the rest of the popcorn in the living room, when the TV turns on. Tabitha climbs out of the TV and Brenda fights with Tabitha. Tabitha kills Brenda, since Cindy is ignoring the ruckus. George receives a phone call about the death, and Tom meets with Sayaman, who apologizes for the accident involving himself and Tom's wife Annie.  During Brenda's wake, George and Mahalik wreak havoc in an unsuccessful attempt to revive her, only to blow up her body and get kicked out of the house. Cindy watches the tape, finding it odd. A phone caller tells her she will die in a week. She calls George, CJ and Mahalik for help. CJ says his Aunt Shaneequa might be able to help. Shaneequa ([[Queen Latifah]]), the Matrix [[Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]], and her husband Orpheus ([[Eddie Griffin]]) agree to watch the tape. Shaneequa discovers the hidden image of a lighthouse and gets in a fight with Tabitha's mother. Shaneequa tells Cindy to find the lighthouse to break the curse. When Cindy returns home, she finds Cody watched the tape.  At work, Cindy searches through pictures of lighthouses before finding the one from the tape. Desperate to save Cody, Cindy warns everyone by entering a message into the news anchor's teleprompter. Her boss interrupts her, and the anchor mechanically recites the wrong message. The Logans take it seriously since they encountered an alien disguised as [[Michael Jackson]], and President Baxter Harris ([[Leslie Nielsen]]) personally visits the farm to investigate the crop circles. Cindy visits the lighthouse, where she encounters [[Architect (The Matrix)|The Architect]] ([[George Carlin]]). The loquacious (and lecherous) old man explains Tabitha was his evil adopted daughter, whom his wife drowned in the farm's well, but not before she imprinted her evil onto the tape. Unfortunately, he mistakenly returned it to [[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]] believing it was ''[[Pootie Tang]]'', unleashing the curse. When Cindy asks about how this relates to the Aliens, the Architect speculates that Tabitha is summoning them to aid her in destroying the human race.  Returning home, Cindy discovers her station has been broadcasting the evil tape for hours, and there have been various sightings of aliens around the world. Worse, Cody is missing. Cindy tracks him to the Logan farm, where he has taken refuge with George. Tom orders everybody into the basement for safety, as he, George and Mahalik go outside to fight the extraterrestrials. The aliens arrive but reveal they are friendly and have come to stop Tabitha, since they accidentally watched the tape on a broadcast they had intercepted, again believing it was ''Pootie Tang''.  In the basement, Cindy recognizes farm's cellar from the tape, and she finds the well where Tabitha drowned. Suddenly, Tabitha appears behind her. A short fight ensues, during which Tabitha takes Cody hostage. Cindy and George appeal to her, offering her a place in their family. Tabitha appears to accept the offer but  changes back to her monstrous form. As she advances on Cindy and the others, President Harris accidentally knocks her into the well. The aliens leave in peace, and Cindy and George get married. Leaving for their honeymoon, they realize they left Cody behind. After Cindy avoids hitting Cody at an intersection, another car strikes him.  
Schultze Gets the Blues
 Schultze (played by [[Horst Krause]])<ref name=RE>[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050310/REVIEWS/50301008/1001 Schultze Gets the Blues] Roger Ebert</ref> is a large, recently retired salt-miner living in [[Teutschenthal]] (near [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt]] in [[Germany]]). Along with his also laid-off friends Jürgen and Manfred, he finds himself restless with so much spare time.  For years, he has played traditional [[polka]] music on his [[accordion]], but a series of upheavals in his life inspire an interest in American [[Zydeco]] and [[Cajun]] music. Though being afraid of travelling to the [[United States]] at the beginning he accepts his music club's wish to represent it at a German folk music festival in [[New Braunfels]], [[Texas]].  But instead of appearing there he chooses to travel in a motor boat around the countryside despite speaking little English, immersing himself in the music and culture of the [[Bayou]]. Finally, among his newly found friends he becomes very sick and presumably dies. Back in Teutschenthal a funeral is held for Schultze which turns into a decent and mildly happy celebration of his life: "Herr, lehre uns Bedenken, dass wir alle einmal sterben müssen, auf das wir im Leben klug werden" &ndash; "Lord, teach us to understand we all have to die sometime, that we become wiser in our lives" ([[Psalm]] 90,12).  
Saw (2003 film)
 A young man, [[List of Saw characters#David|David]] ([[Leigh Whannell|Whannell]]), is in an interrogation room talking to an unnamed, unsympathetic [[police officer]] (Paul Moder). David is in handcuffs, and he has blood on his face and shirt. He is smoking a [[cigarette]]. He tells the officer that after he finished his work as an [[orderly]] at the hospital, he was knocked unconscious and taken to a large room.  Inside the room, David was strapped to a chair with a large, rusty metal device locked onto his head. To his left was a small television, which began playing a video showing a [[Billy (Saw)|frightening puppet]] that tells him that the device on his head is a "reverse [[animal trapping#Foothold traps or Leghold traps|beartrap]]", which is hooked into his jaws and will pry his face open with great force if he does not unlock it in time. The puppet tells David that the only key to unlock the device is in the stomach of his dead cellmate (Dean Francis).  David is able to break free of his bonds, but by doing so he sets off a timer on the back of the device. Across the room, he finds the body that the puppet mentioned, but also finds that the man is actually alive but under paralysis. David panics and stabs his cellmate before starting to look for the key. He slices into the man's stomach and after finding the key, David unlocks the device and throws it to the ground, just as it snaps open.  David begins screaming and weeping in horror. At the entrance to the room, the puppet from the video appears on a [[tricycle]]. He congratulates David on surviving, and tells him that he has proven he is no longer ungrateful for being alive.  The film ends with the police officer asking "Are you grateful, David?" causing the young man to again break down. As the end credits begin to roll, a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] replica of the bathroom used later in the full ''Saw'' film is shown, although with some differences. A small peephole is shown with an eye visible behind it, which was a concept reused in another trap in ''Saw''.  
Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire
 The film takes place in [[Australia]], where the "Vampire Rock Music Festival" is being set up near Vampire Rock, a [[rock formation]] shaped like a vampire head. There is a legend of a vampire named the [[Yowie]] Yahoo, who lives in the rock. Many people are excited for the event, but some don't think it should take place because it would anger the Yowie Yahoo. One such person is Malcolm Illiwara, even though his grandson Daniel is the manager of the contest. One night, as Malcolm and Daniel watch a sure-to-win performer named Matt Marvelous, the Yowie Yahoo appears. The Yowie Yahoo and its three vampire minions capture Matt Marvelous and take him away. Everyone is scared, and Malcolm blames the contest for what happened.  Meanwhile, [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] and the Mystery Inc. have arrived in Australia for a [[Tourism|vacation]] after solving the mystery of the Sea Serpent Smugglers on a cruise ship. After seeing the harbor, the gang decides to go to the outback and see the music festival. When they arrive, they meet [[the Hex Girls]], (the [[Musical ensemble|band]] the gang had met before in ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost]]'' and have since become close friends with) who are the opening act. They also see Daniel, Malcolm and Daniel's partner Russell. Malcolm tries to warn Daniel about what has happened and drives off. Daniel tells them that most of the performers have left because they are too scared of the vampires. Daniel and Russell then tell them about Wildwind, a musical group who performed at the Vampire Rock Music Festival the year before. Though Wildwind put on a great performance, they only got third place. They then went into Vampire Rock to camp but were never heard from again. It is believed that the members of Wildwind - Dark Skull, Stormy Weather, and Lightning Strikes - have been turned into vampires by the Yowie Yahoo. Daniel says he does not believe it, but then Russell reminded him that the three vampires who were with the Yowie Yahoo when it kidnapped Matt Marvelous looked just like the members of Wildwind.  [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred]] decides the best way to solve the mystery is to enter the contest as a band, in order to drive the Yowie Yahoo to capture them. Russell is skeptical, but Daniel thinks it is a good idea. The Hex Girls make them look like rock stars, and soon they are on stage. While they are practicing (but not very well), a golf cart approaches them. In it are Jasper Ridgeway, a snotty manager, and his band, the Bad Omens. They criticize the gang's playing and make them leave the stage so they can practice. Then the gang learns that Jasper was once the manager of Wildwind. Jasper says Wildwind was the greatest band he ever managed and is still haunted by their disappearance. He then complains about the head and camping, and goes back to his trailer, leaving his band to practice. The gang grows suspicious of Jasper and thinks he might have put his band up to masquerading as vampires and getting rid of all the other performers. They split up, with Fred, [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] and [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] going to Jasper's trailer and [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] and Scooby staying at the food stands.  At the trailer, Fred, Velma and Daphne find that Jasper has lots of mementos of Wildwind, including the band members' old stage costumes. They also wonder why Jasper did not come to his trailer, (as they have been there); when he said he was going to. Meanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy get chased by the Wildwind Vampires but eventually lose them. They end up back at the stage, where the Bad Omens are rehearsing. There, they witness the Yowie Yahoo and the Wildwind vampires capture the Bad Omens is the same way they captured Matt Marvelous. They tell the others. Jasper is sad they are gone, but then he says he shouldn't have gone back to his trailer, when in fact he was never there at all. Fred decides that everyone should sleep at the same place, so no one gets taken.  During the night, a band named Two Skinny Dudes arrives. They say they have been staying in Vampire Rock, but have not seen any. Jasper quickly forgets the Bad Omens and asks Two Skinny Dudes if they wanted him to be their manager, which makes the gang suspicious. The next day, the gang and Daniel go to see Malcolm. He explains how Wildwind was foolish to go into Vampire Rock. He also says how vampires hate the sun, cannot run over running water, and cannot be seen in a picture. Later that night, the Hex Girls start things off. However, the Yowie Yahoo and the Wildwind vampires appear and capture the Hex Girls. The crowd thinks it was an act, but the gang decides to investigate the rock.  Inside, Fred, Velma and Daphne find lots of special effects equipment like fans and lights. However, they find the Wildwind vampires and get chased. Scooby and Shaggy get trapped by a group of [[dingo]]es. The sound of Fred, Velma and Daphne running scares off the Dingoes, but then the whole gang gets trapped by the vampires and the Yowie Yahoo. The gang is able to avoid them until the sun comes up. The sun reflects off Scooby-Doo's collar, which shines on the Yowie Yahoo and destroys him. However, the Wildwind vampires are not affected by the sun or running over water, and give chase to the gang. The Wildwind Vampires chase them until the gang and Daniel unleash a trap and capture the "vampires". Jasper and Daniel are confused, but the gang knows. After splashing water on the faces to get rid of the makeup, the gang shows that it was Two Skinny Dudes and Russell. Daniel and Jasper are surprised, but get even more surprised when it is shown that Skinny Dudes and Russell are really the members of Wildwind in masks. They explain how they wanted to start up their career, so they posed as dead and were planning to perform again. They used special effects to make the Yowie Yahoo and climbing equipment to fly around. When asked about the missing performers, they said they sent them away on free [[Great Barrier Reef]] [[Scuba diving]] tours. Then the Hex Girls and Malcolm show up. The Hex Girls say they were left in the Outback because they did not want the trip, but Malcolm found them.  The members of Wildwind are arrested and sent to jail. Daniel realizes that since all the other bands are out of the competition, that makes Scooby and the gang the winners by default. The film ends with the gang performing to the crowd and getting their band name, the Meddling Kids, joined by the Hex Girls.

Seabiscuit (film)
 Three men, [[Red Pollard]] ([[Tobey Maguire]]), [[Charles S. Howard]] ([[Jeff Bridges]]), and [[R. Thomas Smith|Tom Smith]] ([[Chris Cooper]]) come together as the principal jockey, owner, and trainer of the championship horse [[Seabiscuit]], rising from troubled times to achieve fame and success through their association with the horse.  Red is the child of a Canadian family financially ruined by the [[Great Depression]]. In desperate need of money, the family leaves Red with a horse trainer. Red eventually becomes a jockey and makes extra money through illegal boxing matches that leave him blind in one eye. Howard is a clerk in a bicycle shop who gets asked by a passing motorist to repair his automobile, a technology which has recently been introduced. As a result, Howard becomes knowledgeable enough with automobiles to increase their performance and sell them as a dealer, eventually becoming the largest car dealer in California and one of the Bay Area's richest men. However, his son is killed in an automobile accident, which sends Howard into a bout of deep [[Depression (mood)|depression]], which results in his wife ([[Valerie Mahaffey]]) leaving him.  On a trip to Mexico to obtain a divorce, he meets Marcela Zabala ([[Elizabeth Banks]]). After marrying Marcela, Howard acquires a stable of horses and has a chance encounter with skilled horse trainer and drifter Smith. Howard hires Smith to manage his stables. Smith convinces then Howard to acquire the colt "Seabiscuit", who comes from noted lineage but had been deemed "incorrigible" by past handlers.  Smith is unable to find a jockey willing to deal with Seabiscuit's temperament, but after witnessing Red Pollard brawling with other stable boys, he sees in him a similar temperament to the feisty horse and appoints him as Seabiscuit's jockey. Seabiscuit and Pollard become close, and they begin to race. After overcoming early difficulties, such as a dismissive media and Pollard's anger issues and blind eye, Seabiscuit earns considerable success and becomes an extremely popular underdog for the millions affected by the Great Depression. Inspired, Howard tries repeatedly to provoke a race with the mocking New York tycoon [[Samuel Riddle]] and his "[[War Admiral]]", the top race horse in the country. Riddle eventually relents to a [[match race]] on his terms between War Admiral and Seabiscuit, but while the date approaches, Pollard is injured in a riding accident, fracturing his leg. When the doctor reports that he will be unable to ride again, Red suggests that Howard get an old friend, [[George Woolf]] ([[Gary Stevens (jockey)|Gary Stevens]]) to be Seabiscuit's new rider.  Red teaches Woolf about Seabiscuit's handling and mannerisms. At the match race, Seabiscuit upsets the heavy favorite, War Admiral, partly because of a secret that Pollard relates to Woolf, instructing him to hold him head to head with the other horse so he gets "a good look at the Admiral". Later Seabiscuit is racing at [[Santa Anita Park|Santa Anita]] when he is injured. Red helps him to recover and get fit enough to race again. The last race is again at Santa Anita, and Red rides him this time after putting a special self-made brace on his own leg to keep it stable. Woolf is on a different horse. Seabiscuit drops to last place and trails the pack, but Woolf holds back to be alongside Red and let Seabiscuit "get a good look". After a short conversation, Seabiscuit surges and wins the race.  
Seducing Doctor Lewis
 The small fishing village Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne on the north coast of Quebec is in decline. Every resident collects welfare. To lure a company into building a plastic container factory nearby, they need to double their population of 120, have a resident doctor, and give a $50,000 bribe for the company owner.  Montreal plastic surgeon Dr. Christopher Lewis (David Boutin) gets pulled over for speeding by an officer, Réal Fournier (Jean-Pierre Gonthier), the former mayor of Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne who moved to the city because he, like most of the residents of Ste-Marie, couldn't get a job there. Réal will not arrest him for drug possession - Dr. Lewis is carrying a packet of cocaine - if Dr. Lewis will visit Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne for one month. In a deleted scene, Dr. Lewis sells cocaine to his patients.   Germain Lesage (Raymond Bouchard), a welfare recipient himself and the new mayor, hatches a plan. The entire village will convince Dr. Lewis to stay. They tap his phone, and pretend to share his likes: cricket, fusion jazz, and all the same foods. Henri Giroux (Benoît Brière), the local banker whose sole job is to cash the townfolks' welfare cheques, leaves small amounts of money for Dr. Lewis to find as small measures to increase Dr. Lewis' happiness about being in town, and attempts to secure a loan through his bank for the bribe. Dr. Lewis likes the beautiful post office worker Ève Beauchemin (Lucie Laurier), but Ève knows he has a girlfriend, Brigitte, in Montreal.  The ruse works, but they cannot secure a loan. Henri fronts the money from his personal savings, after a bank executive tells him that he has a job only as a favour to his father, and that his position could easily be replaced by an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]. When the plastics company owner arrives, everyone continues their elaborate trick, and convinces him to build the factory there. The owner is ready to sign, but insists that they must have a doctor.   When Dr. Lewis learns that Brigitte has been having an affair with his best friend Paul for three years, he proclaims that he will stay because everyone in the village is genuine. Germain feels bad for lying, and "lets him off the hook" by telling him another lie in that they have secured another person as a permanent doctor. Hurt, Dr. Lewis turns to Ève, who has disliked all the lying, and confesses all to him, including the phone tap. Dr. Lewis confronts Germain about the lies, with Germain confirming the accusations. When Dr. Lewis asks him if he will learn the game of cricket for real if he decides to stay, Germain replies "no". It is then that Dr. Lewis decides to stay. The factory is built, Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne is saved, everyone gains renewed pride, and Dr. Lewis has five years in which to woo Ève.  
Secondhand Lions
 14-year-old Walter ([[Haley Joel Osment]]) is left by his irresponsible mother, Mae ([[Kyra Sedgwick]]), to live for the summer with his reclusive, bachelor great-uncles, Hub ([[Robert Duvall]]) and Garth ([[Michael Caine]]). Despite living on a ramshackle Texan farm, they are said to have a secret fortune and are made the target of every traveling salesman. They, in turn, sit on their porch with shotguns, the salesmen their targets.   Walter is given a room in the attic and is not welcomed at first, until they realize he annoys other gold-digging relatives who visit with their children. For his part, Walter persuades his uncles to try spending some of their money, generally with disastrous results. Packets of seeds to plant a vegetable garden turn out all to be corn. Then they order a lion for an animal target and end up with an aging, tame lioness, which they turn over to Walter as a pet. Later, it is released by accident and takes to the cornfield, which becomes her new "jungle" home. While loading 50-pound bags of Lion Chow, Hub passes out and is taken to the hospital. On leaving, they encounter four [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]] at a roadside store who draw [[switchblade]] knives on Hub, but are easily beaten by him in a fight.  A subplot develops around the photograph of a beautiful woman that Walter finds in the attic. In a series of flashbacks, Garth tells Walter the story of their African past, during which Hub fell in love with an Arab princess promised to a powerful [[Sheikh|Sheik]]. When they married, the Sheik put a price on Hub's head, keeping them in constant peril from [[assassins]]. Finally Hub won a duel against the Sheik but spared his life, warning him to cease the manhunt. When Walter asks to hear more from Hub, his uncle reveals that Jasmine died in childbirth. Hub then returned to the [[French Foreign Legion]], until he retired with Garth to their farm, where they are resignedly waiting to die. Walter asks Hub for confirmation, since his mother always lies to him. Hub responds with a piece of his "What Every Boy Needs to Know..." speech, that the actual truth is not as important as ''belief'' in ideals. Walter then asks Hub to promise to be around to give him the rest of the speech when he's old enough and Hub grudgingly agrees.   Late one evening, Walter trails Garth and discovers they have a room filled with money underneath the barn. On another night, Walter's mother and her current boyfriend, a supposed "private investigator", arrive. While the uncles sleep, Stan and Mae demand that Walter reveal the location of his uncles' fortune, claiming they were actually [[Bank robbery|bank robbers]]. When Walter chooses to believe in his uncles instead, Stan pins Walter down and begins beating him. Sensing that he is in danger, the lioness emerges from the cornfield and mauls Stan. Awakened by the ruckus, Hub and Garth find the old lioness has died of heart failure defending her “cub”.   The next day, Walter leaves with his mother. Once on the road, Mae explains that Stan will be staying with them to recuperate, but Walter asks her instead to "do something that's best for me for once" and abandons her. While Hub and Garth are delighted to see him back, Walter insists there have to be changes: His uncles must involve themselves in his education and live carefully, as he wants them to die of old age.  Seventeen years later, Walter is alerted by the sheriff of his uncles' deaths from a failed flying stunt with their biplane. Arriving at the farm, he is given his uncles' will, declaring "The kid gets it all. Just plant us in the damn garden, with the stupid lion." A helicopter bearing the logo ''Sahara Petroleum'' then touches down near the homestead and a man steps out with his young son, explaining that he heard about Hub and Garth's deaths on the radio. He had recognized the names as the two Americans in tales told to him in his youth by his grandfather, "a very wealthy sheik". When the man's young son asks Walter if his uncles were real, Walter confirms, "Yeah. They ''really'' lived."  
Scorched (film)
 Sheila Rilo (Silverstone) is a [[bank teller]] at Desert Savings Bank in a small desert town. Her boyfriend is Rick Becker ([[Joshua Leonard]]), the bank manager who was informed by his superiors that he would be fired if the bank's [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] were to be robbed just one more time. Sheila and Rick have spent several years together in their on-again off-again relationship, in which he uses her until something better comes along; after Sheila pays for most of Rick's education, he leaves her for his tutor. Sheila decides to exact revenge on Rick by robbing the bank and getting him fired.   On the same night, Stuart ([[Paulo Costanzo]]) and Jason (Woody Harrelson), two other tellers from the same bank, have also decided to rob the bank. Stuart's plan is to steal $250,000 from the bank and bet the entire amount on one game of [[roulette]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Stuart, who is desperate for excitement in his life, is doing this on the suggestion of his friend Max ([[David Krumholtz]]) even though the intelligent Stuart is usually the one talking Max out of his hare-brained ideas and [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s.  Jason is a nature lover who lives with an orphaned duck. He was promoted to assistant bank manager, a position with much more responsibility but only a $0.55 per hour raise. He feels the bank owes him for years of loyal and underpaid service and he decides to get even by robbing the safety deposit box of a mean-spirited local millionaire, Charles Merchant (Cleese). Merchant, who got rich from making infomercials and selling videotapes on how to get rich quickly on the real estate market, is the person that shot Jason's duck's mother, therefore making easier Jason's decision to rob Merchant's safety deposit box.   Jason is not the only one with a plan for revenge against the local tycoon. A disgruntled clothing store employee, Shmally (Cook), takes her revenge against Merchant the same night by having Carter ([[Marcus Thomas (actor)|Marcus Thomas]]) help her throw eggs at Merchant's home. Carter Doleman is Shmally's friend and roommate and the bank's newest employee. Due to his inability to dress well and his lack of ability to get a job on his own, Shmally agreed to help him. When Carter was called for an interview at the bank, Shmally gave Carter a make-over, dressed him up properly and coached him on how to pass the interview. Anxious and excited about starting his first day of work, hesitant Carter lets himself be dragged out of bed by Shmally so that he can help her egg Merchant's house.

Alejo and his young son, Jorge, and their pet [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]], Chiquita, see the monster, and the locals start calling him "[[El Chupacabra]]".  Later, when Mystery, Inc. arrives in Veracruz, they meet Alejo, who recognizes them all from Fred's letters. Alejo and his family run a huge and fancy hotel, and he shows them around and where they will be staying. He then introduces to them his family, which includes his wife, Sofia, his mother, Doña Dolores, his brother Luis, and Luis's fiancée, Charlene, who is originally from the United States. He also introduces the gang to visiting family members, while doing so, Scooby and Chiquita meet and fall in love. Luis tells the gang he met Charlene when he visited America, at a [[theme park]] run by Mr. Smiley. The gang and the Otero family enjoy a meal, and Dolores talks about her late husband. Then, a man named Señor Fuente arrives and asks to speak with Alejo and Luis. Dolores tells the gang that Fuente has been trying to get her to sell the hotel to him ever since her husband died the previous year. Meanwhile, Alejo and Luis tell Fuente once again that they do not want to sell the hotel. Fuente leaves, and the family go inside because of a fierce storm. When inside, Alejo's forced to tell the gang about El Chupacabra. He says that he does not have many other guests besides the gang because El Chupacabra has been scaring them away. Luis and Charlene tell the gang to lock their doors when they go to sleep.  During the night, [[Shaggy Rogers|Shaggy]] and Scooby-Doo are scared when they think they hear a noise. They then hear a loud growl and run screaming out of their cottage. They wake up Fred, [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] and [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]]. After seeing footprints outside of Shaggy and Scooby's window, Fred declares that there's a mystery they have to solve. The next day, the gang and the Otero brothers set out to search for El Chupacabra. Charlene gives Luis a charm for good luck. Daphne interviews the townspeople, but none of them are able to find El Chupacabra. When they get back to the Mystery Machine, they find someone has written a threat on it, basically telling them to get out of solving the mystery. The gang realizes this is serious and decide to search at night. Fred, Velma and Daphne go one way, Alejo and Luis go another way, and Shaggy and Scooby stay at the Mystery Machine.  At night, Shaggy and Scooby sleep in the van, while someone drains their brake fluid. Fred, Velma and Daphne search the woods, and find El Curandero, a [[medicine man]]. El Curandero tells them they need to look at history and that they are in grave danger. Meanwhile, Alejo and Luis are searching when Alejo sees El Chupacabra. Alejo is chased and nearly falls off a cliff, but he manages to hold on and lost his sunglasses. He calls for Luis, but there is no answer. El Chupacabra disappears, and Luis shows up, saying he was knocked on the head by El Chupacabra. Luis helps his brother up from the cliff.  Shaggy and Scooby start driving, but when they realize they cannot stop, they get scared. They meet up with Fred, Velma, Daphne, Alejo and Luis, who were being chased by El Chupacabra. Eventually, the van runs out of gas and stops right in front of a gas station. The Mystery Machine gets fixed, and Alejo gets some ice for Luis's head wound, but Luis does not have a bump on his head. Luis says he is fine. The gang drives along and finds a sign to a history museum, and thinking that is what the medicine man said, go to it. When they get there, they meet a suspicious and [[Hyperactivity|hyper]] museum guide who leads them into an auditorium. There they see a performance about ancient Mexican [[Tradition|customs]]. The guide then makes Daphne volunteer, and she kidnaps her, vanishing with a puff of smoke. The rest of the gang find a secret passageway and follow it, until they come to [[Aztec]] pyramids. They find Daphne at the top of one and rescue her, but the tourists chase after them, thinking they have vandalized a statue. After a long chase scene and fights against giant living statues, they finally return home.  The next day is the [[Day of the Dead]], and all go to the cemetery, where Dolores informs them that Charlene has been captured by El Chupacabra. The family gives offerings to the grave of Señor Otero and hope Charlene can be found. Suddenly, the ghost of Señor Otero comes out of his grave and tells them to sell the hotel and the land or they will be in danger. At the same time, Fred just revealed the good luck charm Luis has is really a [[tracking device]] instead of an ancient medallion. The family cannot believe that Señor Otero would want them to sell, but Scooby and Alejo realizes something is suspicious. He and Chiquita follows a beeping noise that is actives by pushing the button from the tracking device until they find a man in a skeleton suit controlling the ghost. The gang catches him, and he is revealed to be Mr. Smiley. Then, El Chupacabra appears and scares everyone.  After chasing the gang, El Chupacabra is caught up in some wiring. As they all gather around El Chupacabra, the culprit is revealed to be the museum guide when she climbs out of the suit. She tells them she loves Mr. Smiley and that they were going to get all the land. Luis asks what happened to Charlene, and the guide tells him he will never see her again and he should forget about her. Velma then guesses something is up and realizes the guide is wearing a wig and glasses to hide their identity, and pulls it off to reveal that Charlene was the guide and El Chupacabra. Her true identity is given away by the random tossing of coffee beans; a trait Charlene adopts from working in the hotel cafe all day. Fred says that the message written on the Mystery Machine ("Sal ahora o no veras el dia de manana!" - Leave today or you won't see tomorrow!) wasn't written in proper [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]], so whoever made the threat had to have been someone who could not understand the language. Señor Fuente then comes in and says that even though he wanted to buy the Otero family's land, he eventually came to respect the fact that they did not want to sell it.  Mr. Smiley, however, refused to accept this and decided to ruin the business by scaring away all their customers with his lover dressed as El Chupacabra. Fuente explains that he learned of Mr. Smiley and Charlene's plans and wanted to warn the Oteros and Mystery Inc. of what was really going on. Charlene and Mr. Smiley are arrested and taken to jail, and Luis admits that the real reason he didn't come to Alejo's rescue because he was paralyzed with fear — after their father died the previous year, Luis was afraid of losing Alejo, so he lied by saying that El Chupacabra had knocked him unconscious. Alejo comforts Luis and assures him that there are worse things than being a coward, to which Shaggy adds how he has "made a career out of it." In the end, everybody enjoys the Day of the Dead festivities.

 The film opens with a creepy castle  in [[Hollywood]]: Victor Gaghan, an evil scientist, is creating his S Club clones and chanting the words "S Club, S Club, S Club" and as he says this he is joined by fans awaiting the group as they arrive in [[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]] for their last show of their tour. After spending the day promoting and performing, the group gets excited about having some time off. Their manager, Alistair however shoots down their joy informing them that they will be leaving for Los Angeles at seven in the morning the next day. At the hotel, the S Club members ignore Alistair and after they get into their room, Alistair is attacked by the scientist's assistant Susan Sealove.  The next morning, the members of S Club awaken to find Alistair gone having been left with his bill. Instead of using a credit card that Rachel finds to pay the bill, they use it on pampering themselves and after going bankrupt Hannah thinks she is going crazy when she sees the cloned S Club performing live on TV at a nearby cafe. After the others start thinking they are uncanny lookalikes the members all decide to quickly leave the hotel and fly to LA but suddenly they are busted and thrown in jail and get wrongly accused of impersonating S Club and trying to run out on the hotel bill despite telling the jailer they are the real S Club and innocent.  In jail, they learn that the warden likes to dance and to escape, they sing "Don't Stop Movin'" and get to their friend Natalie. She helps them get to LA by disguising them as English World Cup football fans so that they can stop whoever is impersonating them and not get arrested again by the Spanish police.  In Los Angeles, the group tries but fails to get close to their doubles, so they decide to switch out their Hannah, Rachel and Jon for their copies. After getting the clones to tell them that they are copies, Bradley, Tina and Jo decide to do something about it after tracking down Gaghan based on his recent online purchases of S Club memorabilia including their underwear, only for them to get caught by his goons.  Both sets of S Club are taken back to Eagle Peak, (Gaghan 's secret mountain laborotory) where Gaghan tells to the originals that he is going to take over the world through music because celebrities attract more attention than politicians (as well as the obviously greater appeal in seeing naked singers emerging from the cloning tubes as opposed to politicians). The clones save the band and then both groups have to save all of the clones he has created including clones of [[AC/DC]]'s [[Angus Young]], King of Rock & Roll [[Elvis Presley]], [[Will Smith]] as [[Men in Black (film series)|Men In Black]]'s Agent K, [[Victoria Beckham]] (as Posh Spice), [[Robbie Williams]], [[Eminem]], King of Pop [[Michael Jackson]], [[Elton John]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[George Michael]], Pop Idol star [[Gareth Gates]], and [[Groucho Marx]] (of the [[Marx Brothers]]). Both S Clubs sing "Who Do You Think You Are?" and the original group is able to stop the place from self-destructing whilst the Michael Jackson clone stops Gaghan and Sealove from escaping in their helicopter. Jon then says how they have released a new bunch of cloned pop acts including [[Britney Spears]], [[Nsync]], and [[Nelly Furtado]] into the world and that they should be quiet about it. Clone Alistair suddenly appears and tries to kill the real S Club when suddenly the real Alistair knocks him out. Dr Gaghan and Sealove are later arrested and the group wonder what to do with their clones when Alistair reminds them of their very busy schedules.  At the end, the real S Club are seen at the beach and the clones are taking their place. They have decided that the clones will take their place when they want a holiday, and the same vice versa. (It is also mentioned that the clones are getting paid in boomerangs.) The Gareth Gates clone is also seen talking to Rachel and the film ends.

Shanghai Knights
  In 1887, Chon Lin ([[Fann Wong]]) tells her father (Kim Chan), the Keeper of the [[Imperial Seal of China]] in the [[Forbidden City]], that her brother, Chon Wang ([[Jackie Chan]]), is doing well as a [[sheriff]] in [[Carson City]], [[Nevada]], but her father replies that her brother is dead to him. At that moment, Lord Nelson Rathbone ([[Aidan Gillen]]), leads a band of [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxers]] into the city, who attack the Keeper. Despite Lin's efforts, her father is killed and the seal is stolen. With his last breath, he gives Lin a box and tells her to give it to her brother.  Meanwhile, Chon Wang is doing well as sheriff, having captured an impressive array of fugitives. His deputy ([[Matt Hill]]) is relaxing with a book called ''"Roy O'Bannon Vs. The Mummy"'', a highly fictionalized account of the events of the first film that now portrays Wang's "[[Shanghai]] Kid" as a cowardly sidekick, which dismays Wang. Wang receives a parcel containing a [[puzzle box]] and a letter from Lin telling him that their father is dead and that she has tracked the murderer to [[London]].  Chon Wang travels to [[New York City]] to find his old partner Roy O'Bannon ([[Owen Wilson]]). and uses his share of the first film's gold to buy a ticket to London. Chon finds that Roy has left his brief stint in [[Police|law enforcement]], broken off his romance with Falling Leaves, spent most of the gold investing in the [[Zeppelin]] , and is now a hotel waiter and part-time gigolo. (Later Roy reveals that he has lost all of the gold on publishing his novels). After they attempt [[prostitution]] to pay for a trip to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the [[List of mayors of New York City|Mayor of New York]] arrives in search of his daughters who are Roy's latest clients. The pair escape and ship themselves to [[London]] in a crate.  In London, Wang and O'Bannon have their duster and watch stolen, respectively, by a number of street thugs including a young boy named Charlie ([[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]]). After an extensive battle to reclaim these items, they are arrested by the police. In [[Scotland Yard]], Inspector Artie Doyle ([[Tom Fisher (actor)|Thomas Fisher]]) thanks the two for defeating the [[Fleet Street]] gang. He tells Wang that Lin is also in Scotland Yard, having attempted to kill Lord Rathbone. Meanwhile, Rathbone finds he is not alone in his carriage as Wu Chow ([[Donnie Yen]]) has sneaked his way on; Rathbone slips him the dagger that killed the Keeper of the Imperial Seal. Sometime later, Roy and Wang wander through London and see [[Buckingham Palace]]. They encounter Charlie, who lets them into the empty house of a [[Nobility|nobleman]] and finds an invitation to a gala at the castle.  Roy and Wang arrive that night at the gala, wearing [[disguise]]s: Roy masquerades as [[Major General]] "[[Sherlock Holmes]]" (a name he derives from the face of a clock), and Wang is the "[[Maharaja]] of [[Nevada]]". Wang and Roy follow Lord Rathbone to a private library, but Rathbone slips quickly through a secret passage before they can reach him. As Roy occupies himself with a copy of the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', Wang looks for the secret passage and discovers it in the fireplace. Wang enters the secret room, which contains treasures from throughout the [[British Empire]] and asks for Roy's help which Roy repeatedly ignores, as he thinks it is something minor, and continues to read his book. Rathbone's guards then attack Roy, but he is rescued by Lin, who has escaped from Scotland Yard. The three see Rathbone hand the Imperial Seal to Wu Chow, the [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] brother of the [[Emperor of China]], which is then stolen by Charlie who leaves his hat. Rathbone spots the three, and after a brief battle, he sets the barn on fire and escapes, and then the three also manage to escape.  They find Artie drunk after being sacked at his home. Artie deduces using from the hat that Charlie is in [[Madame Tussauds]]. They arrive just in time to save Charlie from the boxers at the expense of losing the seal again and being captured outside by police. Taken away in a police buggy, they are rescued in turn by Charlie, who later reveals his full name to be [[Charlie Chaplin]]. After an interlude in a [[brothel]] where Wang tries to convince Lin that Roy is unsuitable, Roy has overheard this and is upset with Wang, but forgives him when Roy arranges a pillow fight with the ladies of the night. When Lin sees this she runs into the night followed by Roy and Lin. They are all captured by Rathbone, who tells them that he is going to kill the royal family and frame "Loony" Lin. They escape and manage to stop Wu Chow from killing the royal family. Just as Wu Chow is about to kill Wang, Lin blasts and kills him with a rocket. The three they follow Rathbone to the top of Big Ben. He throws Roy out of the tower, but he survives when he grabs a hand of the clock. Thinking Roy is dead, Wang fights with Rathbone, and the pair are both thrown outside. Roy saves Wang as Rathbone falls to his death.  Roy and Wang are [[British honours system|knighted]], as is Artie, whose full name is now revealed to be  [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]. Artie decides to become a writer, of detective stories revolving around his deductive reasoning technique, and asks Roy if he can use the "Sherlock Holmes" name. Roy proposes that he and Wang go to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] to get in on the ground floor with [[Film|motion pictures]]. They roll off in a buggy, with Charlie (wearing [[The Tramp|a fake moustache]]) stowed away. Wang also manages to open the box his father sent him, finding a message inside reminding him of the importance of family.  
Shattered Glass (film)
 Stephen Glass is a reporter at ''[[The New Republic]]'', where he has made a name for himself for writing colorful stories. His editor, [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]], is revered by the magazine's young staff. When David Keene (at the time Chairman of the [[American Conservative Union]]) questions Glass's description of minibars and the drunken antics of [[Young Republicans]] at a convention, Kelly backs his reporter when Glass admits to one mistake but says the rest is true.  Kelly is fired after he stands up to his boss [[Marty Peretz]] on an unrelated personnel issue, and fellow writer [[Charles Lane (journalist)|Charles "Chuck" Lane]] is promoted to replace him. The magazine publishes an entertaining story by Glass titled "Hack Heaven" about a teenage hacker named Ian Restil who was given a lucrative job at software company Jukt Micronics after hacking into its computer system. After the article is published, [[Adam Penenberg]], a reporter at Forbes Digital Tool, begins researching the story in order to discover how Glass scooped everyone else. Penenberg is unable to uncover any corroborating evidence for Glass's story.  Questioned by the ''Forbes'' reporter, Lane becomes suspicious when Glass cannot provide sources for his article and when the few pieces of concrete evidence are discovered to be an amateurish website representing Jukt Micronics and a [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] phone number where every call goes directly to voicemail. Penenberg and his colleague, Andy Fox, can find no proof Jukt or an Ian Restil even exist. Lane drives Glass to the convention center where the hacker convention supposedly took place. When Lane asks a security guard for information, he is told the convention center was not open that day. Lane also discovers that the restaurant where the hackers supposedly ate dinner afterwards closes in the early afternoon.   After haphazardly trying to defend himself, Glass finally "admits" to Lane that he wasn't actually at the hacker convention, but relied on sources for information and pretended he was there to give the article a first-person feel. Lane is outraged, but proceeds cautiously while seeking the truth. He suspends Glass, earning him the enmity of staff reporters, who all are fond of Glass. Caitlin Avey, a writer at the magazine, is so angered by Lane's actions that she considers quitting. When a colleague calls Lane to express concern for Glass's state of mind, he also reveals that Glass has a brother in Palo Alto. Lane realizes the brother must have posed as the president of Jukt Micronics on the day he returned Lane's phone call.  Glass pleads for another chance, but Lane orders him out of the office and takes his security access card. Searching through back issues of ''The New Republic'', Lane realizes that much of Glass's previous work was falsified. When an emotional Glass returns, Lane fires him. Caitlin accuses Lane of wanting to get rid of everyone who was loyal to Michael Kelly, but he challenges her to act like the good reporter she is. He reminds her that half of the falsified stories were published on Kelly's watch, after being fact-checked, and that the entire staff will have to apologize to their readers for allowing Glass to continue to hand in fictitious stories.  The following day, a receptionist wryly remarks to Lane that all this trouble could have been averted if the stories required photographs. Lane discovers the staff has written an apology to their readers. They spontaneously applaud their editor, signifying their unity. At a meeting with Glass and a lawyer, Glass tacitly admits that 27 of the 41 articles he wrote for ''The New Republic'' were fabricated in whole or in part. An [[epilogue]] reveals that Glass decided to complete law school, and wrote a novel called ''[[The Fabulist]]'' about a reporter who fabricates his stories and that Michael Kelly was killed in Iraq while covering [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].  
Shade (film)
  Many years ago, a young Dean is playing in a mob-run illegal underground [[poker]] game. The game is raided by robbers who order everyone to put up their hands. The Dean reluctantly does so, revealing the card he's [[muck (gambling)|concealed]]. Incensed, a fellow player grabs a gun and starts shooting, setting off a firefight that kills everyone in the club except the Dean and one of the mobsters. The two men point their guns at each other's heads.  In present day, hustlers Tiffany ([[Thandie Newton]]) and Charlie ([[Gabriel Byrne]]) meet up with Larry Jennings ([[Jamie Foxx]]) as he's taking down an underground poker game. They discuss a partnership to work a "soft game" with a potential profit of $10,000-$20,000, and Larry tentatively agrees pending his meeting the third member of the group, Vernon ([[Stuart Townsend]]), a [[card mechanic]] who is working as a [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] [[blackjack]] dealer. With a small crew, Vernon switches out the contents of a six deck shoe and they take the casino for $40,000. As Vernon and Charlie wait for Larry at another bar, corrupt cop Scarne ([[Bo Hopkins]]) shakes them down and empties Vernon's wallet, but Vernon saves the bulk of his money as it's stashed in his boot. Larry arrives shortly after Scarne leaves and after seeing Vernon's skills agrees to team with them. The plan is for Larry to take down large pots on Vernon's crooked deals.  At the game, Larry gets impatient with the slow action and, on his own deal, gets over $100,000 in the pot. Unfortunately he loses, and the money he bet belongs to a mobster named Malini ([[Patrick Bauchau]]), who sends his enforcers, Marlo ([[Roger Guenveur Smith]]) and Nate ([[B-Real]]), to retrieve him. They take him to the house, which has been stripped bare. Everyone at the game was in on the con. The enforcers take Larry to an airport and under cover of the jet noise, kill him.  Charlie continues the story from the prologue, where Dean and the mobster agree to cut cards for the money. The mobster cuts a King and Dean cuts the [[Ace of spades]]. The mobster goes for his gun but Dean gets to his first, shooting the mobster and splashing the Ace with his blood. The three speculate that the story is an [[urban legend]]. They talk about taking the Dean ([[Sylvester Stallone]]) down at a game with a $250,000 buy-in and total stakes of at least $2,000,000. After Vernon's departure, it's revealed that he and Tiffany had been lovers until Vernon left and Tiffany slept with Charlie.  The next day, Malini's enforcers track down Charlie to a restaurant and Marlo demands the return of Marini's money. Charlie agrees to pay back $100,000 but instead Nate pulls a gun and a gunfight ensues. Tiffany arrives in time to kill Nate, but Marlo escapes. Charlie, Vernon and Tiffany run away and hide out at the [[Magic Castle]] with The Professor ([[Hal Holbrook]]), Vernon's former mentor. Scarne intrudes into the murder scene and he realizes that the three are involved from the description of the witnesses.  The three arrive at the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] for the game, where they discover that the host is Malini. One by one, Vernon and the Dean bust the other players until they're heads up and they decide to play [[five card stud]] for the rest of the game. Dean's former lover Eve ([[Melanie Griffith]]) arrives, and they take a break. The three grifters talk about the trouble Vernon is having getting the Dean to bite and Tiffany speculates the cards are marked. Grabbing some cards, Vernon discovers the Dean is using a "juice deck," a deck marked to be readable when one's eyes are unfocused. They return to the game prepared to use the deck against the Dean.  In the final hand, Vernon mucks a card and deals the hand. He deals the Dean two pair, Kings and Queens (with one King in the hole), and himself a pair of Jacks with a 7 in the hole for the Dean to see. The Dean goes all in, and when Vernon is $50,000 short Charlie and Tiffany make up the shortfall so he can call the bet. Before the cards are turned up, Scarne arrives at the hotel and Marlo enters the room. Identifying the three as the team who conned Larry, Malini's muscle pull their guns and Tiffany pulls hers, then Scarne enters with his gun drawn. The Dean insists that the hand be completed and Vernon swaps out his hole card 7 for a third Jack, which would beat the two pair he'd dealt the Dean. The room is stunned when the Dean turns up a third Queen to take the hand and a $2,000,000 pot. Malini tells the three they can leave but advises them to stay out of the Los Angeles rackets.   Charlie splits up the partnership with Vernon and, after Marlo's revelation that he was tipped off by Tiffany about shaking down Larry, with her as well. As Vernon sits alone in a diner, The Dean, Eve and Scarne enter, revealing the game was all an elaborate setup by the four of them to con Charlie and Tiffany. They split the take and part, the Dean and Eve leaving together. The Dean pauses to flip the blood-stained Ace of spades to Vernon.  
Sex with Love
 Luisa, a new young teacher, calls a meeting of parents to address how her primary school should deal with sex education. But sexuality is still an unresolved issue for her and for many of the parents, among them being her secret lover Jorge, a shy butcher Emilio and brash businessman Álvaro. ''Sexo con Amor'' is the story of how these three parents and the teacher herself are ambushed by their own erotic passions. While professing undying love to their partners, they hop enthusiastically on a merry-go-round of physical relations, leading to sometimes tragic and sometimes hilarious effects.  
The Shape of Things
 When nerdy Adam Sorenson ([[Paul Rudd]]), an [[English Literature]] major at Mercy, a fictitious Midwestern college, meets Evelyn Ann Thompson ([[Rachel Weisz]]), an attractive graduate art student, at the local museum where he works, his life takes an unexpected turn. Never having the best success with women, he is flattered when Evelyn shows an interest in him and, at Evelyn's suggestion, gets a new hairstyle, begins a regular exercise regimen, eats healthier foods, dresses more stylishly, acts more confident and dominant, and begins wearing contact lenses instead of his usual eyeglasses. These initial changes regarding Adam's physical appearance are well received by Adam's friend, Phillip ([[Frederick Weller]]), and Phillip's fiancee, Jenny ([[Gretchen Mol]]). Jenny takes such a liking to Adam's new physique that she makes a move on Adam and the two share a passionate kiss. It is left ambiguous as to whether or not Adam and Jenny have sex. Later, Evelyn cajoles Adam into undergoing [[plastic surgery]] to fix his misshapen nose and succeeds in persuading him to cut himself off from Phillip and Jenny, whose relationship she ruins.  Eventually, Adam learns that he has been part of Evelyn's MFA thesis project, a topic often mentioned in conversation but never fully explained. Evelyn presents Adam to an audience of students and faculty as her creation, announcing that she had been instructed to "change the world" by her graduate adviser, but that she had chosen to "change someone's world" instead. Her work consisted of "sculpting" Adam into a more attractive human being. Accordingly, none of the feelings she has shown him throughout the film are genuine; at no stage in their "relationship" has she fallen in love with him; her videotapes of their lovemaking are simply part of the project's documentation. She also announces that she is not going to marry him and the engagement ring he offered her is simply one of the exhibits of her art installation, the "capper to my time at Mercy".  Publicly humiliated and emotionally devastated, Adam confronts Evelyn in the gallery (no one showed up to the Q&A afterwards), demanding an explanation for her actions. She responds by saying that he should in fact be grateful to her, claiming that, objectively speaking, she has been a positive influence on his life, making him a more attractive and interesting person in the eyes of society. He calls it a heartless joke, not art, and asks for the ring back, as it was his grandmother's. Evelyn agrees. He asks her if "anything you told me about yourself was true" and she tells him what she whispered in his ear the night they had sex on tape was true.   Finally, Adam stands alone in the gallery. He goes over to the TV and pushes "Play" as it shows when the two of them were in bed making love. He watches it over and over again.  
Shark Zone
 Divers try to recover diamonds in waters infested by great white sharks.  
A Short Film About John Bolton
  In a posh London gallery, Carolyn Dalgleish (Carolyn Backhouse) prepares a showing of the latest works by John Bolton; disturbing portraits of beautiful, vicious vampiric women he encountered whilst pot holing. The Interviewer ([[Marcus Brigstocke]]) collects information on Bolton, who seems to perplex those who work with him and collect his art (like radio personality [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]] (playing himself)).  Bolton appears to review the placement of the paintings before the opening. Eccentric and detached, Bolton is uncomfortable with the amount of attention being paid to him. Forced to give a speech at that evening's party (where guests include the ''real'' John Bolton in a cameo appearance), Bolton quietly states that he simply "paints what he sees."  Following the gala, Bolton is interviewed at home by Brigstocke. Bolton again proves elusive with answers about his art, though he does (reluctantly) agree to have his work habits filmed for the first time (though only by the Interviewer, working without his crew).  As dusk approaches, Bolton takes the Interviewer to his studio, located in the basement of an ancient monastery and graveyard. As the hours drag on, Bolton shows no signs of getting started (he says he is waiting), and the Interviewer finally leaves. Filming himself as he walks out of the graveyard, the Interviewer spots two ghostly women (one with zebra stripes running up her leg) moving towards him. The camera falls to the ground, and the film closes on Bolton's latest work: a pale woman, with zebra stripes running up her leg, feasting on human flesh.  
Shubho Mahurat
 The phrase "Shubho Mahurat" is associated with the beginning of shooting for a feature film. The first shot is marked by a grand reception. This Miss Marple-esque film begins with this event. An [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]] producer, Padmini Chowdhury ([[Sharmila Tagore]]), has come to India to invest in a film. Her second husband Sambit Roy ([[Sumanta Mukherjee]]), an out-of-work director, is assigned the job of direction.  The out-of-work director has a shady past. A witness to his shady past is an aspiring actor, who was subsequently thrown out of the acting circuit. This actor started a catering service for the film unit.  The NRI producer insists on casting a retired actress, Kakoli ([[Kalyani Mandal]]) in a prominent role. Kakoli, a drug addict, subsequently dies under mysterious circumstances, on the day of 'Shubho Mahurat'. The journalist Mallika Sen ([[Nandita Das]]) is the only person present at the time of the death. The suspicion naturally falls on the husband of the actress, who reportedly has an amorous relationship with another lady.  The unnatural death of the actress causes a police investigation. An [[Indian Police Service|IPS]] officer named Arindam ([[Tota Roy Chowdhury]]) takes up the investigation. During the course of investigation, Arindam befriends Mallika. Meanwhile, Mallika catches the fancy of a still photographer named Jojo ([[Anindya Chatterjee]]) who, incidentally, is closely related to the NRI producer.  This NRI producer had a past no less interesting than the other protagonists. The NRI producer was an actress of repute in her heyday. She divorced her husband and left the country to settle abroad. Before that, she had given birth to an abnormal child. The course of the film reveales that she bore a grudge against Kakoli for spreading a contagious disease to her while she was pregnant, resulting in the abnormal child.  Another amorous affair runs parallel to the main theme: The camera assistant was repenting for his past affair with the hairdresser. The hairdresser has her problems and she was extracting money very often from the camera assistant. All through the movie, the aunt of the journalist, Ranga Pishima ([[Raakhee]]), gives vital leads to the investigation through deductive logic. She is able to read the mind of the niece correctly. Her valuable inputs finally leads to solve the murder mystery.  
Shredder (film)
 Chad (Elliot Olson) is [[snowboarding]] down a mountain, when suddenly a [[skier]] dressed in black attacks him. Chad attempts to get away, but is decapitated by a piece of wire strung up between two trees. Meanwhile, college student Kimberly ([[Lindsey McKeon]]) is going on a trip to an abandoned ski resort, which her father will be buying soon, with her boyfriend Cole ([[Scott Weinger]]), cousin Pike (Juleah Weikel), and friends Skyler (Billy O'Sullivan), Robyn (Holly Towne) and Kirk (Peter Riggs). While stopping off at a gas station, the group bump into the [[Europe]]an Christophe ([[Brad Hawkins]]), who they quickly invite along with them.  Cole and Skyler go back into town to retrieve beer, but are warned away from the resort by a bartender, Bud (Ron Varela). Skyler also briefly meets Bud's daughter Shelly (Candace Moon) to whom he takes a liking. Arriving back at the resort, the group partake in drinking games until the town Sheriff (Seth Reston) shows up. Kimberly and Robyn manage to bribe him to let them stay there for the night, however as the Sheriff leaves the cabin he is stabbed to death. Kimberly then tells the others that a few years previous, a group of snowboarders murdered a young girl at the resort, and that's why it had closed down.  The next day, the group go snowboarding. Kirk stumbles upon a small building hidden in the mountain. As he enters to investigate, he is stabbed in the stomach with an [[icicle]] by the killer. Meanwhile, Skyler bumps into Shelly while she ski's. The two get on well and decide to stick together, but Bud appears and sends Shelly home. As Robyn uses the chairlift, the killer boards with her before attempting to throw her off. Robyn fights back and manages to push him off the chairlift, but as she prepares to deboard her scarf wraps around the handle and she is hanged as the lift drags her off the ground.  At the cabin, Skyler meets up with Cole and Pike, before the trio stumble upon the Sheriff's body. The group are quick to suspect Christophe as the murderer, and set off to warn the others. While searching, they find the little girl preserved in ice, and Skyler is stabbed in the leg with an axe by the killer, but manages to escape. Kimberly and Christophe find a hot tub, where Kimberly discovers Christophe was at the resort when the little girl was murdered, and that all other witnesses had been murdered. Christophe suspects Bud for the previous killings, as to get revenge for the death of his youngest daughter. Kimberly and Christophe then begin to have sex. Cole soon sees the pair and angrily leaves, prompting Kimberly to follow him. After they leave, Christophe is beaten to death with a shovel.  Returning to the cabin, the survivors find the car has been broken and the dead bodies of their friends lined up in the snow. In the cabin, the group tend to Skyler's leg. Cole and Pike go outside to fix the car, leaving Kimberly and Skyler in the cabin. The killer sneaks inside and murders Skyler, stabbing him through the eye with a ski pole. Kimberly hides from the killer in a cupboard, where she finds Chad's body. The killer manages to break in the cupboard and stabs Kimberly with a poker. Cole rushes inside, but finds Kimberly dead before the killer locks him in the cabin.  Outside, Pike fixes the car. The killer swiftly attacks her however, and in a panic she crashes the car before the killer hits her in the head. Cole manages to get outside and finds Pike persumably dead. Cole travels up the mountain, taunting the killer. He is soon shot at by a figure, revealed to be Bud. Bud tells Cole he simply wanted to scare the group away from the area, but Cole tries to escape. Bud chases him on a [[snowmobile]], and is quickly decapitated by a piece of wire strung up between two trees. Cole then makes his way into town. After entering an alley, he becomes trapped as the killer drives a large shredding truck to block his path. The killer reveals herself to be Shelly, who wants to get revenge for the death of her younger sister. As she is about to murder Cole, Pike shows herself to be alive, shoots Shelly who then falls into the shredder. Cole and Pike leave the town and persumably start a relationship.  
Shiver (film)
 Regional Crime Unit officer Chan Kwok-ming ([[Francis Ng]]) and his wife, Sammi Mok ([[Athena Chu]]) were on the way to finalize their proceedings for separation where an armed robbery breaks out in the streets. Kwok-ming steps in to assist in hunting the criminals, but Sammi was hit by a stray bullet and was seriously injured, leading her into a coma. Several months later, Sammi awakes from her coma. Sammi's doctor, Ko Chuen ([[Nick Cheung]]) warns her to be especially careful with her body as her blood type is very rare.  Since Kwok-ming is often busy and handling cases at the police station, Sammi is left home along to recover and have been hallucinating often lately. One time, Sammi sees a female celebrity, Kitty Chow (Tiffany Lee), killed in her hallucination. While being skeptical, Sammi walks into the back alley of a bar and discovers the corpse of Kitty.

However, in this critical moment, Sammi mysteriously goes missing.  
Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas
 Sinbad and his pirate crew attempt to steal the magical "Book of Peace" while it is being shipped to [[Syracuse, Sicily]], protected by Prince Proteus of Syracuse. Proteus was once Sinbad's best friend as a child and he tells him if it ever meant anything he can prove it. Sinbad tries to steal the book anyway, but is prevented when [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] attacks the ship. The two work together to fight off Cetus and for a moment reaffirm their bond. Just when it seems the beast is defeated, Sinbad is dragged off the ship. Proteus goes to save Sinbad, but he is stopped by his crew.  Drawn underwater by Cetus, Sinbad is saved by the beautiful Goddess of Discord, [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], who offers him any boon he desires in exchange for the Book of Peace. Sinbad and his crew go to Syracuse to steal the Book, but leave without doing so. Anticipating this, Eris impersonates Sinbad and steals the Book. Sinbad is sentenced to death, whereupon Proteus sends Sinbad to retrieve the Book instead, [[Damon and Pythias|placing himself as a hostage]], and Proteus' fiancée Lady Marina goes to make sure that Sinbad succeeds. To prevent them from succeeding, Eris sends a group of mythical [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]s, who entrance and seduce the men aboard Sinbad's ship with their hypnotic singing voices, but do not affect Marina, who pilots the ship to safety. The Goddess of Discord later sends a [[Roc (mythology)|Roc]] which captures Marina, but she is rescued by Sinbad.  After these and other incidents, Sinbad and Marina enter Eris' realm, where she reveals that her plan was to maneuver Proteus into Sinbad's place, leaving Syracuse without an [[heir]], and agrees to surrender the Book of Peace only if Sinbad truthfully tells whether he will return to Syracuse to accept blame and be executed if he does not get the Book. She gives him her word that she will honour the deal, making it unbreakable even for a god. When he answers that he will return, Eris calls him a liar, and returns him and Marina to the mortal world. Ashamed, Sinbad admits the Goddess of Discord is right, truly believing deep down that he is a selfish, black-hearted liar.  In Syracuse, the time allotted to Sinbad has elapsed. Proteus readies himself to be beheaded, but at the last minute, Sinbad appears and takes his place. An enraged Eris appears suddenly and saves Sinbad by shattering the executioner's sword to pieces. Sinbad, shocked, realizes that this was still part of her test and that he has beaten her by proving his answer to be true after all. Eris is furious but cannot go back on her word, but happily gives the Book to Sinbad.  With the Book restored to Syracuse, Sinbad and his crew prepare to leave Syracuse on another voyage, leaving Marina behind. Unbeknownst to him, Proteus sees that Marina has fallen deeply [[Romantic love|in love]] with Sinbad and has released her from their engagement and sent her to join Sinbad's ship. Now together, they and the crew set out on another long voyage as the ship sails into the sunset.  
Silmido (film)
 On 21 January 1968, 31 [[North Korea]]n commandos of [[Unit 124]] are shown to have infiltrated [[South Korea]] in a [[Blue House Raid|failed mission to assassinate]] President [[Park Chung-hee]].  As a means of retaliation, the [[Republic of Korea Armed Forces]] assembled a team of 31 social outcasts including criminals on [[death penalty|death row]] and [[life imprisonment]], in a plot to kill [[Kim Il-sung]]. The team is designated 'Unit 684'. The recruits are taken to the island of [[Silmido]] for training. The mission is offered to the recruits as the only way to redeem themselves and show their loyalty to their country. If they succeed, they will win their freedom and a new life. With this goal in mind, they endure their training. The training is shown over several months, with the recruits enduring various forms of extremely vigorous training and regular physical punishment, including being [[Human branding|branded]]. One recruit is killed after he falls from a [[ropes course]].  At the end of their training, they are dispatched on their mission to North Korea, but are recalled not long after their departure. It is revealed that the project has been called off, as the government attempts a peaceful reconciliation with the North. The recruits return to Silmido discouraged and frustrated. Shortly afterwards two of the Unit 684 members escape from their barracks and rape a female doctor. They are quickly discovered, and believing that they will be executed, decide to commit suicide. One kills the other at his request but is apprehended before he is able to kill himself. The apprehended soldier is then returned to the camp, tied up, and made to watch his fellow Unit 684 members being beaten by the guards for the two men's betrayal. Enraged, one of the Unit 684 members being beaten is able to take his guard's bat and kills the tied up soldier for bringing disgrace to the unit.  To keep the plot to kill Kim Il-sung unknown to the outside world, the South Korean intelligence agency decide to kill all the members of Unit 684. The unit's commander protests, but is told that if his troops failed to follow this order, they too would be killed alongside Unit 684. Torn between his duty to follow orders and his personal honor, the commander intentionally leaks this information to one of the Unit 684 members. Unit 684, realizing they are going to be killed that same night, make plans to mutiny. They attack and kill the majority of their guards, and find out from one of the guards that they legally no longer exist, and never would have received recognition for their mission if it succeeded, nor even be allowed to return to society. Unit 684 decide to escape from the island and make their story known. The 20 remaining members of Unit 684 capture a bus containing civilians and head to [[Seoul]]. An official pronouncement is heard over the radio that 20 "armed communist agents" have infiltrated the country, and a state of emergency is declared. After charging through one army roadblock and winning a firefight they are eventually stopped and surrounded by soldiers in front of the [[Yuhan Corporation]] building in [[Dongjak District]], Seoul. A firefight ensues, with the [[Republic of Korea Army]] showing no regard for the welfare of the civilians on board the bus. All of the Unit 684 members are either killed or wounded, and many South Korean soldiers are also killed. The surviving Unit 684 members release the civilians who have not been killed by the [[Republic of Korea Army]], before committing suicide using their own hand grenades. An investigation into the incident is shown to have been carried out; however the report is not read and is seen to be filed away in storage.  
Since Otar Left
 The three women live together in the same run-down apartment in one of Tbilisi's oldest neighborhoods. They bear many of the realities of life in modern Georgia, such as frequent power blackouts and dilapidated infrastructure. Amidst this, Eka remains the matriarch of the family. She retains an often fractious relationship with her daughter, Marina, but is very close to her granddaughter, Ada. However, it is her beloved son Otar (an [[unseen character]]), that she is most attached to.  At the opening of the film, the audience learns that Otar Gogebashvili, although a doctor by profession, has recently moved to [[France]] because of the difficult economic situation in newly independent Georgia. In [[Paris]], he works illegally on construction sites in order to financially support his family back in Georgia. Eka eagerly awaits Otar's regular phone calls and the money he sends home from France. The difference between the generations is apparent: Eka loves French culture, speaks perfect French but remains a [[Stalinism|Stalinist]], even in 2002, whereas Ada is quite Westernized, and longs to follow her uncle's path and move to the West. Marina has university degree but due to the high unemployment in Post Soviet Georgia sells heirlooms at the market.   Their life then changes drastically when Marina receives a call from Otar's friend, Niko ([[Duta Skhirtladze]]), who had accompanied him to France. Niko bears bad news: Otar  has been killed in an accident. Eka is elderly and fragile, and Marina and Ada both agree that the shock of the death of her beloved son could kill her. In a similar manner to the [[Germany|German]] film ''[[Good Bye Lenin!]]'', which was released in the same year, the pair decides to conceal Otar's death from Eka.   In order to create the charade, Ada forges letters from Otar. Eka grows worried about the lack of phone calls and the lack of money in the letters (as Ada and Marina are in no position to attach any), but the pair includes excuses into the letters, and initially succeed to allay Eka's worries. Several other complications arise, but the pair deal with them in turn, and Eka remains unaware of Otar's death.  After some time, Ada grows reluctant to continue the charade, as she feels that lying to her grandmother is taking its toll. Ada and Marina discuss possibly telling Eka the truth, when instead the eccentric Eka decides that she wants to visit Otar in France. Before the pair can persuade her otherwise, she sells her library with unique French books collected by the generations to raise the money, and purchases plane tickets for all three of them. Unable to persuade Eka not to fly to France, Ada and Marina accompany her along.  The story resumes in France, where Eka searches for any sign of her son. After several attempts, she finally locates the apartment where he lived, and told the truth by his neighbors. Eka breaks down with the initial shock, but soon recovers and returns to meet Ada and Marina, as they are due to return to Georgia. Instead of confronting them, Eka offers them a gracious way out of their dilemma by pretending that she now believes Otar could not make a living in France and had decided to move to America. He did not tell his family in order to avoid admitting the failure of his original plan.  Not long after, they leave for the [[airport]]. Upon reaching the airport, Ada tells Eka and Marina to go ahead while she purchases a magazine. While the older women pass through the security checkpoint, Ada remains behind. It thus becomes clear that Ada has no intention of returning to Tbilisi, and intends to try to make a life for herself in France. The film ends with their tearful goodbye through the windows of the [[gate (airport)|departure gate]].  
Silent Warnings
 After his cousin Joe ([[Stephen Baldwin]]) dies, Layne Vassimer ([[A. J. Buckley]]) and his girlfriend Macy (Callie De Fabry), along with their friends Stephen ([[David O'Donnell]]), Maurice (Ransford Doherty), Iris (Kim Onasch) and Katrina ([[Michelle Borth]]), decide to clean up Joe's house with the intention of selling it. When they see it for the first time, they discover the house completely covered in plates of iron armor.  The group also finds [[crop circle]]s in the nearby cornfield.  When Iris suddenly disappears, they realize something is really wrong.  During a blackout, the house is attacked by [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]].

The Singing Detective (film)
 Suffering from the skin disease [[psoriasis]] and crippling [[psoriatic arthritis]], [[detective]] novelist Dan Dark is in such pain in a hospital that he begins to delve into fantasy, resulting in several storylines told simultaneously: * A [[film noir]] based on Dark's novel, ''The Singing Detective'', in which a [[nightclub singer]]/private eye, hired by Mark Binney, takes on a strange case involving prostitutes and two mysterious men. Nothing is ever solved from this, only a vague plot. Notably, all of the people in the film noir are played by people who are real people in Dark's life; for example, Dark's nurse plays a singer. * The present reality, in which Dark is tormented by incredible pain. Dark interacts with the various people around him, as the doctors and nurses attempt to help, but are dismissed by Dark's anger and bitterness towards everyone. His sense of reality then collapses into hallucinations as the people randomly sing choreographed musical numbers, such as "How Much Is That Doggie In The Window?" In the end, his reality is blended with the film noir and he is abducted by the two mysterious men, only to be shot by the titular "singing detective". * Dark's traumatic childhood in the past, which explains Dark's repulsion toward sexuality (Dark had watched his mother have sex with other men, including his father's business partner), and his own fiery temper.

He is met with unfamiliar local customs. Selima ([[Jessica Alba]]) becomes his "sleeping dictionary", who sleeps with him and teaches him the language and the habits of the locals.  John is sent up river where a sickness is affecting the Yakata tribe. He and Selima travel inland. John witnesses a nearby mining operation run by Europeans. He notices that the Yakata have rice – which has been given to them by the miners – and he guesses correctly that the miners have poisoned the rice in order to get rid of the Yakata. Knowing that they will exact vengeance, John tells the Yakata what has happened. The Yakata wipe out the miners.  Despite their intents, the two find themselves falling into a forbidden love. John is eager to marry Selima despite the longhouse not allowing it. When John tells Henry about his plans to marry her, they lock Selima up. Selima then agrees to marry in the longhouse and they part ways. Bullard threatens to send him to trial for the death of the European miners. He makes a deal with John. John has to give up Selima, and go to Britain for a year's vacation and to meet the Bullards' daughter Cecilia. Another local British official, Neville Shipperly ([[Noah Taylor]]), a boorish drunk and a man who despises the locals, is jealous of John because he had planned to win Cecilia as his own.  A year later, John is seen marrying Cecilia. He still struggles to get over his past with his sleeping dictionary. With Cecilia, he decides the best thing to do is go back to Sarawak to continue his work there. Returning to Sarawak, Cecilia notices John's desire for Selima with his constant distance from her. Cecilia demands to know more about Selima and John replies by saying that she is married to Belansai and that the couple have a baby together.  While at the lake collecting rocks for research, John sees Selima with a baby. He believes the child to be his and asks Famous to arrange a meeting with the pair. Soon back at the house, Selima walks in, unaware that John is there. John begs to see his son and soon Selima walks away not before John can stop them. Here, John meets his son Manda for the first time. When Belansai hears news that John is spending time with his wife, he sneaks in to try to kill John but only manages to hurt him with a razor. The next morning, Henry reveals to John his past about his own 'sleeping dictionary', which resulted in the birth of another child: Selima. When Belansai is caught for trying to kill an officer, he is sentenced to be hanged. Selima is not happy that Belansai will be killed as he's been a good father to Manda. Not wanting to kill Belansai, a friend of his, John goes through with announcing Belansai's hanging as he had no other option. Later that night, Selima tries to break Belansai out, not knowing John is already there. When she walks over to the jail cell, she sees John breaking Belansai out and handing him a gun. As Belansai escapes, John asks Selima to meet him at the dock so they can escape on the boat. Selima tells him he won't come as they'll catch him. John turns to Selima and says "Then I'll tell them I'd rather have you than a country... or a language... or a history". They embrace as the rain is pouring behind them.  The next day, since the people of the Longhouse have turned on Selima, she is forced to become the sleeping dictionary for Neville. Later Cecilia announces she is pregnant, shocking John. That night, Selima bashes Neville on the head, knocking him out, because he has attempted to attack her and force her. She grabs the baby and runs from the house, heading for the docks. Although John still has plans to be with Selima and their son, he begins writing a note but stops as Cecilia catches him. The couple then talk about John's love for Selima and how Cecilia wants John to be happy. Aggie is not happy that Cecilia and Henry have allowed both John and Selima to run away together because she never left Henry's sight, fearing he'd go with his sleeping dictionary. She encourages Neville to go after them.  With the help of Famous and the Yakata, John searches for Selima as she's left believing that John didn't come to the place of arrangement. They reunite as Neville comes through with a gun. He tells them to cuff themselves around the bamboos and tells them of his plans to kill John, Selima and their baby. They're then rescued by the Yakata, who kill Neville.  At the end, they decide to live together and migrate with the Yakata.

Sniper 2
 Former [[U.S. Marine Corps]] [[Force Reconnaissance]] [[Scout Sniper]] Thomas Beckett ([[Tom Berenger]]), who was discharged [[Sniper (1993 film)|after his finger was amputated in the first film]], is met by [[CIA]] officer James Eckles ([[Dan Butler]]) and Colonel David McKenna ([[Linden Ashby]]) at his home. Despite losing his index finger he uses to shoot, Beckett still has the capability of firing a gun (as he uses his middle finger for the job). Considering this, along with his impressive career from his time in the Marine Corps, Beckett is given a mission to [[assassinate]] renegade Serbian General Mile Valstoria (Peter Linka), who is responsible for conducting [[Hit-and-run tactics|hit-and-run]] [[ethnic cleansing]] operations in Muslim-populated areas. The CIA fears that Valstoria's actions are threatening to inflame a larger conflict in the region. Beckett agrees to participate, but requests that an additional man, a [[Sniper team|spotter]], must come with him. Beckett is introduced to his spotter, Jake Cole ([[Bokeem Woodbine]]), an experienced [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] sniper who is on death row for killing a federal officer who allegedly betrayed Cole's unit and had them killed during a mission. But Cole is released and offered to be pardoned if he takes part in the mission.  After being dropped off into Serbia, Beckett and Cole make their way to a [[Catholic]] [[basilica]]. There, they meet an underground [[resistance movement|resistance]] member named Sophia ([[Erika Marozsán]]). Sophia takes them to her apartment, which is perched high above the designated area where Valstoria is due to show up, near a government building. The next morning, Beckett assassinates his target. Valstoria's killing puts the city into lockdown. After their original extraction point is compromised, Cole and Beckett are forced to find an alternative plan. When they hitch a ride on a public tram, nearby soldiers stop the vehicle and try to arrest them, but the two operatives take over the tram and ram it into some police cars. They soon exit the tram, running through the streets. Cole is captured and put into a prison where Valstoria's men keep their so-called 'special enemies', but Beckett is able to escape.  Beckett meets Sophia that night, and the two make a plan to rescue Cole. With the help of Sophia's brothers, Zoran and Vojislav, the next day they box in military trucks carrying Cole and a fellow prisoner to a prison where Cole was to be executed. They ambush the convoy and then help Cole and Pavel (Tamás Puskás), who is a pacifist and political dissident, out of the truck and into a van that Zoran brought. Cole admits to Beckett that the assassination of Valstoria was set up to get Cole caught and then rescue Pavel from jail and brought out of Serbia. That night, at an abandoned factory that was meant to be the designated extraction zone, the group is ambushed by a tank and infantry. Both Vojislav and Zoran are killed in the attack and, after escaping from the factory through a sewer, Beckett orders Sophia to break off from the group and leave.  A distance away from the factory, Pavel insists that they should head to Komra, a Muslim town where a friend of Pavel's, Nauzad (Zoltán Seress), lives. As the group meets Nauzad, he offers to help get the men to the border by getting them to a bus that would get them there. Within a couple of hours they are on their way but, as they cross a river, they come across an unexpected checkpoint and end up heading to Simand, the secondary extraction point, on foot. Meanwhile, Cpt. Marks ([[Can Togay]]) inspects the bus that the three men just departed from and suspects that they are attempting to head to Simand. Marks orders a tracker, (Béla Jáki), to take his special forces unit to Simand.  As the three men arrive at Simand, they are ambushed by the special forces team in a forest outside of town, and Pavel suffers a slight flesh wound in the arm. After the trio kills the entire team, they are forced to proceed into town. The tracker holds up in the town factory and snipes down the team. Beckett demands that Cole take Pavel to the extraction zone while he deals with the tracker. Cole is severely wounded by the sniper, but Beckett picks him off. Pavel and Becket carry the wounded Cole into the helicopter and leave, just as Serb reinforcements led by Cpt. Marks arrive. In the helicopter, Beckett and Pavel look at Cole as he is badly wounded. Cole says, "Freedom!" and succumbs to his wounds.  
The Snow Walker
 In the summer of 1953, Canadian bush pilot Charlie Halliday (Barry Pepper), a brash, former [[World War II|Second World War]] bomber pilot based in [[Yellowknife]], is flying a routine job in the [[Queen Maud Gulf]] on the [[Arctic Ocean]] when he encounters a small band of [[Inuit]] people who plead for his help. They are traveling with a sick young woman, Kanaalaq ([[Annabella Piugattuk]]), and they ask Charlie to fly her to a hospital. Charlie suspects she has [[tuberculosis]]. At first he refuses, but when they offer him two valuable [[Walrus ivory|walrus tusks]] for his help, he reluctantly agrees to take her to Yellowknife.  During the flight, his [[Noorduyn Norseman]] aircraft develops engine trouble, and they crash land near the shore of a glacial lake. Charlie and Kanaalaq are unharmed, but the aircraft is disabled. They are in the middle of a vast [[tundra]] in the [[Northwest Territories]], the radio is broken, and they have a meagre amount of supplies. To make matters worse, he is hundreds of miles from the route he submitted in his original flight plan, so any rescue operation would not know where to look. Charlie is overwhelmed with a sense of doom, and he sees his Inuit companion as an unwelcome burden.  Charlie estimates they are about 100 miles from the closest town. Believing their chances of survival are slim if they both wait with the aircraft, Charlie leaves Kanaalaq behind to look for help on his own. He soon learns, however, that he is unprepared for the challenges presented by this harsh and unforgiving land. One morning he awakens surrounded by a storm of mosquitoes, which force him to flee shoeless across the jagged rocks before collapsing. Kanaalaq appears above him and begins treating his wounds and bites with mud and grass. She feeds him and mends his clothes. Gradually, Charlie regains his strength and is healed through Kanaalaq's patient care. Charlie comes to appreciate this young woman's gifts, and together they learn to communicate with each other.  After hearing the sound of a distant aircraft, Charlie realizes they never should have abandoned the crash site. He decides they should return to their aircraft, which he believes has surely been discovered by now. They set out together, but this time he is much better equipped with the watertight boots that Kanaalaq made for him. Along the way, the ailing young Inuit woman teaches the hot-tempered pilot the way to live in the tundra, and the two form a bond of respect and friendship. When they discover the ruins of another aircraft crash, Kanaalaq shows Charlie how to prepare a corpse for the afterlife in a stone burial cairn with the person's tools placed inside. She tells him that when a person is called to the afterlife, where there is much wildlife for hunting, they need the appropriate tools.  When Charlie and Kanaalaq arrive back at the crash site, they discover no sign of rescuers, and Charlie becomes deeply depressed, convinced they will not survive the oncoming winter. Kanaalaq, however, understands how to survive in this harsh land, and she prepares a [[caribou]] hunt. She places [[inuksuit]] — multiple stone structures used by the Inuit to guide caribou into areas where hunters can easily harvest them. She is able to elicit Charlie's help, and together they kill three caribou, which will provide sufficient food and pelts for the winter.  One night, Kanaalaq reveals how her father died in a snowstorm, and how her mother wandered off to die so that her children would have enough food to live.  After Kanaalaq uses the pelts to create suitable winter clothing for Charlie, Charlie and Kanaalaq set out together across the tundra hoping to reach an Inuit camp or village to the north. In the coming days, Kanaalaq's condition worsens, and Charlie is forced to carry her on a sleigh he built using the valuable walrus tusks.  One morning, Charlie discovers that Kanaalaq too has wandered off so that he might live.  He follows her tracks in the snow, which lead to a [[Snowy Owl|white owl]]. He builds a stone burial cairn for Kanaalaq, placing her hunting and fishing tools, and the valuable walrus tusks inside for the afterlife.  In a snowstorm, Charlie approaches a small Inuit village, where he is welcomed.  
Sleeping Pills (film)
 Tarika, a supposed expert in [[applied probability]], gets a job with a [[Bleeding edge technology|cutting-edge]] transportation company, Dymotran (Dynamic Modular Transportation), and develops a romantic interest in his attractive new boss and [[Vice president|EVP]], Charlotte. Having presented himself to his new employers as a square-toed professional, Tarika is embarrassed when Charlotte discovers that his closest friends are playful misfits with little to no professional aspirations. In spite of apparent compatibility issues, Tarika and Charlotte begin to develop a relationship. Tarika reconsiders his choice of friends after his on-again off-again love interest, Tricia, makes out with Kevin, his close friend and proverbial [[Ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]], during a surreal birthday party in a [[kitschy]] Mexican restaurant (complete with cliff divers and [[Mariachi]] bands).  Tarika struggles to decide which life suits him best and as is his tendency, develops somewhat of an over-attachment to Charlotte. After an untimely marriage proposal to Charlotte, who is focused on her career and not ready to settle down, Tarika is dumped. In his bitterness and hurt, Tarika resigns from work on Dymotran's sustaining project, the development of a futuristic, modular transportation system. This places Charlotte and her company in jeopardy and Charlotte confronts Tarika in the parking lot as he leaves the office for the last time. This encounter erupts into a full-blown screaming match and eventually ends with Charlotte admitting that she loves Tarika. After a final plea from Charlotte for Tarika to reconsider his decision, he agrees to give two more weeks to the job and in return, Charlotte agrees to be open-minded about a future with Tarika.  Taking breaks from his final work on the project, Tarika visits many buildings and public spaces of 60's and 70's [[Modernist]] origin, the architecture and design of which serves as inspiration for much of his work. At every turn, another one of these spaces is boarded up and [[bulldozed]]. This builds upon the predominant [[theme (arts)|theme]] of Sleeping Pills, whereby the entities and images forming ones identity are crushed without remorse in favor of new and improved versions. These images serve as a [[metaphor]] for the ephemeral home, relationship, and sense of self that can be seen as a consequence of a [[Postmodern]] society.  Tarika is reunited with the old gang for a final [[roller skating]] session at the FunPlex, a large [[roller rink]] and game [[Video arcade|arcade]] scheduled for demolition the following week. Soon after, Tarika meets up with Tricia at the courtyard of their old high school (an odd building with no windows), where Tricia reveals that she is leaving the area for good and asks Tarika to run away with her.  The plot culminates with Tarika having to make a decision to either run away with the unpredictable and fun Tricia or stay and attempt to build a life with a more stable, yet seemingly incompatible Charlotte.

The two drive to her mother's [[Hamptons]] [[beach house]] expecting to be alone, but are surprised by Marin's mother, successful playwright Erica Barry, who is there with her sister Zoe.  After an awkward dinner, the night turns disastrous when — during [[foreplay]] with Marin — Harry has a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and is rushed to a hospital. The doctor, Julian Mercer, tells Harry to stay nearby for a few days, so Harry ends up staying with Erica. Their personalities clash and create awkward living arrangements—until they get to know each other. The fact that Harry is dating her daughter and that Julian has fallen for Erica leave the two struggling to deal with relationships.  Marin and Harry agree to break up. He and Erica spend more time together and eventually consummate their relationship. Harry discovers that his improving health means that he no longer has to stay with Erica, so he heads home.  Marin receives news that her father, Dave Klein, Erica's ex-husband, whom Erica still allows to direct her plays, is getting remarried to Kristen, an ear, nose and throat doctor who is only two years older than Marin. Although Erica is unaffected by the news, Marin is devastated and pressures her mother into accompanying her to a family dinner. Erica is the life of the party until she sees Harry at another table with another woman. In the argument that follows, Harry suffers from what he believes is another heart attack, but he is told by the young ER physician, Dr. Martinez, who treats him like her father, that it was only a [[panic attack]].  Although she is heartbroken, Erica figures that these events would be great to use in a play. Harry hears about it and rushes to the NYC theater where it is being rehearsed. Despite her denials, it is quickly obvious that she has used the most personal details of their affair in the play. Erica coolly rebuffs his every insinuation that he cares about her and hints that his character will die in the play—for a laugh. He then has another panic attack and is again treated by Dr.&nbsp;Martinez, who warns him that he needs to learn to "decompress".  Six months pass. Erica's play is a huge success. Harry pays Marin a visit to apologize for anything he ever did to hurt her. She replies that he was nothing but nice to her and happily tells him that she is pregnant and has a new husband.

Remembering how they had once planned to spend their birthdays together there, he shows up at the Parisian restaurant where she is seated at a table. Harry explains that over the past six months he reached out to all of the women he ever had affairs with, and even though repeatedly rebuffed at first, finally broke through. They all had identical harsh stories that helped him learn how "I arrived at being me." He tells Erica that his trip to find her was the last and the farthest. Julian appears. All along, Erica has been waiting at the restaurant for Julian, whom she is now dating.  Harry and Erica get along well during the dinner, but they part outside the restaurant. While he is gazing in heartache over the river [[Seine]], Erica pulls up in a taxi. She explains that Julian figured out what was happening between them and decided to step aside to let her be with Harry. Harry explains that his search the last six months has made him realize he truly loves Erica. Harry and Erica kiss.  A year later, at a New York restaurant, Erica and Harry, now married, are out with Marin, her husband and her new baby daughter, as one big happy family.

Soori (2003 film)
  The story begins with Surya ([[Vignesh (actor)|Vignesh]]) walking lonely during [[Valentine's Day]]. He [[head shaving|shaves his hair]] and his mustache, and then takes a container lorry. He starts to remember his happy past during the travel.  Surya was a sales representative and worked with his friend Pichamuthu ([[Chinni Jayanth]]). His family, even knowing he played [[kabaddi]] and often got into fights, was very kind to him. One day he saw Rishaba ([[Uma (actress)|Uma]]), a college student, at the bus stop, who advised a smoker not to smoke because it disturbed non-smokers and would cause cancer. Surya was amazed by her words, so he dropped his cigarette and decided to stop smoking.  Surya wakes up screaming and a container passenger ([[Manobala]]) jumps with fright. The container passenger is afraid of Surya and offers him a little alcohol. Surya refuses and takes a cigarette. He goes back to his memories.  Another day, his friend and he bought black tickets from a boy at the cinema. Rishaba's friends also bought by this way, so Rishaba tore the tickets and said that the tickets would encourage the boy to have a bad future. Surya tore the tickets in turn. Then she accidentally dropped her book and Surya took it. The full night, Surya decrypted her personality by studying [[graphology]]. The next day, he brought the notebook to Rishaba with her personality description. She was surprised. Surya proposed his love and gave her a love letter. The following morning, he waited at the bus stop for her answer. She ignored him. He began to follow everywhere she went. Anxious, he called out to her when she took the bus. He requested Rishaba to come tomorrow with the same clothes which she wore now (a blue [[shalwar kameez]]) if she agreed to his love or in other clothes if she disagreed his proposal, at the same place. The next day, she came with a red shalwar kameez. Surya was vexed and he promised her that he never would cross his path again. Rishaba immediately showed him her blue shalwar kameez. She explained that her mother had put this dress on the washing machine, so she could not wear it wet. Finally, Rishaba said "I love you" to Surya. Rishaba and Surya became much closer. One day, at the river, Surya wrote on his hand Rishaba's name and his name, and showed it to her. Rishaba found that to write separately their first name took away them. She surrounded the letter of each of their names: ''Soori''. Surya jumped for joy and shouted: "It's not her name, it's not his name, it's their name".  Back in the present, Surya takes his cigarette and burns his tattoo on his arm (which reads ''Soori'') with it, his eyes full of rage.  Rishaba waited for Surya at the bus stop, but he didn't arrive. The next day, she got mad at him, and Surya apologized by saying that his bike was repaired. She scolded him and was upset by his carelessness after only 15 days of love. She said, "Boys are very punctual and rigorous to charm girls who they love but when girls accept their love, they become careless about them." She explains to him that lovers looked only for their plus points and after the marriage, they looked only for their minus points which engaged later divorce. She didn't want them to separate because of this matter. She wished he shared his negative habits and she shared with him her bad habits to improve them to positive things.   They were lovers for 25 days. Rishaba was afraid that time changes people affections. Surya tried to appease him but in vain. They decided to put their love to an endurance test to prove to themselves that the romance was much more than infatuation. The endurance test would last until the next Valentine's Day. Surya became less and less concentrated with what he did. Pichamuthu, after hearing a sad story of a man, phoned Rishaba to tell her that Surya had been admitted at the hospital in a serious condition. She went at the hospital upset and she didn't find him. She phoned Surya, he answered, and she hung up without talking. Surya knew the matter and slapped his friend. He said to not compare his love to others and Pichamuthu apologized. The lovers suffered the pain of separation.   One year later, at Surya’s home, his friends came to congratulate him. His family didn't understand why they came to congratulate him, and Surya narrated to them his love matter. They took it easy and they were proud of the way which Surya took. They prepared for the arrival of their future daughter-in-law. Surya waited a long time at the place she promised to come. Upset, his friends and him went to her home. A woman said that Rishaba had shifted to Trichy at her husband's city. His friends presented to his family about the issue and they were shocked.  Main Guard Gate Manikandan ([[R. Parthiban|Parthiban]]), a thug, makes his entry at this point. He fights against people who touched his wife. He goes home and calls a woman called Priya. Uma runs, and then smears him with coloured powder and hugs him with kisses. Surya comes at [[Trichi]] to find his old friend Devi, a former prostitute. Devi feels that Surya has changed a lot. She reveals that her boyfriend is Manikandan and she then asks him to find a house for Surya.  Surya moves on the odd jobs (milk deliverer, newspaper deliverer, etc.). One day, Surya thinks he sees Rishaba and runs behind an [[auto rickshaw]]. At the same moment, Manikandan is in a photoshop and punishes the seller to scratch Rishaba’s frame photo. By going out of the store, he grows by Surya and brings down the frame. The frame is broken, Manikandan beats Surya, Devi intervenes in their fight, and she makes clear that it’s Surya, her close friend. Surya doesn’t even see the photo. While selling [[Kumkum|Kungumam]] at the temple, Devi saw Surya. She asks why he does that, he replies that he searches his girlfriend everywhere where the women are presents. Surya gives to Devi Rishaba’s photo. Regrettably, Devi doesn’t see the photo and put it at Manikandan’s pocket. The housemaid gives the shirt to a [[Dhobi]]. The dhobi finds Priya's photo and gives it to Devi. She recognizes the cover given by Surya. Shocked, she goes to clear the matter. Surya agrees that the woman on the photo was his lover and he would like to kill her. The next morning, Surya reads the newspaper and Devi sees Rishaba’s photo on the paper. She managed to take it. Surya cries by seeing his family photo. Finally, the fate shows him the article with Rishaba. Surya reads the articles and goes at the mentioned address. Devi sees the burnt paper. The housemaid said to Surya that they went. Devi also goes there and the housemaid said that a bold man came here to ask this. Devi phoned to Manikandan to prevent him, that Surya will kill Priya.  Surya sees his lover and Manikandan,  takes his gun and shoots in Rishaba’s direction. Manikandan saves her and takes the bullet on his shoulder. Manikandan puts the gun on his breast and orders Surya to shoot. Surya refuses because his goal is killing his love’s traitor. He welds the gun towards Rishaba. Rishaba takes a man’s ice cream and eats it like a baby. Surya doesn’t understand what happened. Manikandan reveals that she has gone mad, she doesn't know herself and Manikandan but knows only the name: ''Soori''. Manikandan posted at the newspaper the news of her so Surya knows.  The pain of separation is the reason for her situation. She saw anywhere Surya, when she drove her scooter and she had an accident. Manikandan's sister was distributed after the accident, Rishaba hasn’t any relation. So Manikandan decided to marry her. Then, just after the marriage, he read her diary and understood their hearts.  Surya, troubled and culprit, cries and refuses to marry her after wishing her death. Manikandan manages to make him accept.  Manikandan takes off the [[Mangalsutra|Thaali]] and Surya knots a new Thaali on Rishaba's neck. Devi takes Manikandan’s hand and puts it on her belly, a synonym of her pregnancy.  Rishaba takes from Surya’s pocket a packet of cigarettes and throws it away.

Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over
 Juni Cortez, after [[Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams|stopping Donnagon from activating the EMP device]], has retired from the OSS, no longer wanting to work for them. He now lives a quiet life and works as a private detective, although his salary is very little. One day, he is contacted by President Devlin, former head of OSS, who informs him that his sister, Carmen Cortez, is missing after a mission gone wrong. Upset about this, Juni returns to the OSS to learn more about his sister.  Arriving at the technological and computer part of the OSS, he is reunited with a now reformed Donnagon Giggles and his wife Francesca, who explain that Carmen was captured by the Toymaker, a former OSS informant. The Toymaker was imprisoned in cyberspace by the OSS, but he has since created ''Game Over'', a virtual reality-based [[video game]] which he intends on using to escape cyberspace via players that reach Level 5, which is unwinnable. Juni agrees to venture into the game, save Carmen, and shut down the game, given only twelve hours to win. He is also informed that his sister was last seen on Level 4.  In the game, which takes place in a full 3D environment, Juni finds the challenges difficult, having only nine lives within the game and already losing one at the start. While roaming a cartoon-like medieval village, he finds three beta-testers, Francis, Arnold, and Rez, who provide him with a passage to the Moon and launch him into space, but mostly to get rid of the competition.  Juni lands on the Moon, losing another life at the process, and receives an opportunity to bring in a fellow ally to assist him, selecting his grandfather Valentin, who uses a wheelchair and has a personal history with the Toymaker. He receives a power-up which gives him a robotic bodysuit, allowing him to walk and possess superhuman strength and durability, and abandons Juni, telling him that they will regroup later. Searching for the entrance to Level 2, Juni ventures into a robot battle arena where he fights a girl named Demetra in order to return to Earth and Level 2. In the fight, he receives a robotic, more powerful suit, and he is placed on a huge mecha to combat Demetra. In the 3-round fight, in which he loses another life, he defeats Demetra and returns to Earth.  He meets the beta-testers again who believe he is a player named "The Guy", who can supposedly beat Level 5. Rez is unconvinced and challenges Juni to a "Mega-race" involving a multitude of different vehicles, which will allow them on Level 3. The only apparent rule of this game is "Win, at all costs". Juni wins the race with help from Valentin, and Demetra joins the group; she and Juni display romantic feelings for each other, with him giving her a med-pack with extra lives and she provides him with an illegal map of the game. Upon entering level 3, Arnold and Juni are forced to battle each other, the loser getting an immediate game over. During the fight, Juni loses almost all of his lives, but Demetra swaps places with Juni and is defeated, seemingly getting a game over, much to Juni's sadness.  The group arrives at Level 4 where Juni finds Carmen, released by the Toymaker, who leads the group on. Carmen notices their grandfather is with them and tells Juni that the Toymaker is the reason their grandfather uses a wheelchair. Juni follows a map to a lava-filled gorge. The group surfs their way through the lava. The OSS finds out about the history between the Toymaker and Valentin. Fearing that Valentin might seek revenge, Donnagon attempts to prevent them from reaching Level 5, but fails, as they fall into the lava and discover that lava does not mean the game over, but that it is actually possible to swim, and they reach a cavern where they find the door to Level 5. Outside the door to Level 5, Carmen informs them that they only have 5 minutes left. After the other gamers start to think that Carmen and Juni are deceivers and Rez threatens to give Juni a game over, the real "Guy" appears and opens the door. However, he is struck by lightning as part of a booby trap set by the Toymaker when the door to Level 5 is breached, which makes him lose all of his hundred lives and get a game over, forcing the group to move on without him.  In the Level 5 zone, which is a purple-ish cyberspace, Demetra then appears, claiming to have gotten back into the game via a glitch but Carmen identifies her as "The Deceiver", a program used to fool players. Demetra confirms this and apologizes to a stunned Juni before the Toymaker attacks the group with a giant robot. Valentin then appears, holding the entrance back to the real world open so the group can escape. However, he cannot come with them since someone needs to hold the door open. Demetra, shedding a tear, quickly holds the door open so he can go with them. After their return though, it is revealed that Valentin released the Toymaker, with the villain's army of robots now attacking a nearby city.  Juni and Carmen summon their family members: Parents Gregorio and Ingrid, Gregorio's brother Machete, their Grandma, and Uncle Felix. With too many robots to handle, Juni calls out to their "extended" family (or "everyone", as Juni puts it), summoning characters from the first two films (including Fegan Floop and Alexander Minion with the robot children, Dinky Winks and his son, scientist Romero (plus a Spork), and Gary and Gerti Giggles). All the robots are destroyed except for the Toymaker's. Valentin confronts The Toymaker, and forgives the Toymaker for what he did to him, which Valentin had been trying to find the Toymaker to do for 30 years. The Toymaker shuts down his robot and joins the rest of the Cortez family and their friends in celebrating their families.

Brossard kills "Manenbaum," hiding the dead body after finding the printed "Statement" and discovering that his pursuer was travelling on a Canadian passport. Brossard for years has taken refuge in sanctuaries in southern France within the Traditionalist Catholic community, appealing to long-time allies who have operated in great secrecy to shield him and provide him with funds. But now they bring increased scrutiny to themselves for continuing to do so.

He moves into the old building hoping for a life of solitude, but he quickly finds himself reluctantly becoming enmeshed in the lives of his neighbors.

Meanwhile, back at the safehouse McCall scrambles for an escape, but realising there is no way out he decides to grab two pistols and begin shooting at police. Stander and Heyl pull up just in time to see McCall gunned down by police.

Heyl and Stander part ways to go off and escape South Africa. Stander goes to the airport and is followed by numerous police where he is forced to show identification. Deventer frantically rushes to see if it is Stander, but stops when he finds out that it was a false alarm (due to Stander's use of a fake passport) and Stander is allowed to leave.  Finally arriving in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Stander is unable to remain inactive for long when he hotwires a [[Mercury Cougar]] and runs a red light in front of police. Leading them on a short chase, Stander exits his vehicle and begins to disobey the officer's orders, prompting the officer's partner to grab a shotgun and threaten Stander with it.

Rocky is the jokester of the group and likes to bunk classes. Suraj and Mahek head off to Mrs. Roy's psychology class and it's obvious Rocky is jealous and in love with Mahek.   While preparing for gym class, Ghena encourages the relationship between Suraj and Mahek. Mahek expresses her concern of the incident of the phone call, and Gehna brushes it off. As Mahek is left alone in the locker room, the killer's voice comes over the loudspeaker calling her name. The principal announces not to worry, as someone played a cheap joke while out of his office. Mahek starts picks up her makeup she dropped when the person screamed over the loudspeaker, and the clown-masked killer comes up behind her with a knife. Mrs. Roy enters the room and the killer is gone. Mahek leaves and Mrs. Roy continues to rant about the prankster from earlier. She hears a man's cough from one of the stalls. Thinking it's a girl and boy together, she starts to open each stall. As she gets to the third stall, it won't open. She peers into a slight opening and the killer stabs her in the eye.   Students crowd around as the investigation of Mrs. Roy's death presses on. There is a bloody shoe print at the scene of the crime, but no other evidence. Kamat Uncle is there and advises the principal that his students are not safe as this is the second incident in 6 months. The inspectors believe it is the work of a serial killer. Mahek approaches Kamat Uncle and tells him about the phone call she received. Rocky is chatting with Nikhil and Suraj, making jokes about how he's escaped having to take the psychology exam tomorrow, obviously not taking the situation seriously. Kamat Uncle overhears and becomes suspicious and starts questioning where Rocky was, and what his shoe size is. Rocky claims to have been at home an hour earlier and just got to campus. He jokingly asked the inspector if he's planning on giving him a gift, and threatens that the inspector doesn't know who he is, and the inspector replies that is exactly what he wants to find out. However, Rocky's feet are bigger than the prints at the scene. Rocky tells the inspector to question newer students, pointing to Suraj. Suraj is very nervous, and even more so when his size 8 matches the footprint. Kamat Uncle dismisses it, saying that more than half the students probably wear that size and suggest they wait for the post-mortem report.  Mahek starts to avoid Rocky and apologizes to Suraj for his behavior. She reveals that she and Rocky have been friends for 15 years, but nothing more. Suraj shares about his close relationship with his father, and Mahek has flashbacks to when her dad left her family. Upset, she runs away without explanation. At home she is comforted by her mom, who explains she is going away for an art convention in [[Delhi]]. She is worried about leaving Mahek, even though it is just for 3 hours.  Later that night, she hears a noise thinking her mom is back from Delhi. She finds a window unlocked and realizes she's in her house with the killer. During the pursuit she notices an orange watch on the killer's wrist. She manages to alert Kamat Uncle of her attack and is able to fight the killer, who escapes through a window before the police arrive. She runs outside and Suraj is out there. Initially she rushes into his arms, but she notices the same orange watch on his wrist. Kamat Uncle arrives and she points at Suraj with disbelief. Inspector Rathod finds the clown mask and robe in the bushes nearby. Her mom arrives as Suraj is being arrested.   Rocky is throwing a party and is desperate for Mahek to attend. She is convinced by Gehna and her mom to get out of the house and go have fun to get her mind off of the attack. Mahek goes to the party but is less than enthusiastic. Eventually she leaves, and on the foggy drive home. Ghena is venting and blaming Rocky for being insensitive, but Mahek defends him saying it's not the party but her mood after all of the events. She receives a call on her mobile from the killer. She is terrified, because Suraj is currently in jail. Suddenly, the killer appears in the middle of the road, causing Gehna to lose control of the car and crash into a shallow river. Ghena is unconscious and Mahek climbs her way out and begins to scream for help. The killer comes out from the water and grabs her trying to drown her. As he pulls out his knife, Suraj is at the scene and begins to fight the killer. It turns out he had an alibi and was working with Principal Aneja that evening. Kamat Uncle is also there. He has his gun out but doesn't have a good shot. The killer escapes into the fog and is shot by Kamat Uncle, and jumps into the river. The police are unsuccessful in recovering the killer's body and Mahek is back at home.  She makes amends with Suraj, but continues to have visions of the killer, despite her assuming he is dead. She has a breakdown in front of Gehna, and her friends decide that they need to go on holiday. They decide on going to Thailand. There is no escaping death now as they realize they are trapped on an island with the killer. Tensions mount between the friends as they try to find out who amongst them can't be trusted. Mahek is turned against Rocky as suspicious circumstances continue to surround him. Rajat, Rhea, and Nikhil are all murdered. Kamat Uncle and Rathod arrive on the island and bring news of Mahek's mother's murder. Kamat Uncle is killed, and the killer is shot by Suraj. When they remove the mask, it is Inspector Rathod. Rocky tries to implore Mahek to accept his love, and Suraj shoots him.   It is at this point Suraj reveals his identity as the killer. It is also revealed that Rajat was not killed, but is very much alive. The killer is a duo. Suraj and Rajat are brothers. Their mother was raped by Mahek and Malini's estranged father, destroying their family after she committed suicide from the shame. Following their mother's suicide, their dad shot himself. For revenge, Suraj and Rajat killed Mr. Gujral first, followed by Malini, Mrs. Gujral, and need to claim Mahek's life to repay the debt owed for her father ruining their lives.   Rocky is able to regain enough strength to shoot Suraj and Rajat and save Mahek from the same fate as her family. Ultimately Suraj dies at the hands of Mahek, who stabs him after his gunshot wound proves to be nonfatal. Rocky and Mahek ride back to the mainland on a boat in each other's arms.  
Standing Room Only (2003 film)
 The film begins with Larry, [[Michael Gambon]]'s character, walking up to a theatre door on an empty wet side street in what appears to be the [[West End of London]].

The Story of the Weeping Camel
 During Spring, a family of nomadic shepherds assists the births of their camel herd. The last camel to calve this season has a protracted labor that persists for two days. With the assistance and intervention of the family, a rare white calf is born. This is the mother camel's first calving. Despite the efforts of the shepherds, the mother rejects the newborn, refusing it her milk and failing to establish a care-bond with it.  To restore harmony between the mother and calf, the nomadic family call upon the services of a group of [[lama]]s who perform a ritual with bread or dough 'effigies' () of the mother, the calf and the individual members of the family. The rite opens with the sound of a [[conch#As musical instruments|sacred conchshell horn]] followed by bells in the hands of lamas, some of whom wield ''[[vajra]]''. The rite takes place with members of the extended nomadic community and a number of lama at a [[shrine|sacred place]] that consists of one end of a log, or wooden pole, set in the earth, with the other end raised to the sky: a stylized 'victory banner' () with a piece of blue fabric entwined around it, functioning as a [[prayer flag]] (darchor-style). The log is supported by a [[cairn]] of rocks at its base as foundation. The ritual, however, does not re-establish harmony between the mother and calf.  The family then resolve to secure the services of an indigenous 'violinist' to play the music for a Mongolian 'Hoos' ritual. They send their two young boys on a journey through the desert to the community [[marketplace]] to locate a musician. The 'violinist' —who plays more precisely a [[morin khuur]] — is summoned to the camp and a [[ritual]] of [[folk music]] and chanting is enacted.  The musician first drapes the morin khuur on the first hump of the camel to establish a [[sympathetic magic]]al linkage between the mother and the state of harmony represented by the instrument. Once this is done he removes the instrument and commences playing. As the musician sounds the Mongolian 'violin', the female family member who lulled her child to sleep with a [[lullaby]] earlier in the documentary, repeatedly intones the calming sounds and beautiful melody of the 'hoos'. At this point, the mother camel starts to weep, tears visibly streaming from her eyes. Immediately after the rite the mother and calf are reconciled and the calf draws milk from her teat.  
Stitch! The Movie
 The film starts out with ex-Captain [[Gantu]] on his new spaceship (his original got destroyed in the first film), being hired by a hamster-like alien named [[Dr. Jacques von Hämsterviel]] to retrieve the other 625 experiments.  Meanwhile, on Earth, [[Stitch (Lilo & Stitch)|Stitch]] is still not fitting in and causes another disaster. [[Lilo Pelekai]] tries to encourage him by saying he's one-of-a-kind, comparing him to [[Frankenstein's monster]]. Naturally, that just makes him feel worse. Suddenly, a crash is heard from below. Running downstairs, the pair encounters Gantu, breaking into their home. In the ensuing chaos, Stitch thrusts his belly out at Gantu, only to be blasted into a net. Gantu finds and takes a blue pod with the number 625 on it before abducting [[Jumba Jookiba|Jumba]] for interrogation. Lilo and Stitch manage to take Jumba's ship to chase Gantu into space and engage him in battle, before being defeated and falling back towards Earth.  Back at the house, Lilo, Stitch and [[Pleakley]] find the container Jumba was hiding. Pleakley realizes that these are the other 625 experiments, in [[dehydration|dehydrated]] form. He warns them not to tell anyone or put the experiments in water. Deliberately disobeying Pleakley, Stitch and Lilo retrieve the container and hydrate [[Sparky (Lilo & Stitch)|Experiment 221]], who promptly escapes.  Meanwhile, Jumba is being held captive on the ship of Dr. Hämsterviel, who is surprisingly a small [[hamster]]/[[poodle]]/[[rabbit]]-like [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]]. Unable to intimidate Jumba, Hämsterviel activates [[Reuben (Lilo & Stitch)|Experiment 625]], who has all of Stitch's powers, to attack him. Fortunately for Jumba, while 625 has all of Stitch's powers, he is incredibly lazy, a terrible coward, and prioritizes in making sandwiches above all else.  Meanwhile, Pleakley is able to come into contact with Hämsterviel's ship via telephone. Hämsterviel tells Pleakley that he wants a ransom of the other 624 experiments in return for Jumba. When Pleakley informs the other family members what the ransom is, Nani proceeds to call [[Cobra Bubbles]] while Lilo and Stitch go out to find 221. When Cobra arrives the next morning, he seems to already know about what happened. Meanwhile, Lilo and Stitch finally catch a troublesome Experiment 221 at a hotel.  The rendezvous time arrives and Pleakley and Cobra show up with the container, not knowing that it contains only 623 experiments. Pleakley hands the container over to Hämsterviel, who is shocked to find that one is missing. Lilo then shows up with Experiment 221 trapped in a glass vase. Announcing that she has named it "Sparky", she says that Sparky is part of Stitch's, and thus her, ohana. Hämsterviel tells her to give him the experiment or Jumba will be shot dead.  After several moments of thinking and hearing Cobra, Pleakley, Jumba and Hämsterviel persuading them, Lilo and Stitch set Sparky free and break Jumba from his bonds. On Cobra's signal, the Grand Councilwoman's ship rises out of the nearby ocean and aims several guns at Hämsterviel. Lilo protests, saying that Hämsterviel has the other experiments and Sparky overhears.  Sparky proceeds to use his electrical abilities to blow the power on the Councilwoman's ship, while Hämsterviel and Gantu climb back aboard their own ship with the experiments. In a last attempt to stop Hämsterviel, Lilo and Stitch stow away on it as it leaves, with Sparky following.  Lilo and Stitch manage to swipe the container with the other experiments in it. The struggle for the container between Lilo, Stitch and Gantu results in releasing the dehydrated pods to rain down and scatter throughout Hawaii. Having captured the heroes, Hämsterviel tells his plans to clone Stitch a thousand times over and orders Gantu to do what he wants with Lilo. While Gantu puts Lilo in a teleportation pod to send her to an intergalactic zoo, Stitch is strapped to a weight just heavier than he can lift.  Watching as Stitch tries to avoid being vivisected by a laser for the cloning process, Sparky shows that he has reformed by causing the cloning machine to short-circuit. He then breaks Stitch free and the two strap Hämsterviel to the device before rescuing Lilo.  Having locked Hämsterviel in handcuffs, Lilo, Stitch, and Sparky short-circuit Gantu's ship, causing it to crash near a waterfall on [[Kauai]]. Landing Hämsterviel's ship back at the rendezvous point, they give Sparky a new home powering the [[Kilauea Lighthouse]], which hasn't been running in years because powering it was very expensive. They then persuade the Grand Councilwoman to let them rehabilitate the other 623 experiments. The Councilwoman places Hämsterviel under arrest, and Jumba whispers to Pleakley that he has plans for making 627. At the end of the movie, Experiments 202, 529, 455, 489, and 390 are activated, [[Lilo & Stitch: The Series|thus leading to the series]].  In a post-credits scene, Jumba and Pleakley hope to go home with the Grand Councilwoman this time, but they are left stranded once again.

Stuck on You (film)
 [[Conjoined twins]] Bob and Walt Tenor try to live as normally as possible. Outgoing and sociable Walt aspires to be a [[Hollywood]] actor, however, whereas shy, introverted Bob prefers the quiet life. They run Quikee Burger, a diner in [[Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts|Oak Bluffs]] on [[Martha's Vineyard]], that guarantees free meals to customers whose orders are not completed in three minutes, a testament to how skilled and in sync Bob and Walt are with each other. Though Walt is comfortable socializing with women, Bob is the shyer of the two, and carries on a long-distance relationship with a pen pal named May Fong whom he has never met in person, and who is unaware that they are conjoined twins.  Walt gets a role in a local play. Bob stays as much as possible in the background, as he has a tendency to get [[stage fright]]. Following the play's success, Walt decides to follow his dream to Hollywood and persuades his hesitant brother to go along for the ride. They rent an apartment in California and become friends with fellow aspiring actress April Mercedes. When she expresses curiosity about their conjoinment, Walt explains that they share a [[liver]] that is mostly Bob's, and that because surgical separation entails risk to Walt, Bob would not consent to the surgery, even though Walt favored it. It is also the reason why Walt appears somewhat older than Bob. (Greg Kinnear is seven years older than Matt Damon in real life.)  Walt's efforts to find acting work in Hollywood are fraught with difficulty, and his agent, Morty O'Reilly, is little help, offering at one point to get him a job in a pornographic film. [[Cher]] is upset that she has ended up starring in a prime-time TV show called ''Honey and the Beaze''. She wants out of the deal, so she decides to hire Walt as her co-star (since her contract states she can choose anyone she wants), certain the show will get cancelled. The producers, realizing Cher's scheme, foil it by going forward with the production, compensating for Bob's presence by keeping him out of the camera frame and employing [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] effects. The show is a surprise hit and Walt becomes famous.  Walt arranges for May Fong to come to California. Although he did this without Bob's consent, Bob and May Fong develop a romantic relationship, though the twins' attempt to keep their conjoined nature a secret proves challenging, especially since Walt must accompany the new couple everywhere, sometimes using creative solutions like disguising himself as a giant teddy bear. Eventually however, when May discovers the twins in bed, she concludes that they are a homosexual couple rather than brothers. Although Bob shows May that they are indeed conjoined twins, May is nonetheless in even greater shock at the deception, and flees.  Morty informs the twins that word has leaked about Walt and Bob being conjoined. Rather than hide this, the twins decide to embrace it, and they both become huge celebrities, making commercials and appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. While Walt enjoys this success, he knows that Bob is unhappy because he misses May. Resolving that Bob needs to be independent from him in order to be happy, Walt demands they be surgically separated.  When Bob refuses, Walt, determined to convince him, begins acting wild and crazy until Bob can no longer take it. Walt starts to make a fool of himself by getting drunk and accidentally snatching a woman's purse. They eventually end up spending the night in jail for drunk driving; even though Walt was drinking, Bob is the one who suffers the hangover since their shared liver is mostly his. When they are released the following morning, they get into a fight and Bob decides to go with the operation.  On the night before the surgery, May shows up and apologizes to Bob for running out the way she did. Bob informs her that they're getting separated; although she does not want them to, he knows that it's best for them. At the hospital, May and April keep a vigil until learning from [[Ben Carson]], a real-life neurosurgeon playing a cameo role, that the surgery was successful.<ref name=Griswold13Aug></ref> Bob and May, both being small-town people, decide to move back to Oak Bluffs, but Bob finds the separation from Walt difficult, both practically and emotionally, and is unable to do the things by himself that the twins used to do together, such as maintain Quikee Burger's three-minute challenge or play hockey. Walt, for his part, loses his job when ''Honey and the Beaze'' is canceled due to low ratings, and finds it difficult to find subsequent work. He is also emotionally devastated by Bob's absence. After having a brief talk with Cher about what's best for him, he decides to move back to Oak Bluffs.  One year later, Walt and Bob are back in Oak Bluffs running the restaurant together, Bob and May have married and May is pregnant. The twins simulate their former conjoinment with [[Velcro]] clothing that attaches them to one another. Walt finds creative fulfillment continuing in local plays, including a musical in which he and [[Meryl Streep]] play [[Bonnie and Clyde]].  
Strayed (2003 film)
 In June 1940, as German troops are advancing on Paris, Odile, an attractive widow in her late thirties, joins the exodus from the city with her two children: 13-year-old Philippe and 7-year-old Cathy. Like many others, they are heading south in a long line of refugees escaping Paris by whatever means of transport possible. After fifty kilometers, a German planes bomb the choked road filled with civilians. Odile's car is destroyed and in the chaos, she runs from the roadside fields into the nearby woods, looking for shelter. They are helped by a shaven-headed wiry teenager, Yvan, who recommends that they continue off-road.   Resourceful and fiercely independent, Yvan, who is seventeen, can hunt and knows his way around the forest, so he can be of big help to Odile and her children. Odile regards this enigmatic scamp with overt suspicion, but Yvan charms Cathy and especially Philippe, who admires his rogue self-sufficiency and take-charge attitude.  Afraid that Yvan will leave them, Philippe bribes him to stay, using his late father's watch as an inducement. After a night in the open, the four fugitives stumble upon a large house. Yvan unhesitatingly breaks in. Odile just would like to make a phone call, but Yvan convinces them all that the abandoned house is a safe and comfortable refuge from the war, at least temporarily. As he goes inside, Yvan cuts the phone lines and hides an existing radio, before opening the door  to the others, ensuring their isolation from what is happening in the outside world..  An almost idyllic peaceful life follows for the four refugees, away from the war around them. The house is large and comfortable and as Odile soon discovers it was a country retreat owned by a Jewish married couple of musicians who left for abroad. Odile takes on house chores providing a sense of normalcy for her children. Her husband was killed recently fighting the Germans and she, a former school teacher, was ill prepared by the subsequent upheavals created by the war.   With time, Odile's suspicions about the young stranger begin to fade away, as Yvan makes himself indispensable providing food. Knowing the countryside and its dangers well, he hunts rabbits and catches fish from a nearby river during the day; at night he makes excursions to retrieve objects from dead soldiers and provisions from abandoned homes. Cathy enjoys his company and Philippe admires him as an ideal older brother, but when Yvan finds a gun and grenade, Odile hides it from him. Philippe refuses to tell Yvan where it is and they quarrel. Realizing that Yvan is illiterate, Odile begins to teach him how to read and write. She begins to open up to him, but Yvan does not give much information about his past only that he was orphaned and it is evident that he was in a reformatory. As he lays aside his brash attitude, he confesses to her that he loves her and wishes to become her husband. She is surprised and bemused, but flattered.  Days later, two French soldiers named Georges and Robert arrive leaving the war. There has been an armistice. Odile provides the soldiers with food and shelter but Yvan, who hides from them, does not trust them. Certain that they want to rape Odile, he intends to kill them, but ends up hitting Philippe when he tries to stop him. Yvan decides to stay away. At night Odile walks out of the house where the soldiers sleep to find Yvan. They make love passionately, since he does not know any other way, they have anal sex. As he is hungry, Yvan leaves to find something to eat. He promises to come back the next day and celebrate the soldier’s departure.  The next morning policemen arrive at the house, having caught Yvan stealing. The clothing Yvan was wearing led the police to the abandoned house. Yvan and Odile remain silent, but Philippe confesses that they know him, he is their friend. Odile then tells the police how the young man helped them.   Sometime later Odile and her children are seen with many others in a camp for refugees. The policeman approaches Odile in private. He wants to see if she has more information about Yvan, but she lies and tells him that he never even mentioned his name. The policeman bluntly informs her that her friend committed suicide by hanging the night before. Yvan's real name was Jean Delmas, a fugitive from a reformatory in [[Mettray]]. When Philippe asks his mother about Yvan, Odile lies and says that he escaped.

In all killing contracts they are provided with a photograph, the location, and are instructed to look at the photo just 15 minutes before killing the person. In this manner the friends enjoy their new-found wealth. When Aryan's [[Parsi]] [[girlfriend]], Dilnawaaz finds out, she wants him to quit. He does, but his friends refuse to let go of this easy money and luxurious life. Shortly thereafter, the trio are given a contract; before the killing they look at the photograph ... of Aryan. The trio knows that it is too late to back out of this 'supari' ([[contract killing]]). Soon events takes a worst turn as one by one gets killed. Chicken commits suicide and a gun battle ensues where Papad and Mushy are killed with Sekhari's men. Aryan puts everything to an end by killing Mamta Sekhari and Baba once and for all.

S.W.A.T. (film)
 Jim Street ([[Colin Farrell]]), a former [[U.S. Navy SEAL]] and hot-shot cop from the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] and his [[SWAT]] team are sent to stop a gang of robbers who have taken over a bank. His high-tempered partner and close friend Brian Gamble ([[Jeremy Renner]]) disobeys an order to hold their position and engages the bank robbers, accidentally wounding a hostage in the process. Gamble and Street are demoted by Captain Fuller ([[Larry Poindexter]]), the commander of the [[LAPD Metropolitan Division]]. Gamble quits the force following an intense argument with Fuller, and Street is taken off the team and sent to work in the "gun cage", where he looks after the gear and weaponry. Fuller offers Street the chance to return to SWAT by selling Gamble out, but he refuses, though people refuse to trust him as his decision was never made public.   Six months after the incident, the chief of police calls on Sergeant Daniel "Hondo" Harrelson ([[Samuel L. Jackson]]) to help re-organize the SWAT platoon. Hondo puts together a diverse team, including himself, Street, Christina Sánchez ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), Deacon Kaye ([[LL Cool J]]), TJ McCabe ([[Josh Charles]]), and Michael Boxer ([[Brian Van Holt]]). The team members train together, eventually forging bonds of friendship. As a result, their first mission to subdue an unstable gunman is a success.  Meanwhile, French [[drug lord]] Alexander "Alex" Montel ([[Olivier Martinez]]) arrives in Los Angeles and goes to a local restaurant to kill his uncle for holding back the family money from him. While driving to the airport, uniformed LAPD officers stop Montel for a broken tail light and later detain him to get a full positive I.D. on him; they learn through [[Interpol]] that he is an international fugitive wanted in over a dozen countries. But as Montel is being transferred to prison, his associates, dressed as LAPD officers, attempt to rescue him as he rides the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] bus. Hondo's team arrives in time to kill the two gunmen and recapture Montel. As Montel, under SWAT escort, approaches the police station, reporters crowd around them, prompting Montel to yell to the cameras that he would "give 100 million dollars to whoever gets [him] out of here". The LAPD makes plans to transfer Montel into federal custody. They initially plan for travel by air, but Gamble shoots down the helicopter with a high-powered rifle. The police next send out a large convoy, which gang members attack and discover to be a decoy, at the same time as Hondo's team is spiriting Montel away in two SUVs. However, while driving Montel into federal custody, TJ had been plotting with Gamble, and the two succeed in taking Montel from the other officers, critically wounding Boxer in the process.  Hondo and the rest of his team give chase for a final battle against Gamble's group. Fuller later informs them that Gamble intends to fly Montel out of the United States. Fuller dispatches every officer to Hawthorne airport to prevent the escape. As Hondo and his SWAT team race across town, they observe a plane flying at lower than normal altitudes and deduce correctly that the plane is going to land on the [[Sixth Street Viaduct|Sixth Street Bridge]] and is expected by Gamble. They decide to go after the plane, as available units are at the airport and won't make it in time. Before Gamble's group can take off, the team intercepts it, and a gun battle ensues, killing Gamble's remaining thugs, although wounding Sánchez. TJ commits suicide out of remorse for his betrayal of the team and to avoid being disgraced. Street pursues Gamble under the bridge and following a hand-to-hand fight, inadvertently kills him by knocking him under the wheels of a passing train. Fuller and the rest of the LAPD arrive to take care of everything else. Fuller thanks Hondo and his team for their success but tells them the job wasn't finished as Montel was not yet in federal custody. Hondo and his team deliver Montel to a federal prison to await trial. On the way home to Los Angeles, a report of a holdup in progress comes over the police radio and despite the team being two officers down and off shift for the past twelve hours, Hondo, Street, Kaye, and Sanchez decide to help anyway.

Sylvia (2003 film)
 (Born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] in 1932, Plath developed a precocious talent as a writer, publishing her first poem when she was only eight years old. That same year, tragedy introduced itself into her life as Plath was forced to confront the unexpected death of her father. In 1950, she began studying at [[Smith College]] on a literary scholarship, and while she was an outstanding student, she also began suffering from bouts of extreme depression. Following her junior year, she attempted suicide for the first time. Plath survived, and, in 1955, she was granted a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] to study in [[England]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].)  The film begins with a shot of Plath sleeping, then opening her eyes. As a student at Cambridge she rides along on her red bicycle and wearing an academic gown. She hears of a party to celebrate the publishing of a magazine called St. Botolph's, where she meets the young poet [[Ted Hughes]]. The two fall in love and marry in 1956, then go off to Massachusetts where her mother lives (Aurelia Plath, played by Paltrow's mother Blythe Danner). While they both are teaching at Smith College. Sylvia quickly learns that others are also enthralled with her husband, for a combination of his good looks, charisma, fame and success. They return to England, first to London and then to Devon, where Sylvia raises their two children and lives in her husband's professional shadow as she tries to eke out her own writing career, which doesn't come as naturally to her as it does to Ted. After a visit by David and Assia Wevill, who had rented their London flat, Sylvia rightly accuses Ted of infidelity. She kicks him out and then begins to write the poems that would be published posthumously in her collection titled Ariel. Sylvia then moves back to London with her children. Ted visits at Christmas and they make love again but he says he cannot leave Assia, who is pregnant. Shortly thereafter she prepares for her suicide, sealing off the children's room from the gas from her gas oven. A nurse comes to take out the children and Ted sees Plath's manuscript on her desk. A closing title informs us that her book made her much beloved and that Ted wrote his response in 1998 (just before his death), in a collection titled Birthday Letters.  
Swimming Pool (film)
 Sarah Morton, a middle-aged English [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] author, who has written a successful series of detective novels, is having [[writer's block]] that is impeding her next book. Sarah's publisher, John Bosload, offers her his country house near [[Lacoste, Vaucluse|Lacoste]], [[France]] for some rest and relaxation. Sarah takes him up on the offer, hinting that she hopes John may come and visit as well. After becoming comfortable with the run of the spacious, sun-filled house, and meeting the groundskeeper Marcel, Sarah's quietude is disrupted by a young woman claiming to be the publisher's daughter, Julie. She shows up late one night explaining that she's taking time off from work herself. She eventually tells Sarah that her mother used to be Bosload's mistress, but that he would not leave his family.  Julie's sex life consists of [[one-night stand]]s with various oafish men, and a competition of personalities develops between the two women. At first, Sarah regards Julie as a distraction from her writing. She uses earplugs to allow her to sleep during Julie's noisy nighttime adventures, although she nonetheless has a [[voyeur]]istic fascination with them. Later, she abandons the earplugs during one of Julie's trysts, beginning to envy Julie's lifestyle. Sarah sneaks into Julie's room and steals her diary, using it in the new novel she's working on. The competition comes to the fore when a local waiter, Franck, is involved. Julie wants him but he appears to prefer the more mature Sarah, having struck up a relationship with her during her frequent lunches at the bistro.  An unexpected [[tragedy]] occurs after a night of flirting among the three. After swimming together in the pool, Franck refuses to allow Julie to continue performing [[oral sex]] on him, once Sarah, who watches them from the balcony, throws a rock into the water. Franck feels frightened and tells Julie he is leaving. The next day, Franck is missing. While investigating Franck's disappearance, Sarah learns that Julie's mother died years earlier, though Julie had spoken of her mother as if she were alive. She returns to the villa, where a confused Julie thinks that Sarah is her mother and has a breakdown. Julie eventually recovers and confesses that Franck is dead because she repeatedly hit him over the head with a rock as he tried to leave her at the pool. His body is in one of the sheds.  When Marcel becomes suspicious of the mound of fresh soil where Sarah and Julie have buried Franck's body, Sarah seduces the elderly gardener to distract him. Julie leaves, thanking Sarah for her help and leaving her the manuscript of an unpublished novel written by her late mother, which she had previously claimed that John made her mother burn. Sarah uses the mother's manuscript in her novel-in-progress.  Sarah returns to England and visits John at his publishing office with her new novel. His daughter, Julia, also shows up just as Sarah is leaving, but is revealed to be a completely different person than the girl Julie that the viewer was introduced to as John's daughter. The viewer now must question whether the story that took place at the country house was a fictional plot dreamed up by Sarah.  
Sword in the Moon
 The film opens up with an assassination attempt on the king of [[Joseon|Joseon Dynasty]] at some sort of reception. The attempt is foiled by a special security squad, and specifically by its leader, Gyu-yup. A series of deaths of prominent politicians leads to a nighttime battle in which one member, a female, of what is apparently an assassin duo, is captured. Gyu-yup recognizes this female, and after her torture in prison (of which Gyu-yup is left in charge when she refuses to divulge any information), the film flashes back to Gyu-yup's past.  Shortly after the [[Japanese invasions of Korea]] in the middle of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], a military unit of elite soldiers (made up of students of the Clear Wind Shining Moon sword school) is created to ensure the peace and the security/safety of the country. In its center, the two best swordsmen, Ji-hwan and Gyu-yup, are also two inseparable friends. But a political ''coup d'etat'' plot (it is referred to as a "rebellion" in the film) forces Gyu-yup, threatened with the death of his entire unit of elite soldiers, to not only kill his fencing master, but also Ji-hwan, who is seeing the female assassin from the night battle, Shi-young (who was also a warrior at the time, and the daughter of the school's fencing master). Having had to behead his master, kill his best friend and his best friend's lover, and lead his troops against members of their own training school (as one character protests, "we have killed the brothers with whom we shed blood"), we are led to understand that Gyu-yup loses some part of himself.  The film returns to the present, five years after the events in the flashback. Gyu-yup is known as a cold and cruel commander, nicknamed "the human butcher." The discovery of a sword during the night battle that carries the seal of Gyu-yup's old unit (such swords, with the exception of Gyu-yup's, were apparently destroyed and at least not in use by this time, so the only other person who could be wielding one is Ji-hwan) confirms the fact that Ji-hwan is back as well (and not dead as Gyu-yup had thought). The current king (the usurper general who, in Gyu-yup's flashback, is the commander who forces him to choose between the deaths of his men and leading his men against Ji-hwan, Shi-young, and the training master) himself becomes embroiled in what amount to attempts to cover up his tracks and betrays at least one of his foremost commanders by ordering his assassination. The king then plans an excursion aimed at drawing out Ji-hwan and Shi-young (who we are made to understand was allowed to be freed by Ji-hwan in disguise under Gyu-yup's watch) into the open where they are meant to be killed.  The excursion (of which Ji-hwan and Shi-young become aware) takes place, and the king is almost killed by Ji-hwan, but he is momentarily distracted by the death of Shi-young at the hands of the king's elite bodyguard and troops. The king, stabbing Ji-hwan with a heretofore hidden dagger, pushes Ji-hwan away; and the king continues to look on as Ji-hwan battles more troops. Almost defeated, Gyu-yup, finally moved by compassion and his past relationship with Shi-young and Ji-hwan, comes to Ji-hwan's rescue. He pleads for his and Ji-hwan's freedom (Gyu-yup had promised his neck to the current king during the rebellion in order to save his own troops from execution, and the now-king took this to mean this promise was binding in perpetuity), and when that is met with silence, he and Ji-hwan engage the troops that have surrounded them. The movie ends by freezing the old friends, united in battle again, in action against the usurper king's troops.  
Swimming Upstream
 The film shows ten years in the life of [[Tony Fingleton | Anthony Fingleton]], from when he was a young boy in the mid-1950s, to the day of the men's 100m backstroke final at the 1964 Summer Olympics. Growing up in Brisbane, Australia, Tony was the second of five children of working class parents Harold and Dora Fingleton. It was a dysfunctional family, since Harold, the child of an alcoholic mother who had witnessed his mother's degradation as a prostitute when a child, was violent and unable to show equal love to all his children, and favored those showing sporting prowess. He was physically and emotionally abusive, especially toward Tony and Dora. She tried to protect Tony from that abuse which only angered Harold more. The abuse was exacerbated by Harold's alcoholism, which in turn led to frequent difficulties with money as Harold, who worked at the docks only when ships were in port, was often off work, sometimes due to divisive labour unrest on the wharf, and strikes.   Tony was on good terms with most of his siblings, especially "number 3", John. But each of the five children did whatever they needed to do as self-preservation measures against Harold's abuse, sometimes at the expense of harmony with the others. As a refuge, the four youngest felt comfortable in the local pool. It was only when he found out that both Tony and John were good swimmers that Harold began to pay Tony any attention, and became their trainer. But nothing Tony did was ever good enough, Harold spurring on anyone else but Tony, and especially John. Initially the two swam different strokes, freestyle and backstroke, but Harold secretly shifted John to compete directly against his brother in state finals. After losing, Tony responded by training on his own, eventually placing second at the 1962 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, without his father's support - who had by this time become withdrawn and continued to drink. John, meanwhile, abandoned competitive swimming after failing to qualify, and his relationship with Tony remained strained.   Tony wanted to make his father proud, but also revealed to his mother that he saw swimming as a means to an end, a way to escape their life of poverty in Brisbane. This he did after his Commonwealth medal, when his application to  [[Harvard University]] to enter with a sports scholarship was successful. He was offered a spot on the Australian Olympic team, but chose instead to attend Harvard.  The film ends in the pool at Harvard, where he obtains an excellent backstroke time, as his life and family flash before him as he swims. The 1964 Olympics are being aired, with [[Dawn Fraser]] competing, and his coach asks him if he would rather have swum there. He replies no, he is "exactly where he wants to be". He has achieved his goal of escape from a dysfunctional childhood and is on track to a successful career, which is hinted in the closing credits.

The police go in search, but Emilien is captured after another botched attempt to arrest them. The journalist sets a trap; she leaves Emilien tied to a chair in an old warehouse, directly in the path of a giant ball which will crush him five minutes later.

Tears of the Sun
 Turmoil erupts in [[Nigeria]] following a military ''[[coup d'etat]]'', which involves the brutal murders of the [[President of Nigeria|president]] and his family. As foreign nationals are evacuated from the country, [[Lieutenant]] A.K. Waters ([[Bruce Willis]]) and his [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEAL]] detachment comprising Zee ([[Eamonn Walker]]), Slo ([[Nick Chinlund]]), Red ([[Cole Hauser]]), Lake ([[Johnny Messner (actor)|Johnny Messner]]), Silk (Charles Ingram), Doc (Paul Francis), and Flea (Chad Smith), aboard the [[aircraft carrier]] , are dispatched by [[Captain (United States O-6)#U.S. Navy|Captain]] Bill Rhodes ([[Tom Skerritt]]) to extract a "critical persona," one Dr. Lena Fiore Kendricks ([[Monica Bellucci]]), a U.S. citizen by marriage and daughter-in-law of a U.S. Senator. Their secondary mission is to extract the mission priest ([[Pierrino Mascarino]]) and two nuns ([[Fionnula Flanagan]] and Cornelia Hayes O'Herlihy), should they choose to come.  The mission begins as planned. Waters tells Dr. Kendricks of the company of rebel soldiers closing in on her hospital and the mission, and that the team's orders are to extract U.S. personnel; however, Kendricks refuses to leave without the patients. Waters calls Captain Rhodes for options; after their short and ambiguous conversation, he concedes to Dr. Kendricks that they will take those refugees able to walk. She begins assembling the able-bodied for the  hike; the priest and the nuns stay behind to take care of the injured. Irritated and behind the schedule, the team and the refugees leave their hospital mission after daybreak.  At nightfall they take a short break. Guerrilla rebels rapidly approach their position, and Waters stealthily kills a straggling rebel. Dr. Kendricks warns Waters that the rebels are going to the mission, but he is determined to carry out his orders, and they continue to the extraction point. Back at the mission, the staff and refugees are confronted by rebel forces. Despite the priest's pleas for mercy, the rebel forces execute him and the remaining occupants.   When the team arrives at the extraction point, Waters' initial plan becomes clear: the SEALs suddenly turn away the refugees from the waiting helicopter. Waters forces Dr. Kendricks into the helicopter, leaving the refugees stranded in the jungle, unprotected against the rebels. En route to the aircraft carrier, they fly over the original mission compound, seeing it destroyed and all its occupants murdered, as Dr. Kendricks had predicted. Remorseful, Waters orders the pilot to return to the refugees. He then loads as many refugees as he can into the helicopter and decides to escort the remaining refugees to the [[Cameroon]] border.  During the hike to the border, using satellite scans, they discover the rebels are somehow tracking them. As they escape and evade the rebels, the team enters a village whose inhabitants are being raped, tortured, and massacred by rebel soldiers. Aware of having the opportunity to stop it, Waters orders the team to take down the rebels. The team is visibly shaken by the atrocities they see the rebels have committed against the villagers.  Again en route, Slo determines that a refugee is transmitting a signal allowing the rebels to locate them. The search for the transmitter reveals the presence of Arthur Azuka (Sammi Rotibi), the surviving son of late President Samuel Azuka, which they realize is the reason the rebels are hunting them: Samuel Azuka was not only the president of the country, but also the tribal king of the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]. As the only surviving member of this royal bloodline, Arthur is the only person left with a legitimate claim to the leadership of Nigeria. Waters is angry at Dr. Kendricks, who knew of Arthur's identity, yet never informed the SEAL team. A newer refugee ([[Jimmy Jean-Louis]]) picked up during the trek is discovered with the transmitter on his person. He attempts to run but is shot.  The team decides to continue escorting the refugees to Cameroon, regardless of the cost. A firefight ensues when the rebels finally catch up with the SEALs, who decide to stay behind as rearguard to buy the refugees enough time to reach the border safely. Zee radios the ''Truman'' for air support; two [[Boeing F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18A Hornets]] take off and head for the firefight. The rebels kill Slo, Flea, Lake, and Silk. Waters, Red, Zee, and Doc are wounded but direct the fighter pilots on where to attack. Arthur and Dr. Kendricks are scrambling to the Cameroon border gate when they hear the fighter jets approach and bomb the entire rebel force.  Waters, Zee, Doc, and Red rise from the grass as U.S. Navy helicopters land in Cameroon, opposite the Nigerian border fence gate. Captain Rhodes arrives and orders the gate open, letting in the SEALs and the refugees. A detail of [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] then escorts the SEALs to the helicopters. Captain Rhodes promises Waters that he will recover the bodies of his men. Dr. Kendricks says her tearful farewells to Nigerian friends and flies away in a helicopter while romantically embracing Waters, watching as Arthur is surrounded by his people proclaiming their freedom.  
A Tale of Two Sisters
 A teenage girl, Su-mi ([[Im Soo-jung (actress)|Im Soo-jung]]), is being treated for shock and [[psychosis]] in a mental institution. She is released and returns home to her family's secluded estate in the countryside with her father ([[Kim Kap-soo]]) and younger sister Su-yeon ([[Moon Geun-young]]), whom she is protective over. The sisters have a cold reunion with their stepmother, Eun-joo ([[Yum Jung-ah]]).  Eun-joo sleeps beside the sisters' father but he becomes uncomfortable and goes to sleep in the living room. Su-mi experiences a terrifying nightmare where the ghost of her late biological mother climbs on her bed with a broken neck. The next day, Su-mi finds family photos which reveal that Eun-joo was formerly an in-home nurse for her then-[[terminally ill]] biological mother. She discovers bruises on her sister's arms and angrily confronts Eun-joo about the abuse. That night, their uncle and his wife arrive for dinner and Eun-joo tells bizarre stories that bewilder them. The uncle's wife suffers a violent [[seizure]] and tells her husband that she witnessed the ghost of a young girl beneath the kitchen sink. When Eun-joo is in the kitchen alone, a ghost girl is seen watching her in the background.  After finding her pet bird dead and seeing defaced family photos of herself, Eun-joo locks Su-yeon in the closet. Su-mi releases her hysterical sister and is confronted by their father, who repeatedly begs her to stop acting out. She retorts that he is blind to Eun-joo's abuse against Su-yeon. Her father tells her that Su-yeon is dead but Su-mi refuses to believe it.  The next morning, Eun-joo drags a bloodied sack through the house, whipping it. Su-mi believes that Su-yeon is inside the sack and attempts to open it. Eun-joo and Su-mi get into a violent physical altercation. Su-mi's father arrives to find an injured Su-mi lying unconscious.  It is ultimately revealed that Su-mi and her father were alone in the house the entire time. The characters of Su-yeon and Eun-joo were manifestations of Su-mi's [[dissociative identity disorder]]. Throughout the film, Su-mi simultaneously switched personalities, acting as herself and Eun-joo. She hallucinated Su-yeon as a result of not being able to accept her death. In her "Eun-joo" mode, Su-mi imagined scenarios where she impersonates Eun-joo "abusing Su-yeon" but in reality injures herself to act out these situations. The bloodied sack simply contains a porcelain doll.  The father and the real Eun-joo, a much different woman from the imaginary version, send Su-mi back to the mental institution. That night, Eun-joo hears footsteps in Su-yeon's old bedroom. Simultaneously, Su-mi hears a mysterious whistling and recognizes it as Su-yeon, which is in stark contrast to her delusion of Su-yeon, who was unable to whistle. Eun-joo enters the room to investigate and the real ghost of Su-yeon crawls out of the closet. It is implied that Eun-joo is killed by Su-yeon, who finally gets her revenge. Su-mi smiles, appearing to have finally found peace.  Flashbacks reveal the day that led Su-mi to be institutionalized.

Tagore (film)
 The film is about a common man who decides to abolish corruption altogether in the society at various levels.  15 Tahsildars are found missing, and the police find that 14 of them have been released after three days, but one of them has been killed. They find some files and a tape along with the body of the dead Tahsildar. These files carry details of why the kidnapping of the Tahsildars had been done and the reason for the murder of one of them, and have the words ACF written on it. It is understood by the police that these men were the Tahsildars who had indulged themselves in bribery and that they were the top 15 of the list of the corrupt Tahsildars. The ACF sends the tape, with the message that they shall continue the kidnap of the corrupt officers in all the departments and that the No. 1 corrupt shall be sentenced to death according to the law of the Anti Corruption Force. The ACF similarly kidnaps officials from PWD and police department and kills the top corrupt official.  There is fear among the corrupt officials. They come forward to file their returns. For a while there are no illegal transactions done, but the corruption soon continues in the society due to the threatening of the local mob to sign illegal documents and accept bribes. Meanwhile, the ACF finds that it is Badrinarayana ([[Sayaji Shinde]]) who is the real reason behind this corruption scenario. Then the kidnapping continues. The case is investigated by group of several old-aged senior level officials who are very slow-moving in their progress. However, Suryam ([[Prakash Raj]]), an IPS-passed guy who is working as a constable (unable to pay the bribe to get the officer-level job), takes up the case in order to get promotion in the department and moves ahead of those officials in a short time. He investigates the case starting with finding of the non-corrupt official in every government office, assuming that official would have collected the information of other corrupt officers and passed it to ACF. He tries to figure out what is the common thing which unites them under one roof. He gradually finds out that they are alumni of National College and working for the ACF under their professor and the leader of the ACF, Professor Tagore ([[Chiranjeevi]]).  Tagore is a simple man who leads a simple life during the daytime along with his adopted kids from different cultures (one is a Muslim, one is an American, one is Hindu, etc.). He looks like a timid character, but brave in terms of his actions and he loved by all his peers. Tagore once takes one of his kids to the hospital for treating an injury and finds that the hospital is a place full of corruption who play with the lives of people for the sake of money. Tagore decides to expose the truth and catches them red-handed by faking a dead body as a patient. The hospital, unaware of his plans, continue their treatment even though they know that the person is dead and demand lakhs of money for treatment. Tagore produces the documents and receipts related to their fake treatment and gets the hospital sealed by the government. The hospital dean is arrested, but he commits suicide. Badrinarayana, the dean's father, is enraged by this and attempts to take revenge on Tagore. He finds Tagore in the CCTV camera and is shocked as according to him he was dead several years ago.  Tagore is a happy professor who lives with his wife Nandini ([[Jyothika]]), who is expecting a second child and daughter. On a Deepavali day, when the whole apartment is celebrating the festival, the entire building collapses due to some fault in the construction of a nearby highway, and many of the residents (including Nandini and Tagore's daughter) lose their lives. Tagore rushes to the government officials, and he comes to know that all this was due to one person, namely Badrinarayana, the owner of a construction company and builder of that highway. Tagore finds that the highway was constructed on loose soil by which the contractions caused to collapse was very well known to him. Badrinarayana and his men thrash Tagore heavily and beat him to death. However, Tagore escapes from them. The incidents that he faced at the office and seeing corrupt puppets in the hands of Badrinarayana, he gets frustrated and he forms the ACF (Anti Corruption Force) to fight against corruption. He also kidnaps Badrinarayana and kills him like he killed other corrupted officials.  The constable finally finds out the people working for ACF are the ex-students, and the police force captures all of them. Police men torture them to open the identity of their leader; however, they refuse to do so. Tagore, on seeing his students suffer, surrenders to the police and requests the Indian Police to release his students. The rising support for Tagore makes the Chief Minister ([[K. Vishwanath]]) to meet him for higher appeal. Tagore refuses to appeal as he wants to stress the concept in the minds of everyone that if we make mistakes, we will be punished, and he himself doesn't want to violate it as he did a crime of killing four people. Tagore gives a speech in the court explaining what a student power the country has, but corruption is what is letting it down. In the end, Tagore is given a normal punishment of five years and is to be released by then.

Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines
 [[John Connor]] has been living off the grid in [[Los Angeles]] following the death of his mother, [[Sarah Connor (Terminator)|Sarah Connor]]. Although a war between humans and [[Skynet (Terminator)|Skynet]]'s forces did not occur on August 29, 1997, as foretold, John still fears it. He rejects his fate as humanity's savior and hides from Skynet.   Unable to locate John in the past, Skynet sends a new model of the [[Terminator (character concept)|Terminator]] called the [[T-X]] to July 24, 2004, to kill other members of the Human Resistance instead. The T-X is more advanced than previous Terminators: it has an [[endoskeleton]] with built-in weaponry, a [[liquid metal]] exterior similar to the [[T-1000]], and it can reprogram other machines after injecting [[nanorobotics]]. This model is also designed to eliminate other Skynet-related machines. Unlike previous Terminators, its default appearance is female. The Resistance again sends a reprogrammed Terminator ([[Terminator (character)|T-850 – Model 101]]) to protect the T-X's targets, including John and his future wife, Kate Brewster.  After killing several other targets, the T-X locates Kate and John at an animal hospital, where Kate has caught John stealing drugs. They escape with the Terminator's help. The next day, the Terminator takes them to a [[mausoleum]] where John's mother is supposedly interred. Inside her vault, they find a weapons cache left at Sarah's request in case Judgment Day occurred. Police arrive and a gun battle ensues. The T-X also chases them, but they escape. The Terminator reveals that John and his mother's actions merely delayed Judgment Day, and that his plan is to drive John and Kate to [[Mexico]] to escape the fallout when Skynet begins its [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear attack]] at 6:18&nbsp;p.m. John orders the Terminator to take Kate and him to see Kate's father, a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] who, in the present, is supervising the building of Skynet after Cyberdyne Systems went defunct. John threatens to kill himself if the Terminator refuses. The Terminator calls John's bluff but agrees to take them after Kate orders him to. The Terminator reveals that he killed John on July 4, 2032; Kate sent him back after having him captured and reprogrammed, and she is the only one who can give him orders.  Meanwhile, at an Air Force base, General Brewster faces pressure from the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] to activate Skynet to stop an anomalous [[computer virus]] of unknown origin from invading [[Server (computing)|servers]] worldwide; he is unaware that the virus is actually Skynet establishing control over them. John and Kate arrive too late to stop Skynet from being activated, and its machines begin attacking Brewster's staff. Brewster is mortally wounded by the T-X, which arrived before John, Kate, and the Terminator. Before dying, he gives Kate and John a code book and the location of what John believes is Skynet's system core. John and Kate head for the tarmac to take General Brewster's biplane; their destination is Crystal Peak, a military base built inside the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. The T-X and the T-850 fight each other. The T-X severely damages the T-850, then reprograms it to kill John and Kate. The T-X pursues John and Kate through the military base, but it becomes trapped when a [[particle accelerator]] is activated and the magnetic field bonds the T-X to the accelerator. The Terminator, unable to control his outer functions but still consciously aware, attacks John and Kate before John convinces it to reject the T-X's control. The Terminator deliberately shuts its corrupted system down, enabling John and Kate to escape. Shortly after they leave, the Terminator's system [[Reboot (computing)|reboots]].  John and Kate reach Crystal Peak and begin entering the access codes to gain entry when the T-X arrives by helicopter. Just as she is about to attack, the rebooted Terminator arrives in a second helicopter and crashes into the T-X, crushing it. The T-X pulls itself from the wreckage and attempts to drag itself inside the bunker to follow John and Kate. The Terminator holds the bunker open long enough for John and Kate to lock themselves inside, then uses one of its hydrogen fuel cells to destroy both itself and the T-X.  John and Kate discover that the facility is not Skynet's core, but rather a nuclear [[fallout shelter]] and command facility for government and military officials. Skynet has no core and it has become a part of [[cyberspace]] after its self-awareness. Judgment Day begins as Skynet fires nuclear missiles across the world, starting a [[nuclear holocaust]] that kills billions. John and Kate begin receiving radio transmissions on the emergency equipment; John tentatively assumes command by answering radio calls, and they reluctantly accept their fate.

Kemper goes inside to look for Erin, and is killed with a sledgehammer by Thomas Hewitt, also known as "[[Leatherface]]", who drags his body into the basement to make a new mask.  Meanwhile, Hoyt arrives at the mill, and disposes of the hitchhiker's body. After Erin discovers that Kemper is missing, she and Andy go back to Monty's house, and Erin distracts him, while Andy searches for Kemper. When Monty realizes that Andy is inside, he summons Leatherface, who attacks him with a chainsaw. Erin escapes and heads towards the woods, but Leatherface severs Andy's leg, and carries him to the basement, where he is impaled on a meat hook. Erin makes it back to the mill, but before she and the others can leave, Hoyt shows up. After finding marijuana on the dashboard, he orders Erin and Pepper to get out of the van, gives Morgan the gun he took from the hitchhiker, and tells him to reenact how she killed herself.

Erin wakes up at the Hewitt house, surrounded by the entire family: Leatherface, his mother Luda Mae, Hoyt, Monty, and Jedidiah. Luda Mae explains to Erin that Leatherface was tormented his whole life, because of a skin disease that left his face disfigured, and she felt that no one cared for her family besides themselves.  Erin is taken to the basement, where she finds Andy, and kills him to end his suffering after failing to get him off the hook. Afterwards, she finds Morgan handcuffed in a bathtub. Jedidiah, who does not agree with his family's actions, leads them out of the house, and distracts Leatherface long enough for them to escape. Erin and Morgan find an abandoned shack in the woods, and barricade themselves inside. Leatherface breaks in and discovers Erin, but Morgan attacks Leatherface, who hangs him from a chandelier by his handcuffs, and cuts through his groin with the chainsaw. Erin escapes into the woods with Leatherface in tow. She finds a slaughterhouse and attacks Leatherface with a meat cleaver, severing his right arm.  Erin runs outside and flags down a trucker, whom she tries to convince to drive away from the Hewitt house, but he stops to find help at the eatery. As the family is distracted by the trucker, Erin sneaks the baby out of the eatery, and places her in the sheriff's car. Erin hot-wires the car and Hoyt tries to stop her, but she runs him over repeatedly until he is dead.

Timeline (2003 film)
 Professor Edward Johnston leads an archaeological study of the village of Castlegard near LaRoque Castle in [[Dordogne|Dordogne, France]], the site of the 1357 hanging of Lady Claire, sister to [[Arnaud de Cervole|Arnaut de Cervole]]; her martyrdom led [[Kingdom of France|France]] to win the [[Hundred Years War]] against the [[Kingdom of England|English]]. Johnston's team includes [[Scottish people|Scottish]] archaeologist André Marek, Johnston's students Kate Erickson, Josh Stern, and François Dontelle, and his son Chris who is infatuated with Kate. While excavating a nearby monastery, they find a [[sarcophagus]] with the remains of a French knight with a lopped ear, and holding the hand of his lady, an unheard-of practice for the time. Johnston travels to the American headquarters of the ITC Corporation, their sponsor, to question if they have tampered with the site. The students later discover a pair of Johnston's [[bifocals]] and a note begging for help, though both date over 600 years old. When they contact ITC, the company invites them to their headquarters.  There, the team is introduced to ITC president Robert Doniger and vice-president Steven Kramer. Doniger reveals that in the process of developing [[teleportation]] technology, they locked onto a stable [[wormhole]] to 1357 Castlegard. Johnston was invited to see the past for himself but his group has not returned and they want the students to go back in time to locate him. All but Josh volunteer to go. They are stripped of all modern technology save for pendant-shaped markers they can use to initiate their return. The students are joined by a security team including head of security Frank Gordon and two former military men.  On arrival in 1357, they find themselves in the path of a young woman chased by English knights; the security men are killed while protecting the group, though one has activated their marker shortly after priming a grenade. When his body arrives in the present, the grenade detonates and shatters much of the teleportation device. Josh aids Kramer to help make repairs.  The team evade the knights, and are led by the woman to the English-controlled Castlegard. They are captured and brought before Lord Oliver de Vannes and his second in command, DeKere. They are stripped of their markers, and de Vannes kills François, believing him to be a French spy. The others are imprisoned along with Johnston, who is revealed to have promised de Vennes that he can make [[Greek fire|Greek Fire]] for the English in exchange for his life. They make their escape but are pursued by the English. Gordon and Johnston are recaptured while the others make for the monastery, led by the woman. DeKere reveals himself to Gordon and Johnston as former ITC employee William Decker; he had frequently used the teleportation device but was not told by ITC that each use damaged his DNA until it was too late, at which point he would die on a return trip. He plans revenge on ITC and kills Gordon. De Vannes orders his knights to march on LaRoque castle, and DeKere brings Johnston along.  At the monastery, Marek, Kate, and Chris meet de Cervole, and realize the woman is Lady Claire; they have changed history by saving her. Marek, who has become infatuated with Lady Claire, is given a horse to rescue his friends. Kate and Chris help to swing the upcoming battle in the French's favor by leading de Cervole's men through the monastery tunnels they had previously mapped to the castle. As the battle starts, Marek is captured in his rescue attempt, and Lady Claire is also kidnapped. Marek manages to free himself, Lady Claire and Johnston, while Chris helps de Cervole defeat de Vannes. Enraged, DeKere slashes off Marek's earlobe; Marek realizes he is destined to be the knight in the sarcophagus. He defeats DeKere and recovers the markers, giving them to the others and says his goodbyes as he runs off to help the French assure victory and restore history.  As the three activate their markers, in the present Josh and Kramer have finished the repairs after coming to learn that Doniger has attempted to sabotage their attempts; he fears that when the students' stories become public, ITC will suffer great financial losses. As the machine activates, Doniger races into it, attempting to block the teleportation, but instead he is sent back to 1357, where he is quickly killed on the battleground. Chris, Kate, and Johnston safely return. Later, the team returns to Castlegard and re-examine the sarcophagus, finding that Marek and Lady Claire led a prosperous life after the war and had three children: Christophe, Katherine, and François.  
Time of the Wolf

Having fled Paris, the Laurent family arrives at their country home, hoping to find refuge and security, only to discover that it is already occupied by strangers.  The family is assaulted by the strangers and forced to leave, with no supplies or transport. As they seek help from people they have known in the village, they are repeatedly turned away.

She is imprisoned and the three girls garner support for Asha who would be executed if sent back to Dubai.  
Timecop 2: The Berlin Decision
 The film introduces new characters and takes place twenty years after the previous film.<ref></ref>   In 2025, time travel technology has improved considerably; Time Enforcement Commission (TEC), the agency that monitors time travel, is still keeping the past safe and after the events of the previous film, Society for Historical Authenticity (SHA) is established to ensure that TEC personnel do not [[Alternate history|alter history]]. But the Society's leader, Brandon Miller, believes he has the responsibility to change history based on a "moral obligation to right the wrongs of the past" and plans to do so by traveling back to [[Berlin]] in 1940 and killing [[Adolf Hitler]]. TEC agent Ryan Chang is sent back to stop him, but in the resulting fight, Miller's wife, Sasha, part of the SHA, ends up dead. Miller is imprisoned in the World Penitentiary for trying to change history, and Ryan Chang begins arresting Miller's close Society friends. In [[Atlantic City]] in 1895, Ryan prevents SHA member Frank Knight from robbing [[Andrew Carnegie]]. Knight accuses the TEC of being murderers when they execute him. Ryan is haunted by memories of when his father, Josh, died of a [[Intracranial aneurysm|brain aneurysm]] in 2002. Josh was lecturing about time travel at the [[University of Southern California]], and had a heated debate on the morals of altering history.  TEC agent Douglas illegally makes physical contact with his younger self and they are suddenly merged, causing the agent to [[Blinovitch Limitation Effect|wink out of existence]]. Without the agent ever existing, a key Brandon Miller associate isn't arrested and Miller is able to leave prison on a technicality. Miller sets out to eliminate every TEC operative by traveling back in time and killing their ancestors, making it as if the agents never existed. Miller could then change history with impunity since there wasn't anyone to stop him. Eventually, Ryan is the only agent left and he has to stop Miller.  Ryan fights his way through rioters at the World Penitentiary and confronts Miller, but is unable to convince him that what he wants to do is wrong. Back in his present time, Ryan finds changes to history; Doc is more irascible because her husband was "killed in the war". When he returns to the World Penitentiary, Miller was never there at all. Ryan, becoming less and less capable of surviving all these time jumps, returns to 2025 again. This time, the world is even more different due to Miller’s interference: Ryan's parents were "killed in the war", Doc has been executed for trying to save her husband and O'Rourke wears an eye patch and has never heard of Hitler.  Ryan is issued a tracker that enables him to follow Miller by jumping into the wake of his time leaps. He is sent to 1881 and prevents Miller from killing an ancestor named Jason in [[Springfield, Texas]], then chases him to 1929 where he saves a Frances in a Chinese restaurant. In a nightclub in 1988, Ryan is embarrassed to see his young parents disco dancing and lures Miller away from them. Miller shoots Ryan, but the bullet is stopped by the pocket watch that his father bequeathed to him. Returning to his own era, where things are mostly back to normal, he realizes that his father died when Miller tried to kill Ryan at age 11. Barely surviving another time leap, Ryan goes to the University of Southern California in May 2002.  The student who disagreed with Josh was a young Brandon Miller. Josh tries to stop the older Miller from killing Ryan, but is killed by one of Miller's weapon that induces brain aneurysms. The older Ryan intervenes, threatening to erase Miller’s existence by killing his younger self. The older Miller taunts Ryan by accusing him of hypocritically being willing to change history. He provokes him into a fight, watched by the younger Miller, younger Ryan and his mother, and Sasha. When Ryan has Miller at his mercy, he tells the younger Miller that “It doesn’t have to be this way.” Ryan and Miller then disappear, suggesting that the younger Miller changed his mind. In 2025, Ryan’s colleagues who were erased by Miller are back, although Doc still refuses to date Timecops.  
Tie Xi Qu: West of the Tracks
  === "Rust" === The first portion, "Rust," follows a group of factory workers in three state-run factories: a smelting plant, an electric cable factory and a sheet metal factory.

In particular, Wang focuses on the teenage children who concern themselves with their own lives but must also cope with their inevitable displacement as Tie Xi's factories continue to close down. In Chinese, this section is called 艳粉街 (''Yànfěn Jiē''), meaning "Yanfen Street."  === "Rails" === The third part, "Rails" narrows its focus to a single father and son who scavenge the rail yards in order to sell raw parts to the factories. With the factories closing however, their future suddenly becomes uncertain. In Chinese, this section is called 铁路 (''tiělù''), meaning "railway."

He misses the one bus out of town to [[Thimphu]], however, and is forced to hitchhike and walk along the [[Transport in Bhutan#Highways|Lateral Road]] to the west, accompanied by an apple seller, a [[Buddhist]] [[monk]] with his ornate, dragon-headed [[dramyin]] heading to Thimphu, a drunk, a widowed [[rice paper]] maker and his daughter Sonam (played by [[Sonam Lhamo]]).  To pass the time, the monk tells the tale of Tashi, a restless farmboy who, like Dondup, dreams of escaping village life.  Tashi rides a horse that goes into a forest. He immediately becomes lost in remote mountains and finds his life entwined with that of an elderly hermit woodcutter and his beautiful young wife.  Tashi's wish of escape granted, he finds himself caught in a web of lust and jealousy, enchanted by the beautiful and yielding wife, but fearing the woodsman and his axe. Tashi finally tries to murder the woodcutter, aided by his wife who is pregnant by Tashi. He runs away, however, while the old man is near death, burdened by his guilt. Deki, the woodcutter's wife calls and runs after him, but drowns in a mountain river while giving pursuit.  Tashi's adventures finally turn out to be hallucinations induced by [[chhaang]], a home-brewed liquor. The monk's tale merely parallels Dondup's growing attraction to Sonam. During a dilemma similar to Tashi's, Dondup manages to hitch a ride to Thimphu. The film ends without showing the final outcome of Dondup's journey - his visa interview and his trip abroad. The audience is left to wonder whether the trip changed his attitude toward the village and Bhutan, and if he returned to the village.  
A Touch of Spice
 Fanis Iakovides, professor of [[astronomy]] and [[astrophysics]], recalls his childhood memories from growing up in [[Istanbul]]. When Fanis was 7 years old, his grandfather Vassilis was an owner of a [[general store]] with a specialty in [[spices]]. He was also a culinary [[philosopher]] and his mentor. Fanis grew very attached to his grandfather who would assist with his homework using imaginative techniques. For instance, Vassilis would teach his grandson the planets of the [[Solar System]] by showing an illustration of it and replacing the planets with spices. [[Cinnamon]] took the place of [[Venus]] since according to Vassilis, "like all women, cinnamon is both bitter and sweet". Fanis also fell in love for the first time in his grandfather store's upper floor with a young Turkish girl, Saime.  However, beginning with the [[Istanbul Pogrom]] in 1955, through 1978, the ethnic Greek community of Istanbul was reduced from 135,000 to 7,000 by a series of government orchestrated riots, pogroms and deportations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2008/09/07/haber,033E2E8B399A4A638FCD099591F11DD4.html |accessdate=2008-12-25 |title=Sermaye nasıl el değiştirdi? |first=Ecevit |last=Kilic |work=Sabah |language=Turkish |date=2008-09-07 |quote=6-7 Eylül olaylarından önce Constantinople 135 bin Rum yaşıyordu.

Since Vassilis was not a dual citizen, he was able to stay behind while his grandson Fanis and his parents were deported to [[Athens]].  Fanis had trouble initially adapting in Greece, constantly trying to spend his time in the kitchen cooking, as it was the only link between him and his homeland. However, this would upset his mother who was afraid that the boy was either severely depressed or a [[homosexual]]. Fanis grew from childhood to adulthood, preserving his culinary talents and often offering his secrets of the Politiki Cuisine to those that ask for his help.  As the years passed by, and the tension between Turkey and Greece resolved, grandfather Vassilis made several promises to visit his grandson in Athens but failed to keep them. The reason for the final incompletion of this engagement was his rapidly declining health. Consequently, Fanis returns to Constantinople after three decades to visit his near-death grandfather and also runs into his old love, Saime, who is now married. Together, they reflect on their lives and the way politics managed to change everything.  Fanis will eventually realize that contrary to what his grandfather had taught him, he forgot to put a little bit of spice in his own life.  The main characters easily fit into a parallel metaphor - Saime, the old love of Fanis, a beautiful Turkish girl and multi-lingual tour guide, represents Istanbul (a cosmopolitan city called a "she" in Greek), Fanis is modern Greece, one that is still deeply in love with Constantinople and nostalgic for the past, while Saime's husband is a Turkish military doctor who represents a modern, pragmatic Turkey.  
Triads, Yardies and Onion Bhajees
 Triads, Yardies and Onion Bhajees is primarily an action movie but it has a mythological and spiritual vein running through it. The character of Chacha worships the Hindu Goddess [[Kali]], and a statue of [[Kali]] is shown both in his home and in his office. Chacha is seen praying to the Goddess in a temple.  Chachas influence and teachings have also influenced members of his gang. The image of Kali can be seen in the homes of his various gang members. The smoke emanating from the incense surrounding the Kali statue in the temple is deemed to be holy, and Chacha names his crime syndicate "The Holy Smokes". The film suggests that the Goddess [[Kali]] is watching the proceedings unfold before her and ultimately will decide who lives and who dies.  
The Triplets of Belleville
 The film begins with a flashback showing The Triplets of Belleville: a trio of singers performing on stage in the early 1900s (dancing alongside other celebrities including [[Josephine Baker]] and [[Django Reinhardt]]).  The story focuses on Madame Souza, an elderly woman raising her young grandson, Champion. Souza notices her grandson is sad and lonely, hinted as due to the loss of his parents, so she first tries to get him interested in the piano. When this fails, she buys him a puppy named Bruno to cheer him up. Although he is initially happy, he quickly becomes melancholic once again. After discovering that Champion has a keen interest in [[road bicycle racing]], because it is implied that Champion's deceased parents were cyclists, she buys him a [[tricycle]]. Years later, Champion becomes a professional cyclist with Souza as his coach.  Eventually, Champion enters the [[Tour de France]] but during the race, he and two other riders are kidnapped by two [[Milieu (organized crime in France)|French mafia]] henchmen and brought to the bustling metropolis of Belleville.  Souza and Bruno follow the men, but lose their trail soon after reaching the city. Lost and with no way to find Champion, Souza has a chance encounter with the renowned Belleville triplets, [[music hall]] singers from the 1930s, now elderly women turned [[Musical improvisation|improvisational musicians]]. The sisters take Souza to their home and over time she becomes a part of their group. Meanwhile, the mafia boss drugs the kidnapped cyclists and employs a mechanic to build a stationary cycling machine for the racers to race on — to create their own mini Tour de France for gambling.  At a fancy restaurant, the Triplets and Souza perform a [[jam session]] using a newspaper, refrigerator, vacuum and bicycle wheel as instruments. The mafia boss who kidnapped her grandson happens to be in the same restaurant and, with the help of Bruno, Souza realizes he has Champion. She tails one of the Mafia's minions the next day and discovers their scheme. That night, several mob bosses and their henchmen arrive at the mafia hideout and place bets on the riders (one of whom falls off his bicycle from exhaustion, at which point the bookmaker shoots him as one would an injured horse). Madame Souza, Bruno and the triplets then infiltrate the hideout and sabotage the contraption, unbolting it from the ground and turning it into a pedal-powered vehicle on which they all escape. The mob henchmen pursue them, but are all thwarted amidst the chase. The film ends with the motley group riding on out of Belleville, and a [[flashforward]] to an elderly Champion reflecting on the adventure, as told to him by the then-deceased Souza.

She goes to his room and is shocked to find the card and gift. She says that she does not want to marry Akash and will tell everyone about them.

Meanwhile, [[Teav (Cambodian character)|Teav]], ([[Danh Monica]]) the daughter of a rich woman in a village, hears some news about the handsome monk with the beautiful voice from her waitress ([[Kong Socheat]]). So she asks her mother, [[Pai (Cambodian character)|Pai]], ([[Chan Daraty]]) to invite him to sing for at their home.  As Tum sings at the Teav's house, both fall in love at first sight. Then Teav offers Tum betel nuts and a blanket as evidence of the feelings she had for him and prays to Buddha that the young monk will be with her for eternity. Tum accepts the offer with delight to see that she feels the same as he does.  Back to the Monastery, Tum cannot stop stop thinking in Teav. The feeling grows stronger and eventually he persuades Pich to quit the [[monkshood]]. Both of them meet the abbot and talk about their intention. The abbot says that Pich can leave, but he prevents Tum of that, because he could get a bad fate if he insists. Although the advice, Tum is decided to leave in order to meet Teav. The abbot tells them that if they insist, they must defrock by themselves in the middle of the jungle and so they do.  Now as laity, they visited in secret the house of Teav, although she is "in the shade" (ក្នុងម្លប់), a traditional period of few weeks where young ladies are secluded at their home, especially far from the contact of males, in order to gain in virtue as a woman. But Teav accepts Tum in his house, hidden from her mother and they even sleep together with the complicity of the waitress, who has also feelings for Pich. As the Teav's mother is back home, Tum manages to show up as he just comes to visit the family and to announce that he is not more a monk. The mother never realizes the love affair of her daughter with the ex-monk.  The Tum's reputation for his voice as a singer reaches the King and he is invited to the royal palace to perform. The King is so amazed with his voice that names him the royal singer. At the same moment, Teav's mother is informed about the love of Teav for Tum and thus hurries to arrange an early wedding with Ngoun, the son of the Province's governor, who is a handsome but arrogant young man, who thinks he should married the most beautiful woman in town, just because he is the son of a powerful lord.  However, the village is visited by a chief of the royal guard, who sees Teav and thinks she would be a good new wife for the King. He meets the village and asked Teav and her mother to go with him to the Palace to be introduced to the King. It angers Ngoun and his father, who thinks that Pai, the Teav's mother, has deceived them. Pai cried in front of the governor claiming that it was not her idea and that she cannot do nothing, because it is a royal order. The two women are brought to the Palace and introduced to the King.  The King likes Teav very much, who seems completely upset of this new change of destiny. To her horror the King calls Tum, the royal singer, to sing a song as a celebration. Tum sings obediently in front to a crying Teav and the King notices the situation. At the end, he asked Tum why he sang that new, beautiful but sad song and why Teav was crying too much. Then, suspicious, he asked if both of them had any love affair, because if it is true, he could not take her as his wife. Tum stands honestly in front of the King and confesses his love for Teav, with her confirmation. Then the King says that he will not be an obstacle to such a love and ordered that both become marriage to the evident upset of Pai.  Back to the village, now without her daughter, Pai feels miserable, while the Governor insults her for deceiving Ngoun, his son. She feels ill and alone, but at the end creates a plan to lure Teav out of the Palace and, at her return to the village, to celebrate the wedding with Ngoun. Teav gets a message at the Palace that she must return immediately to her mother's home, because Pai is sick. When both say goodbye expecting to meet soon for their marriage, something fall to the ground and they feel it is a bad omen of separation.  When Teav is back home, she discovers with horror that her mother has arranged her immediate wedding with Ngoun. Teav cries and shouts that she is a bad mother, but Pai is determined to conclude the affair over the feelings of her daughter.  The news of the forced wedding reaches the Palace and Pich gives a message to Tum right at the moment he is going to sign for the King. When the King realizes that his Royal Order to marriage Tum and Teav will be challenged by the Governor, he becomes furious and sends an [[Edict]] in order to stop the wedding.  Tum brings the message alone and runs to the wedding, but instead of presenting the Edict, he drinks and becomes drunk, then singing in the party for Teav and kissing her in public. His behavior upsets everybody, especially Ngoun and his father, who ordered to bring Tum out of the village. Pich arrives too and tries to prevent the expulsion shouting that he has a Royal Edict, but the father of Ngoun does not hear him and expelled him too. At the same moment, Pai asked Teav to stay at home and order her guard.  Tum fights with the men who want to expel him from the village, making them more violent and led by the governor, he is persecuted and brutally beaten. At the end, due to the persistence of Tum to go back to the wedding, the governor plunges a sword in his chest, while telling him to stay away from the life of his son. Tun dies in the field, under a [[banyan]] tree before the powerless eyes of his friend, who then runs back to the wedding to communicate the event to Teav.  Teav becomes hysteric and runs to the field, while her mother cries out, trying to stop her. She runs through the jungle and finds easily the dead body of her lover. She is followed by her loyal mistress. She embraced Tum and then removes the sword and commits suicides with it. The mistress, then, terrorized, follows her example. Few minutes after Pai, Nguon, his father and villagers arrived to the place. Only in that moment the Governor finds the Edict in the dead body of Tun and feels afraid for what he has done.  In the last scene, all villagers are brought in front to the King, held in stocks. For the King, all the village was guilty of disobeying the Edicts, including children. Following the advises of his Royal Council, most villagers are condemned to die and the rest to be sold into slavery, while a wider area is crippled with heavy taxes.

Twist (film)
 The film is similar in some ways to  [[Seth Michael Donsky]]'s 1996 film ''[[Twisted (1996 film)|Twisted]]'' made prior to Tierney's film.  As in Donsky's film, the plot of ''Oliver Twist'' is updated to the present day, and moved out of the London [[poor house]] onto the streets of a large North American city (in Donsky's film it was [[New York City]], and this film it is [[Toronto]]). In addition, the tale is told not from Oliver's point of view, but rather that of [[Artful Dodger|Dodge]] ([[Nick Stahl]]). Oliver ([[Joshua Close]]) falls into the hands of down-and-out young men. Dodge takes Oliver under his wing and instructs him in the unforgiving arts of [[drug abuse]] and [[prostitution]]. Oliver develops a crush on Dodge and views him as his boyfriend, complicating their friendship. Dodge does not reciprocate his feelings, and reacts angrily to Oliver's kisses and other signs of affection. As Oliver's innocence dissolves, both young men confront their demons, and ultimately it is Dodge who finds he cannot escape his past. Dodge is found by his abusive brother around the same time the young men's caretaker commits suicide, sending Dodge into a violent rage at the film's conclusion.  
Twentynine Palms (film)
 With a Russian girl called Katia, a young American photographer called David drives a [[Hummer]] from [[Los Angeles]] to a motel in the little desert town of [[Twentynine Palms]]. As she hardly speaks English and he speaks no Russian, they talk in French, a language in which neither is confident. Much of their communication is therefore non-verbal and the two frequently misunderstand each other.  Their days are spent driving and walking around the empty desert, sometimes naked. They make love, they fight, or just pass time. The camera contrasts the vastness, timelessness and emptiness of the landscape with the two small humans. Yet, as well as natural beauty, the desert contains menace. Stopped by a pick-up full of rednecks, David is beaten and raped while Katia is stripped and forced to watch. Back at the motel after their ordeal, David loses his mind and, after cutting off his hair, stabs Katia to death. The police find the Hummer in the desert with his corpse beside it.

Ultraman Cosmos vs. Ultraman Justice: The Final Battle
 While EYES prepare to safely transport the world's monsters to a far off planet where they will no longer be troubled by humans, an army of giant alien robots, called Gloker Pawns appear to stop the project. Cosmos arrives in time to temporarily stop the attack when Ultraman Justice enters the battle aiding the alien invaders. Cosmos is defeated by Justice and the aliens destroy the spacecraft that were to be used as transports for the monsters. It becomes apparent that these aliens don't want Earth's species to leave the planet.  With Cosmos out of the way the invaders begin an onslaught against the Earth's major cities. Every attack is witnessed by a mysterious woman in black who shows no emotion and no desire to interact with any of the victims. Without Cosmos the world is defenseless.  It is soon revealed that the mysterious woman Julie is Ultraman Justice in disguise who has been sent by a Universal peace-keeping organisation called the Universal Justice to oversee their plans. Justice appears at a meeting of top level EYES leaders to deliver  a message from the organisation: In the near future life on Earth will become a threat to peace in the galaxy from the conclusion of the incident of Sandros (see [[Ultraman Cosmos 2: The Blue Planet|2nd movie]]). The aliens have come to destroy all life on Earth then restart it with new species that will be more acceptable to the other planets with their ultimate weapon, a massive space craft called Giga Endra. The destruction of Earth will begin in 35 hours and there will be no negotiations. As the Earth's forces try to stop the advance of Giga Endra, nothing in their weapons are powerful enough to so much as scratch it. EYES at this time tried to protect the people from the wrath of Gloker Pawns while putting all their efforts in getting a communication with Delaxion, one of the higher officials of the organisation in order to convince her to stop the attack.  Through interaction with a kind young girl and her puppy, Justice is able to see the good in mankind that Cosmos mentioned as two Gloker Pawns combine to form the Gloker Rook as they're being attacked by Earth's monsters and defeat them. Justice attacks the Gloker Rook and after a fierce battle, with EYES' help and changing into his Crusher Mode, destroys the robot with Crusher Victorium Ray. But the aliens release their next robot, the Gloker Bishop. Try as he might, Justice is not strong enough to defeat it but Cosmos' friends combine their energies to resurrect Cosmos. Holding no bad will against Justice, Cosmos changed into Future Form and recharged Justice and the two take on the Bishop.  With the combined efforts of the Ultramen,the Gloker Bishop is overcome and all is left is the life resetter, Giga Endra. The massive robot cannon is far too powerful for the duo to overcome and killed the two. But they were combined to form Ultraman Legend. The super Ultraman catches Giga Endra's resetter beam and pushes back before losing his ultimate move, the Light of Legend (The Spark Legend), and obliterating Giga Endra. With Giga Endra destroyed, Delaxion appeared before Ultraman Legend, asking him why the legendary warrior is going that far to protect the life on Earth. Legend then split back into Cosmos and Justice which both of them convinced the Universal Justice to retreat their forces. Before fully retreat, Delaxion stated that they should believe in the warriors of light as well as the humans who keep on sending messages to Delaxion herself.  In the ending scene, Julie and Musashi was eating sweet bits given by the girl she saved. Musashi's friends wave to him and leave Julie behind. She smiled to him and everyone in the end of the scene.  
Underworld (2003 film)
 For generations, a secret war has been waged between [[vampires]] and [[Lycanthropy|Lycans]], an ancient species of [[werewolf]]. [[Selene (Underworld)|Selene]], a [[Death Dealer (Underworld)|Death Dealer]], a vampire specialized in assassinating Lycans, tracks two Lycans. Selene's motivation goes beyond duty; she also wants revenge because, 600 years ago when she was a child, Lycans slaughtered her family. The vampires believe they defeated the werewolves many centuries ago and killed their leader, [[Lucian (Underworld)|Lucian]], and that they must kill the surviving Lycans. Selene locates the Lycans' den and learns they have developed a new kind of [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|UV]] bullet capable of killing vampires.  Later, Selene arrives at the mansion of her vampire coven and, recounting these events, urges an attack on the Lycans; but the vampire [[regent]], [[Kraven (Underworld)|Kraven]], dismisses her proposal. Selene determines that the pair of Lycans may have been following a human, [[Michael Corvin]], and continues her investigation. In a Lycan lair, a scientist named Singe tests blood from kidnapped descendants of the ancient Corvinus family, trying to find a pure source of the ancient and powerful Corvinus bloodline. Soon after Selene finds Michael, the pair are attacked by Lycans, including their leader, who is revealed to be Lucian. Lucian bites Michael, but Selene helps Michael escape and the two become attracted to each other.  Selene discovers that Kraven was the only witness to Lucian's supposed death. Sensing a conspiracy, she awakens a dormant powerful vampire elder, [[Viktor (Underworld)|Viktor]], who has been [[hibernating]]. Viktor is angered by his early awakening, as it was [[Markus Corvinus (Underworld)|Markus]]' turn to rule the coven. Viktor believes Kraven and orders Selene to acquiesce to the vampire [[hierarchy]]. Kraven, meanwhile, has secretly planned to kill the third vampire elder, [[Amelia (Underworld)|Amelia]], and her companions with Lucian's help.  Selene informs Michael about the feud and her past. She then binds him, fearing that he will kill innocent people after he changes into his Lycan form at the coming night's full moon. Selene captures Singe while Michael is captured by Lycans. Selene returns to the mansion with Singe, who admits to Viktor that the Lycans are trying to combine the [[bloodline]]s of the two species with the Corvinus Strain, the shared source of both the Vampire and Lycan bloodlines, to create a powerful [[Hybrid (Underworld)|hybrid]]. After Kraven flees the mansion because Singe has revealed his cooperation with Lucian, news arrives that Amelia, who was coming to awaken Markus, has been killed by Lycans. Viktor kills Singe and tasks Selene to kill Michael.  While Michael is being held captive, he learns from Lucian that Viktor's daughter, [[Sonja (Underworld)|Sonja]], and Lucian were lovers. Lucian tells Michael that the Lycans were slaves to the vampires. When Viktor learned that his daughter had been impregnated by a Lycan, he killed her to prevent any crossing of the two species, which led to the war. According to Lucian, such a crossing would create a hybrid creature that would be more powerful than both the vampires and Lycans.  Selene arrives with a group of Death Dealers to kill the Lycans and Kraven for his treachery. Kraven shoots Lucian with a newly designed bullet that kills by poisoning a Lycan's bloodstream with [[silver nitrate]]. Selene rescues Michael, who is shot by Kraven. Kraven tells Selene it was Viktor who killed her family. Lucian stabs Kraven in the leg and convinces Selene to bite Michael, transmitting the vampire virus into his bloodstream. Selene complies, and Kraven flees after killing Lucian. Viktor arrives and admits that he killed Selene's family, though he believes she should be grateful as he spared her and made her immortal. He reveals the truth of his love for Sonja – that his choice to have her killed was to protect the vampires and that he must now kill Michael to protect the vampires. Selene eventually kills Viktor with the assistance of Michael, who is now a hybrid. Selene and Michael leave the Lycan lair, now enemies of both species. At the mansion, blood from Singe's corpse seeps into the [[sarcophagus]] of a hibernating elder, Markus, a carrier of the original Corvinus Strain.

The United States of Leland
 The film begins with a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] narrated by Leland P. Fitzgerald, describing how he could not remember the details of the day that he killed an [[Intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] boy named Ryan Pollard. Leland is arrested. Ryan's parents, Harry and Karen, sisters Becky and Julie, and Julie's live-in boyfriend Allen grieve the loss of their loved one. Leland's divorced mother, Marybeth, is desperate to see her son, while his father, famous writer Albert Fitzgerald, discovers his son's fate in a newspaper and returns home to be there for the trial.  While in [[juvenile hall]], Leland is schooled by teacher Pearl Madison, an aspiring writer who is searching for a breakthrough story. Like many others at the detention center, Pearl senses something is different about the emotionally detached Leland, and helps him circumvent the prison rules so he can keep a journal. While his girlfriend is out of town in [[Los Angeles]], Pearl sleeps with a coworker and tells her that he is going to write a book about Leland.  Through his discussions with Pearl, Leland reveals his childhood memories such as his grandmother's funeral and traveling long distances to visit his father. One time, he decided to stay in [[New York (city)|New York]] rather than continue on to see his father. After he could not find a hotel, a kindhearted family, the Calderons, decided to take him in for his stay. He continued to visit the family over the years, and was especially captivated by Mrs. Calderon. The two also discuss Leland's history with Becky, Ryan's sister. He had met her innocently at a [[record store]] and begun regularly walking home with Ryan and her after school. They had grown to love each other, and Leland recalled a time when Becky asked him to promise her "everything's gonna be okay", despite his objections that he had no control over bad things that could happen. As she explained, sometimes it is just nice to hear things one hopes to be true.  Pearl covertly arranges a meeting with Leland's father at his hotel. After he asks for more information on his family's past, Albert realizes Pearl is researching for his book and refuses to let his son be exploited - something of which he is guilty himself. He eventually tells the prison supervisor about Pearl's prohibited meetings with Leland, leading him to be reassigned to another section of the prison.  Leland discovers through Allen that Becky had an affair with a [[drug dealer]] named Kevin who is due to be released from prison. After he gets out of prison, Becky starts to see Kevin again and decides to break up with Leland. In a rare display of emotion, he argues with her, but ultimately realizes the futility of anything he can do or say to change her mind, saying that neither the tears nor the amount of his love - he says he still dreams about her - can change the fact that she does not love him in return. Pearl says he should be angry with her since she betrayed him. Leland replies that he is sad, but not angry.  Pearl begins to realize the implications of his sexual indiscretion through his discussions with Leland, and admits his own failings. Eventually, his girlfriend discovers his tryst and they have a fight over the phone. Meanwhile, Julie decides to break up with Allen and does not want him to go to college with him. Brokenhearted, he holds up an [[auto repair shop]] and allows himself to be arrested in front of Julie. He is sent to the same juvenile hall as Leland, where he steals a knife (from Pearl) and kills Leland in the prison yard as revenge for what he has done to the Pollard family.  Pearl flies to LA to reconcile with his girlfriend and reads Leland's final entries in his journal. On one of his return trips to New York, Leland had discovered that Mrs. Calderon had divorced her husband and that the spark for life that she had before was gone; it is implied Leland and Mrs. Calderon had slept together. Afterwards, Leland writes, he begins noticing a sadness in everyone around him, driving him into a deep [[Clinical depression|depression]]. One day, as he walks Ryan home from school, the boy becomes frustrated with an obstacle on the bike path. Leland helps him off his bike, gives him a hug, and whispers in his ear that "everything is going to be okay".

After her boyfriend, Tommy, leaves her for another girl, she goes to a bar where she sees a talk show segment about Sally Weston, who has written a memoir called ''My Life in the Sky'', and decides to follow her destiny by becoming a [[flight attendant]]. Her first position is at a small, seedy California commuter airline called Sierra, where she works with Sherry, a senior attendant, and also gets an intern herself, named Christine. After working for several months, this success builds up her confidence and encourages her to attend open interviews for Royalty Airlines. She convinces Sherry and Christine to join her at Royalty Airlines. While Christine and Donna get in, Sherry does not, and remains in Sierra Airlines.  After getting the job, Donna puts her heart and soul into the training camp, and, after meeting Weston, she is determined to be assigned to the top route, "Paris, First Class, International". Alas, when the assignments are posted, Donna is shocked and disappointed to discover that, instead of the top route, she has been assigned to a [[Regional airline|commuter]] route in Cleveland. Christine, who had initially struggled with the material and procedures, has inexplicably been assigned the high-priority [[New York City]] route, much to the dismay of Donna.  A few months later, by chance, Donna runs into Christine in Cleveland. Donna knows from previous experience that Christine has the airplane soap from Sally's house during their training sessions, but is still shocked when Christine empties her handbag to reveal all manner of Royalty Air items. Even the smallest theft is strictly prohibited by Royalty Airlines, and could mean termination. Still sure there was some sort of error in her route assignment, Donna turns to Weston for help. Through a course of events, Donna discovers that Christine had switched their test booklets when they were being handed up to their trainer.  With that, Donna realizes that Christine has cheated her way to the top route, wanting success herself but knowing that Donna would do better. When Sally asks to have airline security spy on Christine's flight—to see if she stole any property (a code blue)—Christine gets caught and is fired. Donna gets the chance to re-take her exam and achieves a perfect score, resulting in being assigned a Paris, First Class, International route. However, following her "destiny" means deciding between a boyfriend, Ted, and her career. She chooses the latter.  Though she gets all that she wants—Paris, first class, etc.—Donna realizes that she is still unhappy. She misses Ted terribly, and with Weston's encouragement, she returns to Cleveland to meet him. She does, and after a heartfelt speech to his deaf grandmother, which he overhears, the two reconcile. The film ends with Donna wishing her passengers well as they land in Cleveland, now moving her position from a flight attendant to a pilot.

 Veronica Guerin, a [[crime]] [[reporter]] for the ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'', becomes aware of how much Dublin's [[illegal drug trade]] is encroaching upon the lives of its [[working class]], especially the children, and vows to expose the men responsible.  Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and [[John Traynor (criminal)|John Traynor]], a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord [[John Gilligan (Irish criminal)|John Gilligan]]. To steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests [[Gerry Hutch]], a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues Hutch and discovers he is not involved.  As Guerin nears the truth, she and her family become targets. A bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her. She is then shot in the leg, and her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and is savagely beaten, she becomes more determined to expose him. Rather than press charges, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with the investigation.  On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to parking tickets and speeding penalties that she had ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IR£100. En route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news. She is speaking to her office while stopped at traffic light on the [[Naas Dual Carriageway]] when two men riding a motorcycle pull up beside her. The driver breaks the window of her car and shoots her six times. The two flee and dispose of the bike and gun in a nearby [[canal]].  Guerin is mourned by her family, friends, associates and the country. Her violent death results in the establishment of the [[Criminal Assets Bureau]], and Gilligan, along with several of his henchmen, are tried and sentenced to lengthy [[prison]] terms. The [[epilogue]] states that "Veronica Guerin's writing turned the tide in the drug war. Her murder galvanised Ireland into action. Thousands of people took to the streets in weekly anti-drug marches, which drove the dealers out of Dublin and forced the drug barons underground. Within a week of her death, in an emergency session of the [[Oireachtas|Parliament]], the Government altered the [[Constitution of the Republic of Ireland]] to allow the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|High Court]] to freeze the assets of suspected drug barons."

The wasp flies away and Zoe becomes enraged when she notices that there are remnants of [[Spare ribs|rib]]s around her baby's mouth.

With this money, he hires Clint (Cowen), a professional wedding video director. He sends Clint out to videotape some of his best friends. This includes Julie (Oliver), a naive country girl who is surprised to find out Norman is gay; and Heather (B.), a street-wise, egocentric African American woman who doesn't really care either way. The three were once roommates in New York City; they lived on Gay Street.  Other guests include Norm's Minnesotan lumberjack cousin Sean (Duffy) and his conservative-but-open-minded wife Rachel (Campos,) who is 8 months pregnant, promiscuous stripper Cory (Murphy), Norm's college buddy Syrus (Yarbrough), and opinionated eurotrash DJ Lars (Schlichting). The group ultimately converge in Norm's castle in Los Angeles where pre-wedding festivities unfold.  Crises unfold when the wedding planner Norm has hired discovers he is gay and backs out; when her assistant secretly continues the gig, the planner cancels all of their catering and florists. Additionally it becomes evident to everyone at the wedding that Sky has a female mistress; Cory reveals that Sky is also a gay porn star.  Ultimately, the wedding goes off mostly without a hitch (thanks in part to Norman's obliviousness because he took [[MDMA|ecstasy]]), and Clint edits the video down into a charming (if false) portrayal of a happy wedding.

Dr. Moreli tells him when he opened the portal 30 years ago, it let in the giant Spider Queen, who set out to enslave or eat most of humankind.  Elayna says the "soldiers" (the spider people) used to be normal people, but the Spider Queen's venom makes them completely under her control. Any  survivors are made to show the soldiers where their base camp is, when the others go out and find the camps they are empty and bloodstained. They leave the base, to find the Spider Queen has been watching, they hear gunshots and find Shelly and Ray. The survivors bring them back to the base, and Shelly and Moreli begin to build a new portal.  The lookouts spot "soldiers" in the building and chase them. Dean and Ray stay behind to defend Shelly and Moreli. Dean gets impatient and goes off to help, leaving Ray alone. Dean, Crane and Elayna, meet up and go back for Moreli, but find Ray with a broken leg and alone. The three set out for the Queen's lair, while Ray stays behind to build traps. They find Moreli in the food chamber, but Shelly has been bitten. Shelly grabs Dean's gun and holds it to his head, telling them to go. The four race back to the base, while Shelly comes face to face with the Queen. Shelly tries to shoot her, but she is too far gone. She leads the Queen and her army to the base, and the "soldiers" kill everyone but Crane, who kills all of the army but Shelly and the Queen. Crane collapses, and Moreli leaves the makeshift lab to go out to him. Crane dies in his arms, and the Queen leaps down and kills Moreli.  Shelly enters the lab, turning off the power. Dean tries to get through to him, but fails and ends up killing him. Dean and Elayna work hurriedly on the portal, and they are just about to power it up when the Queen shows up. Dean grabs the last two wires to connect, and he connects them to the Queen. The current starts moving between the two, and the Queen gets electrocuted. The portal opens and Dean and Elayna jump through. The strain on the power system causes it to explode, taking the Queen with it.  Dean and Elayna wake up on a beach, and they share a kiss, just before a large flying animal attacks and presumably eats them, the two having apparently only made it to another alternate world and not home.

She lives with her single mother, Libby above a Chinese Restaurant in [[Chinatown]], [[New York City|New York]]. Believing it is in his best interest, her mother had left Daphne's father seventeen years earlier because of his family's disapproval of their relationship; ultimately, his father's manager threw her out of the house, without Libby having a chance to tell him that she was pregnant with their daughter.  Daphne flies to London to get to know her father, Lord Henry Dashwood, who recently inherited an Earldom but has [[Peerage Act 1963|disclaimed his seat]] in the [[House of Lords]] to run for election to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], hoping eventually to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], with the backing of Alistair Payne, his fiancee's father.  At a hotel, she meets Ian Wallace, a local boy. She notices her father on the television during a news broadcast, and tells Ian that the politician is her father.  When Henry is informed of the existence of the daughter he never knew existed, he embraces the opportunity to connect with her at the urging of his mother Jocelyn. Her appearance causes a controversy that endangers his political ambitions. Daphne tries to win the acceptance of her father's social circle but is repeatedly thwarted by his snobby, gold-digging fiancée, Glynnis Payne, and equally snobby step-daughter-to-be, Clarissa Payne.  Daphne has to ward off the advances of Armistead Stewart, a sleazy upper-class boy whom Clarissa fancies. In the end, Daphne ends up throwing him into the [[River Thames|Thames]] at the [[Henley Regatta]] when he tries to kiss her.  After Daphne's behavior (and Henry's subsequent misbehavior with her) catches the public eye, Henry's political campaign suffers. He reminds her of the Dashwood lineage and asks her to assume a more dignified manner. To please her father and his social circle, she abandons her old style and dons an upper-class sophisticated look, and is noted in the British newspapers.  Due to her changing herself, Ian is disappointed and leaves when they were supposed to go to a concert which Daphne forgot about. During her coming-out party hosted by her father, she overhears Alastair talking to Glynnis about having "got rid of" Daphne's mother seventeen years ago, and how he thought he would have to do the same thing with Daphne. After Daphne tries to confront him, Glynnis grabs Daphne and locks her up. Glynnis then asks the band's lead singer, Ian, to announce the father-daughter dance. Glynnis, knowing that Daphne is locked up, uses this as a ploy to get Henry to dance with Clarissa. Libby rescues Daphne, but it is too late; Daphne witnesses Henry dancing with Clarissa. Daphne rejects her new self because it is not who she is. She returns to America, and restarts working as a waitress. Henry announces in an election meeting that he is no longer going to pursue his political career. On the steps on his way out, he discovers that Alastair knew about Libby's pregnancy. Henry punches Alastair in the face for concealing Daphne's existence. He then breaks off his engagement to Glynnis.  Daphne is serving at a wedding in America, and the father-daughter dance begins. She thinks of Henry and what she left behind, and just then, Henry shows up by boat after a flight from London. After asking what he's doing there, Henry informs Daphne that, while on the plane, he wrote down something that he had to tell her at least two hundred times, but is unable to find the papers. He then says that he loves her for who she is and "wouldn't change one hair on her head". Daphne, overjoyed, accepts his love and instead of calling him Henry, refers to him as "Dad".  She finally gets the father-daughter dance she has been longing for her whole life, while Libby watches. Realizing that he still loves Libby, Henry informs Daphne that he has "a rather large present" for her. Ian shows up and cuts in. As he and Daphne dance, Henry goes to see Libby. He apologizes to her, Libby accepts his apology, and they kiss.  In the epilogue, Glynnis gets married to a wealthy nobleman and Clarissa marries Armistead Stuart (who still has a wandering eye). Alastair becomes a tour guide in London. Libby and Henry are married in a [[Bedouin]] ceremony. This time they make sure it is legal. Daphne gets into [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].

The Whizzard of Ow
 The short begins with a magical battle between two different stereotypes of sorcerers (a short [[Gandalf]]-like wizard that holds a large book of magic in one hand and a staff in the other, and an elegant but sombre [[Doctor Strange]]-like warlock with a black cat on his shoulder) where they zap each other until they kill each other in a final energy blast. Their possessions, however, escape unharmed and fall on Wile E. Coyote, just as he was about to catch Road Runner, causing considerable pain to him (especially the cat, who viciously scratches to his face out of fear). Coyote notices the ACME book of magic and becomes delightfully happy (as his hare-like ears fall off), as he now has a new weapon against the Road Runner. * '''1:''' The first spell that Coyote tries is to turn the black cat into a feral beast. He succeeds, and the cat transforms into a [[black panther]], but unfortunately, his beast proves to be too feral, and it quickly slices his body into strips, deflating Coyote like a balloon. * '''2:''' Coyote buys an ACME [[flying broomstick]] and, after some trial and error, begins to chase the Road Runner through the air. However when he enters a gloomy tunnel, Coyote mistakes his beeps (that were temporarily deeper than normal) with a horn of an approaching truck and suddenly changes his direction to the sky, only to be hit by two meteorites and get his broom "out of gas". Wile E. starts to fall and dials the Acme Flying Broom Customer Service on his phone for help but gets a [[Intercept message|recording]] telling him all operators were busy. After a long drop, Coyote manages to stop his broomstick in mid-air and land safely, only to have the Road Runner scare him from behind with his beeps off a cliff and leaving the poor Coyote to suffer gravity. * '''3:''' In his second spell, Coyote tries to turn himself in a [[Giant (mythology)|giant]], but much to his chagrin, the spell only affects his head, whose weight crushes his own body. * '''4:''' Coyote uses invisible ink to make a bomb transparent and disguise it as a [[crystal ball]] in order to lure an unsuspecting Road Runner to his death. However, the fake crystal ball actually works and the Road Runner sees Coyote's future where he's caught in the middle of a huge explosion...a future that quickly turns into reality when the bomb rolls straight to him. * '''5:''' In his third spell, Coyote learns levitation and uses his classical "seeds trap" to temporarily stop the Road Runner and smash him with a large rock. Unfortunately, the rock doesn't fall under his command, giving enough time for the Road Runner to finish his lunch and leave. After several unsuccessful attempts to make the rock fall, Coyote leaves in disgust, only for the rock to follow and crush him. * '''6:''' In his last spell, Coyote once again tries to [[shapeshifting|shape shift]] the cat into another creature, this time into a Pegasus, to once again chase the Road Runner though the air, but they inadvertently fly through a load of poisonous snakes (prompting the Pegasus to use the Coyote as a stick to get rid of them), and to make matters worse, the Pegasus quickly turns into a [[flying carpet]], and much to Coyote's anguish, they fly straight to a reserve of scorpions and to a field of cacti. The carpet is then turned into a [[monitor lizard]] (who promptly devours his snout), a lawnmower, and then into a great white shark, and he and the Coyote land in a lake where the Coyote is viciously mauled by his familiar.  It turns out that the reason for the cat's uncontrollable transformations was the Road Runner, who found the book of magic and decided to test his powers. He then turns a mailbox into a gracious and beautiful female roadrunner and the two leave, walking and holding "[[wing|hands]]", while the Coyote suffers being shark [[food]].

As the fight between the two was witnessed by several other girls, Jin-sung is now looked down upon by the students, who believe that she intentionally pushed So-hee down out of jealousy. Jin-sung's wish comes true and she gets the spot for the ballet school. Her fellow students throw her a surprise party for it, but still treat her coldly by throwing a cake into her face.

Believing that Jin-sung does not love her as much she does, So-hee states that she want to be with her always and proceeds to crush Jin-sung's stomach with her arms, killing her. The spirit then vanishes.  Some time later, a new girl (whose face is not seen) moves into the dorm room that Jin-sung once occupied. A picture with Jin-sung and So-hee on it is seen on the floor.

He tries to get advice from his friends, who all (besides not being married or in any sort of exclusive relationships of their own) basically tell him to stand firm in his decision if he doesn't feel he's ready. Cheri also has a group of friends however, and they are just as much in support of her opinion that the two should be looking to settle down as Robert's friends are of his. When they all get together to celebrate the baby shower, tensions inevitably flare, and a few unexpected secrets finally come to light, leading to a frothy and mirthful climax.  
Witnesses (film)
 The plot of the movie is centered in the city of [[Karlovac]] in 1992, during the [[Croatian War of Independence]]. The front lines, where Croatian and Serbian forces fight each other, lie near the city. Meanwhile, in the city of Karlovac, a Serbian civilian Vasić is murdered. The story follows the local police officer Barbir ([[Dražen Kühn]]), who tries to solve the murder in spite of ethnic hatred and war revolving nearby.  The film's screenplay is based on [[Jurica Pavičić]]'s 1997 novel ''Alabaster Sheep'' (''Ovce od gipsa''), which was in turn inspired by a real-life case of [[murder of the Zec family]] in Zagreb in 1991.<ref></ref>  Cast
X2 (film)
 At the [[White House]], brainwashed [[Teleportation|teleporting]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] attempts to assassinate the [[President of the United States]] but fails and escapes. Meanwhile, [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in [[Alberta]] for clues to his past, but finds nothing. He returns to [[Professor Xavier]]'s school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using [[Cerebro]]. Xavier and [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] go to question the imprisoned [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] about the attack, while X-Men [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and [[Jean Grey]] retrieve Nightcrawler. Since the Liberty Island incident, Jean has been having premonitions and struggles to concentrate when her powers begin to get increasingly harder for her to control - which is emotionally and mentally affecting her. Meanwhile, military scientist Colonel [[William Stryker]] approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] leads the remaining students to safety while Wolverine, [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Pyro (Marvel Comics)|Pyro]] escape, and Stryker's assistant [[Lady Deathstrike|Yuriko Oyama]] captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack Wolverine confronts Stryker, who knows him by name.  The shape-shifting [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] gains information about Magneto's prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics for a second Cerebro. Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents in [[Boston]] and meet up with Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler. The [[Blackbird (comics)|X-Jet]] is attacked by fighter jets en route back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it, and Xavier, to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker's son, Jason, is a mutant with mind-controlling powers, which Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason's powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler's attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier's mansion. Magneto also tells Wolverine that Stryker was the man who grafted his [[adamantium]] skeleton onto his bones. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake.  The mutants infiltrate Stryker's base and Magneto and Mystique go to disable Cerebro before the brainwashed Xavier can activate it. Storm and Nightcrawler rescue the captured students, and Jean fights a mind-controlled Cyclops; their battle frees Cyclops but damages the dam, which begins to rupture. Wolverine finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting lab and remembers it as where he received his adamantium skeleton. Wolverine fights and kills Yuriko, then chases Stryker to a helicopter pad and chains him to the helicopter's wheel. Magneto stops Cerebro and, using Mystique impersonating Stryker to command Jason, has Xavier redirect its powers on normal humans. The two subsequently use Stryker's helicopter to escape, accompanied by Pyro who has been swayed to Magneto's views. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason's concentration and free Xavier from his control.  The X-Men flee the dam as water engulfs it, but the damaged X-Jet struggles to take flight. Jean sneaks off the jet and telepathically wishes the team goodbye. She holds back the water and raises the jet above it as flames erupt from her body, until she lets go and allows the flood to crash down upon her; presumably killing her. The X-Men give the president Stryker's files, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Wolverine remember Jean, and Xavier begins to hold a class.  The film ends with a voice-over narration from Jean accompanied by the flooded Alkali Lake and a [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]]-like shape rising towards the surface of the water.  
Wrong Turn
 College students Rich Stoker and Halley Smith are [[rock climbing]] in a remote forest of [[West Virginia]]. When Rich reaches the top, he is suddenly murdered before he can help Halley up. Someone then begins to yank her up the cliff so she cuts the rope and falls. She attempts to escape but gets pulled back into the woods, screaming.  Medical student Chris Flynn ([[Desmond Harrington]]) drives through the mountains of West Virginia on his way to a business meeting. He stops at a gas station to ask directions and the elderly man tells Chris to go down Bear Mountain Road. He collides with a stopped car whose tires have been punctured. The car belongs to a group of college students on a camping trip: Jessie ([[Eliza Dushku]]), Carly ([[Emmanuelle Chriqui]]), Scott ([[Jeremy Sisto]]), Evan ([[Kevin Zegers]]) and Francine ([[Lindy Booth]]).  Evan and Francine stay to watch the cars as the others go to find help. Both of them are murdered. The others find an isolated cabin and go inside to use the phone. They are horrified to find human body parts in the house and attempt to escape. However, they are forced to hide inside when the family returns home. Three disfigured [[Cannibalism|cannibalistic]] mountain men "Three Finger" ([[Julian Richings]]), "Saw Tooth" ([[Garry Robbins]]) and "One Eye" enter the cabin with Francine's dead body. The four watch in horror as her body is dismembered and eaten.  After the cannibals fall asleep, the group attempts to escape. However, Saw Tooth awakens and chases them through the forest. The group run into a clearing where they find hundreds of cars that belonged to previous victims. Chris is shot in the leg by Saw Tooth but survives; Saw Tooth kills Scott.  Chris, Jessie and Carly stumble upon an old watchtower and find a radio inside, which they use to call for help. They get no response. Later, the cannibals arrive. The radio starts responding to their call, alerting the cannibals. Unable to get inside, they set the tower on fire to burn the group alive, but they escape by jumping out of the window. Three Finger catches Carly and decapitates her. Chris and Jessie hide in a cave until the morning. The cannibals find them, pushing Chris down the hill and taking Jessie back to their cabin. Chris survives the fall and meets a police officer, but the officer is shot in the eye with an arrow.   Chris hitches a ride underneath the truck as it is driven back to the cabin by Saw Tooth. Jessie is tied to a bed and gagged. Chris drives through the building and runs into One Eye. He unties Jessie and they fight the cannibals together. They escape and Chris kills the cannibals by blowing up their cabin. The pair drive out of the forest with the cannibals' pickup truck.  The credits are interrupted by a scene showing a deputy sheriff investigating the remains of the destroyed cabin. Three Finger, who survived the explosion, rises to attack the deputy.  
Wonderland (2003 film)
 ===John Holmes and Dawn Schiller=== The girlfriend of [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]], Dawn Schiller, is on the streets and picked up by a [[holy roller]] after Holmes leaves Schiller in a hotel room. Schiller eventually calls Holmes to come and get her. Holmes arrives at the apartment, and they have sex and snort cocaine in the bathroom. The next morning, while in a motel room, Dawn sees a newscast that states four people were murdered at a rowhouse on Wonderland Avenue, the same one she had earlier been at with Holmes. The story eventually moves on to two city detectives investigating the crime, Sam Nico and Louis Cruz, and their contact with Holmes. Another officer, Billy Ward, intervenes in the investigation.  ===David Lind's story=== The next major character introduced is [[Wonderland Gang#David Lind|David Lind]]. He hears of his friends' murders at Wonderland and soon discovers his girlfriend was there. While at the crime scene, he is picked up by Nico and Cruz. Through Lind's story (told in [[Flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s), we are introduced to some of the people who partied at Wonderland. These people, known as the [[Wonderland Gang]], included Ron Launius and his wife Susan, Billy Deverell, Lind's 22-year-old girlfriend Barbara Richardson, and Joy Miller. Ron has a fondness for antique guns and frequently shows them off. When he learns that Holmes knows notorious gangster [[Eddie Nash]], he gives Holmes a pair of stolen antique guns to take to Nash, so that Nash can fence them and the Wonderland Gang can split the loot. (Nash had befriended Holmes because of Holmes' notoriety as the porn film phenomenon [[Johnny Wadd]].) Holmes takes the guns to Nash, but Nash says the guns are too rare to be sold, as they would be recognized right away and everyone involved would be apprehended. Rather than return the guns to Holmes, Nash keeps them for himself. Attempting to get back in the gang's good graces, Holmes suggests robbing Nash's home. Ron Launius is reluctant to go along with the robbery at first, but after Holmes gives him a rundown of what's there, he is eager to participate. Holmes volunteers to draw them a map to plan the robbery, since he has visited Nash's house frequently. Holmes then visits Nash to buy drugs, and on the way out leaves the kitchen door unlocked to give the Wonderland gang easy access.  ===The robbery of Eddie Nash=== The next morning, Ron Launius, Lind, and Deverell carry out the robbery, while wheel-man Tracy McCourt waits outside in a car, serving as lookout. Neither Holmes nor any of the women are present when the robbery occurs. The [[Wonderland Gang]] gains access through the unlocked kitchen door and robs Nash at gunpoint. Lind [[Accidental discharge|accidentally fires]] his gun, wounding Nash's bodyguard, Greg Diles. The gang hurls racial epithets at Nash and Diles and walks away with over one million dollars in cash, jewels, and drugs. They bring their loot back to the Wonderland apartment to divide everything up. Holmes is unhappy with the cut he is given, even though he did not take part in the robbery and he's in debt to the gang.  Nash discovers Holmes was involved in the robbery, he has Holmes beaten and finds Holmes' [[Address book#Little black book|little black book]]. He tells Holmes he will kill every person listed in the book, starting with Holmes' mother, if Holmes does not give up the men who robbed Nash.  ===July 1, 1981=== The retaliation for the robbery is swift and fatal. On July 1, 1981, a group of Nash's henchmen (including Holmes), led by Diles, gains access to the apartment at Wonderland Avenue. Ron Launius, Deverell, Richardson, and Miller are all brutally beaten to death with striated lead pipes. Diles compels Holmes to deliver blows to Launius. Susan Launius is beaten but survives, and is questioned by Nico and Cruz in her hospital bed. She tells them (in a near comatose state) that she does not remember anything, only shadows. Lind is not present during the attacks.

One day, as they are playing alongside the railroad tracks, they find a dead body. With him they find a gun with one bullet and a video camera. Sipho takes the gun and Madiba takes the camera, which he puts inside a wooden toy camera to make it seem a not-working toy. Sipho seems to harmlessly joke about the gun at first, but begins spending more time in Cape Town, robbing parking meters and paying for glue to sniff. He eventually starts living in abandoned places in Cape Town with a group of thugs.  Madiba films the world around him, finding beauty in both Khayelitsha and Cape Town. He tries many filming techniques and is skilled, but finds his videos very personal and does not normally let other people see them.

Sipho uses the gun to rob people. Madiba disapproves and does not want any of the stolen money, but still considers him his friend. One of Sipho's robberies goes wrong and he is killed. In the end Madiba and Estelle run off and take a train together.

Young Adam (film)
 The film is set in [[Scotland]] in 1954. Shiftless young drifter Joe Taylor works on a [[barge]] which operates from [[Glasgow]], on the [[River Clyde]], along the [[Forth and Clyde Canal|Forth and Clyde]] and [[Union Canal (Scotland)|Union Canal]]s to [[Edinburgh]]. He shares the cramped on-board living quarters with its operators, Les and Ella Gault, and their young son Jim. One day Joe and Les pull the body of a young woman, naked except for a [[petticoat]], from the water. Via [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s, we learn Joe knew her, and scenes involving his relationship with office worker Cathie Dimly are juxtaposed with those set in the present time.  After finding Cathie's body, Joe and Les go to a local pub to play darts. Joe leaves Les behind and returns to the barge, where Ella succumbs to his advances. Not wanting to disturb the sleeping Jim, the two engage in sex on the [[towpath]]. It proves to be the first of many such encounters they enjoy whenever they can find a few moments away from Les.  In the past, Joe meets Cathie on a beach and the two soon are living together. He aspires to be a writer and spends his days banging on a battered [[typewriter]] while she works to support them. Joe begins to suffer from chronic [[writer's block]] and Cathie, unhappy with his lack of productivity, accuses him of taking advantage of her. He packs his meager belongings and moves out. After tossing his typewriter in a canal, he meets Les, who offers him a job on the barge.  Les eventually becomes aware of Ella and Joe's affair and moves out of the barge, which belongs to her, and Ella and Joe drift into a more serious relationship. When she receives word her brother-in-law has died, she and Joe visit her sister Gwen and invite her to spend a couple of weeks with them. One evening, on the pretext Gwen would like to see a movie, she and Joe leave the barge and go to a pub. After a few drinks, the two have sex in an alleyway.  Eventually, Ella's desire to settle in the suburbs and her no-nonsense supervision of the barge's daily commercial activities put a damper on the once-unbridled passion in her relationship with Joe, and he packs and leaves.  In the past, Joe and Cathie reunite on the waterfront and have sex beneath a parked truck. She reveals she is two months pregnant with his child, and when Joe nonchalantly begins to walk away, she runs after him, trips, and falls into the water while dressed only in her petticoat. Joe makes no move to rescue her and, when she fails to surface, he panics and runs away.  Past and present converge. Daniel Gordon, a plumber whom Cathie was casually seeing, is arrested and tried for her murder, and Joe spends a few days in the courtroom listening to testimony. Guilt-stricken, he writes an anonymous note absolving Daniel of the crime and leaves it where a courthouse guard can find it. It has no effect on the proceedings, and Daniel is found [[Guilty (law)|guilty]] and sentenced to hang. Unwilling to risk his life, Joe opts not to confess how Cathie really died and sets off for parts unknown.

Yakada Pihatu
    
Zero Day (film)
 Andre Kriegman (based on Eric Harris) and Calvin Gabriel (based on Dylan Klebold) announce their intention to attack their high school, calling their plan "Zero Day". They keep a video diary on the camera, carefully hiding it from their friends and families. The majority of the film is portrayed through their video filming, and shows them planning, preparing, and explaining some of their motives.  Other scenes show the two attending Andre's birthday party, egging the house of someone they dislike, and Cal going to the prom while Andre works at a pizza place. In one video entry, Cal notes the origin of the name "Zero Day": Cal and Andre originally planned to attack on the first day on which the temperature dropped to zero degrees after they had finished their preparations. This plan soon proved impractical, and they set May 1, 2001 as the new date. Wanting their attack to have a memorable name, they agreed to keep the original title.  The second to last scene of the movie show the boys arriving at school on May 1 and preparing their plan and weapons in Andre's car. Andre says that he could never have carried out Zero Day without Cal's help, a sentiment Cal echoes. They run into the school, armed with three pistols, an [[M1 carbine]], and a 12-gauge [[pump-action shotgun]], all stolen from Andre's father and cousin. The shooting is shown through the viewpoint of security cameras very similar to [[Columbine High School massacre]]'s view. The dialogue is heard via the cellphone of a student who is shot and killed. Shooting at anyone they see, Andre and Cal eventually see law enforcement arriving in force after sixteen minutes of shooting. After arguing over whether to engage the police in gunfire, the pair decide to count to three and shoot themselves.  The next scene is set on May 10, nine days after the shooting. A group of youths film themselves going to a park where memorial crosses are standing. They say that Andre and Cal killed twelve students and themselves. Finding crosses for the pair, they set them on fire and run back to their cars. The last scene shows the two crosses burning.  
Želary
  In the 1940s [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]], Eliška is a nurse who works alongside her lover, Richard, a respected surgeon.  They are part of an underground network that has formed to help those in danger of persecution from the Nazis.  Eliška acts as a messenger.  One night, Richard responds to an emergency call to a patient needing a risky operation.  Because she has the same blood type, Eliška gives blood for the transfusion.  Days later, she arrives at Richard's apartment to find their friend, Slávek, with news that the Gestapo has apprehended two of their members, putting everyone at risk of discovery.   Eliška is told that Richard has emigrated, leaving papers for her to assume a new identity.  Slávek says that she must leave the city with a man named Joza - the patient who had received the transfusion.  Seeing no alternative, Eliška - now Hana - leaves for the countryside.  As a mountain-dweller, Joza appears uncouth and disheveled, but he is kind and considerate to her plight.  He provides her with temporary refuge in a small village, where she quickly becomes the object of curiosity.  Some, such as Teacher Tkáč the schoolmaster, are xenophobic and suspicious. The Nazis have killed anyone harbouring enemies. Eliška tries to leave, but the village doctor reveals that the Nazis have executed Slávek.  He tells her that to remain safe, she must marry Joza and live with him in the mountain village of Želary.  Initially, Eliška is reluctant. Joza takes her to their new home, a small cottage with no electricity, dirt floor, and a fly-infested outhouse.  On the day of their wedding, Eliška rebels, but relents upon Joza's explanation that the villagers will not accept a strange, single woman.  So Eliška agrees, and the two are married.  At the wedding, she meets most of Želary's inhabitants.  Helenka is a young girl who lives near Joza and Eliška with her mother, Žeňa.  Her best friend is Lipka, a boy whom the villagers treat as an outcast, but who is actually homeless due to his step-father Michal's dislike of him.  He survives through the goodwill of Žeňa, Lucka the village midwife, and Old Goreik, an elderly gentleman who lives with his daughter-in-law, Marie, a victim of spousal abuse.  Eliška seems ill-suited to rural life.  She finds the villagers' behavior raucous and crude, and is particularly repulsed by Michal, the drunk, who makes unwanted advances.  As time passes, Joza's patience and Žeňa's gentle guidance help her to assimilate.  Despite this, Eliška remains wary of her husband, until one evening when she breaks their only lamp and fears a beating.  On the contrary, Joza is comforting and gives her a gift: a stack of books that she may like.  One day, he takes her to his mother's grave and Eliška is moved by the love and kindness he feels.  Joza falls in love with Eliška and she with him, leading to the consummation of their marriage.  Years pass and Eliška - called Hanula by the villagers and Hanulka by Joza - bears witness to a number of incidents.  The Nazis, though scarce in Želary, kill an entire family for harbouring partisans, and then murder an innocent man in front of everyone.  Eliška fears that the Gestapo will find her.  Michal attempts to rape her at the saw mill.  Helenka witnesses the attack and alerts Joza, who beats Michal and breaks his arm. His parents, the Kutinas, then force Michal's pregnant wife and Lipka's mother, Aninka, to do all the farm work, which leads to her miscarrying. Lipka alerts Eliška, Lucka, and Žeňa, but it is too late. Aninka's death destroys Michal's reputation and redeems Lipka in the eyes of the villagers.  By the spring of 1945, Eliška is a nurse again, and learns the art of herbal healing from Lucka. The old woman divulges that Marie and her father-in-law, Old Goreik, are expecting a child. Following the birth, soldiers from the Red Army arrive with news that the war is over. After a night of celebration, Joza reminds Eliška that she is free to leave (their marriage being technically invalid). Eliška replies that she wants to stay with him always, and falls asleep on the mountain in Joza's arms.  Young Goreik, furious over his father's relationship with his wife, arrives at Old Goreik's home with a drunken soldier who he persuades to rape Marie.  Old Goreik arrives and shoots his son, as well as the would-be rapist, but the latter's brother arrives and shoots him. Intoxicated, the soldiers interpret the killing as the act of fascists and shoot at the villagers.  With help from Lipka, many escape by crossing a swamp towards an old saw mill, where Lucka and Eliška tend to the wounded. Joza races back and forth between the haven and the village, and rescues several people - including Michal. Meanwhile, the soldiers kill the village priest and rape Žeňa.  Vojta, a farmhand, comes to her aid and Joza goes back to rescue him. The next morning, they arrive at the saw mill and find soldiers heading in the same direction.  The villagers are relieved, but Joza collapses (Vojta having shot him earlier after mistaking him for the enemy). Devastated, Eliška kneels beside Joza's lifeless body and weeps.  Years later, Želary is virtually abandoned due to modernisation of the town below.  Eliška, now with Richard, returns to visit the mountains and the cottage that she had shared with Joza. Lucka emerges from the ruins and is shocked to see Hanula, but remembers that "nothing disappears off the mountain, there’s always tracks".  Astounded, Eliška asks if it is possible that Lucka is still alive, to which Lucka responds, "I'm none too sure.  I'm none too sure at all." On the top of the mountain, the women laugh.  
Yu Ming Is Ainm Dom
 Bored with his life in [[China]], [[wiktionary:shopworker|shopworker]] Yu Ming ([[Diyu Daniel Wu (actor)|Diyu Daniel Wu]]) decides to visit a random country and picks Ireland by spinning a [[globe]]. He goes to the library, where an atlas informs him that the official language of Ireland is "[[Irish language|Gaelic]]". Consequently, he learns and becomes perfectly fluent in Irish before his trip.  The film follows his adventures in trying to be understood in [[Dublin]], where most of the population has little or no grasp of the language. For example, when he arrives at a Dublin [[hostel]], Yu Ming says, "''Ba mhaith liom leaba anseo''" ("I would like a bed here"). The receptionist, who speaks with an [[Australian English|Australian accent]], assumes that Yu Ming is speaking [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and asks an Asian co-worker, Enke, to help translate. Enke says, "I am Mongolian."  Yu Ming then heads to a bar in order to seek work and again his Irish lets him down. He asks the barman, "''Tá mé ag lorg obair''" ("I am looking for work") and the barman stares blankly at him, not understanding a word. An elderly Irish-speaker ([[Frank Kelly|Kelly]]) at the end of the bar listens in awe at the Asian man speaking his language fluently, and he invites him for a drink and explains the misunderstanding.  Yu Ming is later shown working as a bartender in the [[Gaeltacht]] (Irish-speaking) area of [[Connemara]].  A phrase that recurs throughout the film is "''An bhfuil tusa ag labhairt liomsa?''" ([[Taxi Driver#"You talkin' to me?"|"Are you talking to me?"]]).  
Zatōichi (2003 film)
 The film's plot follows a traditional theme, with Zatoichi (a blind swordsman) coming to the defense of townspeople caught up in a local [[yakuza]] [[gang|gang war]] and being forced to pay excessive amounts of [[protection money]]. Meanwhile, Zatoichi befriends a local farmer and her gambler nephew and eventually offers his assistance to two [[geisha]] siblings (one of whom is actually a man) who are seeking revenge for the murder of their parents. The siblings are the only survivors of a robbery and massacre that was carried out on their family estate ten years ago. They soon discover the people responsible for the murders are the same yakuza wreaking havoc on the small town.  After slicing his way through an army of henchmen with his sword, Zatoichi defeats the yakuza's bodyguard, a powerful [[ronin]], in a duel. Zatoichi later wanders into town and confronts the yakuza bosses, killing the second-in-command and blinding the elderly yakuza boss (who had been masquerading as a bumbling old waiter up until this point) after surprising him by opening his eyes. The film ends with a dance number led by noted Japanese [[tap dance]] troupe ''The Stripes'', and Zatoichi walking down a trail and tripping over a rock, saying "Even with my eyes wide open, I can't see anything."  
The Young Black Stallion
 The film follows the adventures of Shetan, a young black Arabian colt. After a band of robbers separates a young Arabian girl named Neera ([[imdbname:1173326|Biana G. Tamini]]) from her father, she finds herself alone in the desert. Before too long, a mysterious black colt comes to her rescue. The two quickly form a special bond, and the horse returns Neera to her grandfather. Once Neera is back home, the stallion disappears.  Neera greets her grandfather Ben Ishak ([[Richard Romanus]]) and her cousin Aden (Patrick Elyas) eagerly, but is disappointed and upset when she find out that her grandfather's horse breeding days are over. Ben Ishak informs Neera that because of the shootings in the desert, his fields are ruined, and he can no longer afford to keep any of his horses. He kept an old plow-horse, Abha, and set his most precious mare Jinah free. We find out later that Jinah was Shetan's mother.  A year passes, but the black stallion does not return. Neera’s grandfather tells her that the horse was probably nothing more than a product of her imagination. But Neera knows better. She thinks the stallion is the lost horse of the desert, a legend born of the sands and sired by the night sky. Then, one night, the colt appears again. In an attempt to help her grandfather start a breeding farm again, Neera joins a grueling cross-country race against the finest horses of Arabia for a purse of the most exceptional Arabian mares. Shetan, the black stallion, is trained, and Neera rides him in the competition to restore her grandfather's money and respect. In the end, Neera wins, and Shetan is reunited with his mother.
