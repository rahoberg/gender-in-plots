4.3.2.1.
 The story focuses on four 19-year-old friends: Joanne, Cassandra, Shannon and Kerrys. They all meet one other at a diner, where they see Dillon and Smoothy. Unbeknownst to Dillon, Shannon has a crush on him. As the police turn up, Dillon and Smoothy run off and Dillon accidentally drops a stolen diamond into Cassandra's bag. The four girls then walk out and go their separate ways home.  First, the story focuses on Shannon: she walks into her home just as her mother is leaving her father. She loses her temper and runs away, going to Jo's home, who has to rush to work, telling her she does not have time to talk. Jo calls Shannon over to the supermarket where she works, but tells her to leave as soon as she arrives. When she refuses, Dillon kisses Jo, upsetting Shannon, whom he asked out earlier in the day, so she grabs a Pringles tube from the shop and runs away.  After getting drunk at a bar, she goes to a tunnel where she sprays graffiti on the wall, is attacked by a gang and then taken in by Kelly, who saved her. Shannon realizes that Kelly seems to be looking for the Pringles. This is later confirmed when she finds out that she is searching for "15 diamonds". One is already in Cassandra's bag and the rest are in the can that fell out of Shannon's bag in the tunnel. She escapes by knocking Kelly out with the bathroom door. She finds the diamonds by going back to where she was attacked, and leaves a message informing Jo about them. Later, Shannon tracks down her mother and accuses her of not caring about her, especially when she forced her to get an abortion. Her story ends with her holding the diamonds above a bridge, suggesting she is about to commit suicide. Jo, Cassandra and Kerrys appear to threaten Shannon into handing the diamonds over.  Second, the story moves onto Cassandra, who visits New York City to meet up with Brett, whom she has met on the internet and audition for a piano school. She has sex with Brett and in the morning finds all her possessions gone except for her handbag, which contains a diamond. She also finds a letter that Shannon has been looking for, which was written by her mother explaining why she left. She mails it to Kerrys' house to deliver it to Shannon.  She goes to Brett's house to find that Brett is a stalker who hacked into Cassandra's computer, taking videos of her. When the fake Brett comes, she knocks him out and erases the footage and proceeds to take photos of his genitals as revenge but he escapes and chases her down the street where she is rescued by a black woman and her family, who do not take kindly to Brett's racist comments. Cassandra forces her way into an impromptu audition with Jago Larofsky and wins a place at his school. She then leaves to go home to London, telling Jo she knows where Shannon is.  Third, the story of Kerrys is explored. After witnessing her brother Manuel receive a package with instructions from Dillon and Smoothy, Kerrys and her girlfriend Jas break into Cassandra's flat and stay there for the weekend. Manuel locks them in the panic room, returns the package to Dillon and Smoothy as instructed and throws a party. When the two girls escape from the panic room, they angrily force everyone out of the flat. Kerrys goes home and finds Shannon's mother's letter that Cassandra had sent her. After making amends with her father, she steals Manuel's new car to find Shannon and stuffs him into the trunk, but when he tries to attack her, she crashes the car into Jo's shop.  Fourth, Jo, who works at a 24-hour supermarket with Angelo, finds that her new manager Tee is in town, and begins to become suspicious of his intentions. It later emerges that Tee has been working with Dillon and Smoothy to deliver the diamonds, but one is missing. Tee asks Dillon and Smoothy to come over to the supermarket. Dillon and Smoothy come to get the money, when they find that Tee has betrayed them, keeping the money for himself and they hold up the store in retaliation.  When Shannon arrives, Jo tries to make her leave and Dillon kisses Jo, whom unseen to Shannon, is at gunpoint. Shannon leaves, stealing a tube of Pringles, and Dillon and Smoothy escape, leaving Tee with the 14 diamonds, which Tee had hidden in the tube of Pringles that Shannon stole. The next day, Jo realizes that Shannon has the diamonds, and when Tee is about to be shot by Kelly, Jo rescues him before Kerrys crashes Manuel's car into the shop. Jo helps Kerrys escape and leaves a note and a DVD implicating Tee, but when he tries to run, Angelo attacks him and Tee is then arrested by the police.  Cassandra returns with the last diamond. She meets Jo and Kerrys and they go to find Shannon. They talk her down and give her the letter, comforting her. They put the 15 diamonds together, give them to the police and fly to New York City with Kelly also on the plane.

13 (2010 film)
 Vincent "Vince" Ferro overhears people talking about a dead man who was going to start a well-paid job. Ferro, in need of money, steals an envelope containing the instructions for the job. He arrives at an event in a secluded place. He is ordered to strip, and his boot heels are cut off, in order to check for surveillance equipment. The organizers accept him for the job instead of the dead man. The job is participation in a series of [[Russian roulette]] games. There are several participants, identified by number. In each round, the participants have to spin the cylinder of their [[revolver]], and shoot when the light of a special light bulb is switched on. The event is organized for the enjoyment of rich spectators, one of these spectators being Jasper Bagges, who places bets on who will survive. Bagges bets on his brother Ronald, who was brought from the mental institution.  In the first round, the participants each get one bullet in their revolver, they are arranged into a circle, and each has to aim his revolver at the man in front of him. Ferro tries to back out, but he is forced to participate. As #13, he survives the first round and fires his gun only after being threatened with death. In the second round, in which two bullets are placed in each gun, Ferro survives only because the man behind him is killed before he could fire. In the third round, with three bullets in each gun, Ferro again survives, along with four other men. Ferro is one of two survivors randomly chosen to participate in a duel. The three others are finished and get a large sum of money. One of them, Patrick Jefferson, who was brought from prison to compete, is surprised that he is free to go, and he is escorted out by Jimmy, one of the employees. Jimmy then tries to kill Jefferson, attempting to steal a map Jefferson has, leading to money he has stashed from a robbery. Another employee catches Jimmy in the act, and demands that he stop, insisting that nobody is allowed to harm the surviving players. Jefferson collects his belongings and leaves.  Against the odds, Ferro wins the duel and gets $1,850,000 (USD). He also learns that his opponent won his last 3 duels. He collects his winnings and sneaks away from the mansion, arriving at a train station. When he spots police closing in on him, he stashes his winnings in a garbage can. After being interrogated by the police, he retrieves the money and sends it to his family, via registered mail, and buys a toy for his sister's birthday. However, on the way home, he is shot by Jasper, partly in revenge for Ferro having killed Ronald, and partly to steal the money, as he thinks Ferro still has the money with him. Jasper escapes with the money bag, not knowing that it only contains the toy.

13 Assassins (2010 film)
 In 1844 of the [[Edo period]], as the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] is in decline, Lord [[Matsudaira Naritsugu]] of [[Akashi Domain|Akashi]] rapes, tortures, and murders his citizens at will. He is shielded because the [[Shogun]] is his half-brother. Sir [[Doi Toshitsura]], the Shogun's Justice, realizes that the situation will escalate after Naritsugu ascends to a higher political position. After a wronged party publicly commits ''[[seppuku]]'' as a way of showing disdain for Lord Naritsugu, SirDoi seeks out a trusted older samurai, Shimada Shinzaemon, who served under the former shogun, and secretly hires him to assassinate Naritsugu. However, Naritsugu's loyal retainers, led by Hanbei, an old contemporary of Shinzaemon, learn of the plot by spying on Doi's meetings.  Shinzaemon gathers eleven more trusted samurai including Shinzaemon's nephew, Shinrokurō, who together plan to ambush Naritsugu on his [[Sankin-kōtai|official journey]] from [[Edo]] to his lands in Akashi. Just before they leave, Hanbei arrives and warns his old colleague that he will suffer grave consequences if he tries to kill Naritsugu.  The group, with the legal authority and financial assistance of SirDoi, buy the help of the town of [[Ochiai, Okayama|Ochiai]] in order to create a trap. They also enlist the help of Makino, a minor lord whose daughter-in-law was raped and son murdered by Naritsugu. With troops, Makino blocks the official highway, forcing Naritsugu to head into town and the trap. During the assassins' own journey to the town, they are attacked by ''[[ronin]]'' who have been paid off by Hanbei to kill the plotters. The group decides to head through the mountains but end up getting lost. In the process they encounter a hunter named Kiga Koyata who becomes their guide; Shinzaemon eventually recruits him as the thirteenth assassin.  The town is converted into an elaborate maze of booby traps and camouflaged fortifications. When Naritsugu and his retinue arrive their numbers have been swelled with additional troops. The thirteen assassins are no longer facing seventy men-at-arms; now they face two hundred. A lengthy battle follows, with Naritsugu and his guards trapped inside the village and attacked on all sides by arrows, explosives, knives, and swords—with the exception of Koyata, who fights with rocks in slings. In the midst of this carnage, the deranged noble Naritsugu is elated. He tells Hanbei that when he ascends to the Shogun's council he will bring back the wars of the [[Sengoku period]].  The assassins are killed, but not before they inflict heavy damage on the Akashi forces. Eventually, Naritsugu and Hanbei are cornered by Shinzaemon and Shinrokurō. After Shinzaemon kills Hanbei, Naritsugu kicks his loyal retainer's head away, insulting the older samurai. Contemptuously, Naritsugu announces that both the people and the samurai have only one purpose and that is to serve their lords. Shinzaemon counters by telling Naritsugu that lords cannot live without the support of the people and that, if a lord abuses his power, the people will always rise against him. Naritsugu and Shinzaemon mortally wound each other. As the lord crawls away in mud crying and experiencing fear and pain for the first time, he thanks Shinzaemon for showing him excitement before Shinzaemon chops his head off.  After Shinzaemon dies, Shinrokurō wanders through the carnage. He meets the hunter Koyata, who has made a miraculous recovery after being stabbed in the neck by Naritsugu. The two then make their separate ways out of the town. An [[epilogue]] states that the Shogun and his government covered up what really occurred, announcing that Naritsugu died of illness on the journey back to his lands. Twenty-three years later, the Tokugawa Shogunate would be overthrown with the [[Meiji Restoration]].

30 Days of Night: Dark Days
 A year after the Alaskan town of Barrow's population was decimated by vampires during its annual month-long [[polar night]], [[Stella Oleson]] ([[Kiele Sanchez]]) travels the world trying to convince others that vampires exist.  She is fully aware of the risk to her life that her work could bring, but does not care due to her grief over the death of her husband, Eben.  Following instructions from a mysterious individual named Dane, she travels to [[Los Angeles]] to give a lecture on the existence of vampires. Aware that vampires are in attendance when she speaks, she activates overhead [[ultraviolet]] lamps that incinerate several of the vampires in the audience, in front of the humans. She is quickly arrested and harassed by Agent Norris, who she learns is one of the human followers of the vampires, charged with keeping their activities covered up. After her release from custody, she returns to her hotel to find Paul ([[Rhys Coiro]]), Amber ([[Diora Baird]]) and Todd ([[Harold Perrineau]]), sent by Dane to recruit her to hunt the vampire queen, Lilith. As Lilith is responsible for the vampires' every move and for keeping them hidden, the hunters are convinced that once she is eliminated, the vampires will fall into dormancy. When Stella learns that Lilith was responsible for the slaughter at Barrow, she agrees to meet Dane ([[Ben Cotton]]), and is shocked to discover that he too is a vampire. Due to a superficially inflicted wound, he has maintained a grasp of humanity, only drinking blood from packaged hospital stocks he keeps. Stella hesitates to join a plan to attack a vampire nest, but Paul eventually convinces her, revealing that vampires were responsible for his daughter's death and the resulting divorce from his wife.  The following day, the four hunters enter a vampire nest, only to be ambushed by a group of them. During their attempt to flee, Todd is bitten. After the four lock themselves in a cellar, Todd turns into a vampire. When Paul hesitates to act against his friend, Stella kills him by smashing in his head with a cinder block. The trio decide to wait for nightfall, when the vampires leave to feed, in order to make their escape. After night falls, Dane comes and frees them. On their way out, they capture a vampire and interrogate him with the ultraviolet lamps, eventually following him back to another nest. They invade the nest and rescue Jennifer, a captive being used as a feeding station. Jennifer's knowledge of Lilith's lair being aboard a ship in the bay allows the hunters to plan an attack on Lilith directly. Returning to Dane's place, Stella and Paul become intimate.  Meanwhile, Lilith ([[Mia Kirshner]]) decides that Agent Norris should prove his worth to become a vampire (in order to cure the cancer he has been suffering from). He bites the neck of a captive girl, Stacey ([[Katharine Isabelle]]), drinking her blood until dead. Satisfied, Lilith turns him to hunt Stella and the others.  Norris kills Dane and the others flee with Jennifer to a boat yard where Jennifer points out the boat that the vampires are set to sail to Alaska in for another 30-day feeding period. After telling Jennifer to leave, the three hunters stow away on the ship where they discover that they can be resurrected after death if they are fed human blood. At gunpoint, they confront the human captain who says he is cooperating because the vampires had threatened his family. Amber is suddenly pulled away from behind, causing her gun to fire and kill the captain. Stella and Paul are too late to save her from being eaten and are quickly captured by Norris and Lilith who orders that they be bled dry. Stella manages to free herself when they are alone with Norris and kills him, but they are subsequently attacked by Lilith when attempting to sabotage the ship and Paul is killed. After being outmatched in hand-to-hand combat, Stella hides from Lilith and when the queen comes looking for her, Stella emerges from her tub of blood and manages to decapitate her. The other vampires appear, but seeing that she killed Lilith, they quietly stand aside and let her pass without a fight, and she returns to Barrow.  Stella digs up Eben's grave and recovers his body to feed him her own blood. It appears not to work and she lies down slowly dying from blood loss. After a time, she sees Eben has returned to his former health and she stands to greet him with a hug. As they embrace, Eben pulls back her shoulder and his sharp teeth come down on her neck before the screen goes dark.  
14 Blades
 During the late [[Ming Dynasty]], the imperial court is plagued by corruption and the reigning emperor is incompetent. The [[Jinyiwei]] are the government's secret police, orphans trained in cruel clandestine combat since childhood to produce the strongest martial artists. The Jinyiwei are in charge of conducting missions to ensure peace and stability within the empire. They have the authority to prosecute anyone deemed an [[enemy of the state]] and they serve the emperor only. A Jinyiwei commander, Qinglong (Donnie Yen), is given a mechanical box of 14 blades to help him in his duties. Jia Jingzhong, the royal eunuch, plots rebellion with the emperor's uncle, Prince Qing (Sammo Hung), who had been exiled and his legs cut off for an unsuccessful rebellion many years previous.  Jia Jingzhong orders Qinglong, to retrieve a safe box in the possession of the imperial councilor, Zhao Shenyan, whom he accuses of planning a revolt; Qinglong is told that the box contains proof of the councilor's treason. However, Qinglong soon discovers that the box actually contains the [[Imperial Seal of China|Imperial Seal]], a symbol of the emperor's authority, which Jia Jingzhong needs to legitimize Prince Qing's authority. Qinglong is betrayed by his fellow Jinyiwei and his fellow officers executed by his brother-at-arms, Xuan Wu, who pledges himself and the Jinyiwei to Eunuch Jia. Prince Qing's adoptive daughter Tou-Tou (Kate Tsui), a deadly warrior, arrives to lend her assistance on receiving news of Qinglong's escape. A fugitive Qinglong, unable to leave the city limits til his wounds heal, finds his way to the failing Justice Escort Agency, an agency providing armed guards. Qinglong appears just as the agency decides to shut down due to lack of business. The owner eagerly accepts Qinglong's offer to pay him handsomely for safe passage in hopes of revitalizing his business.   By coincidence, the escort's daughter, Qiao Hua (Zhao Wei), is engaged to be married, and the escort agency hides Qinglong within her wedding carriage as a means to avoid detection by the guards so they can leave the city. As Qinglong recovers, Qiao Hua develops a fascination for him. Things become difficult as another group of Jinyiwei arrive in search of Qinglong. He kills them, but in doing so reveals to his escorts that he is Jinyiwei himself. Fearing more trouble than they bargained for, the owner offers to return Qinglong's money and asks to be left in peace; however Qinglong is determined to fulfill his duty to the emperor and takes Qiao Hua as a hostage. He commands her father to intentionally spread false information about his whereabouts to throw his pursuers off the scent and promises to return his daughter in one piece if he does. Qinglong continues to search for evidence of Prince Qing's plot while undermining the prince's activities. In the interim, Qiao Hau develops feelings for Qinglong despite misgivings about his actions and obsessive vendetta, but he maintains a cold distance to avoid attachment.  The pair arrive at the Uyghur city of [[Yanmenguan Township|Yanmen]], where Qinglong hopes to gather information. He discovers that his enemies intend to sell three provinces to fund their cause. While Qinglong investigates and plots his next move, the duo encounters the Heaven's Eagles Gang, a group of bandits led by the self-proclaimed "Judge of the Desert". The leader is a strong warrior who tests himself against Qinglong via a series of challenges, proving that they are fairly evenly matched. Qinglong proposes an alliance to raid the [[Yanmen Pass|Yanmen outpost]]: the gang will get their full cut of the booty while Qinglong gets to satisfy his personal objectives. Standing in Qinglong's way are Jia Jingzhong's henchmen and his former Jinyiwei fellows.  Tuo-Tuo tracks down Qinglong at an inn and wounds him in a fight before he escapes.  Before the raid is executed, Eunuch Jia is betrayed and killed by Xuan Wu, who intends to directly serve under Prince Qing.  Qinglong and the Heaven's Eagles Gang successfully raid the outpost and kill most of the soldiers. Qinglong overcomes Xuan Wu in combat, but the latter escapes by yielding the imperial seal. Tou-Tou kidnaps Qiao Hua and demands the seal in return for freeing her. Qiao Hua is doubtful that Qinglong will make the trade, given his cold behavior towards her and his fixation with his mission, but Qinglong gives up the seal. However, he also makes it clear that he intends to take Qiao Hua to her fiance. Duty-bound to recover the seal, Qinglong reluctantly leaves Qiao Hua, but she reunites with the Justice Escort Agency and they catch up with Qinglong, offering to assist with their superior knowledge of the roads.  Separately, the Judge of the Desert realizes the importance of the seal and leaves his gang to pursuit the seal on his own.  Intercepting Tou-Tou, Xuan Wu and Prince Qing's men at the ancient ruined Sky Wolves City, Qinglong first fakes an attack to draw Tuo-Tuo into chasing a disguised Qiao Hua.  Subsequently, Xuan Wu and Prince Qing's men were split up and lured into an ambush set by the Justice Agency, where they are tricked into firing upon each other and decimated with falling boulders before being attacked by Qinglong and the escort's men, who win the battle. Xuan Wu plays on Qinglong's guilt and mercy to escape execution, but then attempts to kill Qinglong when his back was turned, forcing his hand. Tou-Tou eventually catches up with Qiao Hua but the Judge of the Desert intervenes.  Realizing he is no match for Tuo-Tuo, the Judge sacrifices himself in combat to enable Qiao Hua to escape. Qinglong gives the seal to Qiao Hua and instructs her to bring it to the authorities to alert them of Prince Qing's conspiracy. Qiao Hua tells Qinglong she has declined her wedding proposal, suggesting she wants to be with Qinglong, but he believes he's likely to die; he tells her they will meet again if she rings a bell bracelet he had previously given her initially after abducting her. The two embrace and Qinglong asks Qiao Hua to wait for him after he faces Tou-Tou. Qinglong then duels Tou-Tou to the death in an abandoned temple. The two are evenly matched. Eventually, Qinglong grabs hold of Tou-Tou and then uses his box of 14 blades to kill both Tou-Tou and himself.  In the aftermath, Prince Qing's rebellion fails. He mourns for Tou-Tou's death and later commits suicide before being brought to trial. Qiao Hua's father passes away and she inherits the Justice Escort Agency. With the money they earned, the business is able to thrive again. During her travels, she frequently detours along the desert roads to remember her adventures with Qinglong and on one such foray, while looking across the desert with her telescope and ringing her bell, she tearfully sees a man who appears much like Qinglong in the distance.

22 Bullets
 Three years ago mafia boss Charly Matteï retired and left the business to his old friend Tony Zacchia, and has led a peaceful life since, devoting himself to his wife and two children. His past catches up with him when he is ambushed by an eight-man hit squad in a parking lot and left for dead with 22 bullets in his body. Against all odds, he survives to take revenge on his killers.  On the hunt for the shooters, he finds himself confronted with his criminal past and resulting threat to his family. He tries to identify those responsible without bloodshed. This "weakness" is, however, exploited, and his friend Karim is brutally murdered by the same people who had shot him. Matteï swears revenge and goes on a hunt for the masterminds of the attack. He visits the hit squad during a birthday celebration and announces that he will kill them one by one anytime, anywhere.  Marie Goldman is the policewoman investigating the shooting in the parking lot. Her husband, who was also a policeman, was killed in the service but his killer was never caught. Despite the indifference of her superiors, she would like to clear up the murder of her husband. Towards the end of the movie, in order to get to Zacchia, a desperate Matteï makes a deal with Goldman, who herself is divided between doing her duty and punishing the murderers of her husband who she suspects were Zacchia's men. The police get a USB drive containing data incriminating Zacchia in a money fraud and laundering operation. He finally confronts Tony Zacchia at his home and is about to kill him, but is interrupted by the police who end up arresting both Zacchia and Matteï.  In the end, Matteï is released as the cops do not have enough evidence to charge him. Goldman had earlier in the movie revealed to Matteï that one of the 8 shooters had missed him on purpose in the shootout at the start of the movie. Matteï figures out that this eighth shooter was his friend and lawyer who had been forced by Zacchia into shooting Matteï. He is forgiven by Matteï and the movie ends with Matteï walking with his family on a beach. His voiceover tells the audience that he had left his past life behind him and all he wanted to do was spend whatever possible time he had left with his family. He also says that he will no more have to look over his shoulder as he is at peace with his past.

The group flees to the bathroom, and Sarah discovers a passageway leading up to the attic. Momentarily safe, the group contemplate their situation. Emily sees a pathway leading to another room, and the group decides that Sarah shall go down and distract the beast while Charlie goes to call for help on their father's phone.  While Sarah distracts the monster, Charlie contacts the police. However, the beast kills and devours him. When Sarah witnesses this, the monster pursues her, and manages to bite her leg. On the other side of town, McRae, a trained dog-catcher, is picked up by police officer May, who believes the call is a hoax, on the way to investigate Charlie's call. Back in the attic, as Doug tends to Sarah's leg, Stephen and Emily discover another passageway into a room containing a shotgun. Armed with a stake, Sarah makes her way down and injures the beast before it attacks Emily. She attempts to kill the beast with the gun, but accidentally shoots herself.  McRae and May find an abandoned car in the middle of the road, and upon discovering several evidences, conclude that Charlie's call might not have been a hoax. Luke returns to the house, unaware of what's happening. He finds Gary's body and is soon pursued by the beast. After falling through the ceiling, Sarah takes Luke and the remaining survivors to the roof. McRae and May arrive but are both slain by the beast. Sarah reaches their vehicle and takes the handbag inside, which she realizes is her mother's. At the barn, Stephen tries to fix the Jeep, which he had tampered with to prevent their mother from seeing her lover.  Sarah blames Stephen for the possible death of her mother, and they get into a fight. He then runs out of the barn and is attacked by the beast, while Sarah begins to transform into one as well. Luke and Doug return to the house and hide from the beast. A beast-like Sarah attacks and fights with the other beast. Doug, trying to shoot at the beast, is killed by Sarah; Luke runs back to the car. In the morning, Sarah is human again, and it is revealed that the other beast is their mother who had left to go somewhere where she could not hurt anyone, not to have a love affair. Sarah and Luke leave to go somewhere safe like their mother did.  The film finishes by looking at the mauled and bloody body of Gary, who then opens his eyes and takes a breath before the screen cuts to black. This implies that the others who were bitten will come back to life.

71: Into the Fire
  South Korean student Oh Jang-beom is a volunteer militia soldier in a battle inside [[Yeongdeok County|Yeongdeok]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]] during the Korean War, serving as an ammunition and litter bearer under the charge of regular army Captain Kang Suk-dae. As the city is overrun by the North Korean forces of the elite [[766th Independent Infantry Regiment (North Korea)|766th Unit]], 5th Division, [[North Korean People's Army]], he is pulled into a squad of South Korean soldiers led by Lieutenant Kim Jun-Seop attempting escape. However, the unit is eventually cut down to only Lt. Kim and Jang-Beom. A North Korean suddenly shoots and bayonets the lieutenant; Jang-beom, due to his inexperience and terror, is unable to save him. They are found by other South Koreans, and barely get aboard one of the last trucks out of the town to a hospital in [[Pohang]], where Lt. Kim dies with a guilt-ridden Jang-beom at his side.  Capt. Kang orders Jang-beom to lead a newly-raised [[Student soldiers in the Korean War|student-soldier]] unit, as he is one of only three of the volunteers with combat experience, and all the regular soldiers are needed at the [[Nakdong River]] in the impending battle at the [[Battle of Pusan Perimeter|Pusan Perimeter]]. The unit is joined by three young criminals led by Ku Kap-jo, who challenges Jang-beom's command, and cause trouble by accidentally destroying the students' food supply. Later, while patrolling, they are attacked by a North Korean sniper. They impulsively give chase, and the sniper leads them into an ambush. The students suffer heavy casualties before disengaging. During the shootout, Jang-beom and Kap-Jo encounter a North Korean child soldier, whom Kap-jo kills over Jang-Beom's orders to spare him. The students' morale is decimated by the disastrous encounter. The students' call for aid to Capt. Kang is fruitless, as Capt. Kang and the regular forces are pinned at the Nakdong. Kang pleads with his superiors to help the students, but they refuse to divert resources from the critical Pusan front. They do, however, allow Kang to go, and he gathers vehicles and a small force of South Korean soldiers to relieve the school.  One of the student-soldiers, Dal-Young, is captured by the 766th Unit and is interrogated by Major Park Mu-Rang, a 766th officer. Being a father, Mu-Rang takes pity on the student and orders his return to the school, going there himself to assess the students' strength. There, he tells Jang-Beom that he and his men will, in 2 hours, capture the school, and offers to spare the defenders' lives if they raise a white flag in those two hours. Kap-Jo beats Dal-young and fights Jang-beom before deserting with a friend, Chang-wu, for the Pusan Perimeter. Shortly after leaving, the two encounter a North Korean truck filled with supplies and weapons, stuck in a road.  The remaining students prepare to defend the school under Jang-beom's leadership, raising not a white flag but the [[Flag of South Korea|South Korean national flag]], while Major Park makes his own preparations for the assault. When the attack begins, the students are able to inflict devastating casualties on the North Koreans, but the attackers are too many and far superior in quality, and the students are forced back. Suddenly, the North Korean supply truck roars in, driven by Chang-wu and Kap-jo, carving their way through the North Koreans, killing many and halting their attack as well as bringing valuable heavy weapons to the students.  The North Koreans deploy a tank. Under its cover, the 766th's men reach the school building and kill off most of the students. During a lull, Jang-Beom and Kap-Jo shelter in a classroom. and the two reconcile their differences. The two students then fight their way through the North Koreans inside the building to the roof of the building, where the others have fitted machine-guns. By now, almost all of the student-soldiers, including Jang-beom's veteran friends from Yongdeok, Dal-young the captured student, and Chang-wu, Kap-jo's fellow criminal, are dead. On the roof, Jang-beom and Kap-jo try to hold back the North Koreans.  Just as Jang-beom and Kap-jo run out of ammunition, Capt. Kang and the South Koreans arrive. They destroy the North Korean tank and steadily defeat the North Korean infantry in the school grounds. At the roof, as Jang-beom collapses from exhaustion and his wounds, Major Park bursts onto the roof and kills Kap-jo. While Park gloats, Jang-beom quietly loads his rifle with a round that he had previously failed to save Lt. Kim with at Yeongdeok, and shoots Park just as Park also shoots him; the Major is later killed by Capt. Kang. Jang-Beom dies from his wounds as Kang comforts him.  It is revealed that of the 71 students, 48 died defending the school. The movie ends with a flashback, with an Army photographer taking a group picture of the student-soldiers before the regular troops leave for Pusan, and the surviving student-soldier veterans, now old, reflect on their experiences.

The battle ends when they lure Tuco's helicopter into American airspace, where it is shot down by an [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22 Raptor]] for trespassing.  Eight years later in Iraq, Hannibal is contacted by CIA [[Special Activities Division]] operative [[Agent Lynch|Lynch]], who assigns them a [[black operation]] to recover [[United States Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] plates and over $1 billion in cash slated to move it out of Baghdad in an armored convoy. Hannibal's commanding officer, General Morrison, consents to the operation but Face's former girlfriend, [[Defense Criminal Investigative Service]] [[Captain (armed forces)|Capt.]] Charissa Sosa, tries to discourage the team against getting the plates. The mission is successful and when the team returns to base, the money and Morrison's vehicle are destroyed by [[List of The A-Team characters#Brock Pike|Brock Pike]] and his men from the [[Private military company|private security firm]] Black Forest. Without Morrison (the only proof that they were authorized to act), Hannibal, Face, Murdock, and BA are [[court-martialled]], are sentenced to ten years in separate prisons, and [[Military discharge|dishonorably discharged]]. Sosa also ended up court-martialled and is demoted to lieutenant.  Six months later, Lynch visits Hannibal in prison and tells him that Pike may be trying to sell the plates with the help of an Arab backer. Hannibal, who has been tracking Pike on his own, makes a deal with Lynch: full reinstatement and clean records for his team in return for the plates. Lynch agrees and Hannibal escapes, breaking out Face, BA, and Murdock in the process. The team hijacks a [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|C-130]], which is later shot down by [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|Reaper]] [[UCAV]]s, but not before the team parachutes away in a tank stashed aboard and make it to the ground safely. The team moves to reclaim the plates and kidnap Pike's backer. It is revealed that the backer is actually General Morrison, who plotted with Lynch and Pike to steal the plates but teamed up with Pike to double-cross Lynch and fake his death. Lynch orders an airstrike to kill the team and Morrison, but the team manages to escape whilst Morrison is killed.  Hannibal arranges to meet Sosa on board a [[container ship]] at the Los Angeles Port, saying he will hand over Morrison and the plates. Face then calls Sosa on a drop phone he planted on her at the train station, and conspires a different plan with her. It all unfolds according to plan until Pike, who is now working with Lynch, blows up the container ship and chases Face to near death. BA (having converted to Buddhism while in prison) finally gives up his pacifist ways and kills Pike, saving Face. Hannibal leads Lynch into a container with Murdock, who, wearing a covered bullet-proof helmet, is portraying Morrison. Lynch shoots at Murdock’s head, believing that he kills Morrison, and is later tricked into admitting that he stole the plates, and is subsequently arrested by Sosa.  The CIA agents led by a separate "Lynch" comes and claims custody of the original one. Despite their success and proving themselves innocent, the military still arrests the team for escaping from prison, also a crime; they and Sosa are angered by this, since it is only being done so Sosa's boss does not have to fill out paperwork. Sosa is reinstated to captain, but she promises to do all she can to set the team free and kisses Face as everybody is led into a prison van. In the van, everyone starts saying that the system has burned them again, but Hannibal tells them that there is always a way out of any situation, and turns towards Face, who smiles and says "I don't want to steal your line, boss, but... I love it when a plan comes together" and opens his mouth and reveals a handcuff key, given to him by Sosa through the kiss. The final scene includes a narration (spoken by [[Corey Burton]]) similar to the show's opening narration.  In a post-credits scene, Murdock and Face of ''The A-Team''s original cast are seen.

All archaeologists who attempted to search for the secret land have disappeared. Archaeologist Chandramouli is the most recent person to have gone missing suddenly.  The Indian government organizes a search expedition led by officer Anitha to find Chandramouli and the Chola empire; she is assisted by the Indian army led by Ravisekharan. They recruit archaeologist Lavanya, the estranged daughter of Chandramouli, because her insight is essential for the success of the expedition. She hands over crucial documents on the Chola dynasty, prepared by her father, with instructions on the route to reach the destination.  Along with the army, Anitha employs a group of [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] headed by Muthu, to transport the baggage during the journey. The crew embark on their voyage leading them to an island, Min-gua, near Vietnam. The island borders 3 countries: [[Thailand]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Malaysia]]. They face seven traps set by the Cholas: sea creatures, cannibals, warriors, snakes, hunger, quicksand and a village. Many porters and army men are killed by these traps.  Muthu, Anitha and Lavanya get separated from the others. They reach the ruins of a village where they are subjected to black magic and nearly go mad before reaching the secret hideout of the Chola. The three find an ethnic isolated primitive Tamil group, ruled by a Chola king. The king and his people are in hiding, awaiting the arrival of the fabled messenger who will bring glory and prosperity back to their land and lead them back to [[Thanjavur]], their motherland. The king and the priest consult the gods for omens and order Muthu, Anitha and Lavanya to be burnt alive as sacrifices.  Anitha tells the king that she is the messenger sent from the homeland. Muthu and Lavanya are enslaved while Anitha is given a chance to prove herself. She tries to seduce and convince the Chola king to march towards the homeland in two days so he can be crowned properly as a king. He suspects her bona fides since none of her actions match those described by the king's ancestors. The ancestors wrote that the messenger will be preceded by hail and following his ill-treatment will eventually help the tribe.  Meanwhile, Anitha drugs the priest and poisons the water sources. She catches a glimpse of the Pandyas' sacred idol and leaves, finally exposing her identity as a descendant of the [[Pandya Dynasty]]. The central minister, who sponsors the expedition, is also shown to be a Pandyan. The Chola king is shattered for having believed in Anitha. Ravishekaran who has escaped the traps and is the sole survivor gets backup and a larger army after getting an information from a hypnotized follower of Anitha from the Chola kingdom. The king discovers that Muthu is the true messenger who would save the Cholas from the clutches of Anitha and the army. The priest gives all of his magical powers, like invisibility and invulnerability to Muthu and dies.  The Cholas fight bravely, but eventually lose to technology and are taken prisoners. Their women are molested and raped by the army. The king is killed and the men drown in the seas with the king's body. Muthu is able to escape and save the Chola Prince.

The plot thickens when Aniket auditions a young actress, Shikha ([[Ananya Chatterjee]]), who bears an uncanny resemblance to his wife when she was younger. Deepti enthusiastically begins to coach Shikha for her husband's film &mdash; so much so that Shikha becomes even more like the young woman Deepti used to be and, as a result, the aging Aniket falls in love with Shikha, a woman as young as his son, despite the sadness and trouble it brings to his family. However, although portrayed as an apparent love between Aniket and Shikha, Shikha was a [[Muse]] for Aniket. Her acting skills and her spontaneity mesmerized him. To him, she was Sreemoti, the name which he had first given to Deepti. Deepti later gave this name to Shikha. Even when Sikha became popular in the acting world by the name Sreemoti, Aniket always referred to her as Sikha. For him, Deepti - his wife was the real Sreemoti.

There, she is confronted by an unwanted marriage proposal to Lord Ascot's son, Hamish, and the stifling expectations of the society in which she lives. Unsure of how to proceed, she pursues a rabbit wearing a blue waistcoat and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole under a tree. She emerges in a forest where she is greeted by the [[White Rabbit]], [[the Dormouse]], the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]], the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#Live Flowers|Talking Flowers]], and [[Tweedledum and Tweedledee]]. They argue over whether Alice is "the right Alice" who must slay the [[Red Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|Red Queen]]'s [[Jabberwocky]] and restore the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] to power, as foretold by [[Caterpillar (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Absolem the Caterpillar]] and his prophetic scroll. The group is then ambushed by the [[Bandersnatch]] and a group of playing-card soldiers led by the [[Knave of Hearts (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Knave of Hearts]]. Alice, Tweedledum and Tweedledee escape into the woods. The Knave steals the Caterpillar's scroll. The Dormouse leaves the others behind with one of the Bandersnatch's eyes in her possession. Tweedledum and Tweedledee are then captured by the Red Queen's [[Jubjub bird]].  The Knave informs the Red Queen that Alice threatens her reign, and the soldiers and [[Puppy (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Bayard the Bloodhound]] are ordered to find Alice immediately. Meanwhile, the [[Cheshire Cat]] guides Alice to the [[March Hare]] and the [[Hatter (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Mad Hatter]]. The Hatter helps Alice avoid capture by allowing himself to be seized instead. Later, Alice is found by the Bloodhound, but Alice insists upon helping the Hatter. At the Red Queen's citadel and palace, the Red Queen is unaware of Alice's true identity and therefore welcomes her as a guest. Alice learns that the [[vorpal sword]], the only weapon capable of killing the Jabberwocky, is locked inside the den of the Bandersnatch. The Knave attempts to seduce Alice, but she rebuffs him, causing a jealous Red Queen to order that Alice be beheaded. Alice obtains the sword and befriends the Bandersnatch by returning its eye. She then escapes on the back of the grateful Bandersnatch and delivers the sword to the White Queen. The Cheshire Cat saves the Hatter from the [[List of minor characters in the Alice series#The Executioner|executioner]], and the Hatter calls for rebellion against the Red Queen. The rebellion is quickly put down by the Jubjub bird, but the resistance flees to the White Queen's castle, and both armies prepare for battle. Absolem advises Alice to fight the Jabberwocky just before completing his transformation into a [[pupa]].  On the appointed day, the White Queen and the Red Queen gather their armies on a chessboard-like battlefield and send Alice and the Jabberwocky to decide the battle in single combat. Encouraged by the advice of her late father, Alice fights the Jabberwocky among the ruins surrounding the battlefield and finally jumps from the remains of a spiral staircase onto the Jabberwocky's neck and beheads it. During this fight, a catapult stone kills the Jubjub bird. As punishment for their crimes, the White Queen banishes the Red Queen and the Knave into exile together. The Knave attempts to kill the Red Queen, yet the Hatter protects the Red Queen from his attack. After the Hatter performs a celebration dance called Futterwacken, the White Queen gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood whose power will bring her whatever she wishes. She decides to rejoin the everyday world after saying farewell to her friends. Back in England, Alice impresses Lord Ascot with her idea of establishing oceanic trade routes to [[Hong Kong]], inspiring him to take her as his apprentice.

Randhir organizes a river rafting camp for everyone, and Aisha uses this as a chance to get Randhir and Shefali to spend more time together. One night during the camp, Randhir takes Aisha for a walk and then confesses his love for her. Confused and taken aback by Randhir's feelings for her, Aisha starts to doubt her match making skills.

Shefali then declares that she has feelings for Arjun. This greatly confuses and hurts Aisha, since she realises that she has been in love with Arjun all this time. Aisha realises that she has been selfish and arrogant all along, playing with the emotions and feelings of her friends. She goes back to her best friend, Pinky, and apologizes for her actions.

He has climbing gear with him and a rope for to use as an anchor. Sal wraps the rope around himself and after some difficulty, Cory makes it to the tail and removes the errant bolt. Sal then sees a horrifyingly giant tentacle among the clouds and loses control of the rope. Cory slips and Sal is almost pulled out of the aircraft. Panicking, he cuts the rope and Cory falls, only to be caught by the monster tentacle.  When Bruce awakens, he finds he has been tied up and learns Cory is dead, along with a monster outside. Bruce tells Sara that he was in the crash that killed her mother and his parents. Sara tries the radio again and hears a strange noise. Sal recognizes it as the monster that took Cory. Suddenly, the aircraft crashes into the monster's open mouth. Bruce looks at a page of his comic which shows a blond woman being grabbed by tentacles. Immediately, a large tentacle grabs Mel and kills her. Bruce starts flicking through the comic book, as if he has discovered something. Sal threatens to kill Bruce for causing Mel's death and tries to throw him out, but Sara intervenes and in the ensuing confusion, Sal falls out the door and plummets to his death.  Bruce tells Sara he is causing all this; that his mind is recreating the comic book, something that happens when he gets very scared. The creature starts attacking the aircraft, and Sara demands that Bruce prove he is doing it by ending it all. His attempts just make things worse, until Sara kisses him, but is grabbed by the monster. She tells him that if he can do all this, then he can bring his parents back. After a struggle, the monster suddenly disappears and she falls back into the aircraft. As they fly out of the storm, they see another aircraft heading straight for them, carrying Bruce, his parents and Sara's mother. They manage to take control of their aircraft, and don't crash into the other.  In the altered past Sara's mother and Bruce's family have arrived at their destination intact. Sara's mother says "Everybody gets one near miss, right?", and Bruce's mom asks, "Do you think they made it?" to which Sara's mother replies "I hope so." The young Sara and Bruce are introduced to one another, holding hands and looking out into the sky.

Jack talks to Pavel one last time — asking how the Swedes have found him. In his growing fear, he even suspects Clara when he discovers a small pistol in her purse.

The Amazing Bulk
  Government research scientist Henry "Hank" Howard (Jordan Lawson) has been commissioned by General Darwin (Terence Lording), who suffers from amathophobia, to develop a [[serum (blood)|serum]] that will increase the user's strength and longevity. Howard wishes to marry Darwin's daughter, Hannah ([[Shevaun Kastl]]), but Darwin angrily refuses. In an effort to prove that his serum is successful, Howard injects himself with it, allowing him to turn into a colossal purple humanoid. That night, he goes on a date with Hannah to a carnival. They then take the [[Rapid transit|subway]], wherein a mugger approaches them at gunpoint and steals Howard's wallet and the ring he plans to propose to Hannah with. Not wanting to lose the ring, Howard attempts to fight the mugger and loses. After the mugger flees the scene, Hannah expresses her concern for Howard's sudden bravery, asking what could be so important that he would risk his life over. In order to hide the intended proposal, Howard lies, saying the mugger took a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing secret files about the serum.   Later that night, while witnessing the same mugger assault and murder a young woman, Howard transforms into the Bulk and kills the man; he runs off as police arrive to the scene, and they notice purple blood on the ground. Detectives Ray Garton (Jed Rowen) and Lisa Tuttle (Deirdre V. Lyons) find Howard's wallet and return it to him the next day. When Garton finds a purple stain on his hand, he becomes convinced that Howard is responsible for the mugger's death. They watch as Howard returns to the scene of the crime, and they confront him, causing him to turn into the Bulk.  The Bulk goes on a rampage throughout the city as the detectives pursue him. The Bulk sends cars flying through the air, one of which lands on Tuttle, killing her. Garton, enraged by his partner's death, shoots at the Bulk, who grabs and destroys a news helicopter. The Bulk morphs back into Howard and is arrested by Garton. In prison, Garton threatens Howard for killing Tuttle, until Darwin arrives with a serum to keep the Bulk under control. Darwin tells Howard that clownish [[supervillain]] Dr. Werner von Kantlove ([[Randal Malone]]), along with his assistant Lolita Kantlove (Juliette Angeli), have been destroying famous [[monument]]s and [[landmark]]s. Kantlove attempts to destroy the moon, but finds a monkey has hijacked the rocket.  Darwin explains that the only way Kantlove can be stopped is with the Bulk, and convinces Howard to work with him when he says he will allow Howard to marry Hannah. Howard is deployed several miles from Kantlove's castle, and after sprinting through several odd locations, such as through a golf course and past [[Wind Turbine|wind turbines]], Howard arrives at the castle. Turning into the Bulk, he kills Kantlove's guards, and the military destroys the castle. Darwin then betrays the Bulk, ordering for a jet to bomb him. After a lengthy chase featuring seemingly random stock animations, a [[nuclear bomb]] is dropped on the Bulk.  Howard arrives at Darwin's home, having inexplicably survived the bombing. He reunites with Hannah, but when Darwin sees that he has survived, they break into a struggle and fall off a balcony, which kills them both. Later, Hannah visits Howard's grave and leaves a rose there. After she leaves, a drunken Garton arrives at the grave. When he begins urinating on it, the arms of the Bulk emerge from the ground and punch him.

They get into a bus and the song "Kadaigalai Pesum" starts. Not owning a house, the two then find a place to sleep in the street where masonry workers are sleeping. While they are dreaming, a fire engine completely loses its control after colliding with another vehicle and hits the people sleeping in street. The next scene shows the jammed vehicle, blood, crying people and the hospital where Jothi is lying on a stretcher with blood all over his body. When some policemen ask Jothi, "What is your name? Where are you from?", he just murmurs "Kani, Kani, Kani...". The flashback now starts and the scene takes us to a village in Tirunelveli.  Jyothi Lingam ([[Mahesh (Tamil actor)|Mahesh]]) is a bright student and son of a mason who leads a happy life in his village near [[Tirunelveli]]. One day tragedy strikes as his father, the only earning member dies in an accident while crossing an unmanned railway gate. The young boy now has to look after his mother and two sisters.  Due to circumstances, he is forced to abandon his studies, though he comes first in his school in the board exam. Through a canvassing agent, he and his friend Marimuthu get jobs as sales-boys in a textile showroom in Ranganathan Street in Chennai.  Jyothi, along with hundreds of others, is employed at the Senthil Murugan Stores run by a big businessman. On each floor at the textile showroom, there are around 50 to 60 sales boys and girls who work in pitiable conditions from early in the morning to late night, without any rest.  He meets Kani ([[Anjali (actress born 1986)|Anjali]]), a fiery independent girl. The difficult and harrowing times in the store bring them together as they face up to a cruel and lewd store supervisor Karungali ([[A. Venkatesh (director)|A. Venkatesh]]), who beats up the boys and molests the girls if they are caught playing around during duty hours. Jyothi says there is no escape from the “jail like” atmosphere in the shop where employees are treated more like slave labour in a concentration camp without any human dignity. Aftet some arguments slowly Jyoti and Kani falls in love with each other.  In the meantime, actress Sneha visits the showroom for the shooting of an advertisement. Marimuthu is a die-hard fan of Sneha. He has made an album with his collection of Sneha's childhood pictures and also written out her biography in the album. He is very keen on meeting Sneha. Amidst of the security, he catches Sneha's attention and shows her the album he has made. Sneha is surprised and she likes the album very much. She tells Marimuthu that she will keep the album herself. Meanwhile, Jyothi and Kani sneak out of the crowd to go somewhere private. While they are talking in the showroom, the supervisor unexpectedly arrives. On seeing this, they quickly find places to hide between the counters. Unfortunately the security guard then locks them in the showroom without knowing. Not knowing what to do, Kani shouts at Jyothi for taking her to the showroom in the first place. Jyothi walks away but then starts to sing. Kani joins in the song and after some time they are putting on the dresses in that room one by one, singing and dancing to their hearts' content.  After sharing this special night dancing and singing, the two change back into their working clothes and go to their usual places the next day morning as if they arrived only in the morning. Unfortunately their dance was recorded in the CCTV of the store. Their boss Annachi sees this and calls the supervisor. The supervisor catches both Jyothi and Kani and beats them up. The supervisor lodges a police report about Jyothi stealing a costly saree from the shop and the police takes Jyothi away. At the police station an inspector beats him up to make him admit he has committed this made-up crime. Jyothi refuses to do so but tells the inspector that he knows all the fraud activities done by Annachi. The inspector calls Annachi and advises him to take back the complaint, otherwise it will make things difficult if Jyothi tells all these things to media. The next morning Jyothi is released from the custody.  Having Kani in mind, Jyothi goes back to the showroom and threatens the supervisor that if they do not release Kani, he will tell the ugly truth about the store to the people shopping there. On hearing this, Annachi orders the supervisor to send Kani with Jyothi. They both leave the place and search for jobs in every shop on that street. Finally a blind old man who is selling clothes on the platform tells Jyothi that he will give commission to them if they help him sell clothes. So they start selling clothes and earn some money for the day. The old man tells them a place where they can safely sleep. They go to the place to sleep and the flashback ends.  The following scene shows the hospital where Jyothi and Kani are admitted. Jyothi regains his consciousness and sees Marimathu. Marimuthu has joined Sneha's team as a makeup man. Jyothi, who has slight injuries on his head, legs and hands, asks Marimuthu desperately about Kani. But Marimuthu refuses to answer. Despite Marimuthu's attempts at stopping him, Jyothi gets out of  bed irrespective of his leg injuries and looks for Kani. He was shocked to see Kani in another room with both her legs amputated. Marimuthu advises Jyothi to forget about Kani as she will not be able do things on her own and she needs someone's care. He says if Jyothi takes care of her then nobody will earn for his family.  Jyothi thinks for a while and finally decides to marry Kani. Kani, who has just woken up, cries hysterically as she has lost her legs. She thinks she will be abandoned and sent to the house for the disabled. So when Jyothi asks to marry her, she cries happily and agrees. The film ends with the scene showing Kani sitting on the platform selling things and Jyothi sells things by walking in the street.  Angadi Theru is about how these two survive in a concentration-camp-like condition and what happens when fate perpetually smiles very cruelly at them. Sneha lights up the happenings in a small cameo as herself by doing a commercial advertisement for the stores.  This film is considered to be a milestone in Tamil cinema due its raw content. This movie reflects few happening at the two Popular Stores in Ranganathan Street in Chennai.

Craig learns that the house is already being monitored, and as the police arrive he tries to flee through a field but is gunned down. Pope and Darren take J to meet their [[solicitor]] Ezra. Ezra coaches J to not tell the police anything and pressures him to break up with Nicky, which J does. Leckie takes J into custody again, where he proposes that J be moved to witness protection, but J turns down the offer. Meanwhile, Nicky, unsure what to do, shows up at Smurf's home, where Pope gives her heroin, questions her, then smothers her to death to keep her silent.  When J returns to Smurf's house the next morning he discovers Nicky's bracelet outside the house. He calls Nicky's phone, and realising something is not right, flees to Nicky's parents' house. Pope gets Nicky's address from Darren and arrives in time to intercept J. J flees on foot and is taken into a safe house. With Craig and Baz dead, Pope and Darren imprisoned, and J potentially the star witness for the prosecution, Smurf decides, "J needs ''to go''". Smurf uses her connections to procure J's address and persuades the corrupt cop to help her. Police from the drug squad then raid the safe house. J jumps a fence and returns to Smurf's house, saying he wishes to help free Pope and Darren from jail. To do this, the family's [[barrister]] then coaches J's answers.  After his day in court, Leckie sees J before his departure from the safe hotel and asks him if he has found his place in the world (a reference to Leckie's animal kingdom metaphor for J's predicament). Pope, Darren and Smurf celebrate with champagne while being interviewed after their controversial acquittal. Smurf later sees Leckie in the supermarket and taunts him. Later again, J returns to Smurf's home asking to stay, before going to his room. Pope enters and begins to talk to him but is cut off when J shoots him in the head. In the final scene, J returns to the living room and embraces a now silenced Smurf.

Aptharakshaka
 The story starts off with an ancient painting of Nagavalli ([[Vimala Raman]]) floating away to distant places, where it finally comes into the hands of a village painter. The painter brings it home so as to restore it back to its original look. However, when his wife asks him to sell the painting, he becomes furious, saying that he wouldn't sell it off even at the cost of his life. The next day, the painter is shown to be dead under mysterious circumstances, possibly being a suicide. The painting is then sold off to a dance competition, which was distributed as a prize to [[Bharata Natyam]] dancer Saraswathi ([[Lakshmi Gopalaswamy]]), her husband and her family. On the Engagement day of Gowri ([[Sandhya (actress)|Sandhya]]), one of her friends had fainted by encountering a huge thirty-feet Snake, and the bridegroom had run away from the family house fearing of something. All strange incidents happen as the family called for a snake charmer to the house, but the snake charmer had died when he attempted to make the serpent appear. The members of the family are psychologically affected by the presence of Nagavalli's painting and things have not been going well in the house. So they decide to contact Acharya Ramchandra Shastry ([[Avinash]]), an astrologer cum sage. The father of the three daughters tells the Acharya that Saraswathi and her husband met with a fatal accident and died, after the bharathanatyam competition. The Acharya takes the help of Dr Vijay ([[Vishnuvardhan (actor)|Vishnuvardhan]]), a psychiatrist, to solve the problem. All directions point to the huge portrait of Nagavalli, and is observed that the portrait is the cause for this. Everyone is warned to not go to the [[outhouse]] or to the room where Nagavalli's painting is. One night, Dr. Vijay goes to the outhouse as he heard anklet sounds, and he sees another smaller portrait of Nagavalli in the outhouse. It is then revealed that Saraswathi is still alive, but became mad after the truck accident in which her husband died while he was carrying the painting of Nagavalli, and that she said that no one accepted to marry the second daughter Geetha because Saraswathi was mad and so Geetha vowed that she wouldn't marry, and since they didn't want Gowri's situation to be like this, they lied saying Saraswathi was dead, and locked her up in the outhouse. In a few occasions, someone attempted to murder the Acharya twice. Suspecting Saraswathi, the acharya asks the family members to bring Saraswathi to the temple and that he will show everyone that Nagavalli is in Saraswathi's body, but as Saraswathi steps the temple, all the animals run out of the temple. Suspecting each and every person in the family, Dr. Vijay starts to investigate everything so he goes to the library to read a book based on Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur's life and further information on Nagavalli too.  The investigation also takes back to around 125 years when Raja Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur (Vishnuvardhan) used to live and how his enmity with Nagavalli has been going on since centuries. Dr. Vijay becomes very shocked to see the Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur for two reasons: 1. The portrait he saw in the old palace 5 years ago, was in fact the portrait of Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur's elder brother, Vinaya Rajendra Bahaddur, who was killed by Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur himself for the sake of ruling the kingdom. 2. Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur resembles Dr. Vijay. It is revealed in the book that he had attempted to escape as one of his men had spread a dirty rumour about him, which caused the whole Ramnagara Dominion and the people to go and slaughter and assassinate him... but the book doesn't say if he got assassinated, or if he really committed suicide or if he is alive. Dr. Vijay finishes reading the book and whilst signing the ledger, he reads the name above him: Nagavalli... and he understands that she had read the book before he had. To further investigate about Nagavalli, Dr. Vijay goes to Nagavalli's place in Peddapuram, Andhra Pradhesh and an old man told the Doctor that Nagavalli's family died back at around a hundred years and told him that he was the second person to enquire about Nagavalli's family, and as the Doctor asked who that person was, the old man told him that a girl came and inquired about Nagavalli, and he also says that she was fine whilst asking the questions, but when she returned from Nagavalli's place, she was holding a portrait of Nagavalli and ran away like a mad girl, so the Doctor goes to Nagavalli's house and realizes that the portrait in the outhouse was the portrait of Nagavalli which had been taken, as he glanced at an empty wall with a rectangular marking outline. Dr. Vijay also investigates about Saraswathi's husband's death and the snake charmer's death, and he comes with information that the snake charmer's death and Saraswathi's husband's death had nothing to do with Nagavalli. Dr. Vijay reveals that Raja Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur is still  alive when he printed out an astrological profile and showed the astrologer, who revealed it. So Dr. Vijay goes to the Fort where the Raja is, and at the time, the Acharya performs a pooja to try to bring Nagavalli out of Saraswathi's body. The Doctor luckily escapes from the invincible Raja, and when the Acharya asks for Saraswathi's name, she says her name as Nagavalli Saraswathi, but is revealed that she is still mad, but not affected by Nagavalli. Dr. Vijay comes back to cure Saraswathi from her madness, and he succeeds, but the problem of Nagavalli is not finished yet, and he knows who is affected by Nagavalli. Later the Doctor reveals to everyone that Gowri is affected by Nagavalli as he makes her angry and change personality from Gowri to Nagavalli in front of everyone, then she swoons after she returns to normal. Then later, he explains to everyone that Gowri had written both the names while she signed the ledger: Gowri in English when she was borrowing the book, Nagavalli in Telugu when she was returning the book, and that it was also her who scared the bridegroom away on the Engagement day and sat downstairs like as if she didn't know anything. In order to know more about Nagavalli's lover Ramanatha ([[Vineeth]]), she went to Nagavalli's house as Gowri, and returned with Nagavalli's photo, completely as Nagavalli. Gowri later goes to the fort where Vijaya Rajendra Bahaddur is, to kill him. Dr. Vijay, knowing Gowri would have definitely sought revenge goes to the fort where the Raja almost gets burnt to death, but he survives when it starts to rain, then Dr. Vijay has a battle with him, and the Raja almosts decapitates Gowri/Nagavalli, but before he does so, the Raja gets struck by a lightning; thus, throwing his sword above and as it comes down, it stabs the Raja in the neck, who then dies. Gowri is no more affected by Nagavalli anymore and is going to marry the bridegroom she scared away, and Geetha is going to marry too and it all comes to a happy ending.

When Rakesh asks Krishnanunni to call his family doctor, he accidentally calls Rakesh's girlfriend. Rakesh asks Krishnanunni to leave his home for all the mess he has created. Rakesh tries to get information regarding his wife's whereabout. Krishnanunni offers to help and calls Rakesh's wife's previous boyfriend Sarath ([[Biju Menon]]) under a false identity. Instead, he ends up giving Rakesh's Landline number that makes it obvious to Sarath that Rakesh is trying to get all details. Sarath tells Rakesh that his wife might have gone to a party hosted by a sex-freak.  It turns out that a colleague of Krishnanunni, played by [[Jagathy]], an Income Tax Inspector Grade 1 (a tax auditor, in Veber's script), knows the whereabouts of this person.

This hurts Krishnanunni, but the good-hearted Krishnanunni still wants to help Rakesh by letting her know how sorry Rakesh is because of his acts and how much he loves her.  Krishnanunni does so by calling Rakesh's wife, who had been involved in a car accident after leaving the apartment for the second time (the first time being when Krishnanunni had sent her away thinking she was really Rakesh's ex-girlfriend), and makes no mistakes in this conversation, as well as making up near perfect excuses on the spot and with no prompting. After encouraging Rakesh's wife to return home, Krishnanunni makes yet another mistake after he picks up the telephone when she calls to talk to Brochant despite having previously told her he was in a phone booth.

Shō gets a glimpse of Arrietty, a young Borrower girl, returning to her home through an underground air vent.  At night, Arrietty's father, Pod, takes her on her first "borrowing" mission, to get sugar and tissue paper. After obtaining a sugar cube from the kitchen, they travel inside a hollow wall to a bedroom which they enter through an intriguing dollhouse with working electric lights and kitchen utensils. However, it is Shō's bedroom; he lies awake and sees Arrietty when she tries to take a tissue from his night table. Startled, she drops the sugar cube. Shō tries to comfort her, but Pod and Arrietty quietly leave and go home.  The next day, Shō puts the sugar cube and a little note beside the air vent where he first saw Arrietty. Pod warns Arrietty not to take it because their existence must be kept secret from humans. Nevertheless, she sneaks out to visit Shō in his bedroom. She drops the sugar cube on the floor, letting him know that she is there. Without showing herself, she tells Shō to leave her family alone and that they do not need his help. On her return, Arrietty is intercepted by her father. Realizing they have been detected, Pod and his wife Homily decide that they must move out. Shō learns from Sadako that some of his ancestors had noticed the presence of Borrowers in the house and had the dollhouse custom-built for them. The Borrowers had not been seen since, however.  Pod returns injured from a borrowing mission and is helped home by Spiller, a Borrower boy he met on the way. He informs them that there are other places the Borrowers could move to. While Pod is recovering, Shō removes the floorboard concealing the Borrower household and replaces their kitchen with the kitchen from the dollhouse, to show he hopes them to stay. However, the Borrowers are frightened by this and instead speed up their moving process.  After Pod recovers, he goes to explore possible new living quarters. Arrietty goes to bid farewell to Shō, but in the course of the conversation he suggests to her that the Borrowers are becoming extinct. Arrietty tells him fiercely that they will not give up so easily. Shō apologises that he has forced them to move out and reveals he has had a heart condition since birth and will have an operation in a few days. The operation does not have a good chance of success. He believes that there is nothing he can do about it, saying that eventually every living thing dies.  While Sadako is out, Haru notices the floorboards have been disturbed. She unearths the Borrowers' house and captures Homily. Alerted by her mother's screams, Arrietty leaves Shō in the garden and goes to investigate. Saddened by her departure, Shō returns to his room. Haru locks him in and calls a pest removal company to capture the other Borrowers alive. Arrietty comes to Shō for help; they rescue Homily and he destroys all traces of the Borrowers’ presence.  On their way out during the night, the Borrowers are spotted by the cat Niya. Sleepless, Shō goes into the garden for a stroll, and the cat leads him to the "river", where the Borrowers are waiting for Spiller to take them further. Shō gives Arrietty a sugar cube and tells her that her courage and the Borrowers' fight for survival have made him want to live through the operation. Arrietty gives him her hair clip as a token of remembrance. The Borrowers leave in a floating teapot with Spiller.  The Disney international dubbed version contains a final monologue, where Shō states that he never saw Arrietty again and returned to the home a year later, indicating that the operation had been successful. He is happy to hear rumors of objects disappearing in his neighbors' homes.

Tinne, a village abandoned to its own destiny in the middle of Mesopotamia, in the Southeast of Turkey, has been intentionally or unintentionally ‘forgotten’ by the government for years. Its inhabitants don’t even have any record in the civil registry. Neither Tinne, nor any of its people exist officially, whereas Yusuf Agha and its whole family have been living in this land for over a century.  Even though Yusuf Agha constantly tries to get in touch with the government, he cannot get a reply to any of his letters. Hoping that his son will get a certificate of identification, he decides to leave his newborn son Ibrahim in the courtyard of the college while many others leave theirs in the mosque’s courtyard. Luckily, Priest Hanna who happens to pass by there comes to Ibrahim’s rescue. He adopts him so that he has identification, so that he exists, and by his existence, makes Tinne finally exist.  Now-30-year-old Ibrahim returns to his homeland having finished his military service and graduated from college. He is enthusiastically and joyfully welcomed in the village. The only hope for Tinne, the village’s unique source of pride is back, bringing with him the chance for Tinne to start to exist, to become wealthy, to have a school, a roadway, a clinic and to become modern.  However, Ibrahim’s heart is left in far away lands. Even though the facts that he received his college degree, that he finished his military service and that he is in love with a girl are greeted with happiness, this whole picture turns into a complete shock with Yusuf Agha hearing the girl’s name: Jessica. So, where is this Jessica from? What family does she belong to? Ibrahim answers: Colorado! The family is completely bewildered. Kolarado???  Ibrahim, while studying Fishery Engineering at the University of Çukurova, met Jessica who worked as an interpreter in America’s military base in Incirlik-Adana and he quickly fell in love with her. She became the reason of his life, so he did for her. They both had a hard time trying to convince their families.  For Ibrahim’s family, it is a major issue to travel to the United States from Tinne, considering that they don’t even have identification cards. Finally, Jessica manages to take her father Christopher, her mother Pamela and her brother Danny to Tinne. This is the arrival of America to Tinne, which is not heard of, seen or known by the Turkish government.  After this moment, everything becomes a reason for bewilderment and confusion, one after the other.

Badmaash Company
 In 1994 middle-class [[Bombay]], three ordinary youngsters, Karan ([[Shahid Kapoor]]), Zing ([[Meiyang Chang]]) and Chandu ([[Vir Das]]) graduate from college and go for a trip to Bangkok, Thailand, where they meet Bulbul ([[Anushka Sharma]]) and they start a business together. Karan eventually falls in love with her. Karan tells her that he always wanted to start his own business but his father Sajjan Kapoor ([[Anupam Kher]]) wants him to study MBA. On the other hand, Bulbul confesses that she wants to be a super model and advises Karan that he does not need a large amount of money to start a business, but a big "idea". Back in India, Sajjan has a heart attack. Karan's mother Maya ([[Kiran Juneja]]) pawns her jewelery in order to arrange some amount of money for better facilities and an AC room at hospital as his insurance could only afford a Non-AC room. This leaves Karan heart-broken, and he immediately decides to get rich by any means, he decides to start his own venture along with his friends. He comes up with an idea for smuggling branded [[Reebok]] shoes in India without any custom charges.  For this, they have to separate the consignment into two halves, one half with only left shoes in Calcutta and the other half with only right shoes in Madras. At both places, the buyer will refuse to receive the consignment, hence the entire consignment will be confiscated. The confiscated consignment will then be auctioned in which Chandu (in Calcutta) and Karan (in Madras) will buy the entire consignment, pretending they are scrap dealers. Once the right shoe pairs up with left shoe, the zero valued product comes into full value which can be sold at any profit without any custom charges. They name their venture "Friends and Company" and proceed to make a large fortune with it. When Karan is caught red-handed by Sajjan while putting away the black money, he explains the situation, including the fact that he is doing business with a smuggler. As a result, he is forced to leave the house and starts living with Bulbul and uses her to get contracts. After the government in India decides to reduce the import duty on foreign goods (including shoes), the friends decide to go to [[United States|America]]. They get help from Karan's Uncle Jazz ([[Pavan Malhotra]].) They do the same business in USA as they did in India, only this time they import Leather Gloves. In short time, the group becomes excessively rich and starts to live royally. The police starts to suspect Karan and his team, owing to which they change their business. Instead, one of the friends rents a lavish house for one hundred thousand dollars by taking a loan from a bank. Then the house will be sold to another friend and again that friend will take loan from the same bank, hence repeating the cycle. Since the property of the person  who cannot return the loan is used to be seized by the bank, one of them will declare thyself as bankrupt and the house gets seized, with an actual worth of one hundred thousand dollars, but the company wil have already gained two hundred thousand dollars' profit. However, Karan becomes too greedy and the group begins to fall apart. Karan and Zing get into an argument about Zing's excessive drinking. Zing leaves and opens his own bar. Bulbul leaves when she finds out that Karan has married another woman for a green card. Chandu gets married and quits the company to start a video store.  Alone and heartbroken, Karan visits India and secretly attends a function where Sajjan is being honored for his years of service to his company. Upon seeing this, he realizes his mistake. On his return to America, he is arrested and put in jail for 6 months. He is bailed out after Bulbul comes and gives up Zing's, Chandu's and her share from what they earned in the company. Karan starts working with his uncle. One day, he meets Bulbul, who is revealed to be pregnant with his child and the lovers reconcile. At Uncle Jazz's office, Karan finds out that his uncle's entire consignment of imported shirts from Madras has been rejected as the color bleeds after washing. The news reaches to stock market due to which Jazz company's share fall down to 30% . Karan sees an opportunity and thinks of another brilliant idea and Karan patches up with Zing, Chandu and his family to start another new venture. This time, he makes Jazz's buyers believe that his company offers a new kind of shirt in market, which changes its color every time it is washed, hence a common man gets a new shirt every time he washes it. The buyers orders a trial order of 5,000 pieces and the public goes crazy over this new shirt, due to which Karan gets another order, this time for much bigger amount of shirts. The shares of Jazz's company go skyrocketed as the public really appreciates and buys the shirts at an overwhelming high rate, hence recovering his Uncle Jazz' loss. Karan, Zing, Chandu and Bulbul are now partners with Jazz in "Friends and Company", but it is turned into a public limited company. With his wife, son, friends and having made his father proud, Karan is finally content with his life.

At their lavish wedding, Barney meets Miriam Grant (Pike), and immediately falls in love. He tells Miriam his feelings for her that night but she rejects him. Despite his marriage, Barney sends Miriam flowers and gifts. Barney later picks up Boogie, who is in the middle of detox therapy, for a few days at Barney's lake house. He eventually finds Boogie in bed with his wife. Barney is at first overjoyed that he has an excuse to divorce her and pursue Miriam, but questions Boogie's integrity. The two argue, firing rounds from Barney's gun into the air before Barney collapses onto his dock and passes out, and a drunk Boogie falls backwards into the lake. When Barney awakens, it appears that he has shot Boogie. An abusive detective (Mark Addy) tries to beat a confession out of Barney until Barney's father, Izzy (Hoffman), intervenes. Barney continues to believe that Boogie ran away, and throughout the movie waits for him to reappear.  With his divorce finalized, Barney asks Miriam out on a date. He travels to New York City to meet her, and they finally begin a relationship. They marry and have two children as Barney gets a job producing a television series. Izzy later dies in a brothel, causing Barney to laugh and cry and call his father a "King". Barney and Miriam live happily until, on another vacation to the lake house, Barney meets Blair (Bruce Greenwood), who works in radio, Miriam's old line of work. There is an immediate platonic connection between Blair and Miriam, much to Barney's noticeable consternation.  After Barney and Miriam's son, Michael, leaves the family home, Miriam informs Barney of her intention to return to work. He attempts to dissuade her but she persists and secures employment, thanks to support from Blair.  Miriam begins work on a radio station but Barney misses her first on air interview - because he "was drunk and watching the hockey game, like has happened a thousand times before".  Barney is rude and dismissive to Miriam's colleagues but she remains steadfastly faithful to him despite his picaresque behaviour. Eventually his bad behaviour results in Miriam taking a week long visit to their son Michael's place in NYC.  While Miriam is absent, Barney gets drunk at a bar and ends up having sex with a former actress on his show. Miriam returns from NYC and is eager to pick up where they left off but Barney tells her about his infidelity and the two divorce. Miriam later marries Blair.  Barney, who displayed small signs of a deteriorating memory earlier in the film, forgetting where he had left his car on two occasions, now begins to show signs of acute memory loss, potentially Alzheimer's Disease or Dementia, though a clear diagnosis is never given.  Boogie's body is discovered in the mountains near the lake house, apparently dead from injuries suggestive of a sky diving accident.  Barney and Miriam meet for lunch in a favourite restaurant and she offers help, as a friend. She goes to the bathroom and when she returns Barney has paid for the meal but forgotten his wallet. She follows him and, by the time she catches up to him, he has forgotten that they were divorced. He speaks to her as if it was years earlier, assuming that they're still married and that their children are quite young.  Barney's condition worsens until his death.  While his children are helping settle some of his affairs at the lake house, they observe a "[[water bomber]]" plane scoop up water from the lake and dump it on a fire on the mountainside, showing the children what had probably happened to Boogie.  The final scene shows Miriam visiting Barney's grave, leaving roses at a tombstone bearing both of their names.

Beck (manga)
   Yukio Tanaka, known as "Koyuki" by his friends, is a regular 14-year-old Japanese boy starting eighth grade in junior high school. His boring life is changed when he saves an odd-looking dog, named Beck, from some kids. Beck's owner turns out to be an emerging rock musician, 16-year-old Ryusuke Minami, who soon influences Koyuki to start playing the guitar. The story focuses on the trials and tribulations of their [[rock music|rock]] band named ''Beck'', and Koyuki's relationships with its members, in particular Ryusuke and his 14-year-old half-sister Maho.  After hanging out with Ryusuke and seeing him play with his former band, Koyuki slowly becomes interested in Western rock music. Ryusuke gives him a guitar, but when Koyuki breaks it, Ryusuke tells him never to speak to him again. At the same time, Ryusuke forms his new band Beck, with vocalist Tsunemi Chiba, bassist Yoshiyuki Taira, and Togo, the drummer from his previous band. Koyuki begins working for, and learning guitar from, 44-year-old Kenichi Saitou in exchange to have the guitar fixed.  He reunites with Ryusuke a year later, and begins to rehearse with Beck. Koyuki then makes friends with his classmate Yuji "Saku" Sakurai. When Togo leaves the band, Ryusuke has Koyuki and Saku join Beck as support musicians, becoming full members only when the band hears Koyuki sing. Eventually Beck releases their first album, which gets released on an independent record label in the United States, under the band name Mongolian Chop Squad. After gaining popularity from their US album and Koyuki being in an internationally screened concert documentary, Beck earns a spot at the music festival Grateful Sound 5, where they put on the most talked about show of the whole festival. (The live-action film adaptation ends here.) However, circumstances cause them to part ways, making it their last performance.  Finding life tedious without being in Beck, Koyuki slowly gets the members back together, except Ryusuke, whose whereabouts are unknown. They perform a few shows as a quartet, before getting an offer to tour the US based on their Grateful Sound 5 performance. After Koyuki and Saku drop out of school to do the tour, Beck heads to America. But after several bad performances, they are about to get kicked off the tour before reuniting with Ryusuke in [[Seattle]]. (The anime adaptation ends here.) The rest of the tour is a hit and they end up appearing on national TV before heading back to Japan.  After releasing two singles, Beck goes on a nationwide tour of Japan and earn a spot at Grateful Sound 7. However, they are later cut from the lineup. They slowly bounce back after forming a tour with several similar-sounding bands, get signed to a popular British indie record label, and start recording their first full album. The now-famous director who created the concert documentary Koyuki once appeared in ends up directing their first music video. Their album and music video do well both in Japan and England, earning them numerous magazine articles in both countries. After another nationwide tour of Japan, they do a short tour of England, including a spot at the relaunch of the legendary Avalon Festival. The band then signs to a major international record label and records their major debut album in [[New York City|New York]]. With the album hugely successful worldwide, they tour Japan and America extensively, and the series then ends with Beck headlining the main stage at Grateful Sound 9.  
Bear (2010 film)
 Businessman Sam, his wife Liz and his musician brother Nick with his girlfriend Christine are driving through a remote countryside to their father's birthday dinner. Several miles into a back road shortcut, they get a flat tire and are unable to get a cell phone signal to call for help. While repairing the tire, Sam berates Nick for wasting his life being a musician, his latest fling with Christine being another mistake on his judgement list.  As they are arguing, they are approached by a [[grizzly bear]]. Despite Nick's efforts to convince the group to calmly leave, Sam takes matters into his own hands and shoots the bear down with a handgun. After the bear dies, they are approached by a larger male bear who charges them in revenge, causing them to retreat into their minivan. In his rage, the bear overturns the minivan, trapping the humans inside.  After striding around for several minutes, the bear leaves, allowing the crew to turn the minivan over. But as they start driving, the axles break under both sets of tires, stranding them again. The group tries to leave on foot, but they are ambushed by the bear who chases them to an out-of-ground pipe. He tricks them into leaving for the minivan and attacks again; this time he is able to catch Christine who is killed while the others watch.  Nick begins to think that the bear is taking out his revenge on them one-by-one due to a Native American legend that bears are actually the reincarnated spirits of shaman and are capable of human thoughts and emotion. Sam dismisses this and they set a trap to try to keep the bear in the car in order for them to escape. The trap is sprung, but Nick is nearly killed by the bear, forcing Sam and Liz to release the bear and retreat back into the vehicle themselves.  Sam opts as a [[marathon runner]] to jog the several miles to the restaurant, but when he arrives he is attacked by the bear before he can get help. Meanwhile, Liz tells Nick that she and Sam have been having serious financial troubles which has caused a rift in their marriage putting him into extraordinary debt and possibly under scrutiny for embezzlement from Sam's company, which is the reason he gave their father a Porsche (as the banks then wouldn't be able to collect it).  Sam is returned rather violently by the bear and released to climb into the car. Nick surmises there must be a reason Sam had been returned, and Liz reveals to him that she's pregnant. But it was established earlier that due to the rift in their marriage, they hadn't slept together in about six months while she is two months pregnant. Nick realizes that he is the father, from an affair he and Liz had months prior.  This breaks Sam's heart as Nick realizes the true reason the bear had locked all three of them together; Sam, realizing that Liz might be happier with Nick, offers to sacrifice himself and attack the bear so the other two can escape. As he is dying, Nick rushes to help and is killed as well. The bear then approaches Liz, who sinks to her knees as the bear sniffs her, closing her eyes ready to die. But the attack never comes, and the bear instead leaves her alone, likely having sensed her pregnancy. As she begins down the road by herself, the camera turns to the bodies of Sam and Nick lying next to each other and the screen goes black.

Before the Rain (2010 film)
   
Belle Épine
  The nearly 17-year-old Prudence Friedman (Léa Seydoux) is struggling to cope with her mother’s death and her father, similarly upset, has now been in Canada much longer than the 48 hours it should’ve taken to settle his client’s inheritance. Over the phone, Prudence keeps up the pretence that she and her sister are living together in the family apartment but, in reality, Frédérique has moved out, unable to handle the painful memories of their mother’s death there.  The film opens with Prudence and Marilyne Santamaria (Agathe Schlencker) – a girl who goes to the same school as Prudence but doesn’t know her well – being strip-searched by mall security. Prudence manages to get away with a bracelet by hiding it in her underwear. When the girls are released, Prudence watches from behind cover as Marilyne rides off with a group of bikers.  The next day, Prudence finds Marilyne in the mall and trails her to a diner. After Marilyne casually confronts her, Prudence invites the girl back to her apartment. Marilyne enjoys having the run of the apartment, eating the food, messing with the Friedman parents’ possessions and putting her feet, in their worn red heels, all over the furniture. The girls make a deal: Prudence will give Marilyne a key if Marilyne takes her to see the notorious bike races on the Rungis.  The pair’s plans to go to the Rungis are ruined when Frédérique shows up to take Prudence to a dinner with their Jewish extended family, the Cohens. Throughout dinner, Prudence remains quietly agitated, listening distractedly as her effeminate cousin Daniel argues with his devout father, Michel. Later that night, she convinces her cousin Sonia (Anaïs Demoustier) to sneak out with her. Scared of her father’s reaction, Sonia gets off the bus before it reaches the Rungis, leaving Prudence to go on alone and meet up with Marilyne. At the Rungis, she eyes Reynald Coste – a biker she heard on the radio – and his gang with great interest. Marilyne and her boyfriend spend the night at Prudence’s place and the next morning Marilyne reveals to Prudence that she lost her virginity last night.  Prudence, eager for more thrills, decides to hold a party at her apartment later that week. Sonia lets her cousin dye her hair in preparation for the night but Prudence accidentally makes it overly blonde. Already disgruntled about the hair, Sonia ends up leaving the party early after she’s aggressively hit on by a strange biker and sees Prudence sitting idly by while Marilyne dresses her male friends in Prudence’s dead mother’s clothes for a laugh.  Prudence, wearing her mother’s perfume and the red heels she borrowed from Marilyne, flirts and makes out with Reynald and she goes for a night-time bike ride with him and his two friends, Gerard and Franck. Come the morning, the four of them find themselves by a wintery beach. Franck lends Prudence his scarf before joining the other men for a swim. Prudence finds an angry Frédérique waiting for her when she returns home but the two, rather than arguing, end up bonding over the loss of their mother.  At the mall, Prudence snaps at her cousin Sonia for calling Frédérique the previous night. Sonia responds by telling her that she does not want to be friends anymore and that Prudence is "boring" now. Upset, Prudence sees one of Reynald’s gang, Franck, being measured for a suit and gets the idea to go visit him at his workplace later under the pretence of returning his scarf. The two nearly have sex on the factory floor but Franck gets self-conscious and they instead agree to go to a concert in the evening.  With even Marilyne too busy to keep up with Prudence’s nightly partying, Prudence and Franck go to the concert without her. They end up having sex at Franck’s place and, in the morning, Prudence wakes up to find that he’s already left for work. She gets dressed and stumbles across Franck’s kindly mother, Delphine, in the kitchen.  At the cinema in the evening, Prudence tries to bail on the group without explanation and Franck finally tires of her strange behaviour. She waits outside in the rain but when the others come out after the film finishes, Maryline ignores her and Franck tries to spite her by spontaneously inviting another girl to ride with him. Prudence makes her own way to the Rungis but, when she gets there, finds that there’s been an accident. Franck has crashed, killing the girl riding with him. Maryline, Franck and his mother, Delphine, all watch as the girl’s body is taken away.  Back at the apartment, Prudence breaks down and imagines a conversation with her mother. She apologises for not calling 911 sooner after her mother suddenly fell ill. Returning to reality, she puts in her mother’s hearing aid and stands on the balcony, crying as sirens sound in the distance and the sun comes out from behind the clouds.

Having adopted Graham's psychopathic behavior, Martin goes upstairs to Allison's cousin, who screams. The house burns down. Martin returns to the farmhouse, killing Graham with an axe. The next morning, the authorities arrive at the smoldering ruins of the house to find that the Millers' beagle is the sole survivor.  Martin uses bones from Graham's remains to construct a skeletal shrine in the farmhouse, with the bull's skull as the head. Martin then stares out the window, waiting for his next victim.  In a post-credit scene set five years later, a young girl (Courtney Harrison from ''Malevolence''), flees from an unseen pursuer. She enters the farmhouse and discovers Martin, who is now an adult, sitting at a table. When she asks for help, Martin turns around, looking deranged look, and the film ends.  
Beneath Hill 60
 As seen in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] that occur throughout the film, Oliver Woodward is an [[Australian]] [[miner]] supplying [[copper]] for the [[World War I|war]] effort. He falls in love with Marjorie Waddell, a young woman ten years his junior. However, he is under constant [[white feather|pressure]] to enlist, especially from Waddell's father. He has the opportunity to do so when the [[British Army]] forms the [[Royal Australian Engineers|1st Australian Tunnelling Company]] to supplement the [[Royal Engineers]]; Woodward is [[commissioned officer|commissioned]] to lead the unit.  On the Western Front, Woodward meets Frank Tiffin, a young Australian soldier who is suffering from [[shell shock]]. Woodward reassigns Tom Dwyer and Norman Morris to relieve Tiffin. Two German tunnelers break through into the tunnel. Morris and Dwyer dispatch both of them, but Dwyer is killed when a German explosive goes off, bringing down the tunnel on top of them; Morris is rescued by the other [[sapper]]s.  Woodward is later tasked with destroying the Red House, a fortified German position raining [[enfilade]] fire down upon the frontmost section of the British trenches. Although Woodward initially proposed tunneling beneath the Red House, his commanding officer, Colonel Wilson Rutledge, insisted that it be done by dawn. Along with Corporal Bill Fraser and Morris, Woodward crosses [[No Man's Land]]. They manage to reach the Red House and plant explosives underneath it. However, as they make their way back to the British lines, they discover that the reel of cable is too short, so Morris runs ahead to retrieve the exploder. While they wait, they discover mortally wounded Lieutenant Robert Clayton, who had been ordered to cut a gap in the wire obstacle for them. Morris arrives with the exploder and they destroy the Red House.  The next day, after a friendly game of [[Rugby football|rugby]] league against some British soldiers, Woodward is promoted to captain and he subsequently promotes Fraser to Sergeant, he later receives word that they are to be moved up the lines to the Ypres Salient. Upon their arrival, Tiffin, Walter Sneddon and Billy Bacon are separated from the rest of the battalion and pinned down by German machine gun fire. Bacon, being the fastest runner, volunteers to distract the Germans while the others make a run for the British lines. Although Tiffin and Walter succeed, Bacon is killed mere inches from safety.  The unit continues on to Hill 60. During an inspection, it is revealed that the Canadian Engineers have been tunneling deep below the [[Messines Ridge]] for months, planting a million pounds of [[ammonium nitrate]] in the form of 21 massive mines. Woodward is tasked with maintaining the tunnels as the British military buildup begins; they hope to kill as many German troops as possible. To this end, he constructs an enormous shaft to keep the water table from inundating the explosives. He also digs multiple diversion tunnels to throw the Germans off. Jim Sneddon (Walter's Dad), is buried in one such tunnel when he is ordered into it by Colonel Rutledge, despite reporting that the Germans would likely be setting off the explosives soon.  The Germans eventually catch on to their plan and dig toward the main tunnel. An attack tunnel is dug in response, and the Australians successfully destroy the exploratory shaft with minutes to spare. However, the charge that was used weakens the clay and a portion of the tunnel collapses, trapping Tiffin. His compatriots race to stall the detonation of the mines, but the schedule cannot be delayed on account of one man. Woodward detonates two of the [[Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917)| mines fired]] at the start of the [[Battle of Messines (1917)|Battle of Messines]].  Woodward returns to Australia and the surviving members of the unit gather for his wedding with Marjorie.

Eventually, he finds Chul in an [[internment camp]] but Chul resents Hyuk for leaving behind the family to escape. It is then revealed that their mother was killed sometime after Hyuk's escape.  Hyuk goes to [[Thailand]] to complete an arms deal, accompanied by Jung Tae-min ([[Jo Han-sun]]), a new member of the smuggling operation. However they were [[Double cross (betrayal)|double-crossed]] by Jung and the Thai gang. Jung escapes, while Hyuk is captured and sentenced to prison for three years. After reading about Hyuk's capture in the newspaper, Lee finds the Thai gangster in a [[massage parlor]] and kills him and his henchmen. However, in the ensuing gunfight, he is shot in the knee and crippled.  After Hyuk is released from custody. Remorseful and determined to start a new life, he finds work as a taxi driver. Meanwhile, Chul has become an officer in the National Police and Jung has become the leader of the arms smuggling operation, while Lee does odd jobs to survive. During an emotional reunion, Lee asks Hyuk to return to the underworld to take revenge on Jung, but Hyuk refuses.  Hyuk seeks Chul out, hoping for a reconciliation, but Chul rebuffs him, seeing Hyuk as nothing but a criminal and still resentful that Hyuk left the family in North Korea. Jung finds Hyuk and presses him to rejoin the organization, offering to bring Young-choon along if Hyuk rejoins, but Hyuk refuses. Meanwhile, Chul is obsessed with arresting Jung and bringing down the arms operation. After Jung has Young-choon beaten and threatens to harm Chul, Hyuk decides to join Young-choon in taking revenge on Jung. Hyuk and Young-choon steal incriminating evidence from the smuggling business and use it to ransom Jung in exchange for money and an escape boat. However, Hyuk has given the evidence to the police. Using Jung as a hostage, Hyuk and Young-choon take the money to a pier, intending to escape in the boat. Meanwhile, having followed his brother, Chul arrives on the scene but is captured by Jung's men. Even though he is free to escape, Hyuk decides to return to save Chul and asks Young-choon to leave on his own.  Hyuk returns and offers to exchange Jung for Chul, but the trade explodes into a wild shootout. Hyuk and Chul are wounded and pinned down, but saved by Young-choon, who turned the boat around out of loyalty to Hyuk. After killing many of Jung's men, Young-choon berates Chul, telling him that he should be grateful to have a brother like Hyuk. Young-choon is in turn gunned down by Jung's men. The police arrive and begin arresting Jung's men.  Jung evades capture and escapes into a steelyard.  Hyuk and Chul chase after him, but Hyuk is shot and killed when he shields Chul from Jung's gunfire. Jung mocks Chul and prepares to surrender to the surrounding police.  Despite warnings from the police to drop his weapon, Chul shoots and kills Jung. As the police advance, Chul cradles his brother's body in his arms and tearfully laments that he missed him. He aims his gun to his head and the scene cuts to black as a single gunshot is heard.

Beyond the Black Rainbow
  In the 1960s, Dr. Arboria founded the Arboria Institute, a [[New Age]] research facility dedicated to finding a reconciliation between science and spirituality, allowing humans to move into a new age of perpetual happiness. In the 1980s, Arboria's work has been taken over by his protégé, Dr. Barry Nyle. Outwardly a charming, handsome scientist, Nyle is in fact a psychopath who has been keeping Elena, a young girl, captive in an elaborate prison that doubles as a hospital beneath the Institute. Elena demonstrates psychic capabilities, which Nyle can suppress, using a glowing, prismatic device.  In an effort to understand Elena's abilities, Nyle subjects her to daily therapy sessions, which take the form of interrogations, during which Elena only communicates by way of [[telepathic]] demands to see her father. By night, Elena is kept in a brightly lit, completely white room, with only a television for companionship. Nyle spends his own nights at home with his wife, a docile, servile woman who gives Nyle endless praise and exists in a state of constant stupor. Nyle takes massive quantities of prescription medication and disguises his complete lack of hair and the color of his irises by way of an elaborate wig and contact lenses.  Attempting to elicit an emotional response from Elena, Nyle speaks to her about her dead mother, who he calls "beautiful" and "desirable". He then hints to her that a photo of her mother might be in her room. Later she discovers the photo under her bed.  That evening, Margo, (a nurse or orderly who works with Elena), is about to go home when she discovers Nyle's case notes on Elena in a wall cavity. In it are strange symbols and images that indicate Nyle's violent sexual obsession with Elena. Fearful of what the notes contain, Margo puts the notes back. Soon afterwards, Nyle receives a phone call and rushes back to the Institute where he discovers ash from Margo's cigarette near the case notes. Nyle takes a psychedelic drug to calm himself.  Suspicious of Margo, Nyle informs her the next day that Elena has somehow smuggled contraband into her room. When Margo attempts to forcibly take the photograph from Elena, Elena kills her by psychically crushing her head. Nyle, monitoring Elena's actions, is intrigued by this blatant display of psychic ability and pleased at Margo's death. He allows Elena to leave her cell, then activates the prism, causing her to convulse and pass out. While unconscious, Elena is approached by a massive entity in a red space suit (identified as a "Sentionaut"), who injects her with a syringe before walking off.  Nyle goes to see Dr. Arboria, now aged, somewhere on the grounds of the Institute. Displaying signs of senility, Arboria remains either ignorant or indifferent of Nyle's psychosis, regarding him as his best protégé. A flashback to 1966 reveals that Elena's mother was Dr. Arboria's wife, who was present when Arboria himself led a young Nyle through a procedure meant to allow him to achieve [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]. As a part of the procedure, Nyle was submerged in a vat of black liquid, providing him with hellish, otherworldly visions; Nyle emerged from the vat insane, fatally attacking Mrs. Arboria. An unperturbed Dr. Arboria is shown submerging the infant Elena in the black liquid. Back in the present, Nyle kills Arboria by administering a drug overdose.  Nyle returns home and presents himself to his wife without his wig or contacts and tries torturously to explain his inner pain to her before crushing her head. Meanwhile, Elena makes her torturous escape from the Aboria Institute, encountering a [[zombie]]-like "mutant", apparently another research subject. She encounters a lone Sentionaut who, instead of capturing Elena, removes its face mask to reveal a mutated, childlike face. Nyle, having dissolved his final contact to the material world, collects a ceremonial dagger he calls "The Devil's Tear-Drop", and heads out in pursuit of Elena. While chasing her through the woods surrounding the Institute, he encounters a pair of "heshers", who he kills with his dagger after insisting one of them had sex with Elena.  Nyle eventually corners Elena in a clearing and repeatedly implores her to "Come to me". Elena uses her psychic abilities to keep Nyle's feet planted in the ground. Trying to leap forward, Nyle flings his head fatally onto a rock. Free of her captor, Elena follows the light generated by a television set to a nearby town. Following the credits, the camera focuses on an [[action figure]] of a Sentionaut lying on a carpet. A voice can be heard, recorded in reverse, before the film ends. Played in reverse, the voice says "I've lost visual contact. Do you read? Repeat, do you read?"

Even he continues to attack Ray Striker. In order to stop Helios from attacking Ray Striker, Benkei, Kenta and Yu launch their beys.

Black Death (film)
 In 1348 in a plague-ridden medieval England, Osmund, a young monk, is in love despite his vows with a girl named Averill, who tells him that when she leaves the monastery to escape the disease, she will wait for him for one week at a meeting place in the forest so they can run away together. Shortly after, a group of mercenaries led by the knight Ulric arrives and takes Osmund as a guide on a quest in the forest, which Ulric later reveals to be a search for a remote marshland village which has remained untouched by the Black Death, and is said to sacrifice people in order to remain free of the plague and to be led by a [[necromancer]] whom the group intends to bring back to the Bishop.  On the way to the village, Osmund leaves the group while they are sleeping to meet with Averill at their meeting spot, but only finds her horse and torn blood-stained clothing. The group is attacked by bandits, resulting in Osmund being severely wounded, and ultimately find the village, an eerie disease-free utopia led by a beautiful woman, Langiva. Pretending to seek shelter to draw the necromancer out, the group grows suspicious of the villagers, as they find evidence of the passage of another group previously sent before them.  Langiva takes Osmund to the body of Averill, claiming to have found her injured in the woods. That night, while the town has a feast to welcome their guests, Langiva leads Osmund into the forest where many women are performing a ritual during which Langiva appears to raise Averill from the dead. Osmund finds the crucified corpses of previous men sent by the church, and the entire group is taken prisoner and tied in a pit of water. Revealing that they know of the group's true intentions, Langiva and the villagers invite the group to renounce God, leading to one being killed; another accepts, but is killed in secret anyway. Langiva tells Osmund that if he renounces God, he will be reunited with a resurrected Averill; however, Osmund realizes that despite looking alive, she cannot speak or even recognize him, and as the result kills her to free her soul from her undead state. As he is beaten up by the villagers, Osmund manages to drop a knife next to the remaining prisoners. Before being executed, Ulric reveals that he is infected with the plague, and as such, he has been infecting the water pit ever since the group got trapped in it, therefore infecting the previously plague-free village; his gruesome execution only makes the infection more certain.  After the surviving mercenaries free themselves and fight the villagers, Langiva claims to Osmund that she was never a witch, but simply a herbalist who is skilled with plants and drugs, and that Averill had never been dead at all; instead, she had simply been drugged, meaning that Osmund actually killed her. She then disappears into the mist and escapes. Osmund and the last surviving mercenary finally leave the village, bringing Langiva's second-in-command back to the Church. In the following years, the village becomes touched by the plague, while Osmund looses his heart, growing cold and cruel, dedicating himself to find Langiva; he punishes countless women in the name of God, believing them to be Langiva, and having seemingly lost his mind.

He is separated from their mother Marambra, who is a woman suffering from alcoholism and [[bipolar disorder]] and works as a prostitute. Having grown up an orphan, Uxbal has no family other than his more wealthy brother Tito, who works in the construction business (and sometimes solicits the services of Marambra). Uxbal earns a living by procuring work for illegal immigrants, a group of Chinese who make forged designer goods which a group of African street vendors then sell. He is a psychic medium to the dead and is sometimes paid for passing on messages from the recently deceased at wakes and funerals. When he is diagnosed with terminal [[prostate cancer]] leaving him with only a few months to live, his world progressively falls apart.  Uxbal initially begins [[chemotherapy]], but he later ends the treatment at the advice of his friend and alternative healer Bea. She also gives him two black stones which she asks him to give his children before he dies. The group of Africans are brutally arrested by the police, despite Uxbal's regular payment of [[bribe]]s, because they also deal in drugs. When one of them is deported back to [[Senegal]], Uxbal offers his wife Ige and baby son a room in his apartment. Meanwhile, an attempt at reconciliation with Marambra fails when Uxbal realizes she cannot be trusted to look after their children. As the Chinese are out of work, Tito brokers a deal to get them employed at a construction site. However, almost all of them die in the night from carbon monoxide poisoning, as the cheap gas heaters Uxbal bought in an effort to help were not safe. An attempt by a human trafficker to dump the bodies into the sea fails when they are washed up on the shore shortly after, causing a media sensation.  As Uxbal's health continues to deteriorate, he is plagued with guilt that he is responsible for the expulsion of the Senegalese and the death of the Chinese. With his death drawing nearer, he realizes that there will be nobody to take care of Ana and Mateo once he is gone. He entrusts the remainder of his savings to Ige, asking her to stay with the children after his death. She accepts his request but later decides to use the money to return to Africa. At the railway station she changes her mind,  however, and returns to the apartment. Knowing that Ige will now take care of his children, Uxbal lies down next to Ana and, after having passed on to her a diamond ring which his father had once given to his mother, he dies. In a [[Heaven|snowy winter landscape]] he is reunited with his father, who had died before Uxbal's birth shortly after having fled Spain for Mexico during the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]].

The Book of Eli
 Thirty years after a nuclear apocalypse,<ref name="girouxj1"></ref> Eli ([[Denzel Washington]]) travels on foot toward the west coast of the former United States. Along the way he demonstrates uncanny survival and fighting skills, hunting wildlife and swiftly defeating a group of [[Highwayman|desert bandits]] who try to ambush him. Searching for water, he arrives in a ramshackle town rebuilt and overseen by Carnegie ([[Gary Oldman]]). Carnegie dreams of building more towns and of controlling the people by using the power of a certain book. His [[henchmen]] scour the desolate landscape daily in search of it, but to no avail.  In town Eli barters with a store owner, the Engineer ([[Tom Waits]]), to recharge the battery of his portable music player. While waiting, he goes across the street to the town bar, where a gang of bikers attack, but he quickly kills all fifteen. Realizing Eli is a literate man like himself, Carnegie asks Eli to stay, making it clear that the offer is non-negotiable. After Carnegie's blind mistress Claudia ([[Jennifer Beals]]) gives Eli some food and water, Carnegie orders Claudia's daughter Solara ([[Mila Kunis]]) to seduce Eli, but he turns her down. While killing time, she finds his book. Unperturbed, Eli offers to share his food with her, and before they eat, he says [[grace (prayer)|grace]]. The following day, Solara repeats the prayer, but Carnegie overhears them and realizes Solara's words relate to the book he has been seeking. He soon forces Solara to tell him if Eli was reading a book, and realizes Eli's book is the one he wants—a [[Bible]].  Eli sneaks out of his room and Carnegie has his henchmen shoot at Eli, but the bullets seemingly just graze him, as if he is being protected. Eli shoots most of Carnegie's men and hits Carnegie in the leg with a ricocheted shotgun blast. Solara, having left the town, leads Eli to a cave which is the town's water supply, hoping she can accompany him on his travels. Eli traps her inside and continues on alone. Solara escapes and soon finds herself ambushed by two bandits who attempt to rape her, but Eli reappears and kills them. As they continue on, Eli explains his mission to Solara. According to Eli, his book is the last remaining copy of the Bible, as all other copies were intentionally destroyed following the nuclear war thirty years ago. He says he was led to the book by a voice in his head, which then directed him to travel westward to a place where it would be safe. The voice assured him that he would be protected and guided on his journey.  Eventually, Eli and Solara investigate an isolated house. They fall into a trap, but manage to allay the suspicions of the residents, George ([[Michael Gambon]]) and Martha ([[Frances de la Tour]]), who invite them in for tea. When Eli realizes that the couple are [[Cannibalism|cannibals]], they attempt to leave just as Carnegie and his henchmen arrive. In the ensuing shootout, George, Martha and many of Carnegie's men are killed. While Eli and Solara are captured, Carnegie threatens to kill Solara unless Eli surrenders the Bible. With the Bible now in his possession, Carnegie shoots Eli, leaving him for dead. Solara escapes and drives back to help Eli. Rather than chase her, Carnegie returns to the town, since his sole remaining vehicle is running low on fuel. Solara finds Eli, and they drive until they reach the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], and then row to [[Alcatraz Island]], where they find a group intent on preserving what they can of literature and music. Eli tells the guards that he has a copy of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible. Once inside, Eli, revealed to be blind, begins to dictate the Bible from memory to Lombardi ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), the leader of the group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/columnists/idolchatter/2010/01/the-book-of-eli-interview-with.html |title=‘The Book of Eli': Interview with Denzel Washington, Mila Kunis, and Gary Oldman |last1=Bakhshian |first1=Sara |date= January 2010 |website= |publisher= |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref><ref name="girouxj1" />  Meanwhile, back in the town, the Engineer opens the locked Bible where Carnegie discovers, to his dismay, that it is in [[Braille]], and orders Claudia to read it to him. She pretends that she cannot remember how to read it, telling Carnegie his leg wound has become [[Sepsis|infected]] and his men have begun to [[run amok]]. At the sanctuary, Eli has died, but not before he finished reciting the entire book. The printing press at Alcatraz begins producing copies of the Bible, and Lombardi places one on a bookshelf between the [[Torah]] and [[Tanakh]] on one side and the [[Quran]] on the other. Solara, though offered sanctuary, chooses to return home, taking with her Eli's machete and other possessions.

Stewart is confused with Milo by Irene's thugs and kidnapped in his place.  Earl tries to kill Nicole, but the two narrowly escape.

She comes out of the bathroom and overhears Milo telling Sid that he may sleep with Nicole, but he's taking her to jail.  She handcuffs Milo to the bed and makes her way to the [[tattoo]] parlor, finding Jimmy and freeing him before she is captured by Irene's thugs.  Milo rescues her at a [[strip club]]. He calls an old friend from the police force and learns that Bobby is on his way to the police's evidence warehouse, which is being relocated to a new building.

Bobby decides to arrest Earl, but Earl draws a gun and shoots him. Milo and Nicole enter the warehouse and Milo is ambushed, but Earl is forced to surrender when Nicole points a shotgun at him.  Bobby explains that Earl was using him, as well as the man who supposedly committed suicide, to gain access to the warehouse. There was no proof, so Bobby was waiting for Earl to make his move before arresting him. Milo proudly notes that Earl might have gotten away with it if Nicole hadn't picked up certain clues. He and Nicole appear to have reconciled. They concede that sometimes their jobs have to come first. Milo turns Nicole in to the police, so she can make her court hearing the next day.   On his way out of the precinct, Milo runs into a cop who insulted him earlier and punches him in the face. He is arrested and put in the cell next to Nicole's. He reminds her that it is their [[anniversary]] and they have to spend it together. Through the bars they admit their love and kiss.

Boy decides to make up for losing the money by leading Alamein to the marijuana crop owned by Dallas and Dynasty's father, and Alamein gathers the entire crop. The group are spotted running away by Dynasty, who stares at Boy, betrayed. Later, Alamein takes his gang out to celebrate. Whilst waiting in the car with Boy, Rocky tells his brother that he likes their father, and wants to get to know him better. Another car then drives up, and the local gang gets out. Boy sees Dynasty sitting in the front seat with a black eye. The gang approaches Alamein and the Crazy Horses, confronting them over stealing their marijuana.

While driving home, Alamein accidentally hits and kills Boy's goat.  The next day, Alamein is abandoned by his men, who steal the marijuana and the car. Boy visits his mother's grave, drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana, and finally comes to terms with the fact that all of his happy, early memories of his father are make-believe, and Alamein was in fact not even there when Rocky was born. Meanwhile, Alamein sits in the barn, depressed that he has been unable to find his money. Rocky comes up to him and attempts to comfort him with his 'powers,' telling Alamein that he is sorry he killed his mother by being born. Just then, Boy comes in and scatters the shredded money at Alamein's feet, then begins hitting his father, screaming to know why he wasn't there when Boy and Rocky's mother died. Boy tells Alamein that they are nothing alike, then returns to the house to take care of his cousins. The next morning, Boy and Rocky's grandmother returns home, and Alamein is gone.  Boy tells Rocky that Alamein has gone to Japan to train as a [[samurai]]. He reconnects with his friends and apologizes to Dynasty, then goes with Rocky to visit their mother's grave. The two boys find Alamein sitting there. Quietly, they join him, before Rocky asks, "How was Japan?"  
Book Girl (film)
 Shortly after entering high school, Konoha Inoue ([[Miyu Irino]]) is recruited into the literature club by Tohko Amano ([[Kana Hanazawa]]), the president and sole member of the club, after he witnesses her ripping out a page of a book and eating it. Instead of eating actual food, Tohko can only eat stories by consuming the paper they are printed on. Konoha spends his days after school writing short stories for Tohko as "snacks". Tohko had previously set up a birdhouse on the school grounds so anyone could ask the literature club to help them in matters of love by submitting letters. Tohko and Konoha find a piece of paper in the birdhouse one day, but there is only a childish illustration on it. Tohko recognizes the drawing to be from the original manuscript of [[Kenji Miyazawa]]'s poem "Songs of a Defeated Young Man". When Tohko finds the same image in the birdhouse five days in a row, they decide to stake out the scene at night, and they find Chia Takeda ([[Aki Toyosaki]]), a friend of Konoha's classmate Nanase Kotobuki ([[Nana Mizuki]]). She tells Konoha that the pictures are from Miu Asakura ([[Aya Hirano]]).  After New Years, Konoha goes to see Nanase in the hospital, who had fallen down the stairs. There, he finds Nanase confronting Miu, who had previously attempted to kill herself when she and Konoha were in junior high school. This was due in part to Konoha winning a new author's contest with his novel ''Similar to the Sky'', which he wrote under the pen name Miu Inoue. Miu had wanted to enter and win, though in the end she only sent in blank sheets to make Konoha believe she had participated. Miu eventually tells Konoha that she hates him. Later, she escapes from the hospital, and Konoha goes to find her at the roof of their junior high school, where she had tried to kill herself. After explaining her reasons for doing so, Konoha agrees to jump from the roof with her. Just as they are about to fall, Tohko arrives and Konoha manages to prevent Miu from jumping. However, back on street level, Miu jumps in front of a truck and gets hit. Afterward, Miu seemingly believes to be a fourth grader and has lost most mobility in her arms and legs, but Nanase interferes, which makes Miu give up the ruse.  Tohko takes them to a planetarium and draws parallels between Konoha and Miu and the main characters in ''Similar to the Sky''. Miu had always wanted to make people happy because her parents were always fighting as she grew up. Konoha tells Miu that he wrote the novel to tell her how much he loved her. Realizing that someone had loved her, Miu apologizes for everything she did to Konoha. When he realizes Tohko has disappeared, Konoha races to the train station and finds her there. She tells him that she got accepted to the university in [[Hokkaidō]] and that she can no longer eat his stories anymore. On the train, Tohko explains that she wants him to become everyone's author instead of keeping him all to herself. After Konoha departs the train, they have a final goodbye kiss and Tohko departs on the train. Years later, Konoha has put out his second novel titled ''Book Girl'', and an editor comes to his house to read his newest work before it gets released. It remains unclear whether the editor is Tohko or not.  
The Book of Zombie
 On Halloween in a small, sleepy town in Utah, David Driscoll and Jenny King, who are involved in a relationship gone cold, try to settle down for a romantic evening, but they are visited by two [[Mormon]] missionaries, who seem to suffer from a small affliction. David shrugs them off with a few bad jokes and tries to resume his evening plans when the Mormons ring again – this time, as blood-thirsty [[Zombie (fictional)|zombies]], along with several others who begin to overrun their neighborhood. After escaping their door-callers when one of them recoils from a soda thrown in his face, David decides to see an acquaintance, a convenience shop and bar owner named Harry Linderman, who owns a double-barrel shotgun. They reach the shop, only to meet a youth named Darwin Nedry and his substance-sniffing friend Charlie Cooper, who tell them that Linderman left with his gun after a phone call reached him from his medieval-themed bar, ''The Drunken Dragon''.  Not knowing how to retrieve their little daughter Charlotte, who is staying out of the house this night, without a weapon, David and Jenny decide to stay in the store for the time being. Soon, however, an armed, gritty hunter named Boothe Gardener stages a dramatic entrance into the store and stays for the night as well, following his own close brush with the zombified Mormon population in which his friend Charlie was killed. Owing to the incident at his house door, David concludes that the zombies are vulnerable to things which are taboo to Mormons, including caffeine. When a zombie breaks into the store, Gardener is mortally wounded after he tries to fight it off using non-caffeinated soda. Darwin destroys the zombie with caffeinated soda.  Forced to evacuate the store, David and company make for the ''Drunken Dragon'' but draw dozens of zombies. In the nick of time, they are led inside by armor-clad bartender Piper McKenzie, who tells them that Linderman was zombified during a zombie riot in the bar and is now kept locked up in a side room because she cannot bring herself to finish him. After discovering that Darwin keeps several explosive prank devices in his backpack, David devises a plan to reach Piper's car and get to his daughter by letting Linderman out, strapping the explosives and their scant soda supplies onto his back and using him as an involuntary suicide bomber to take out the zombies encroaching on the bar. The plan quickly goes awry when Linderman bites Darwin just after he is released, dooming him, before the youngster blasts his head with his own shotgun. Faced with no other choice, Darwin assumes the role of the bomber as a last heroic act, but he turns before he can light the fuse. Piper lights the explosives with a crossbow and fire arrow, but the blast proves too weak to take out all the zombies; before the door can be re-barricaded, the undead break into the bar and devour Piper alive, while Charlie faints.  Retreating into the main taproom, David and Jenny fight and destroy the undead, but by retreating too far, Jenny is caught by a zombie breaking through a window and mortally wounded. After promising Jenny that he will find their daughter, David hugs her until she dies, decapitates her to prevent reanimation, and then kills the remaining zombies in a berserk rage. As morning dawns, David staggers off, filled with revenge, to finish the undead, with an unsure Charlie in tow.  The film ends in some institution where a file labelled ''The Utah Project'' containing information about mutation warfare is presented to a group of boardroom-type people, followed by a file detailing an upcoming project ominously named ''The Vatican Solution''. As the file courier exits the boardroom, the camera backtracks his path to the reception of an office building, where a receptionist answers a phone call with the words, "Thank you for calling [[Church of Scientology]]. How may we help you?"

He sees abuse in everyday arguments among those around him. He trains in self-defense skills and begins to carry a weapon at night. During an attempted mugging, he kills a man. An eyewitness statement draws the interest of Teresa Ames, who has recently been promoted to the NYPD homicide division. She takes an interest in Sean, who frequents the police station as he searches for the information on his mother's murderer.   Teresa befriends him and learns about his life, including his interest in a toxin named Tricelaron. He insists it was part of his research for a chemistry paper. She also finds that he speaks fluent Chinese after he angrily berates rude staff in a Chinese restaurant. Later on, Sean defends a young woman who is being abused by her pimp. He fights with the pimp before shooting and killing him.  While riding the train, Sean encounters a unkempt man under the influence who is verbally threatening a Chinese family and other passengers of the train. In Chinese, Sean tells the boy to tell his family to leave the car. He puts on black face paint and brutally beats the man with brass knuckles. Teresa and her partner, who happen to be on the train, investigate, but Sean gets away without being identified.   Teresa learns that the perpetrator spoke fluent Chinese and suspects Sean. Despite her supervisor's warning not to investigate Sean, she persists. Finally, the now-retired supervisor tells Teresa that the young Sean was able to clearly identify his mother's murderer from a photo book, but his father Terry convinced him to change his story. The murderer is identified as Larry Childs, a contract killer, whom Teresa arrested six months ago, but has just managed to get a two-year sentence, and entry into the witness protection program through a plea bargain.  As Sean walks down the street, he sees parents disciplining their children, but they are inflated in his mind to abusive violence. During a school party, Sean has a violent flashback of his mother's murder, and recalls hearing the killer call his father by his old boxing nickname. Enraged by the memory, he savagely beats a fellow student who has been harassing a female friend. Teresa, while investigating Sean, finds a picture at his house of Terry and the murderer Larry together and realizes that they knew each other before the attack.   Sean believes that Terry staged the attack to obtain his mother's life insurance. Sean confronts his father, but Terry adamantly denies he killed his own wife. Convinced of his father's guilt, Sean shoots and kills Terry. Teresa finds Sean, but he says someone broke into their home and killed his father. Teresa sees the murder weapon and disposes of it.  Sometime later, Sean sends a letter to Larry, who is currently serving his two-year sentence. In the letter Sean expresses his forgiveness to Larry but pleads with him to reveal the truth of his mother's murder: was his father involved? He offers a simple way to reply and includes an self-addressed, empty envelope, a red stamp, and a black stamp. He asks Larry to use the black stamp if his father is guilty or the red stamp if his father is innocent. Larry licks the stamp and after handing it to a guard, falls to the floor of his jail cell, unable to breath. Sean has laced the stamp glue with Tricelaron and Larry dies. When Sean receives the letter, he stares at the red stamp it bears, indicating that his father was in fact innocent of the murder and Sean had killed him for nothing.

 Krishna alias Krish ([[N. T. Rama Rao Jr.]]) is the son of Surendra ([[Mukesh Rishi]]), a multimillionaire in Hyderabad. He is in a relationship with Indu ([[Samantha Ruth Prabhu]]), who has a friend Bhoomi ([[Kajal Aggarwal]]). Bhoomi's father Bhaanu Prasad ([[Prakash Raj]]) wants to get her married to her cousin suitor ([[Ajay (actor)|Ajay]]), who is a rowdy, which Bhoomi doesn’t like. Naturally, her grandfather Durga Prasad ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) tells to the family that she has already fallen in love with a guy in the city to halt the marriage. But Bhaanu Prasad asks Bhoomi bring her boyfriend home with her. Indu sends Krish as Bhoomi's lover just to let her escape the wedding situation.  Upon arriving in Bhoomi's village, Krish learns through Bhoomi about everyone in her family. He thinks that the people in her home are living as individuals and not as an actual family with bonds and emotions. Krish changes the attitudes of Bhoomi's uncles ( [[Raghu Babu]], [[Ahuti Prasad]]) who are lazy at home doing nothing, and successfully wins the heart of family members. Then Durga Prasad reveals to Krish that Bhaanu Prasad and his stepbrother Sivudu ([[Srihari]]) have been rivals for 25 years because Durga Prasad married a second time when his first wife died, against Bhaanu Prasad's wishes, and Sivudu is born to the new couple. This is the reason for Bhaanu Prasad's hatred towards Sivudu. Upon splitting their inherited wealth in half, the two brothers have their father Durga Prasad live in each of their households for six-month periods. Krish decides to reunite the two brothers, and succeeds, much to the happiness of the two families.  Bhaanu Prasad, impressed by Krish, accepts Bhoomi's love and decides to get them married. This worries Krish and Bhoomi as the initial plan was to only cancel the marriage of Bhoomi and her suitor, not to have Bhaanu Prasad accept their "relationship". Bhoomi's suitor, out of lust for her and anger on the wedding's cancellation, vows to get her by any means. The story takes a turn when Indu, who is none other than Sivudu's wife's sister's a.k.a. adopted daughter, arrives in the scene. Sivudu decides to get Indu married to her lover alongside Bhoomi's marriage, not aware of Krish's real identity. Indu then lies to Sivudu that her lover has ditched her in order to save Krish's act. Sivudu orders his men to find Indu's lover's (Krish's) parents and bring them to him. Bhaanu Prasad also asks Krish to bring his parents to settle the marriage alliance. Indu sets up a fake father ([[Brahmanandam]]) and mother ([[Hema (actress)|Hema]]) for Krish before his parents arrive at the place. But when Krish's parents arrive at the scene, they are shocked to see Krish there (who they thought was on a world tour). Krish explains them the whole situation and has them play the game.  Bhaanu Prasad engages Bhoomi with Krish and tells them to decide when they want to marry. Just as when Krish thinks that all is settled and prepares to walk out of Bhoomi's life, Bhoomi reveals that she has fallen in love with Krish, which Indu overhears. Fate takes another turn when Bhoomi's suitor finds out about the real identities and reveals this to Sivudu, who confronts Indu. Bhaanu Prasad too learns of the act, and along with Sivudu, beats up Krish before Durga Prasad intervenes. Durga Prasad reveals to them that the act was created by him in order to save Bhoomi from her ruthless suitor. He also reveals that Krish did not cheat Indu (which is what Sivudu thinks), and in fact it was Indu who sent Krish. He also reveals to Bhaanu Prasad that Bhoomi is also in love with Krish.  Just as things cool down, Bhoomi's suitor takes Bhoomi away by force, only to be chased by Krish. Krish finally beats up Bhoomi's suitor into submission and leaves with Bhoomi. But another problem arises when Krish has to decide between Indu, whom he loves, and Bhoomi, who loves him. Suddenly Lord Krishna (portrayed holographically by [[N. T. Rama Rao]]) appears in front of him to tell Krish that it is part of his life. But when Krish asks for a solution, Lord Krishna disappears, leaving Krish's fate to the audience.

Buried (film)
 On October 23, 2006, Paul Conroy, an American civilian truck driver working in [[Iraq]], wakes up and finds himself buried alive in a wooden coffin, with only a [[Zippo]] lighter and a [[BlackBerry]] phone at hand. Although he initially has no idea how he got there, he starts to piece together what has happened to him. He remembers that his and several other trucks were ambushed by terrorists, who killed his colleagues; he was hit by a rock and passed out. He receives a call from his kidnapper, Jabir, demanding that he pay a ransom of $5 million by 9PM or he will be left in the coffin to die.  Conroy calls the [[Department of State|State Department]], which tells him that due to the [[Omnibus Counterterrorism Act of 1995|government policy of not negotiating with terrorists]], it will not pay the ransom but will try to rescue him. They connect him with Dan Brenner, head of the [[Hostage Working Group]], who tells Conroy they are doing their best to find him.  Jabir calls Conroy and demands he make a ransom video, threatening to execute one of his colleagues who survived the attack. Conroy insists that no one will pay $5 million, so Jabir drops the amount to $1 million. Despite his compliance in making a video, the kidnappers execute his colleague and send him the recording of it, which he watches in horror. Shortly afterwards, distant explosions shake the area, damaging his coffin, which begins to slowly fill with sand. Conroy continues sporadic phone calls with Brenner, skeptical of the man's promises of help. To reaffirm his wholehearted intentions, Brenner tells Conroy about a 26-year-old named Mark White who was rescued from a similar situation three weeks previously, telling him that the kid is home with his family and happy.  Later on, Conroy receives a phone call from his employers, who inform him that he was fired from his job due to an alleged prohibited relationship with a colleague (the one who was executed), and thus he and his family will not be entitled to any benefits or pension he earned during his time with the company. Brenner calls back and explains that the explosions that had damaged his coffin earlier were in fact several [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] bombings, and that his kidnappers may have been killed. Conroy begins to lose all hope and does a last [[will and testament]] in video form, giving his son all of his clothes and his wife his personal savings. Jabir calls back demanding that Conroy video record himself cutting his finger off, threatening Conroy's family back home in Michigan if he refuses, saying that he lost all of his children. Conroy records himself cutting off one of his fingers and sends the video.  Shortly after making the video, the cell phone rings, and Conroy begins to hear digging and distorted voices. The voices become clearer, saying to open the coffin, and the coffin opens. But abruptly, it becomes obvious that he hallucinated the encounter.  After some minutes, Brenner calls and tells Paul that they know where his location is and are driving out to rescue him, explaining that an insurgent gave them details of where to find a man who was buried alive. Conroy then receives a tearful call from his wife Linda, and he assures her that he is going to be okay. As sand continues to fill the coffin to dangerous levels, giving Conroy seconds left to live, Brenner calls back and tells him that he and the rescue team have arrived at the burial site. Through the phone, digging is heard, but Conroy cannot hear any digging around him. The team digs up a coffin and opens it, but it turns out that the insurgent led them to Mark White's coffin, the man Brenner claimed had been rescued. Now knowing that he is not going to be saved, Conroy tries to calm himself down as he accepts his tragic fate. The sand finally fills his coffin and he suffocates to death as the light goes out and the screen goes black. The last thing we hear is Brenner repeating, "I'm sorry, Paul, I'm so sorry," as the connection times out.  In a [[post-credits scene]], a lighter illuminates the name "Mark White" on the lid of the coffin, written by Paul earlier.  
Burlesque (2010 American film)
 Ali Rose (Aguilera) moves to [[Los Angeles]] after she quits her [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] job when her boss refuses to pay her. Once in L.A., she tries and fails at every audition she does until one night, she finds herself unknowingly in a [[American burlesque|burlesque]] club when she hears the music on the street. She finds Tess (Cher) and the dancers performing “Welcome to Burlesque” and decides to pursue a career on stage once she meets Jack (Gigandet) at the club's bar. Jack refers her to Tess for an audition, but she is instantly rejected and ushered out by Sean (Tucci). Instead of leaving, Ali begins serving customers at the club as a [[waitress]], while Jack asks Tess to give Ali a chance.  When Georgia (Hough) becomes [[pregnancy|pregnant]], auditions are held to replace her. Ali begins her audition when everyone leaves, and after performing "Wagon Wheel Watusi", persuades Tess to allow her to become one of the club's dancers, much to the annoyance of Nikki (Bell), the lead performer who is always late and caught drinking before numbers. One day Ali has to replace Nikki on stage because Nikki is too drunk to perform. Nikki sabotages the performance by turning off the music that the dancers usually lip sync to, but before the curtain is dropped down, Ali impresses everyone with her amazing singing skills. Tess immediately decides to have Ali become the main star of a whole new show at the club. It becomes increasingly popular and Ali enjoys her newfound stardom while Nikki fumes in the background. Despite the club's growing success, Tess is still unable to pay the bank the money that she owes.  One night after the club closes, Tess, worried with the club's economic prospects, sings "You Haven't Seen the Last of Me". A very jealous Nikki shows up drunk and picks a fight with Tess, calling Ali a "[[slut]] with mutant lungs" and feels that Tess has rejected their long-term friendship for Ali. Tess, who has grown frustrated with Nikki, questions her gratitude for the help she has received from her during her many drunken binges. Angered, Nikki quits on the spot (before falsely claiming that she slept with Vince after his and Tess's honeymoon), and the altercation ends when Tess angrily retaliates by smashing the passenger side window on Nikki's [[convertible]] with a [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]].  Meanwhile, Ali and Jack become romantically attracted to each other. However, Jack is unable to act on his growing feelings for Ali due to his engagement to his girlfriend, who is away in [[New York City]] for work as an actress. Marcus begins to become increasingly [[puppy love|infatuated]] with Ali, who begins to spend time with him, making Jack jealous. At Georgia's wedding, Jack appears to call off his engagement and becomes drunk. That night, Ali and Jack sleep together, but the following morning Jack's [[Engagement|fiancé]], Natalie (Agron), unexpectedly returns from her play and finds the two in bed together, angrily insisting that she and Jack never broke up. Jack denies this, and while trying to fix things, he asks Ali to leave. Feeling heartbroken and betrayed, Ali runs to Sean for support, and learns that Sean is gay, due to his having spent the night with Georgia's wedding DJ the night before. While making coffee, Ali receives a call from Marcus, and Sean prompts her to go with Marcus after his phone call, while Sean and Mark (the DJ) go on a date.  While spending time with Marcus, Ali learns about "[[air rights]]", which refers to the empty space above a building and what can be done with it. Ali breaks things off with Marcus after she sees his plans to build a skyscraper on the property the club is on; Marcus protests this, asking why this suddenly makes him "the bad guy", to which Ali replies, "It doesn't, Marcus. It just makes you the wrong guy".  Ali tells Tess about the predicament, and together they inform the owner of the new million-dollar condos across the street; fearing the loss of business that would result from the obstruction of his prospective tenants' view, he purchases the air rights to the club's property. The resulting money is enough for Tess to buy out Vince's share (as they are divorced and he wanted out of the club), pay off the bank, and re-fashion the club to her own vision. She also makes up with Nikki, who tells Tess that she claimed she slept with Vince just to hurt her, and rehires her at the club after Nikki tells her she wants to "come home".  Ali reunites with Jack after he tells her that it's over with Natalie for good. After she finally earns Nikki's respect, Ali performs "Show Me How You Burlesque", written by Jack (who refused to allow Ali to listen or see his music throughout the movie due to it not being "ready") with all of the dancers on stage, much to the crowds' delight.

Burke and Hare present the now-mangled corpse to Knox. After some negotiation, Knox agrees to pay them a good sum of money for each corpse they bring him for dissection. In addition to using cadavers in lectures, Knox is attempting to create a pictorial reference of the human body by using an early form of photography, using this he hopes to win royal patronage from the king when he comes to Holyrood Palace.  Burke and Hare try grave-digging to procure more cadavers, but fail (by digging up a long buried skeleton), then they run off chased by the militia, Burke gets shot in the rear.  Getting back to the inn they find Lucky drunk and barely conscious. Lucky says she is drinking because Joseph, another lodger at the inn, is near death. Not willing to wait for the outcome, Burke and Hare suffocate Joseph and take the body to Knox. Flushed with money Burke and Hare dress up for a night in a posher pub. There they meet a young former prostitute, Ginny Hawkins, who loudly performs an excerpt from ''[[Macbeth]]''. The patrons ignore her.

Hare comes home to find Lucky has cooked for him and is in good spirits, he is suspicious, then scared when Lucky tells him she knows what he and Burke have been up to, but surprisingly she thinks it's a good idea and makes Hare give her a pound per corpse, as a tax between man and wife.  Burke is kidnapped and bundled into a horse carriage by McTavish and Fergus, who have already captured Hare. McTavish threatens to kill them unless they give him half the money from Knox. Forced to agree, they are then thrown from the carriage. As they trek back to the inn, they plan a string of murders to make up their losses to McTavish. The people of Edinburgh becomes suspicious of all the deaths in the area as does Police Captain Tom McLintock of the militia. Missing posters of the dead are put up and Burke begins to panic, Hare says they have finished the murders and will go into the funeral parlour business.  McTavish kidnaps Hare again and attempts to [[Extortion|extort]] the remainder of the money.

He investigates Dr Knox and discovers 'photographs' of all the missing people dead and dissected, Knox tells McLintock about Burke and Hare.  McLintock arrests Burke and Ginny, and Hare and Lucky, while both couples are having sex.  In prison Burke is repentant but Hare tells him not to confess or all of them, including the women will be hung. Meanwhile the solicitor general and the lord provost want to keep the scandal out of the headlines- it would have ruined the reputation of Edinburgh's medical schools, and the money they generated. They gently coerce McLintock into a deal by making him a colonel, they then burn the photographs. McLintock tells the prisoners that if any one of them confesses to the murders, the others will go free. Burke agrees to confess if he and Ginny can finish what they were doing when McLintock apprehended them.  Just before Burke's hanging, Angus advises him to speak if he has any final words. Burke sees Ginny in the crowd, and says, "I did it for love."  Onscreen text over the credits describes the fates of all the characters in the story, concluding with an image of the actual skeleton of William Burke at the Anatomical Museum of the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]].<ref></ref>

Burning Bright (film)
  The film opens with a man driving a circus trailer down a silent road and it is revealed that he is attempting to purchase a [[Bengal tiger]] for the creation of a "Safari Ranch". When he doesn't think the tiger looks dangerous enough, the seller tells him a gruesome story and claims that the tiger is evil. Meanwhile, John's stepdaughter, Kelly ([[Briana Evigan]]) is with her [[autistic]] brother, Tom ([[Charlie Tahan]]), whom she has taken to a special hospital for him to be cared for while she is at college. However, Kelly's payment to the hospital is rejected and, upon calling her bank, she is informed that John withdrew all the money and closed the account.  After bringing the tiger home, John instructs his workers to board up the house in preparation for an approaching hurricane. As the windows are being secured, Kelly confronts John and begs him to give her the remainder of the money; he explains that he spent it all on the tiger. Kelly is angry with him, telling him that her mother (who committed suicide by taking an overdose of pills) wanted the money to go to Tom and Kelly. However, there was no official will, so John took the funds for himself. Upset, Kelly calls her college to defer her start until the second semester, citing family issues; however, she has already deferred twice, and her professor tells her that if she does not start college that semester, he will give the scholarship money to someone else.  Upon going home, she undresses and after sending Tom to bed, she sleeps herself and dreams of suffocating Tom so that she won't have to take care of him any more. While she sleeps, the front door is opened, and an unknown person releases the tiger into the house. When Kelly goes to the kitchen for a drink, she finds a note from John claiming that he has gone to the store. Returning upstairs, she sees the tiger cross the foyer beneath her.  She discovers that all of the windows and doors have been boarded up, and she is trapped. She is horrified to find that Tom is missing from his bed, but she is unable to use the house phone to call for help, as the hurricane has brought down the phone lines. After discovering her phone is not on the charger where it is supposed to be, she realizes that she might have dropped it down the laundry chute with her clothes. She sneaks into the laundry room to retrieve it, and makes another attempt to contact emergency services; due to the high volume of calls, however, she is unable to do so. She tries calling John, but his cell phone is in his car, which is parked outside of a bar. John is inside drinking beer and gambling.  Several close encounters follow between Kelly and the tiger; Kelly and Tom hide in John's study, with Kelly bleeding heavily as a result of her injuries from the tiger. She barricades the door with a desk and bandages her leg. She soon discovers that John has taken out life insurance policies on both her and Tom, and intends to collect the money upon their deaths. She finds a handgun, but there are only five bullets; she loads the gun and sneaks out into the hallway hoping to shoot the tiger, and tells Tom to go to the laundry room. As the tiger approaches, she cocks the gun and fires, but the first chamber is empty and Kelly is forced to flee.  In the laundry room, she is able to break the board-covered window and climbs out just as the tiger breaks in to the room and leaps to attack her. She runs to her car, but as she is trying to start the engine, she remembers that Tom is still alone in the house with the tiger. She returns to the house and climbs back in through the window. Upon finding Tom, she promises that she will never abandon him. She intends to lead him to the laundry room, but the tiger attacks. She then instructs Tom to climb into the massive chest freezer John had bought upon deciding to open the Safari Ranch, and she climbs into it as well. Safe from the tiger, she hums a lullaby for Tom, and he falls asleep.  The next morning, Kelly wakes to the faint sounds of drilling; John is removing the board from the front door. Kelly and Tom climb out of the freezer and walk into the foyer to see John wielding a rifle, intending to kill the tiger. Kelly pleads for John to let them go. It is then that John reveals that Kelly's mom was going to leave him, so he killed her and made it look like suicide. Following the murder, he removed Kelly and Tom from life insurance, and admits he was responsible for sending the tiger into the house to kill them. Suddenly, the tiger leaps and attacks John, breaking his spine. It then drags him a few feet away and proceeds to eat him, allowing Kelly and Tom to sneak out of the house. Standing outside among debris from the hurricane, Tom takes Kelly's hand and they begin to walk away.

Caged (2010 film)
   
Cairo Exit
  The story of ''Cairo Exit'' takes place in a small town in the outskirts of Cairo, [[Dar El Salaam]], a city inhabited by mostly lower-class, working-class Egyptians. From ancient times until the 1960s this was very fertile land but is now slums.  The town is close to [[Maadi]], an upper-class neighbourhood that locals call "the American Neighbourhood". The Nile runs through it. The city is one of the many slums that surround Cairo. In 20 minutes a person can leave old Cairo, the slums of Cairo that look like a medieval places to [[Zamalak]] or Maddi with their westernized hotels, houses and internet cafes. It is precisely the journey of the main character, Amal, through Cairo from the slums, to modern Cairo, to Coptic and Islamic Cairo.  This journey in the bewildering chaos of the city, the visual turmoil and disorder of colour is all part of the frame in ''Cairo Exit''.  In this story everyone wants to leave and everyone has a secret of his or her own. Cairo is a city of layers, ancient civilizations crumbled over each other, covered by modern way of life.  The challenge is to capture the light and dark contrasts of the city with fresh eyes— to create a visceral, immediate experience for audiences, immersing them in the sweltering heat and small alleyways.  Since we're shooting in the heart of the city's infamous but rarely explored slums, capturing their energy and urgency on-the-fly, with an unforced realism.  By using a hand-held camera to reflect the urgency of the city, the disorder of details and to activate the perception of loneliness for the characters. With a distilled narrative and a closely attentive camera, the story offer up characters, often members of what might be called the struggling classes, who are humanized through their daily choices.  Though the film is scrupulously naturalistic, in lighting, camera work, sound design, still somehow it belongs to the suspense genre, though it is suspense of character, not of plot. It is not so much a question of what will happen next, as of how the characters arrive, or fail to arrive, at a decision to act.  The Camera and the natural lighting will capture the rhythms of life and the raw reality of the streets. Using caressing natural light, early morning breath, orange tone for the city, dusty green for the in doors locations like the house of Amal. Earthy colours from most of the characters and capturing the neon blue, red and green lights that sweep Cairo at night.  The whole film is a constant discovery, each new image striking our eye in a fresh way; the impression unfolds before us. Another key feature is the moving between indoors and out doors location, completely objective, where the camera just happened to be.  The main character and the main focal of the story is Amal Iskander  a poor 18-year-old [[Coptic Egyptian]] girl. Her Muslim boyfriend Tarek is planning to leave Egypt on an illegal boat-crossing to Italy. Amal tells Tarek she is pregnant but he gives her an ultimatum - abandon the country with him, or have an abortion.  Amal, who loves Tarek and wants the baby, rejects both choices. But when the battered scooter she uses for food deliveries is stolen. Amal is fired from her job and suddenly finds herself with even fewer options. Her future, limited from the start, looks even more uncertain. In the poor neighborhood of [[Bashtel]] where Amal lives with her mother and a stepfather who is a compulsive gambler, day-to-day existence is difficult for everyone. Her sister, Hanan, is also an unwed mother with few paths to a better life.  Her best friend, Rania, is trying to raise money for an operation that will disguise the fact that she is no longer a virgin so that she can marry a wealthy, older man whom she does not love. Amal seeks guidance in prayers to the [[Virgin Mary]], but with few real possibilities left, she takes the only job she can find - in a hairdresser with low pay. The new job opens up the underworld life within Cairo that Amal never imagined - a life of luxury, leisure, expensive homes and cars - but also one of vice. At one of her destinations, a high class brothel in an exclusive part of town, she discovers her sister Hanan working as a prostitute in order to support her child. Devastated, disgusted by the life of the underworld, she gives up her only possibility for self-sufficiency.  Neither desiring a loveless marriage like Rania's, nor wishing to end up destitute like her mother and sister, Amal decides that she must abandon her family and their difficult existence in Egypt to join the man she loves and take the risky journey across the sea to another life.

Camp Hell
 By the end of each summer, children from the fundamentalist Catholic community in the suburbs of New Jersey visited ''Camp Hope''. Deep in the woods, away from civilization, the children are taught the ways of cult-like Christianity, the temptations of the flesh, and the horror of Satan. The head priest, who teaches the children these doctrines of fundamentalist Catholicism, has unknowingly brought evil with him by solely focusing on [[Sin]] instead of salvation. The priest fills these young minds with the belief that everything they do is an occasion of sin. He delves deep into their psyche asking them things like whether or not they masturbate, because [[masturbation]], according to the Catholic Church, is the same as [[premarital sex]] and gives the devil a foothold in their hearts and minds. The priest also goes so far as to call a girl at the camp a whore simply because she was talking to a male member of the camp. These psychological attacks take their toll, and the presence of a demon starts to creep into the minds of the children, especially the main character, Tommy Leary.  Tommy's grandfather had recently died and the afterlife is very much on his mind. At the same time, his innocent relationship with his childhood crush slowly becomes more physical until the two escape into the woods for a sexual encounter. Melissa, his crush, is caught and sent home, allowing the priest to focus on Tommy. The priest takes Tommy down a psychological and spiritual path that makes the presence of the demon real to him, and it begins to haunt him.  The movie ends with Tommy, after a confrontation with the priest and a near suicide attempt, denouncing his faith in the [[God]] he was being taught about and goes on a different path. The priest, after his emotionally brutal encounter with Tommy in his cabin, suffers a stroke. The members of the community struggle over whether to pull the plug, hoping for a miracle, while the priest spends the rest of his life in a [[persistent vegetative state]], eyes wide open, with a look of horror on his face.  On the way home from the hospital, Tommy finds a note given to him earlier by Melissa telling him when he can to find her and be with her.  As the car drives on, he opens the window and throws out the copy of Dante's ''Inferno'', which falls open on the road to a picture of a demon.

Carlos (miniseries)
 Ilich Ramírez Sánchez—who adopts the code name of "Carlos" early in the film—is a grim and elusive Venezuelan [[Left-wing terrorism|Marxist terrorist]] whose life is tracked as he executes dozens of assassination plots, abductions, and bombings across Europe and the Middle East in the cause of [[Palestinian liberation]]. For two decades, he is one of the world's most wanted terrorists. The film begins in [[Paris]] in 1973, where the young Ramírez Sánchez is endeavoring to prove himself as a [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] (PFLP) fighter, and ends with his capture in [[Sudan]], in 1994. In between, Carlos and his fellow terrorists wreak havoc on the [[Left Bank]] in Paris, [[OPEC siege|storm OPEC's headquarters in Vienna]], and carry out other devastating acts of politically motivated violence.  ===Part 1 (98 min.)=== Ramírez Sánchez, who has fought alongside the Palestinians in Jordan, carries out a series of attacks in [[London]] in 1973. He moves to Paris where the PFLP puts him in charge of its European branch under the command of a Lebanese militant, Michel Moukharbal, alias "André". He coordinates several operations, in particular the hostage taking in the French Embassy in [[The Hague]] by militants of the [[Japanese Red Army]]. When André is arrested, French agents of the domestic intelligence service, the [[Direction de la surveillance du territoire|DST]], want to know more about Ilich, who has by now adopted the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Carlos." To escape arrest, Carlos shoots three policemen. He then joins the head of the PFLP, [[Wadie Haddad]], in [[South Yemen]]. Haddad entrusts him with a daring mission – taking hostage the oil ministers of the [[OPEC]] countries at their forthcoming conference in [[Vienna]].  ===Part 2 (106 min.)=== Most of the second episode is devoted to a detailed account of the operation that remains one of the most spectacular terrorist acts of the period. It is December 21, 1975. Leading a group of six militants – leftists from German [[Revolutionary Cells (German group)|Revolutionary Cells]] and Palestinian militants including Anis Naccache – Carlos seizes control of the OPEC headquarters, taking ministers and accompanying delegates hostage. He is at the height of his notoriety in the media. However, he and his group are unable to find asylum in the countries of Algeria, Tunisia and Libya and are unable to fly to Iraq because the plane they requested, a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9|DC-9]], does not possess the range to fly the thousands of miles necessary. By finally releasing the ministers at [[Algiers]] airport in exchange for a large ransom, he fails in the mission that Haddad had given him. This marks the end of relations between the two men. From now on, Carlos becomes a mercenary for hire to whichever country offers the most, including first [[Iraq]], then [[Syria]]. He switches operations to behind the [[Iron Curtain]], moving between [[Budapest]] and [[East Berlin]] under the protection of the East German [[Stasi]]. He works with the remnants of the Revolutionary Cells, in particular [[Johannes Weinrich]] and his wife [[Magdalena Kopp]], who soon leaves Weinrich for Carlos.  ===Part 3 (115 min.)=== Carlos’ band, based in Budapest and protected by Syria, fosters links with various clients interested in their particular capabilities, among them [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]]’s [[Romania]] and [[Libya]]. This intense activity of geopolitical destabilization, orchestrated by Carlos who is trafficking arms, handling huge sums of cash and leading the life of the "Godfather of European terrorism", is soon to come to an end. His decline is closely linked to the changes in the world order. With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, he loses several of his backers, is told to leave Syria, and his arena of operation is drastically reduced. The last place offering refuge is [[Sudan]]: Carlos is by now retired and tracked by the secret services of several countries, abandoned by his closest allies, a long way from the center stage of international politics. His role as a player is over; he is left to observe the shifts in global power from a distance. With the complicity of the Sudanese authorities, and due to immobility from a testicular condition, he is captured on August 14, 1994 and brought back to Paris to stand trial for crimes that have not been forgotten in France.

Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore
  In Germany, a [[bloodhound]] named Rex discovers a [[Cocker Spaniel]] puppy stealing secret codes before revealing itself as Kitty Galore, a hairless [[Sphinx (cat)|Sphynx cat]]. Rex reports this incident to D.O.G. HQ. At a car dealership in [[San Francisco]], the mascot Crazy Carlito plans to destroy the dealership building. The police arrive, and officer Shane Larson and his police dog Diggs arrive to stop Carlito. Diggs takes the remote detonator from Carlito but bites it in the process, blowing up the building. Butch and Lou, now a fully grown [[Beagle]] and the head of D.O.G. HQ, watch Diggs blowing up the car dealership. Lou wants to recruit Diggs as an agent, and Butch reluctantly agrees.  Diggs gets locked up in the police kennels to prevent him from causing any more incidents. When Shane leaves, Butch comes in through the floor, recruits him, and takes him to D.O.G. HQ. After tracking down a [[pigeon]] named Seamus with valuable information, Diggs and Butch meet a M.E.O.W.S. (Mousers Enforcing Our World's Safety) agent named Catherine who was after Seamus for the same reason the dogs were. Catherine reveals to Diggs that Kitty Galore was a former M.E.O.W.S. agent named Ivana Clawyu who, while on a mission at a cosmetics factory, was chased by a guard dog and fell into a vat of hair removal gel, causing her to lose all her fur. Unrecognized and humiliated by her fellow agents and humans, Kitty left M.E.O.W.S. and vowed to exact revenge on humans and dogs.  Lou forms an alliance with Tab Lazenby, the head of M.E.O.W.S, to take down Kitty Galore. At a cat lady's home, the team discover that Calico, the middle-cat who was Mr. Tinkles' former aid, has been sending parts of stolen technology to Kitty using pigeons that work for her. Diggs tries to attack Calico, who then attempts to drown the team in cat litter; due to some quick thinking they eventually manage to escape. Afterwards, they interrogate Calico as to Kitty's whereabouts, but he claims that he doesn't know where she is because the pigeon couriers are flying the stolen technology to a secret location.  The group travels to [[Alcatraz Prison|Alcatraz]] where Mr. Tinkles is currently a mental patient. They try to get him to tell him Kitty Galore's whereabouts, but he only gives them one clue: A cat's eye reveals everything. When Kitty Galore learns about the cats and dogs working together, she hires two mercenaries named Angus and Duncan MacDougall to attempt to assassinate Seamus on the boat returning from the prison. Diggs subdues Angus and accidentally throws him overboard. Fed up with Diggs ruining the mission, Butch dismisses him from the team and leaves with Seamus to salvage clues.  Catherine takes Diggs to her home. She learns that the reason why Diggs never follows orders is because his past experiences have caused him to believe that he cannot trust anyone except himself, which led to him spending the majority of his life in kennels. She tells Diggs if he continues to think in this way, no one will able to help him. Diggs realizes how stupid he has been. Catherine takes Diggs to M.E.O.W.S. HQ, where they learn that Kitty is hiding at a fairground with her new master, an amateur magician named Chuck the Magnificent.  Not long after arriving, Diggs and Catherine are captured by Kitty Galore and her henchcat, Paws. Kitty reveals to Diggs and Catherine that she plots to transmit "The Call of the Wild" via an orbiting satellite which only dogs can hear through televisions, radios and cell phones to cause them to act hostile towards their humans. They will then be left alone and unwanted in kennels. Diggs and Catherine escape and meet up with Butch and Seamus. Kitty uses the roof of the fairground's flying swings ride for a satellite dish. Diggs, Butch, Catherine and Seamus arrive. Seamus presses a red button, thinking it is a shutdown button, but it instead loads the "Call of the Wild" signal. Dogs around the world start acting insane in their homes. Paws battles them, revealing he is a robot in the process. Diggs tricks Paws into biting the wires, destroying the satellite. Kitty's pet mouse, Scrumptious, fed up with Kitty's abuse towards him, fires her away. Kitty gets covered in cotton candy and lands in the magician's hat with the humans thinking it was a stunt.  After the mission, Diggs goes to live with Shane before returning to H.Q. to learn that Mr. Tinkles has escaped from prison with Calico.

Catfish (film)
 Young photographer [[Nev Schulman|Yaniv "Nev" Schulman]] lives with his brother Ariel in [[New York City]]. Abby Pierce, an 8-year-old [[child prodigy]] artist in rural [[Ishpeming, Michigan]], sends Nev a painting of one of his photos. They become [[Facebook]] friends, which broadens to include Abby's family: including her mother, Angela (Wesselman); Angela's husband Vince, and Abby's attractive older half-sister Megan, who lives in [[Gladstone, Michigan]].  For a documentary, Ariel and Henry Joost film Nev as he begins an [[online relationship]] with Megan. She sends him [[MP3]]s of song covers she performs for him, but Nev discovers that they are all taken from performances on [[YouTube]]. He later finds evidence that Angela and Abby have lied about other details of Abby's art career. Ariel urges Nev to continue the relationship for the documentary, although Nev seems reluctant to continue. The siblings decide to travel to Michigan in order to make an impromptu appearance at the Pierces' house and confront Megan directly. As they arrive at the house, Angela takes some time to answer the door, but is welcoming and seems happy to finally meet Nev in person. She also tells him that she has recently begun [[chemotherapy]] for uterine cancer. After leaving multiple messages while trying to call Megan, she drives Nev and Ariel to see Abby herself. While talking with Abby and her friend alone, Nev learns that Abby never sees her sister and rarely paints.  The next morning, Nev wakes up to a text message from Megan saying that she has had a long-standing alcohol problem and has decided to check into rehab and cannot meet him, which is confirmed by one of Megan's Facebook friends, but Nev realizes that this is likely another lie from Angela. After meeting with the family back at their house, Angela admits that the pictures of Megan were of a family friend, that her daughter Megan really is in rehab downstate and that Angela had really painted each of the paintings that she had sent to Nev. Nev thus realizes that, while believing he was talking to Megan, it was really Angela posing as her with an alternate Facebook account and mobile phone. As he sits for a drawing, Angela confesses that the various Facebook profiles were all maintained by her, but that through her friendship with Nev, she had reconnected with the world of painting, which had been her passion before she sacrificed her career to marry Vince—who has two severely mentally disabled children who require constant care. Through a conversation with Vince himself, the siblings learn that Angela had told him (falsely) that Nev was paying for her paintings, and that he had encouraged her to seize the opportunity to have him as a patron.  Vince, talking with Nev, tells the story about how live cod were shipped along with catfish in the same tanks to keep the cod active, and thus ensure the quality of the fish. He further explains this as a metaphor on how there are people in everyone's lives who keep them alert, active, and always thinking. It is implied that he believes Angela to be such a person.  Some time after, Nev receives a package labeled as being from Angela herself; it is the completed drawing that she labored over during their meeting, although Nev seems ambivalent in his feelings about it.  On-screen text then informs the viewer that Angela did not have cancer, there was no Megan at Dawn Farms, and she doesn't know the girl in the pictures. Over the course of their nine-month correspondence, Angela and Nev exchanged more than 1,500 messages. It was revealed later that the girl in the pictures was Aimee Gonzales, a professional model and photographer, who lives in [[Vancouver, Washington]], with her husband and two children. In October 2008, two years subsequent to the events, Ronald, one of Vince's twin sons, has died. Angela deactivated her 15 other profiles and changed her Facebook profile to a picture of herself, and now has a website to promote herself as an artist. Nev is still on Facebook and has more than 732 friends, including Angela.

At the police station Jeanne briefs her colleagues to protect the Colossus of Nairobi statue, which cost her husband his life at the hands of the notorious Victor Costa. Victor Costa intends to have another go at the statue, while it is being moved with help from his code-named accomplices, M. Bébé (Mr. Baby), M. Hulot, M. Grenouille (Mr. Frog), and M. Patate (Mr. Potato).  Back at home, Jeanne takes interest the fish-shaped bracelet and brings it to her colleague Luca.

The rest of the gang, including Claudine, are arrested and Zoé regains her voice.  Nico reforms, gives up thievery and becomes a member of the family, while Dino becomes the household pet. Nico gives to Jeanne a snow globe with the [[Cathedral of Notre Dame]] in it as a Christmas present.  
Centurion (film)
  Beginning in 117 AD, the narrative opens with a Roman soldier fleeing across a snowy landscape, saying:   ''"My name is Quintus Dias. I am a soldier of Rome, and this is neither the beginning, nor the end of my story."''  The Romans have been unable to fully conquer Britain, meeting the fiercest resistance in the north, reaching a harsh stalemate that's lasted a gruelling twenty years. The [[Picts]] of [[Alba]] are engaging in a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla campaign]] against the Roman forts along the [[Glenblocker fort|Glenblocker line]] and the [[Gask Ridge]] at the southern border of the [[Scottish Highlands]]. At the Roman outpost of [[Inchtuthil|Pinnata Castra]], Pictish warriors led by Vortix and Aeron force surprise and kill the entire garrison, taking only one survivor for questioning, the second-in-command, [[Centurion]] Quintus Dias, because he can speak the [[Pictish language|Pictish tongue]]. Dias is brought before the Pictish king Gorlacon, who has united the northern tribes. Dias is brutally interrogated, but two weeks later escapes on foot.  However, a messenger dispatched by the fort's commander has reached [[Gnaeus Julius Agricola]], the Roman governor of [[Britannia]], who wants to obtain favour with the [[Roman Senate]], hoping to secure a transfer back to the comforts of Rome. He dispatches the [[Legio IX Hispana|Ninth Legion]], under General Titus Flavius Virilus, to eradicate the Pictish threat and provides him with a female Celtic [[Brigantes|Brigantian]] scout called Etain. As the legion marches north it encounters Dias and rescues him from his pursuers, saving his neck just in the nick of time.   Etain betrays the legion to King Gorlacon by leading them into an [[ambush]] where, surprised by a rolling legion of massive flaming pitch-wood 'boulders', they are easily annihilated. The wounded general is captured. Dias is one of the few survivors, along with the legionaries Bothos, Thax, Brick, Macros and Leonidas (a Greek), and Tarak (a mere cook). They set out to rescue general Virilus and, after a few days' travel, they find him at Gorlacon's village and sneak in at nightfall. However, they are unable to break his chains and he orders them to leave him and get back to Roman territory. During the attack, Thax, taking shelter in Gorlacon's hut, suffocates the king's young son, who had spotted them, to prevent him crying out.  The next morning, Gorlacon burns his son's body on a funeral pyre and forces General Virilus to fight Etain in single combat. Etain, who as a child witnessed her parents brutally raped and slaughtered by the Romans; and now on a vendetta, kills him with a spear through the heart. Gorlacon then sends her after the fleeing legionaries at the head of a small group of mounted warriors, including Vortix and Aeron, to seek revenge for his son's death.  The seven Romans plan to travel north (away from Roman territory) to throw the Picts off their trail, then head west, and then back south. After several days' pursuit, the Picts being excellent trackers, continually catch up with the fugitives, who jump off a cliff into a river to escape them, (although Tarak, who had broken his foot, is killed before he can jump). Macros and Thax become separated from the others. Dias and his group camp for the night, while their trackers set up camp across the river. Dias and Brick launch a night raid on the enemy camp, killing two men and severely wounding a third, from whom they discover that they are being pursued because of the death of Gorlacon's son, which scoundrel Thax had kept secret. However, Etain has launched her own attack on the Romans' campsite. Dias and Brick return to their camp to discover Leonidas dead and Bothos severely wounded.  Macros and Thax are now running from a wolf pack. Thax pretends to fall, with the wolves in close pursuit, and cries out to his comrade for help. Macros returns to help him and a traitorous Thax [[hamstring]]s him to prevent him from standing, allowing Thax to escape while the wolves attack and devour Macros. Dias, Bothos and Brick find a hut in the forest belonging to Arianne, a Pictish exile accused of [[witchcraft]] who has learned Latin from the soldiers at a nearby Roman frontier outpost. She shelters them, providing food, and medical attention for Bothos. When Etain and her warriors arrive the following day, Arianne confronts her while the Romans hide in her grain store under the floorboards. The next morning they leave Arianne, who provides them with enough food to travel to the outpost. Arianne, having become fond of Dias, is saddened to see him go; left again to her solitude.   They find the outpost abandoned, with an order pinned to a post saying that the Roman troops have retreated south, by the orders of the [[Emperor Hadrian]]. Seeing Etain and her warriors approaching and fed up with running, they set up a defensive position inside the fort. Brick is killed, but the three Romans kill Vortix, Aeron, and the rest of the Picts, with Dias ending the fight by killing Etain.  Taking the Picts' horses, Dias and Bothos continue southwards and en route are reunited with Thax. Upon reaching [[Hadrian's Wall]], which is now under construction, Thax, afraid that he will report his dishonourable actions, threatens Dias and they fight, with Dias overpowering and choking Thax to death. Bothos, joyfully riding towards the Romans, is mistaken for a charging Pict (because of his pelted tunic instead of armour) and is shot by an archer. Dias is outraged and crestfallen at the worthlessness of it all. He reports to Agricola, who is concerned that news of the legion's annihilation might cause other tribes to rise up against them. He is also fearful of his record and status being tainted by a military failure, and decides that the Ninth Legion's fate should remain a mystery and that Dias must be silenced/killed. Dias, however, manages to foil the attempt on his life by Agricola's daughter Druzilla, although he is badly wounded in the thigh during the fracas. Disgusted at their treatment of their own 'heroes' and disillusioned by their 'true colours', he knocks Druzilla unconscious with a punch then escapes from the camp and returns to where he realises "he belongs", back to Arianne in the forest. As the weakened Dias lies in her arms by the stream, his life in her hands once again, he and Arianne kiss.  The film ends with Quintus Dias adjusting the narrative of the film's opening line:  ''"My name is Quintus Dias. I am a fugitive of Rome, and this is neither the beginning, nor the end of my story."''

Freddie ([[Christian Cooke]]) wants to escape their [[working class]] world but cheeky chappy Bruce ([[Tom Hughes (actor)|Tom Hughes]]) and kind-hearted [[slacker]] Snork ([[Jack Doolan (actor)|Jack Doolan]]) are happy with life the way it is. When Freddie gets a new job as a door-to-door insurance salesman and bumps into his old school sweetheart Julie ([[Felicity Jones]]), the gang are forced to make choices that will change their lives forever.  Freddie's boss is Julie's father ([[Ralph Fiennes]]). Selling life insurance in the hopes of improving his life and not ending up like his factory worker father ([[Ricky Gervais]]), Freddie learns from the firm's top seller Mike Ramsay ([[Matthew Goode]]), who is also Julie's fiancé, how to scare people into buying insurance. Bruce lives life to the full, with the notion that one day he will leave Cemetery Junction, but he hates and resents his father ([[Francis Magee]]) for letting his mother leave for another man without fighting for her. Snork just lives for spending his time with Bruce and Freddie, working at the railway station and looking for a girlfriend, a search which is hindered by his lack of social skills. Freddie rekindles his friendship with Julie, who reveals her dreams to see the world and become a photographer, but her father and fiancé Mike both expect her to become a regular housewife, like her mother.  Freddie is invited to his firm's winner's ball to celebrate his and several others' initiation to the company, and he brings Bruce and Snork as his guests. During that night, Snork tires of the band, and claims he could do better. Bruce convinces them to let Snork perform with them. The crowd initially enjoys his performance, but he gets carried away and tells a highly inappropriate joke, embarrassing Freddie. He confronts and scolds Snork and Bruce, but Bruce shrugs it off, still claiming he will leave the town, and that Freddie will never be like his colleagues because he's 'not a cunt', which the crowd overhears, forcing them to leave.  The next day Freddie goes around town thanking his clients for helping him start his new career, and learns that his very first client's husband has died. Deciding not to live off people's misery, he asks Bruce when they plan to leave. They invite Julie to a nightclub, and convince Snork to leave with them. In the club Bruce starts dancing with a black woman, for which he is ridiculed by two men, provoking him to assault the men and get locked up in the police cells for the night.  Freddie accompanies Julie to her home and they develop the pictures Julie had taken throughout the night. They argue about their feelings, the lives of her parents and Julie's engagement to Mike, which is following the same path as her parents' relationship. Freddie declares his love for Julie and asks her to go travelling with him, but she refuses and tells him to leave. Bruce is met in his cell by officer Wayne Davies ([[Steve Speirs]]), an old friend of his father's and the one man Bruce respects, who is fed up with Bruce taking his anger with his father out on other people. He tells Bruce the story of the night his mother left, revealing that his mother abandoned him and wanted nothing to do with him but his father did - and tells him to grow up and get over his anti-social behaviour.  The following morning, Snork goes to a café he frequents and talks to Louise, a girl who works there who has feelings for him, and they form a relationship. Bruce walks home and silently makes amends with his father. When Freddie arrives at the train station to begin his travels, he finds Snork ready for work, having decided to stay, and they say an emotional goodbye. Julie realises that Freddie was correct, and that her relationship with Mike will stifle her, and goes to the railway station. Snork announces over the station PA that Bruce will not be joining Freddie on his journey. Deciding not to go alone, Freddie is on the point of abandoning his adventure when he sees Julie running towards him, and they board the train together.

Certified Copy (film)
 British writer James Miller (Shimell) is in Tuscany to give a talk to a group about his new book, titled "Certified Copy", which argues that, in art, issues of authenticity are irrelevant, because every reproduction is itself an original and even the original is a copy of another form. A French antiques dealer, whose name is never given (Binoche), attends the event with her 11-year-old son in order to have Miller sign several copies of the book she has purchased, but has to leave early because her son is hungry and becomes a distraction. She leaves her phone number with Miller's translator.  Miller and the woman later meet at her shop, and Miller suggests they get out and see some of the countryside. The woman drives them around aimlessly while Miller signs the books, and they talk about the book's subject, debating the finer points. Miller points out that even the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' is a 'copy' of the woman who modeled for the painting, real or imagined.  They then visit an art museum to see another famous 'copy', and the woman gets increasingly distraught as she complains about her rebellious son to Miller, but he seems to defend her son's behavior. They go to a nearby café for coffee, and while Miller steps outside to take a phone call, the woman who runs the café, thinking Miller is the woman's husband, gets into a conversation with the woman about marriage and about him specifically, and Binoche's character immediately plays along. After Miller returns, and the woman makes him aware of their 'assumed' relationship, the two leave the café, and the nature of their discussions changes: they start to speak in a combination of French and English instead of just English (Miller states that he only learned French, not Italian in school), and, more unexpectedly, they now speak as if they truly are a married couple, who've been married for 15 years, and her son is their son. Their discussions get personal, and it's intentionally unclear which, if either, is the true reality of the film. After some arguing, and some soul-baring language, a reconciliation (of sorts) ends the film.  
Chain Letter (film)

As the couple start their cars they exit the driveway. The woman in the car notices the victim, but as she exits her car to warn the man, he drives off. Neil Conners ([[Cody Kasch]]) receives a [[chain letter]] from an anonymous person telling him that he is the first person who links the chain, and instructing him to forward it to five people or else he will die. His sister Rachael (Cherilyn Wilson) forwards the letter, but to only four recipients. Neil then adds his sister to the list and sends it.  Rachael's best friend, Jessica "Jessie" Campbell ([[Nikki Reed]]), gets the letter and forwards it to five friends. Johnny Jones ([[Matt Cohen (actor)|Matt Cohen]]) also receives it but refuses to send it, believing it to be ridiculous. While he is getting a drink of water at the fountain in the gym, a black hooded figure slams his head on the fountain, knocking two of his teeth out. Unconscious, he is chained by his arms to a gym set and has his ankles sliced open. After which the killer uses the chains to slice his face open, killing him. Jessie becomes suspicious as more people start to die. While taking a bath, Rachael becomes suspicious of a possible intruder inside the house. She investigates and is attacked by the killer who whips her with the chain several times as she runs through the house to escape. Re-entering the bathroom, she locks the door and looks for a weapon, pacing back and forth with a cistern lid, waiting for him to attack. She walks up to the door and places her face next to it, listening. Suddenly realizing the killer is on the other side doing exactly the same thing, she rapidly backs away. Seconds later, the killer breaks through a side wall into the room, hitting her on the top of her head with the lid, splitting it open.  Outside the house, Jessie is greeted by Detective Jim Crenshaw ([[Keith David]]), who tells her to forward the chain letter on to him. Jessie figures out they are being spied on using a virus embedded in the chain letter so meets with Neil, and Michael ([[Michael J. Pagan]]) planning to try to stop the murders. Later on, as more people send Neil the message, he panics and decides to delete all of them in order to confront the killer. The killer, however, is on the roof of Neil's room, and sends a chain smashing through his ceiling. Neil dies as he gets dragged up to the roof of his house by chains with various sickles and a hook. It is revealed that the man behind all the killings was a soldier. During the war, he was tortured by the enemy because he had a government-issued cell phone. He returned to the United States severely disfigured and disappeared from a hospital, starting a cult of "[[Luddite|anti-technology]]" followers marked by [[barcode]] tattoos. It is then revealed that the woman chained to the cars in the beginning of the film is Jessie, who is killed because she sent the chain letter to Detective Crenshaw without sending it to four other people.

As the film ends, Detective Crenshaw is shown chained to a table while the killer makes chains.

Chico and Ramón give [[Chano Pozo]] a letter of recommendation they received from his sister in [[Cuba]]. Chano is receptive and excited to meet fellow Cubans. However, he is involved in drugs and has a short temper. After discovering he was sold [[oregano]] instead of [[marijuana]], Chano attacks the dealer, who later finds him in a bar and kills him. Chico finds work as a party musician, and Ramón as an [[Usher (occupation)|usher]] at the [[Plaza Hotel]]. At one of his party gigs, Chico runs into a successful Rita again, who is hurt by the racist doubts of her fellow party goers about her upcoming film project.  Chico and Rita run away in her new car and spend the night together again. The next day, Ron locates Ramón and proposes a deal to finance his artist-agency business, as long as Ramon finds jobs to keep Chico away from Rita. Ramón complies with his end of the bargain and signs Chico with [[Dizzy Gillespie]], who gives him a gig in Paris and a European tour. Rita becomes a big film star while Chico finds a new girlfriend in Paris. One morning, while playing "Rita" at the piano, the girlfriend's dog, Lily, comes in and sits by Chico. He decides to change the name of the song to "Lily".  Back in New York, despite her wealth and success, Rita is still mistreated socially due to her [[racism|skin color]]. While being driven to a set, the radio plays a new Jazz hit that she instantly recognizes as the piece Chico composed for her. She is moved to tears when she learns Chico renamed the song. In New York, Rita goes into a bar and sees Chico playing "Lily".  She waits for him outside the bar and demands to know who Lilly is. He teases her about the mystery female's identity, but finally reveals that he renamed the song after a dog. The two passionately kiss and make up. A paparazzo captures the kiss in a photograph that appears in the newspapers. Chico and Rita agree to marry that New Year's Eve, after Rita's debut in Las Vegas. Chico tells Ramón, who worries that their reunion will ruin his business. Ramón slips a packet of drugs into Chico's coat, which police discover during a search after a raid on his gig at the [[Palladium (New York City)|Palladium]] in New York. They arrest Chico, and won't let him make a phone call to Rita, who waits in vain in a Las Vegas motel. Chico is soon deported back to Cuba. Upset, Rita becomes drunk before her New Year's Eve performance, believing that Chico left her again. Despite Ron's urging to not "spoil it all now", Rita deliberately sabotages her career by denouncing the racism of the Hollywood industry and the hypocrisy of being a celebrated black artist.   Meanwhile, Chico enters Cuba right at the beginning of [[Fidel Castro|Castro's]] regime, and the new Cuban revolutionary authorities seize his passport. All venues are now forbidden to play jazz because it is "imperialist music." Disappointed with life, Chico gives up music altogether.   Sixty years later, when Chico is shining shoes for a tourist, a young man rushes to him and tells him that a famous young singer and her entourage are eagerly asking for him and his jazz music. He reluctantly agrees to meet them and for the first time in years he plays his music for an audience. The singer asks him to record a song with her and Chico agrees. It becomes a big hit and takes him on a world tour, giving him success for the second time. After the tour, Chico is allowed re-entry into the United States. He searches for Rita, starting in New York. He eventually finds Ron in a [[nursing home]] and discovers that his friend Ramón has died and learns Rita is in Las Vegas. He goes there and knocks on her door and she reveals that she has stayed for 47 years in the same motel room, working as the motel's housekeeper and waiting for him. The film ends with their reunion.

The kingdom of Kothakpur and Pehelwanpur are attacked and reduced to rubble. Dholakpur too suffers a similar fate. The king of Dholakpur, Induverma, and the princess Indumati, are abducted by the aliens.  Bheem and his friends are shown playing a [[Twenty20]] cricket match against their rival team led by Kichak from Pehelwanpur. Bheem's team scores 115/2 from 20 overs, aided by a strong innings from their skipper Bheem. In return, Kichak's team scores 109/4; with 6 runs needed to even the scores. Kichak hits a lofty shot in the air, but before the ball could land, it is destroyed by a [[laser]] beam from an alien vessel.  The aliens continue their rampage, setting a majority the nearby huts and trees on fire. Instead of fleeing, Bheem decides to confront them, and call them out. The leader of the aliens, Kyto reveals that they are from the planet Zekan, and they have come to take control over earth. On Bheem's persuasion, he decides to give earth a chance. Kyto says that the following day, they would have a competition- Bheem and his friends would have to face the aliens in a game of 'Plutocket', where if Team Prithvi (earth) wins, the aliens would leave their planet alone. However, if the Zekans win, earth would be theirs forever.  Bheem and his friends are joined by Kichak's team, but are faced with a major problem of having no idea about how the game Plutocket is played. One of Kichak's friends, Gidda, informs that the aliens are practicing nearby. Upon spying on their practice, Bheem and his friends learn that Plutocket is actually what the Zekans refer to [[Cricket]], and realize that they might actually stand a chance. Team earth is formed; Bheem, Raju, Kichak, Kalia, Dholu, Bholu, Jaggu, Chutki, Manna, Motu, and Poptya are selected as the final eleven.  On the day of the match, the arriving aliens are confronted by team earth. Team Zekan wins the toss and chooses to bowl. With Bheem leading from the front, and fueled by contributions from Kichak and Chutki, they manage to put 117 runs on the board after 20 overs, at the loss of 9 wickets. Team Zekan's batting starts [[aggressively]], with their openers Liska and Peptik troubling earth's bowlers with their weird batting styles. Bheem observes that each of the aliens have some definite characteristic, which they can take advantage of. Shortly thereafter, they bounce back in the game and manage to send a handful of Zekanians like Bagel, Puro, and Dilo back into the pavilion. However, Kyto remains not out, and continues to fight through his innings, completing his half century. At the end of 19 overs, Zekans are at 102, requiring 16 runs off the last over. They hit a six off the first ball to ease the pressure, but team earth manages to hold them within the walls. With 6 runs required off the last ball to win the match, having 1 wicket in hand, Kyto hits the balls high in the air. Dholu and Bholu are the fielders running towards the ball, and on the verge of colliding with each other. Surprisingly, they pull off an exceptional double team move to take the catch and dismiss Kyto, thus winning the match for their team and their planet.  According to the deal, Kyto sets free the king and the princess. King Induverma and Kyto agree upon peace relations between the two planets in the future, and the Zekanians leaves earth in peace. The next day, Kalia is shown bragging to Dholu and Bholu about the aliens, saying some of them are not so bad after all. Jaggu drops from the tree wearing an alien mask and asks ''What do you think about me?'', which is enough to have the three running on their heels. Bheem and his friends have laugh at the sight, as the film comes to an end.

Children of God (film)
 Jonny ([[Johnny Ferro]]), an awkward painting student, is “banished” by his instructor to the remote island of [[Eleuthera]], to focus on his work and find his artistic voice. But first he finds Romeo ([[Stephen Tyrone Williams]]), a handsome, self-confident guy who shows Jonny the scenic spots, and a bit more. Romeo’s got a girlfriend, however, as well as a blustery mother who willfully ignores any clue or hint he drops to set her straight.  Meanwhile, Lena (Margaret Laurena Kemp), a pastor's wife, has also made her way to this distant spot to contemplate her future in relative calm. Tired of her husband spouting high-and-mighty, anti-gay rhetoric at rallies while refusing to own up to the cruelty and contradictions in his private life, Lena has a decision to make.  The phrase, "Children of God" is the religious expression used by [[Christians]] to refer to human divinity as being all God's Children. Four Bahamian individuals set out on a journey from the frenetic energy of Nassau to the slower-paced and open Eleuthera. The year is 2004, when the Caribbean world is rocked by the emergence of [[Rosie O'Donnell]]'s gay family [[Norwegian Dawn|cruise ship]]. Actual documentary footage details the mass hysteria that divides the Caribbean, as some fundamentalists lead widespread rallies.  Jonny, a young, obsessive-compulsive white Bahamian artist, faces losing his scholarship at a local university if he does not live up to the potential his professors believe he has. Jonny escapes from his gritty inner-city life, in Nassau, to the under-populated and dramatic Bahamian island of Eleuthera. Here he decides to paint his 'masterpiece' and then gets killed by a closeted homosexual when Jonny was en route to meet Romeo. It could have had a happy ending. However, in this film, life does not have happy endings for many gay and lesbians.  Lena Mackey is an extremely conservative forty-year-old, anti-gay activist who finds out that her husband is not who he represents himself to be. She believes that the only way to fix problems in her life is to limit the rights of homosexuals. She heads to Eleuthera for the purpose of galvanizing the community to oppose gay rights. When Jonny arrives, his and Lena's paths cross, and together these two embark on a series of physical and emotional adventures that not only inspire Jonny to paint, but also give him a new zest for life.

The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
   [[Edmund Pevensie|Edmund]] and [[Lucy Pevensie]] are staying with their irritating [[bookworm]] cousin, [[Eustace Scrubb]], until [[World War II|the war]] is over, separated from Peter and Susan. Edmund is still too young to [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#World War II|enlist]] in [[British Armed Forces|His Majesty's Armed Forces]]. At their cousin's home, a painting of a ship on the ocean transports Lucy, Edmund and Eustace into an ocean in [[Narnia (world)|Narnia]]. They are rescued by [[Caspian X|Caspian]], who captains the ''[[Dawn Treader]]''. He invites them on a [[wikt:voyage|voyage]] to rescue the seven Lords of Narnia whom his uncle [[Miraz]] banished. In the Lone Islands, where slavery is common, Caspian and Edmund are captured and imprisoned, while Lucy and Eustace are sold as slaves. Caspian meets one of the lost lords (Lord Bern), who reveals that the slaves that are not sold, are sacrificed to a mysterious green mist. They are rescued by their crew. Bern, who becomes the new governor, gives Caspian a sword, one of seven given to each of the lords by [[Aslan]].  At another island, Lucy is abducted by the invisible [[Dufflepuds]], who force her to enter the manor of the magician [[Coriakin]] to find a visibility spell. She does so, and later introduces him to her friends. Coriakin encourages the crew to defeat the mist by laying the lords' seven swords at Aslan's Table on Ramandu's island, but warns them that they are about to be tested, through temptation. Lucy recites a beauty [[incantation]] she found, and enters a dream in which she has transformed into Susan and neither Lucy nor Narnia exist. Aslan chides Lucy for her self-doubt, explaining that her siblings only know of Narnia because of her, telling her "don't run away from who you are".  Another sword is recovered from a magical pool that turns anything that touches it into gold, including one of the lost lords (which leads to a massive fight between Edmund and Caspian). Meanwhile, Eustace finds, and steals from a rock pit full of treasure. While Edmund and Caspian look for Eustace, they discover the remains of another of the lords and recover his sword. A dragon approaches and is driven away from the ''Dawn Treader''. The dragon is revealed to be Eustace, transformed by the treasure after succumbing to its temptations. [[Reepicheep]] befriends Eustace, and Eustace is touched by the mouse's kindness. He undergoes a change of heart and becomes helpful to the crew.  The crew arrive at Aslan's Table to find three lost lords sleeping. As they place the swords on the table they realize one is still missing. A star descends from the sky and transforms into [[Ramandu's Daughter|Lilliandil]], a beautiful woman who guides them to the Dark Island, lair of the Mist, where they discover the last surviving Lord, Rhoop. Edmund's fear manifests itself as a monstrous [[sea serpent]] that attacks the ship. Eustace fights the serpent, but Rhoop wounds him with the last sword, causing him to fly away with the sword impaled in his side. He encounters Aslan, who transforms him back into a boy, removes the sword from his body and sends him to Ramandu's island with it. As the crew fights the serpent, the Mist tries to distract Edmund by appearing as Jadis, the [[White Witch]]. Eustace reaches the table and fights through the Mist to place the sword upon it, allowing the swords to unleash their magic and bestow Peter's sword (of which Edmund was in possession) with the power to slay the sea serpent, the death of which awakens the three sleeping lords, destroys the Mist and Dark Island and liberates the sacrificed slaves.  Eustace rejoins Lucy, Edmund, Caspian, and Reepicheep, and they sail to a mysterious shore before a massive wave. Aslan appears and tells them that [[Aslan's Country|his country]] lies beyond, although if they go there they may never return. Caspian refuses, knowing that he has more duties to do as king, but Reepicheep is determined to enter, and Aslan blesses him before he paddles beyond the wave. Aslan opens a portal to send Lucy, Edmund and Eustace home, but informs Lucy and Edmund they have grown up and can never return to Narnia. Aslan encourages them to know him in their world by another name, and tells a reformed Eustace that he may return. The three enter the portal and swim up to the bedroom. Eustace hears his mother announcing a visitor, [[Jill Pole]]. The three leave the room, stopping to look back at the painting, which shows the ''Dawn Treader'' sailing out of sight.

Clash of the Titans (2010 film)
 In ancient times, after defeating their predecessors, the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], the gods, divided the world among themselves. [[Zeus]] took the skies, [[Poseidon]] took the seas, and [[Hades]] was left with the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]] upon being tricked by Zeus. The gods created the mortals, whose faith and prayers has fueled the gods' immortality. As time passed, however, mortals began to question and soon resist their creators, angering the Olympians.  A fisherman named Spyros finds a coffin adrift in the sea, discovering a baby, [[Perseus]], and his mother, [[Danaë]]. Spyros and his wife, Marmara, raise [[Perseus]] as their own son, alongside their daughter, Tekla. One day, an adult Perseus and his family watch soldiers from the city of Argos destroying the statue of Zeus. Infuriated at this, the Gods unleash the [[Erinyes|Furies]] who attack the soldiers. Hades then appeared and destroyed the family's fishing vessel, resulting in Perseus' family drowning. Only Perseus survives and is found by a group of the soldiers.  Perseus is brought before King [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and Queen [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]], who are celebrating their campaign against the gods. Queen Cassiopeia compares her daughter [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] to the gods and boasts that she is more beautiful than [[Aphrodite]]. The revelry is cut short by the arrival of Hades, who has been given leave by Zeus to punish the mortals for their defiance. Hades threatens to unleash his monster, the [[Kraken]], against Argos, unless Andromeda is offered as a sacrifice. Before leaving, he also reveals that Perseus is a [[demigod]] and the son of Zeus. Perseus meets [[Io (mythology)|Io]], who confirms his origin. According to Io, a king of Argos named Acrisius defied the Gods and laid siege on Olympus. Zeus wanted to teach him a lesson, but did not want to kill the humans, instead, he decided to make an example out of Acrisius and disguised himself as the king, and then had sex with Queen Danae. When Acrisius realized this, he executed his wife and her son, while cursing Zeus. Zeus punished him further by changing him into the deformed creature Calibos, who became obsessed with killing Perseus, the son of Queen Danae and Zeus.  Perseus leads the King's Guard to the [[Graeae|Stygian Witches]], looking for a way to kill the Kraken. Seeking to help his newly discovered son, Zeus gives Perseus a sword forged on Mount Olympus and a winged horse named [[Pegasus]]. Perseus refuses the sword, but the captain of the King's guard, Draco, keeps the sword for when Perseus needs it. However, Perseus likes Pegasus. Soon after, they are attacked by Calibos, who kills several of the Kings Guard. Draco severs Calibos's hand and forces him to flee. The band gives chase but they are attacked by giant [[scorpion]]s called Scorpiochs that spring from spilled drops of Calibos's blood. They are saved by a band of [[Jinn|Djinn]], non-human desert sorcerers led by Sheik Suleiman, who tame the remaining Scorpions. Also wishing for the gods' defeat, the Djinn lend their aid to Perseus and his band. As they continue to travel, Io aids and teaches Perseus and they begin to fall in love.  The group arrives at the lair of the Stygian Witches and learn that to kill the Kraken, they must obtain and use the head of [[Medusa]], a [[gorgon]] who resides in a temple in the Underworld. Any living creature that looks on Medusa's eyes will turn into stone. Perseus, Io, Solon, Draco, and their remaining men travel to the entrance into the Underworld. The men enter Medusa's temple lair while Io, being a woman and forbidden from entering, remains outside. Medusa kills most of the band, but Perseus finally manages to behead her by using his reflective shield to see her with his back turned. As he leaves the temple, Calibos appears behind Io and fatally stabs her. As Perseus and Calibos fight, Perseus accepts that he is a son of Zeus, picks up the Olympian sword, and stabs Calibos through the chest, which has restored him to his human form. With his last breath, Calibos urges Perseus not to become a god. As Io lies dying, she urges Perseus to leave her and save Andromeda and Argos. Perseus lovingly stays with her until her last breath instead of leaving immediately. Pegasus soon takes Perseus back to the city of Argos as the Kraken is released. The people of Argos seize and bind Andromeda to sacrifice her to the Kraken. Meanwhile, Hades reveals he does not require the faith or worship of mortals as Zeus does, as he has learned to survive on their fear. Hades then subdues the weakened Zeus.  Perseus arrives at Argos and exposes Medusa's head to the Kraken, which makes eye contact just before it is able to reach Andromeda. The Kraken gradually petrifies and crumbles. Prokopion, the insane leader of the Cult of Hades, attempts to kill Perseus, but Cepheus stops him and is stabbed, before both are killed when the Kraken's petrified hand falls on them.

Avi also develops a severe neck pain and even though he does not appear to be overweight, a scale reveals that he weighs 120 kilograms. Avi, too, starts having experiences similar to Sonia's. The couple is petrified when all of Avi's best friends commit suicide in a similar manner. It then comes to light that the spirit haunting them all has a connection to Avi's college life. Meanwhile, Sonia finds out that Avi was friends with a girl named Aarti during his college days. As Avi and Sonia are still being haunted by Aarti they go and visit her, but realize that Aarti is dead, having apparently committed suicide by using a knife. Aarti's mother believes that she is still alive, thinking that she is merely ill and will recover. On the way home Aarti continues to haunt Avi and Sonia, and again during the night at the hotel she also haunts him as Avi is sleeping, ending up with him being thrown off the fire escape.  Later Avi is in the hospital and Sonia tells him that Aarti will be cremated, and they visit her funeral before returning to their home town. Sonia finds some photos of Aarti, where she is crawling to get something. As she follows the pattern indicated by Aarti, Sonia discovers that Avi's best friends (who later committed suicide) are raping Aarti. When Sonia talks to Avi about this dark secret, he tells her that he only wanted Aarti to understand his feelings, but that when his best friends tried to talk to her, Aarti hurt Avi's friend Tarun, who became angry and with his friends raped her. Avi claims that when he entered the room he was shocked at the scene and tried to help her, but that Tarun then said that Avi had asked them to rape her as a way of avoiding jail, and accused Avi of planning to do this to her and having one of Avi's friends taking the pictures. Avi then tells Sonia that the reason he kept the photos was to remind him that he failed to protect Aarti and say he is the guilty one. But Sonia leaves him and wishes him that Aarti may forgive him. Later on Avi attempts to kill himself in the same way his best friends did, but as a Polaroid camera clicks towards him, he sees Aarti sitting on his shoulders. Avi is suddenly thrown through the window, and ends up in hospital, where it is revealed that the reason why she was sitting on his shoulders was that Aarti had still loved Avi. As Sonia makes another photograph of Avi, she speaks to Aarti, asserting that one day she will let go as the reflection in the mirror shows Aarti still leaning on Avi's back.

Many years ago, somewhere in Malaysia, when the Japanese are experimenting on some gases that mutate people, their lab explodes, killing everyone inside.

A Closed Book (film)
 Sir Paul (Tom Conti) is an art critic and writer who was blinded in a car crash.  He lives alone in a large mansion in the UK.  He is looking for an [[amanuensis]] or "ghost writer" to help him write his final book, an autobiography, and interviews several unsuccessful candidates until Jane Ryder ([[Daryl Hannah]]) applies for the position. Because she is intelligent and forthright, Sir Paul hires her, and he explains to her she will now be living in the house and introduces Mrs. Kilbride ([[Miriam Margolyes]]), the cook and housekeeper.  He then goes on to divulge his claustrophobia and "terrific fear of the dark," despite him being blind, and asks that the lights be switched on at, "exactly the same time as they would be in any normal house."  Jane begins to explore the mansion by herself, noting how a good amount of the furniture is covered in white dust cloths, before stumbling upon a teddy bear with one eye. She picks up the bear and snaps the eye off of its face.  A shot of a painting is then inexplicably shown along with the sounds of a child's laughter.  They have breakfast together and discuss their pet annoyances, with Sir Paul getting disproportionately angry about Jane saying "no problem" repeatedly.  He asks her to bring to his attention anything he does that she finds irritating, if any.  She then states that his saying, "poor," as an adjective, describing it as patronizing. Sir Paul then tells Jane that he can both hear her smile and think.  Sir Paul begins dictating his book, which he decides to call, "A Closed Book," to Jane while she types on her computer. Sir Paul again gets very angry at Jane for not taking his instructions. After they finish writing, Sir Paul asks Jane to buy a puzzle of a specific painting as a favor, which she agrees to do. He later asks her to call his agent to deliver the news about his new book being in the works.  Jane dials the phone and speaks with someone before telling Sir Paul that his agent is currently out of the country and not available. Things run smoothly until Jane starts changing things ever so slightly, like taking paintings out of their frames and turning them upside down. Her true purpose at the mansion starts to become even more questionable when she begins to lie to Sir Paul, stating that she had been wearing a red gown when she was wearing jeans and a shirt, and sets a few of his books ablaze in the fireplace. Sir Paul begins to question Jane's personal life, specifically her love life, but she is divulges little and asks that the subject be changed. Sir Paul starts to suspect Jane when she sends Mrs. Kilbride home for a week without consulting him.   While singing in the bath, he keeps hearing strange noises, which are really Jane attempting to scare him. While he is in the bath, someone turns the light off, and then Jane comes in naked and claims that the light is still on, to reassure him. She leaves the bathroom and the audience is then shown another shot of the teddy bear followed by a painting of a young girl playing with a teddybear and the sound of children's laughter.   Jane's lying and sneaking becomes more and more obvious as she lies to him about Madonna dying and [[O. J. Simpson]] committing suicide.  Sir Paul becomes very suspicious when Mrs. Kilbride returns to the house and she finds a puzzle that Sir Paul asked Jane to purchase, and it turns out to be the wrong puzzle. This particularly matters to Sir Paul as he wrote about the painting in his book, and he gets very angry at her and begins to lose trust in her. Jane assures Sir Paul that nothing like this will ever happen again.  Later, Mrs. Killbride calls to inform them that her husband may have lung cancer and that she won't be able to work again for some time.    Sir Paul's suspicions are assuaged when a Conservative MP visits his house to persuade him to vote for the Conservatives. Because of her fear of Sir Paul, she responds positively to all of his questions, and she reads aloud what Jane has written in his book after he insists she do it for him. Fortunately for Jane, her transcription of his words on the computer are accurate. Jane later escalates her campaign against him, and one day she leaves a suit of armour lying on the floor, and displaces several desks and a number of books. She knows that Sir Paul will walk into them, which will cause him to trip and fall down the stairs. She then comes back into the house.  Sir Paul dials his agent for the first time in the film and finds out that he was in fact at his office the whole time and had never taken a trip.  Eventually, Sir Paul realizes that Jane is attempting to kill him, and he has a confrontation with her, in his bedroom. She tells him that her late husband, Ralph, had once had an art exhibition at a prestigious gallery, where he had been severely criticized by Sir Paul. It is revealed that the quick shots of paintings shown throughout the film are in fact the works of her late husband.  Due to the subject material of his paintings, Ralph had been arrested and accused of being a pedophile. He later killed himself. After comparing Sir Paul to "a closed book," and declaring that she must destroy him the way he destroyed Ralph, Jane shoves him into a wardrobe and she leaves the house, with Sir Paul screaming after her. However, when she returns to the house out of guilt, and because she lacks the capacity to kill someone, Jane discovers that Sir Paul has escaped from the closet.  He had called Mrs. Killbride with a phone that he had forgotten was in his pocket from a previous scene, telling her that he had locked himself in the wardrobe. Then, Sir Paul points a gun at Jane, and explains that Ralph killed himself because he could not stand the truth about himself, that he knew what Sir Paul had written about him was true. Sir Paul then confesses that he saw this "proxy child abuse" in the paintings because he saw his own secret in the paintings. Sir Paul, too, is a pedophile. He invites Jane to shoot him, but she leaves the house instead. As she drives away, Sir Paul shoots himself inside the mansion.

Alone and afraid for her child, Beth wanders outside of the facility where she finds three other mothers who have also been kidnapped and had their unborn children surgically removed. The group finds another woman, barely alive, with her womb surgically opened, who declares her child to be “blue."  As the mothers search around, they discover that their babies are alive and locked in cages, with colored clips that are matched to a colored tag sewn inside their true mother's abdomen. The only way to match the mother to the child is to remove the tag from their abdomens, which will lead to death by blood loss. One of the mothers decides the only way to find out which baby is hers is to kill the other women, remove their tag, and find her baby through the process of elimination. One by one, the women are picked off by the crazed mother until Beth catches and fatally injures her. Before she dies, she threatens to drop the remaining tag down a hole unless Beth promises to take care of her baby as well. The woman dies and Beth takes the tag from her hand. She then uses the tags to find the color for her baby. As she returns to find that the babies are no longer in their crib cages, she is knocked out by an unknown assailant.  Beth regains consciousness and finds herself chained to the floor. She sees a [[Russians|Russian]] couple inspecting her baby and they reveal their scam: prospective parents receive a baby to adopt based on their mother's [[Survival of the fittest|performance]] in the warehouse experiment; the winning mother has the strongest child and that child is the one set for adoption.

He poisons the mind of Joe Joseph against the other four, making him believe that the most notorious among them, Sathish ([[Rayan Raj]]), who is also the son of the home minister ([[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Saikumar]]), is simply making use of them. The five of them, annoyed with Ananthu, plot to frame him in a molestation case and get him ousted from the college. Rakhi plays a trick on him, calling him to a posh hotel room on the pretext of telling him something important. Ananthu goes, only to be pounced upon forcefully by Anu. Ananthu tries to push her away, but she doesn't let go. This sequence of events is secretly recorded by the rest on video, and it appears as though Ananthu has molested Anu. Now the five of them appear, and in anger, Ananthu slaps Rakhi. Enraged at that, Joseph attacks Ananthu and wounds him, thus killing him on the spot. These subsequent events also get recorded on camera.  Thinking he is dead, the gang decide to bury Ananthu and cover up the homicide. Joseph keeps the video tape with him. As Joe and Anand are trying to take the body, they are intercepted by police, whom Joseph just evades and speeds off. But before the police can take action, Sathish arrives in another car and being the son of the CM, he requests the cops to leave the boys as they were "[[substance intoxication|high]]". The five then meet and bury the body.  The gang now try to continue their lives as usual, but not for long. It soon appears to some of them as though Rohith has come back.But Sathish rubbishes it all and does not believe any of it.  The first person to be killed is Joseph. After a late night [[party]], he happens to stumble in the [[anatomy]] lab out of curiosity when he sees someone, presumed to be Rohit, lurking there. He is then attacked by Rohit and hanged in the lab.  Inspector Sudeep([[Biju Menon]]) appears on the scene as the investigating officer. He investigates the case and realizes that something is very fishy about the gang of five. He especially suspects Sathish.  The remaining four assume that Joseph commit suicide, but things don't go well for long. Sudeep investigates about everyone from a notorious college doctor Munthiri Paadam alias Shine Raj([[Suraj Venjaramoodu]])and gathers facts. He learns that Rohit never was a student or house surgeon at the colleges he claimed to be from. Sudeep now starts investigating about the missing Ananthu/ Rohit, worsening tension for the four of the gang. On the pretext of consoling Joe's parents, they arrive at his house and secretly take the video tape, which Sathish keeps.  Sathish and Anand attack Shine raj for telling things to police, but he evades them and dashes for the woods, and as fate would have it, he stumbles exactly upon the same site where Rohit was buried. The body is now exhumed by Sudeep, who continues to investigate the murder of Rohit.  The next person to be murdered is Rakhi. As Anu and Rakhi are one day returning on a late evening, passing through desolate grounds, they lose balance and fall, when Anu thinks she sees Rohit and startles Rakhi. Anu gets injured and faints. At this point, Rohit appears on the scene and bludgeons Rakhi to death.  Anand realizes that he probably is the next victim, and decides to leave for his hometown immediately. As he nears his house at night, he is attacked by Rohit, forcefully bound and thrown before a fast moving truck on the [[highway]].  Now the remaining two are in panic. Anu is hospitalized, where she tells everything to her parents, at which Sathish gets enraged. Anu's parents decide to tell Sudeep everything and they call him, but Sathish warns them that even their only daughter will be in trouble if they do so. Terrified that she will be convicted, her parents do not tell Sudeep anything. But the latter understands.  As Anu's parents are getting her discharged from hospital, she is forcefully carried alone in the elevator to the top desolate floor of the hospital, where she is pushed into the [[operating room]], and Rohit appears and cuts her entire body with a [[scalpel]].  Now suspicion falls on the only one still alive - Sathish. Sudeep goes to his house, forcefully arrests him, searches and finds the tape. He then proceeds to bring him to book by showing the tape in court. Unfortunately his co inspector falls for Sathish's money and replaces the tape for something else. Now Sathish is acquitted of all crimes. The enraged Sudeep thrashes the traitor, and warns Sathish's family that thoug he may have escaped the law, Sathish will be murdered next.  Sudeep also comes to know that the exhumed body is not that of anyone named Rohit.  Rohit now attacks Sathish at his house, and tries to drown him in the swimming pool, but is taken by surprise by Inspector Sudeep and an army of policemen who would be hiding in the minister's house.  Now Rohit alias Ananthakrishnan is arrested. He confesses to Sudeep that it was his idea altogether. His beloved Athira ([[Bhama]])was brutally murdered by Sathish and his friends, and to cover up the crimes, Sathish also murdered his uncle and aunt through a car accident. To take revenge, he enrolled himself for house surgency in the same hospital, and poisoned the minds of all the 5 culprits. He particularly had chosen Joe. It was Joe who had attacked him on purpose, and who had told everyone that Rohit had died in the hotel. When he had sped away in the jeep from police, he took a deviation to the [[anatomy]] lab, where Rohit got off, and a cadaver was put in the car covered with blankets. Joe then caught up with the other four and buried the cadaver. Rohit then murdered Joe first as he knew his secret, then remained in hiding and murdered three of the gang.He also asserts that he has no remorse for his actions. He would have surrendered to police anyway after all 5 were gone. Sudeep sympathizes with Rohit.   As Rohit alias Ananthu is being taken to court, the police, bribed by Sathish, take him to the [[sea harbour]], where Rohit meets the wicked Sathish, who says he wants to personally take revenge on the former, and that it was he who killed Ananthu's loved ones. The enraged Ananthu breaks from the police, thrashes them all and runs after the terrified Sathish. He follows him clinging to the latter's jeep, and they reach a bridge, where he beats Sathish. Sudeep and the cops arrive on the scene and warn Ananthu to stop, but he throws Sathish off the bridge, thus killing him. The film ends there.

Watched over by a neutral spirit named Purapura in the form of a little boy, the soul must figure out what his greatest sin and mistake in his former life was before his six-month time limit in Makoto's body runs out. He also has a number of other lesser duties he must complete, such as understanding what led Makoto to commit suicide in the first place and learning how to enjoy his second chance at life.  He finds Makoto did not like his family and he greatly dislikes them for the same reasons. He is contemptuous of his father who is an underdog at work, forced to work lots of unpaid overtime. Despite her efforts, he hates his mother who had an affair with a dance instructor, something his father seems to be oblivious of. His older brother Mitsuru has given up on him because he is too moody and has no friends at school or anywhere else. He discovers that a girl (Hiroka) he fancies sells sex to older men so she can have the clothes and things she wants. Shoko is a weird girl from Makoto's class who becomes suspicious of his unusual behavior so he tries to stay away from her. After he gets mugged and beaten up by some delinquents, Shoko comes to visit Makoto at his house, but he scares her off. In one of their subsequent encounters Purapura explains that Makoto will really die this time after his six months expire. However, when he befriends Saotome, a boy in his class who accepts outcasts such as him and treats them as equals, Makoto sees the joy in life for the first time. They spend some time together and they even begin studying for their high school entrance exam, something for which neither of them had any ambition before.  Knowing that his brother will never get accepted to a public high school due to his failing grades and lack of interest, Mitsuru announces that he will postpone his college entrance exams in order to allow his parents to save some money so they can send Makoto to a private school. Makoto refuses and tells his parents and brother that he has already chosen Tamegawa High (a public school he and Saotome agreed on earlier). An aggravated Mitsuru is unable to comprehend his unwillingness to accept his family's help and asks him if he enjoys tormenting his own family. Makoto breaks in tears and says that he just wanted to go to the same school his only friend is going to apply which leads to his parents accepting his wish. With his deadline reaching its end, Makoto meets with Purapura for one last time. He announces that he has found out what his former life's mistake was. He reveals that the soul was Makoto to begin with and that the mistake was his suicide. Purapura tells him that he will keep on living, but that he will also erase his memories of Purapura and the spirit world in order to make Makoto not think that he has any more chances. Before wiping his memories, Purapura advises him to live a colorful life.

The Company Men
 When the publicly held [[shipbuilding]] corporation Global Transportation Systems, or GTX, is downsized in the midst of the [[Late 2000s recession|recession]], many employees are fired, including Bobby Walker ([[Ben Affleck]]). Walker is a [[white-collar worker|white-collar]], corporate ladder-climbing employee with a six-figure salary, a wife, and a teenage son and younger daughter.  Walker gets [[outplacement]] services from GTX but, without success, gradually loses luxuries such as his [[country club]] membership and his [[Porsche]]. He finally resorts to selling his expensive house (with a large mortgage) and moves his family in with his parents. Ultimately, Walker is forced to take a [[manual labor]] job working for his [[blue collar|blue-collar]] brother-in-law, Jack Dolan ([[Kevin Costner]]), installing drywall.  Chief Financial Officer Gene McClary ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]) challenges GTX CEO James Salinger ([[Craig T. Nelson]])'s strategy of employee cutbacks and questions the ethics of spending money to build new corporate headquarters while laying off employees. Angry at being questioned by McClary, his longtime friend, college roommate, and first employee, Salinger asserts that the deep cuts are necessary to increase profits, to increase the stock price and discourage a rumoured hostile takeover of the company.  Later, it is determined that an additional round of lay-offs is necessary. Senior manager Phil Woodward ([[Chris Cooper]]), who, over the course of 30 years, had risen from the factory floor to the corporate offices (a decidedly rare accomplishment), is also fired.

Woodward's life quickly falls apart as employer after employer tells him he is either too old to start a new career, or too old to do jobs that those half his age find difficult. At his wife's request, Woodward goes out every morning as usual with his briefcase to keep his situation secret from the neighbors, but he cannot do anything to abate his mounting bills or his daughter's impending college tuition bill. Frustrated and depressed, he commits suicide in his garage by carbon-monoxide poisoning.  Despite McClary's anger, he has become even wealthier as a shareholder of the firm (the value of his GTX stock options increases due to the company's downsizing), but he feels guilty about his company ruining so many lives and, instead, would rather put people to work. Feeling the need for a change, he leaves his wife and starts his own business. Walker is the first person he hires.  Walker arrives at the bare offices to help start a new business composed of many former GTX employees.

Confessions (2010 film)
 Junior high school teacher Yuko Moriguchi ([[Takako Matsu]]) announces to her class that she will resign before spring break. Moriguchi reveals that because the HIV-positive biological father of her daughter Manami was ill, she used to bring Manami (Mana Ashida) to school with her. One day, after school, she returned to the room where Manami was but found her gone. Her daughter was later found drowned in a school swimming pool. She then explains that two pupils in her class, whom she dubs "Student A" and "Student B", have murdered her four-year-old daughter.  She had found a small bunny purse amongst Manami's belongings which should not have belonged there, which led her to question Shuya, one of her students. Shuya, who immediately admitted killing Manami, mocked her compassionate reaction to his feigned expression of remorse with "just kidding".  Having revealed their identities, she explained that because the killers, as minors, are protected by the [[Law of Japan#Criminal law|Juvenile Law of 1947]], turning them in wouldn't make a difference. So to exact revenge on them, she admits injecting her late daughter's biological father's [[HIV]]-contaminated blood in the milk cartons of the two students who she claimed to have murdered her daughter. The rest of the film switches between the aftermath of Moriguchi's confession and the events before the confession through a series of first-person narratives from Moriguchi and her three students.   Naoki Shimomura (Kaoru Fujiwara), Student B, becomes a [[Hikikomori|shut-in]] because he believes he has acquired [[AIDS]] from drinking HIV-contaminated milk. His mother (Yoshino Kimura), after spotting the hidden malicious messages in well-wishes cards from Naoki's classmates, realizes her son was somehow involved with an earlier incident. She decides to commit murder-suicide to free her son and herself from torment, but in the ensuing struggle, Naoki kills her. The police arrest him for the murder.   Shuya Watanabe (Yukito Nishii), Student A, explains that his mother abused him before leaving to pursue her scientific ambitions. He confesses that her abandonment has driven him to thrive in science, from making small inventions to recording his killing and dissecting animals. His first public invention, an electric anti-mugger wallet, earned him a science fair award, but it failed to make the headlines as the media was busy covering the "Lunacy Incident".  Shuya and Naoki's recollections reveal that Shuya said he had upgraded the anti-mugger wallet. He decided to try it out on someone and roped Naoki in to help with his plan. They decided on Moriguchi's daughter Manami. However, when they tested it on Manami, Shuya's device only managed to render Manami unconscious. Shuya mistook this as instant death, who then told Naoki to tell the world that Shuya did it. Enraged Naoki then threw the conscious Manami into the pool where she drowned, therefore proving he was the more effective killer.  The classmates force classmate Mizuki Kitahara (Ai Hashimoto) to kiss Shuya as part of their bullying against Shuya. Mizuki later tells Shuya she believes Moriguchi had lied about the blood-contaminated milk as it was an implausible method of transmission. After spending time together, Mizuki eventually confesses to Shuya that she identified the "Lunacy Murder" girl, who poisoned her parents, as her other self. They soon became romantically involved, but Shuya kills her after a confrontation over his [[Oedipus Complex]] and claims that she was nothing but "a means to relieve boredom".  After finally finding messages left with his mother's name and work place, Shuya visits the university where his mother works expecting to reunite with her, but discovers she has remarried. Believing she has forgotten him, he plants a bomb in his school's sport hall where the graduation ceremony is to be held and he is to give a speech. However, to his surprise, the bomb does not go off during the ceremony. As he tries to work out what has happened, he receives a call from Moriguchi, who says that she has relocated the bomb to his mother's office. She explains that it is her ultimate revenge, to let Shuya's mother die by his own hands, but his redemption would now begin. As the screen darkens, Moriguchi chuckles and says, "just kidding."  
The Confession (2010 film)
  Sam, an eight-year-old attending a Catholic school, and his trouble making friend Jacob prepare for their first confession. Their class is given a list of sins that children can confess. These include "bullying" and "swearing" among others.   Sam pores over the list but is unable to come up with a sin he has done. Sam asks Jacob what he will confess. Jacob states that he would mention not listening to his mother and locking his sister in the closet. Sam feels like he will not be a true Catholic if he cannot be absolved, so he turns to Jacob to suggest a sin Sam could commit and then confess to.  Jacob and Sam decide to steal Farmer Collins’ Scarecrow and leave in middle of the road for him to find while he is driving his tractor to town, committing the sin of "stealing."  The plan backfires when Famer Collins pulls off the main road before he sees the stolen scarecrow. At the moment the tractor pulls off the road, another car speeds down the twisted and deserted street and, believing the scarecrow to be a dead body, swerves to avoid it and crashes into a tree. Sam walks up to the car and sees a woman and a little girl alive, but severely dazed and bleeding from the head. The car bursts into flames. Sam and Jacob flee the scene with the scarecrow. As they are running through the woods they hear the car explode.   Sam and Jacob push the scarecrow off a cliff by the tree they play by every day. Jacob makes Sam swear never to tell anyone because "it was an accident."  Sam is full of guilt. That night he dreams the dead woman, the farmer and his father all know. He is haunted by what he has done.  In school the next day Sam runs out of his class into the bathroom, unable to deal with what he has done. Jacob runs after him and tells him that no one knows that he has to keep it together. Jacob tells Sam to meet him at the tree where they hid the scarecrow after dinner.  During dinner that night Sam’s father mentions that Collins’ scarecrow was missing, leading guilt striven Sam to believe that his father knows what he has done. After dinner he meets Jacob by the tree. Sam wants to tell someone what has happened. Jacob states that if he does Jacob will deny everything because it was Sam’s fault. The two boys start pushing each other, while Sam yells over and over again "it’s not my fault, it’s not my fault."  During the fight Sam accidentally pushes Jacob into the same cliff they dumped the scarecrow the day before. Jacob dies instantly.  The next day Sam goes to church early in the morning in his robes to have his first confession. While the Priest states that confession does not start until later, Sam insists that he confess his sins now. The Priest, seeing that something is clearly troubling Sam, agrees.  Sam states "Bless me father for I have sinned, this is my first confession."  The Priest gently asks Sam to name his sins. With tears streaming down his face Sam, unable to say all he has done, confesses not listening to his mother and locking his sister in the closet, the same sins his now deceased friend Jacob was going to confess. The Priest declares Sam’s sins to be absolved. The scene changes to the empty cross in the field and then fades to black.

Conviction (2010 film)
 Betty Anne Waters' life revolves around her brother, who is now in jail for murder. Despite Kenny's knack for getting in trouble, they have always been close. After the murder, Kenny is initially brought in for questioning by Sergeant Nancy Taylor, but released. Two years later, based on new testimony from two witnesses, Kenny is arrested and tried. The evidence presented at Kenny's trial is entirely circumstantial, but he is convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The three main witnesses against him are Sergeant Taylor, his ex-wife Brenda, and ex-girlfriend Roseanna.  Three years later, Betty Anne lives with her husband, Rick and two sons, Richard and Ben. She is frantic that she has not heard from Kenny, who calls her every week from prison, and finally discovers that he tried to commit suicide. Betty Anne decides to go back to school and become a lawyer so she can exonerate him, but her husband is skeptical and unsupportive, and eventually they split up. As Betty Anne struggles with being a working mother attending law school, flashbacks reveal that her mother was callous and uncaring, forcing Kenny and Betty Anne to fend for themselves. The two were very close, but frequently got into trouble, and were eventually taken away from their mother and sent to separate foster homes.  Betty Anne continues to visit Kenny in prison, working in a bar while going to school, but her busy schedule causes her to miss a planned outing with her sons, who decide they would be better off living with their father. Struggling in school, demoralized and exhausted, Betty Anne stops going to classes, until a friend from school, Abra, comes to her house and prods her to just get up, get dressed, and get back to class.  In a study group, Betty Anne learns about the new field of DNA testing and realizes that this could be the key to overturning Kenny's conviction, as only blood types had been matched at the time of the trial. She contacts attorney Barry Scheck from the [[Innocence Project]]. The backlog of cases will mean waiting at least 18 months unless she can pass the bar exam and find the blood evidence from Kenny's trial herself to have it tested. She passed the bar exam and now she is working hard to get her brother out of jail. At first she is stonewalled, then told the evidence was destroyed, but she refuses to give up, and she and Abra embark on an odyssey to recover any evidence that might still be stored away somewhere. In the process, Betty Anne learns that Nancy Taylor was fired from the police department for fabricating evidence in another case, which deepens Betty Anne's suspicions about Kenny's conviction and the evidence presented at trial. Finally the DNA results come back and establish that the blood was not Kenny's. Betty Anne and Kenny are overjoyed anticipating his release, but Martha Coakley, of the District Attorney's office, refuses to vacate the conviction, claiming that there was still enough evidence to convict Kenny as an accomplice. Kenny is convinced that no matter what, the authorities will find a way to keep him in prison to avoid admitting their mistake. Betty Anne is heartbroken again, but refuses to give up after Barry advises her that their discovery not only proves Kenny's innocence, but also that the main witnesses against him were lying.  Betty Anne, Abra, and Scheck visit the other two main trial witnesses, Kenny's ex-wife and his ex-girlfriend. Both tearfully confess that Sergeant Taylor coerced them into perjuring themselves at Kenny's trial. With an affidavit from Kenny's ex-wife and the DNA evidence, Kenny's conviction is vacated and he is freed from prison in June 2001. Betty Anne is able to persuade his daughter, Mandy, whom he hadn't had any contact with since she was a small child, that he never stopped trying to reach out to her while he was in prison. He is able to reconnect with his daughter, and is reunited with his sister and her sons.

Cop Out (2010 film)
 James "Jimmy" Monroe and Paul Hodges ([[Bruce Willis]] and [[Tracy Morgan]]) are [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] [[detectives]]. After failing to capture suspect Juan Diaz (Cory Fernandez) and endangering civilians, Jimmy and Paul are suspended without pay. Jimmy's daughter Ava ([[Michelle Trachtenberg]]) is getting married, and the cost of the wedding is close to fifty thousand dollars. Though his ex-wife Pam's arrogant second husband Roy ([[Jason Lee (actor)|Jason Lee]]) offers to pay for the wedding, Jimmy is determined to find a way to come up with the money. Meanwhile, Paul is worried that his wife Debbie ([[Rashida Jones]]) is cheating on him, so he sets up a [[hidden camera]]. While Jimmy is selling a 1952 [[Andy Pafko]] [[baseball card]] to pay for the wedding, the card shop is robbed by Dave ([[Seann William Scott]]), who steals Jimmy's card and Paul's favorite gun. They find out that Dave is going to rob a house that night so they stake out the house to retrieve the card and the gun. Jimmy and Paul arrest Dave, but he has already sold the card and the gun for drugs.  Jimmy and Paul go to the [[drug dealer]], Poh Boy ([[Guillermo Díaz (actor)|Guillermo Díaz]]), who tells them they may have the card if they retrieve a [[Car theft|stolen car]]. When they find the car, they discover a woman named Gabriela ([[Ana de la Reguera]]) in the trunk. Gabriela reveals that she is the mistress of a [[drug lord]] who was kidnapped and murdered by Poh Boy's gang. Jimmy previews the tape from Paul's hidden camera and finds what looks to be Debbie and another man, but he tells Paul there is nothing on it. Paul then sees the tape and is heartbroken when he sees that Jimmy has lied. Gabriela does not want to get Jimmy and Paul hurt, so she flees, leaving them a [[flashdrive]] concealed in a [[crucifix]], which contains all the dealer's contacts.  Jimmy and Paul bail out Dave so he can retrieve the card and the gun from Poh Boy, but he falls out of a tree and dies. Jimmy breaks into the house to retrieve the card but is surrounded by the gang. At the same time, Paul learns that Debbie played a trick on him for not trusting her. After killing most of the gang, Jimmy and Paul find Poh Boy holding Gabriela at gunpoint. They shoot him dead, but Paul's bullet goes through Jimmy's baseball card, in Poh Boy's shirt pocket. Pleased with the duo's investigation and assisting two colleagues ([[Adam Brody]] and [[Kevin Pollak]]) who were caught in the shootout, the precinct chief (Sean Cullen) restores Jimmy and Paul to active duty and gives them commendations.  Crestfallen at the destruction of his prized card, Jimmy lets Roy pay for the wedding. Pam asks Jimmy ''and'' Roy to give away Ava together. Jimmy says nothing about it. Paul discreetly points his pistol at Roy and orders him to sit down at the moment the priest calls out for the father who would give away Ava. A bonus scene during the [[closing credits]] reveals that Dave did not die in the fall when he pulls a prank on the coroner opening the [[body bag]] by doing one of his [[knock-knock joke]]s resulting in her fleeing in horror while Dave exits the body bag in laughter.

The Conspirator
 On April 14, 1865, five days after the Civil War ends with the South's surrender to the North at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, lawyer and Union veteran [[Frederick Aiken]], with his friends, [[William Thomas Hamilton]] and Nicholas Baker, and girlfriend, Sarah Weston, celebrate. Later that same night, Southerner [[Lewis Payne]] unsuccessfully attempts to kill Secretary of State [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], only seriously wounding him. German immigrant and carriage repair business owner [[George Atzerodt]] is assigned to kill Vice President [[Andrew Johnson]] but becomes afraid and runs away. Meanwhile, actor [[John Wilkes Booth]] enters Ford's Theatre and sees his target, President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Booth sneaks into the President's box and shoots Lincoln, mortally wounding him. Booth stabs diplomat and military officer [[Henry Rathbone]] who was a guest in Lincoln's box, and leaps onto the stage, shouting, "Sic Semper Tyrannis! The South is avenged!" before escaping. A crowd, including Aiken, Hamilton and Baker, watch in horror as the unconscious President is taken to a nearby boarding house where he dies early the next morning.  Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] orders all suspects, including [[Mary Surratt]], arrested. Booth and [[David Herold]] manage to evade capture for some days, but Union soldiers find a barn where they suspect the conspirators are hiding and set it on fire. Herold is arrested, while Booth is shot and killed by sergeant [[Boston Corbett]].  Maryland Senator [[Reverdy Johnson]] is Mary Surratt's lawyer. Her son, [[John Surratt]], had escaped with hundreds of agents looking for him. Feeling unable to defend Surratt because he's a Southerner, Reverdy asks Aiken, a Northerner, to take over, but he tries to refuse. He is ordered to defend her and tells Sarah and his friends, who are shocked to hear this.  Aiken visits Mary in her cell to question her. Mary asks Aiken to look in on her daughter Anna. Aiken does so and searches the boarding house for clues. He finds a ticket with the initials "LJW" ([[Louis J. Weichmann]]). At the court, Weichman - a seminary friend of Mary's son John, is the first witness and describes John Surratt's meetings with Booth. Aiken incriminates Weichman, making him appear as guilty as the rest of the conspirators.  Aiken again tries to give up defending Mary, believing her guilty. He meets with her, intending to get evidence of her guilt. She explains that John and the others conspired to kidnap Lincoln, not to kill him. They were about to attack a carriage but were stopped by Booth who reported that Lincoln was elsewhere. She says John left town and went into hiding after this, two weeks before the assassination. Aiken asks Anna for information to help with his trial preparations, but she refuses.  At the court, Chief Prosecutor [[Joseph Holt]] brings Innkeeper [[John M. Lloyd|John Lloyd]] to the stand. Lloyd claims that Mary sent binoculars to Booth and prepared shooting irons and whiskey for Booth and Herold on the night of the assassination. Aiken angers Lloyd, implying that he was bribed for his testimony in whiskey. Lloyd is dragged out of the courtroom after threatening Aiken.  While attempting to attend a party at the Century Club, Aiken finds his membership has been revoked due to his defending Mary Surratt. This triggers an argument with Sarah and she disowns and leaves him. Aiken asks Anna to testify next. Anna testifies that Mary had no part in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, but that it was her brother John instead. Anna visits Aiken at his house and tells him about Booth and John, and sends him to where John Surratt is hiding. He brings the message that John must surrender or his mother will hang for his crimes. On July 6, Mary is found guilty on all charges and, with Stanton's intervention, sentenced to hang with three others on the 7th. Aiken procures a writ of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]] to try Mary in civilian court, but President Johnson suspends the writ and Mary is hanged.  Sixteen months later, Aiken visits John Surratt, who was captured abroad and is in jail. John thanks him for his kindness to his mother. Aiken offers him Mary's rosary but he declines. The epilogue goes on to state that a year later the Supreme Court ruled that citizens were entitled to trial by a civilian jury and not a military tribunal, even in times of war (''[[Ex parte Milligan]]''). A jury of Northerners and Southerners could not agree on a verdict for John Surratt so he was freed. Aiken left the law and became ''[[The Washington Post]]''s first City Editor.  
Country Strong
 Beau sings with Kelly, a recovering [[alcoholic]] going through rehab. He is clearly smitten by her, and it is later revealed that the two have been having an affair, even though Kelly is married to James. Kelly is checked out of rehab a month early by James, who wants her to go on a three-city tour to restore her image. She agrees on the condition that Beau becomes her opening act. James has already planned to see Chiles Stanton, a beauty queen with potential to become a rising singer, perform that night in hopes that she will be Kelly's opener instead.  On the night of Chiles' performance, Beau dismisses Chiles as a "Country Barbie" and does not want her on the tour. Chiles' performance nearly falls apart as she gets stage fright and can not sing; however, Beau steps in and begins to sing "[[Friends in Low Places]]". The two sing the song together, and it gives Chiles the courage to continue on her own. James is impressed by Beau's performance, and offers the opening act to both of them. He suggests that Beau and Chiles could make quite the duo, but Beau disagrees. Nevertheless, Beau agrees to go on the tour because he cares about Kelly.  The first show is a disaster: before going on, Kelly receives an anonymous package containing a bloody baby doll with a note reading "Baby Killer," referring to the baby Kelly miscarried when she fell off the stage in [[Dallas]] during her last concert before she went into rehab. At that concert, she was five months [[pregnant]] and was found to have a [[blood alcohol level]] of 0.19 when she was in the hospital for the injuries related to the fall. Kelly falls apart, starts drinking, and almost refuses to go on. However, she is coerced into going on stage by James. She begins to sing "[[Country Strong (song)|Country Strong]]" but breaks down on stage. She attempts to try another song, "A Fighter", but breaks down again and is led off stage by her husband, ending the show. They tell the media at a press conference that they had to cancel the show due to [[food poisoning]] and head off to the next show.  Beau ends his relationship with Kelly, and begins to spend more time with Chiles, whose fame has been increasing as the tour progresses. Chiles and Beau form a bond and Beau lets go of his earlier hostilities towards her. She even finishes the chorus to his song "Give in to Me". Later, Beau confronts James about Kelly's worsening condition. James insists that Kelly may get better, and says that he can't let her go out with a failure. Beau disagrees and subtly admits their affair. Enraged, James punches him in the jaw.  Before the next show in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], Kelly is unable to go on stage after drinking. Beau and Chiles still do their opening act, where they perform "Give in to Me" for the first time together. JJ, Kelly's agent, nearly cancels the tour but is dissuaded by Kelly's offer of sex; having witnessed this, Beau becomes frustrated with Kelly. That same night, Chiles and Beau have sex, and Beau confesses to Chiles that he likes her. In Dallas, Beau gives Chiles a pair of star-shaped earrings and asks her to move with him to California. Chiles immediately agrees, but then asks for more time to consider the offer.  The two perform and Kelly comes out, this time sober and ready, and performs her entire set for the first time. Kelly performs "Country Strong", "Shake That Thing", and "Coming Home". After the concert, James and JJ immediately begin making plans for Kelly's future. That night, Kelly commits [[suicide]] by [[drug overdose|overdosing]] on [[prescription medication]].  She leaves a letter to Beau, echoing his earlier words that "Love and fame can't live in the same place." In the letter, she gives him the advice to choose "love". Beau takes her advice, and after Kelly's funeral, he moves to California.  Later on, Beau is singing in a bar in California, when Chiles walk in, wearing the earrings he gave her. They begin singing "Give in to Me" together.

The Cost of Love
 Told mostly in first person, it is the story of Dale ([[Christopher Kelham]]), in which reality and fantasy intermingle so that the viewer is left to wonder at all times if a scene (or all scenes) are actual or Dale's imagination.  Dale is a hustler who from the onset of the film says he likes sex, lots of it and in all of its varied forms, including [[Sadomasochism|S&M]]. He spends his days cruising parks and saunas for casual sex or prostituting to high-paying clients making their sexual fantasies come true. Upfront with his sexuality and his hustling ways to everybody, Dale's hard exterior is a mask to hide his very fragile shattered interior. He has developed a rampant imagination and fantasies of his own that he resorts to in many situations he is in.    Dale is longing for his best friend since childhood, the "straight" Raj (Valmike Rampersad) and has developed very romantic feelings towards him. Dale is shocked when Raj asks him to become his best man at a hastily arranged wedding with Veena (Mandeesh Gill),<ref>[http://www.entertainment-focus.com/film/articles/the-cost-of-love Entertainment Focus: Review of Cost of Love] </ref> a children's teacher. But there is more to it, since it turns out she is terminally ill and has only a few months to live.   Besides Raj, the other main character is Sean (Michael Joyce, also known in gay scene as the drag artist Estee Applauder) who is Dale's confidant and has an obvious crush on him. Sean has to deal with Christine (Caroline Burns Cooke). There is also Ricardo (Israel Cassol) who is a Brazilian hunk escort, friend of Dale, and a partner in many of his hustling acts. Pete (Robert Gray) is another character who has to come to terms with his sexuality through his involvement with Dale in a series of role-playing abusive relationship. Secrets are revealed when a stranger, Richard (Frank Jakeman), starts frequenting a bar where Sean is performing and makes approaches to reveal deep family secrets.  Homophobia is there with the murder of a young gay man on the [[Hampstead Heath|Heath]], a notable night-time cruising ground in London. Viewers are kept guessing whether this is actually Ricardo or some unknown character as Dale and Sean visit the site to put some flowers. This is also the prelude for a (real or imagined) fantasy scene where Dale is being murdered during an S&M act while he is fantasizing every detail of the gruesome torture and murder. And in a dreamlike "funeral scene", all the grieving characters are present in the church to "mourn" Dale's loss, while Dale is commenting on their lives after his departure, while they are reminiscing on the impact Dale had on all their lives.

  Thomas Zelda ([[Tim Allen]]) has been paroled from prison for being involved in [[Copyright infringement|movie piracy]].  He is picked up by his eccentric sister Viki ([[Sigourney Weaver]]) who is revealed to be a habitual liar (she claims it's so people aren't hurt by the truth).  He arrives at Viki's home where he plans to spend some time putting his life back together when it's revealed that his grandmother was told (by Viki) that he went to France instead of prison. Due to her heart condition, Tommy keeps up the story leading to a euphemism where France means "prison" (Viki's husband asks Tommy if he thinks he'll go "[[Recidivism|back to France]]" soon).  During dinner, Gray ([[Ray Liotta]]), Tommy's old partner from the movie piracy business, shows up and his sister runs him off.  The next day, Tommy meets with his parole officer, Angela Popadopolous ([[Jeanne Tripplehorn]]), who requires him to work at a pirate-themed restaurant called "Pirate Burger" as part of his parole.  He informs Angela that he wants to start up his father's painting business instead, but is told that he is required to work at the restaurant.  While on the job, he sees Christy ([[Julie Bowen]]), his "dead" ex-girlfriend come up to the drive-through window. Realizing Viki lied to him, he takes the delivery car to see Christy leading them to spend the night together.  The next morning, it is revealed that Christy is engaged to Frank ([[Kelsey Grammer]]) and Tommy is forced to escape the apartment.  Since he took the delivery car without permission, he is fired from "Pirate Burger" and risks going back to jail for breaking the terms of his parole.  He is given another chance and goes back to work.  That night, he is "kidnapped" by Gray and Gray tries to persuade him to get back into the piracy business. Tommy refuses stating that he wants to "go straight".  Tommy is called to make a delivery. He arrives at the apartment of Angela. Her son is trying to play matchmaker to get her to start dating again. While there, he notices that the apartment is in need of a paint job. Tommy decides to show Angela the kind of work he can do. With the help of two ex-con coworkers Rick and Edgar ([[Malcolm Goodwin]] and [[Jon Gries]]) from Pirate Burger, he breaks into Angela's apartment while she's away and repaints the living room.  Meanwhile, the fictional story about Tommy's "France" trip continues to evolve including a relationship with Simone, a [[French space program|French astronaut]] who was killed on the launchpad so that Tommy's mother would not fly everyone to France to meet her (because she does not exist).  Angela is furious at Tommy for breaking and entering but understands what he was trying to do and doesn't press charges. She sets him up to paint a judge's home. While doing the job, Angela shows up to check on Tommy's work and invites him to observe her son's [[Little League Baseball|little league]] team. Later, the judge's wife who is impressed by the work invites Tommy to paint the upstairs as well.  While getting tools together, Edgar and Rick prepare the upstairs for painting and knock the judge's wife's diamond ring off the dresser.  Wanting to do something nice for Tommy, Edgar steals the ring and gives it to Christy as a "gift from Tommy". Tommy, who doesn't know that the theft has occurred, joins Angela at the little league game and they begin to express feelings for each other. They set up a formal [[Dating|date]].  When Tommy arrives at Angela's apartment for the date, Angela is furious over the theft and demands the ring back. He goes to Pirate Burger to confront Edgar and Rick, but they have disappeared. He steals the delivery car (his vehicle refuses to start) and calls Edgar and Rick. They inform him of the ring's location and he drives to Christy's house to get the ring back. After a short confrontation with Frank and Christy, he gets the ring and returns it to Angela.  The manager of Pirate Burger presses charges on Tommy and he goes back to jail. Gray shows up to bail him out and, disillusioned with his attempts to "go straight", Tommy teams back up with Gray.  Meanwhile, Angela's son shows up at Viki's house wanting to see Tommy but he is not there. Viki finds Tommy with Gray at the airport and makes up a story about Angela's son going missing. Tommy chooses to abandon Gray at the airport (after Gray pushes Viki to the ground) to find Angela's son. When he shows up at Angela's apartment, he finds out that Viki has lied to him again. Tommy's concern for the well being of her son softens Angela's animosity towards him.  At the behest of Viki, Tommy invites Angela to come to a dinner at Viki's house. Angela shows up for the dinner. A story Viki told Tommy's grandmother about Angela being Tommy's "grief counselor" falls apart when Angela informs her that she is actually Tommy's parole officer and the France story falls apart also.  The movie ends with Viki trying to act surprised but no one is buying it.  
The Crazies (2010 film)
 In the town of Ogden Marsh, [[Iowa]], local sheriff David Dutten ([[Timothy Olyphant]]) is enjoying a baseball game when it is interrupted by a crazed local resident entering the outfield with a shotgun. David attempts to dissuade him, but is forced to kill him when he raises his weapon. David and his wife Judy ([[Radha Mitchell]]), the lA community family doctor, has begun to notice another town resident exhibiting bizarre behavior, including lifeless and repetitive speech. The next night a local farmer Judy had seen just that morning locks his wife and son inside their farm house and burns it down, and then "mows the goddamn lawn".  Learning of a pilot's body found in a swamp, David and his deputy Russell Clank ([[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]]) investigate it. They discover a military aircraft that crashed into the river a few days before. Suspecting a link between the contaminated water and the residents' bizarre behavior, David attempts to have the town's water supply shut off, but is denied. He does so anyway, knowing it may cost him his job.  Soon after, all communication services are lost in town and David urges his wife to leave and go to her parents' house, but she refuses. Suddenly soldiers arrive to take all residents to quarantine at a high school. Everyone is examined for symptoms of infection. Judy does not pass the examination (later we find out the reason is that she is pregnant) and is separated from David. David escapes evacuation and heads back to his office, encountering Russell. The two head for the school to free Judy. At the school, the infected townspeople breach the perimeter, and the military personnel evacuate, abandoning the civilians. Judy wakes up strapped to a [[gurney]], and helplessly watches as a crazed school director kills quarantined people one by one. David and Russell save her and also find Becca ([[Danielle Panabaker]]), a hospital assistant.  Unable to find a working vehicle, the four make their way out of town on foot. They encounter Becca's boyfriend, Scotty, at his farm. Soldiers raid the farm, shoot Scotty and his mother, and burn the bodies. They learn that the soldiers have been ordered to shoot all civilians. The group repair an older patrol car in David's garage, and are ambushed by the infected family of Rory. After a struggle, Russell furiously shoots the infected multiple times. This greatly disturbs Judy, who argues with David about Russell's state of mind. On the road, they are spotted by an [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|attack helicopter]] and drive into a car wash for cover. The workers attack the car and drag Becca out with a wrapped hose, breaking her neck. When the rest of the group leaves the car to help her, the helicopter destroys the car.  While walking down the road, the group spots a black SUV speeding toward them, which Russell disables with a police [[spike strip]]. The driver, a government employee, reveals the cargo plane contained "Trixie," a "[[Rhabdoviridae]] prototype" [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]]. It was en route to Texas to be destroyed when the plane crashed. Enraged, Russell shoots him and threatens Judy and David. When confronted about his behavior, Russell realizes he is infected and, after being disarmed, begs to go on with Judy and David. At a roadblock, Russel volunteers to distract the soldiers so that Judy and David can sneak past. He calls out the soldiers on their actions and gets killed.  David and Judy arrive at a truck stop to search for a vehicle, discovering that the military have also executed those who were evacuated. Judy kills an infected while David fights with another infected and burns its body, killing it. They escape in a semi-truck, but as they drive away, a massive explosion destroys Ogden Marsh  and causes a shock wave that flips over their vehicle. As the couple walk towards [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa|Cedar Rapids]], a view from a military satellite highlights first the couple, then the city, and the words "Initiate containment protocol" appear, signifying a new containment task.

Dante's Inferno: An Animated Epic
  The movie is separated into several parts. Each chapter is animated with different styles. These vary in degree of difference and depict Dante with differing features, such as hair length, bodily proportions, and armor.  The film starts with Dante's return from the [[Third Crusade]]. Speaking in inner monologue, he describes the forests as gloomy and nearly worse than death. He can detect someone following him, but each time he tries to approach, his pursuer vanishes. Upon arriving, he finds his servants slain, his father dead and his beloved fiancee [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] lying on the ground, dying of a stab wound to the stomach. As she dies, she turns into a spirit and begins to ascend into [[Paradiso (Dante)|Heaven]]. However, disguised as a shadow, [[Satan|Lucifer]] takes Beatrice through the gates of [[Hell]].   In pursuit, Dante's chase through the Forrest is stopped as the portal that Lucifer opened for him and Beatrice encloses Dante there as well. He then slaughters a mob of zombies but is captured by a score of large and very long serpent arms which suspend him immobile and then sow into his flesh a torsolength, and apparently "living", cross-form tapestry that is covered in visual animated memories of his greatest sins, across the front of his body. [[Virgil]] appears then and offers to guide him through hell. After Dante invokes his [[faith]] he is able to tear open the gates and enter hell.  Upon Entry, Dante and Virgil bodily board the being [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]], itself a massive demonic living-ferry that takes [[soul|souls]] across the river [[Acheron ]] to the First Circle of Hell. Charon commands [[demon]]s to attack the mortal Dante, no living mortals being allowed to enter. Dante fights them off, but loses his sword in the process and so takes up one of the demons' [[scythe]]s to wield from then on and proceeds to kill Charon, crashing him into the coasts of the first circle.  Virgil and Dante enter the first circle, [[limbo]] which is home to mostly virtuous [[paganism|pagans]] and [[Infant baptism|unbaptized babies]]. It is here Dante learns Beatrice was pregnant with his child while he was away, but was miscarried in the womb. Without time for sorrow, he is attacked by demonic children. As he and Virgil escape into a large building, they come across a hall of great rulers, philosophers and thinkers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]] and [[Socrates]] and [[Saladin]], whose forces Dante had battled during his crusade. They move on, and eventually encounter King [[Minos]] whose task is to judge all [[Damnation|condemned]] souls to their sin's corresponding circle of hell. When he denies Dante access, they battle. Dante kills Minos by dropping him onto his own spinning wheel of judgment. Meanwhile, Lucifer [[torture|tortures]] Beatrice in a cycle of killing her, tricking her endlessly with the hope of rescue and taunting her that Dante had never kept his promises after he left.  Falling onto the storm-ravaged shores of the second circle, Dante notices bodies flying through the wind, intertwined. Virgil explains the island is the second circle of [[Lust]] and those in the wind are caught in a never-ending storm of passion and may never know rest. Following Beatrice's cries from the distance, Dante ends up in a room of [[succubi]] who transform into hideous demons. As they try to seduce him, he finally realizes that he did break his promise to Beatrice; during the Crusade an imprisoned heretic woman offered "[[comfort]]" in ransom to save her husband from being beaten to death. Having been under the illusion he was '[[absolution|absolved]]' of all sin by mere summary declaration by a priest, he accepted her offer. Upon hearing this, Beatrice begins to lose her faith yet refuses Lucifer's offers her his hand in marriage.  Coming to a [[grotto]] of men and women who had lived their lives without knowing fulfillment by [[gluttony]], so they suffer lacking it entirely in death. Many starving individuals are caught and devoured by [[Cerberus]] and Virgil tells Dante the only way to the next circle is from within the beast. Dante allows himself to be eaten by it and enters the [[Gastrointestinal tract|gut]] of the great hound of hell.  In order to escape Cerberus' belly, Dante attacks and destroys the beast's [[heart]], causing the demon to spit him up and spew him out in a river of blood that flows down into the next circle.  Dante and Virgil's next circle is the ring of hell to men and women who wasted their lives in pursuit of [[greed|material possessions]]. The condemned souls are tortured by being sheared in money presses, boiled in melted [[gold]] and buried in enormous mounds of heavy gold coins. Within this circle, Dante confronts his [[Alighiero di Bellincione|father]], having been promised a [[millennium|thousand years]] free of torture and endless gold if he would murder his own son. The pair battle fiercely, but Dante gains the upperhand, kicking his father into a vat of boiling gold.  The fifth circle of hell is [[Wrath]]. Virgil and Dante can sense the very rage in the air. They proceed to the [[River Styx]] in which violence is still running rampant among the spirits fighting in the shallow waters. They climb aboard [[Phlegyas]], a demonic giant who traverses the river while men and women who know of Dante taunt him from within the boiling mud below. Dante has Phlegyas charge the city when he sees Lucifer within, announcing to the damned souls within his intent to marry Beatrice. When he strikes Phlegyas down, Dante chases after the [[devil]].  The sixth circle of hell is for the [[Heresy|heretics]], people who have gone against the teaching of their churches. As they travel through halls of men and women who [[Christian views on hell#Eternal_torment_view|forever burn in fire]] and are therein also tortured by various implements, Dante comes across Farinata, another man Dante hated in life, who taunts Dante by revealing Lucifer's plan to wed Beatrice and how he would be trapped in hell forever. Dante angrily kills [[Farinata degli Uberti|Farinata]] just before fleeing the sixth circle and before it collapses from the [[harrowing of hell|force of Christ's death]] which, Virgil explains, quakes the circle eternally.  Virgil helps Dante face the [[minotaur]], guardian of the Circle of Violence, causing an easy defeat by allowing the beast's anger to get the better of him.  Dante and Virgil enter the seventh circle: Violence, having been helped across the river by the [[centaur]] [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]]. In this river they behold many souls boiling in a vast river of the [[blood]] of their own victims; violence they had inflicted upon others. Entering the Forest of [[suicide|Suicides]], Dante hears a familiar cry and finds his mother growing from the sapling of a tree, forever in pain for killing herself and not finding the strength to stand up against or leave her husband, Dante's father, she eventually [[hanged]] herself. Dante had been told she died of a fever. Having been overwhelmed with sorrow, Dante uses his [[cross]] to [[Redemption (theology)|free her soul]]. They move onto a graveyard within the Abominable Sands where his one time comrades and one of his close friends Francesco rises from the grave, with his fallen comrade crusaders, as [[undead]] warriors. This graveyard is where souls are condemned for committing acts of violence in the name of God. Dante defeats Francesco by slicing his head in half laterally. It is in this that Dante reflects upon slaughtering several heretics including men, women and children without [[mercy]].  After being carried by the [[geryon]], Virgil parts ways with Dante upon entering the realm of [[Fraud]], the eighth circle, telling him he only needs to cross a continuous series of several very large bridges in order to stop the marriage of Beatrice and Lucifer who are just beyond the far end of the bridges. As Dante starts crossing, he begins to reflect upon his own [[sins]]. He realizes his father, family servants and Beatrice were slain by the husband of the woman with whom he had been [[adultery|unfaitful]] to Beatrice and thus blames their deaths on himself. Beatrice finally gives in to her sorrow of Dante's betrayal, thus wedding Lucifer and fully becoming a demon, losing her wings and rights to heaven. Her body entirely becoming entirely a flaming, Beatrice proceeds to attack Dante, overpowering him and forces him to look on his greatest sin, letting him peer into the ninth circle of [[Betrayal|Treachery]]. This [[Seven deadly sins|cardinal sin]] had been his allowing her brother to [[self-sacrifice|willingly]] take the blame for his slaughtering of the heretic prisoners. Thus overwhelmed with grief, he presents Beatrice her cross, which he had [[vow|promised]] to give back to her upon his return from the crusade. She relents as he begs for [[forgiveness]] and pleads with her to once again accept the [[love of God]], and so she [[forgiveness|forgives]] him, causing her to return to her previous angelic form as she kisses him. A two-headed [[Cherub|Angel]] descends from heaven to take her. Beatrice promises they will be together soon, but in order to escape hell he will need to face Lucifer [[single combat|alone]].  Descending into final circle, the cold caverns of traitors, and after wandering in the dark he comes across a very large cave filled with huge frozen chains blocking the path and thenmows through them, only to encounter a three-faced demon in the center who appears to be Lucifer's corporeal form. So then Lucifer, having been freed by the rending his chains, attacks Dante. Dante slays the beast and is within a short span of escaping Hell and entering Purgatory, where his [[salvation]] awaits. Lucifer however, now freed from his previous frozen form now reveals his true corporeal form, breaks free from his false body and easily overpowers Dante, promising to enter Purgatory, and then even Paradise, to rend heaven into a new and greater hell. Dante realizes he cannot stop Lucifer on his own. So Dante then [[prayer|prays]] and [[repentance|repents]] in [[humility]] and [[supplication|begs]] for [[divine]] forgiveness and to sacrifice his own soul to defeat Lucifer and so prevent him from his sworn conquest of the higher realms, pleading for the power to trap Lucifer with him forever. Lucifer runs back in shocked horror, trying to stop Dante from making this pact; however, he is stopped by an explosive beam of light, emanating from Dante, that freezes stop and freezes Lucifer solid.   Free to move on, Dante dives into the chasm that leads through the earth to Purgatory to be with Beatrice. Now "neither completely living, nor completely dead" as he puts it. Later that night the flesh-emblem of sin he ripped off his chest transforms into a serpent, supposedly Lucifer waiting to get his revenge, that slithers away into the distance.

Date Night
 Phil and Claire Foster ([[Steve Carell]] and [[Tina Fey]]) are a married couple from [[New Jersey]] with two children, Ollie and Charlotte, and whose domestic life has become boring and routine. They have not had sex in over a year. Phil is a tax lawyer while Claire is a [[realtor]]. They are motivated to reignite their romance after learning that their best friends, Brad and Haley ([[Mark Ruffalo]] and [[Kristen Wiig]]), are planning to divorce to escape the married-life routine and to have more excitement in their lives.  To avoid the routine that had become their weekly "date night", Phil decides that he will take Claire to a trendy [[Manhattan]] restaurant, but they cannot get a table. Phil steals a reservation from a no-show couple, the Tripplehorns, despite Claire's misgivings. While eating they are approached by two men, Collins ([[Common (entertainer)|Common]]) and Armstrong ([[Jimmi Simpson]]), who question them about a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] they believe Phil and Claire stole from [[mobster]] boss Joe Miletto ([[Ray Liotta]]). Phil and Claire explain that they are not the Tripplehorns, but the men threaten them at gunpoint and don't believe them. Not seeing any other way out, Phil lies and tells them it's in a boathouse in [[Central Park]].  At the boathouse, Claire pretends to search; while Collins and Armstrong's backs are turned, Phil hits them with a paddle and escapes with Claire on a boat. At a police station, Phil and Claire talk with Detective Arroyo ([[Taraji P. Henson]]), but discover Collins and Armstrong are also detectives, presumably on Miletto's payroll. Realizing they cannot trust the police, they decide to find the real Tripplehorns. They return to the restaurant and find the cellphone number of the Tripplehorns.  Claire remembers a former client, Holbrooke Grant ([[Mark Wahlberg]]), a security expert and [[James Bond]]-like action hero. He is consistently seen never wearing a shirt. At his apartment, Grant traces the cellphone signal to an apartment owned by Tom Felton. Collins and Armstrong arrive, but Phil and Claire escape in Grant's [[Audi R8]].  They arrive at Felton's apartment and break in. They question Felton, nicknamed "Taste" ([[James Franco]]), and his wife "Whippit" ([[Mila Kunis]]) about the flash drive and Joe Miletto. It turns out that they went to the restaurant, but left when they spotted Collins. Realizing they are in danger, the couple give the flash drive to Phil and flee. When Phil and Claire get back in the Audi, Armstrong and Collins shoot at them. Phil and Claire crash the Audi [[head-on collision|head-on]] into a [[Ford Crown Victoria]] [[taxicab]], resulting in their Audi and the Ford being attached at the bumpers. Phil and the cab driver ([[J. B. Smoove]]) decide to drive off to get away. Phil climbs into the Ford to navigate while Claire navigates the Audi. Phil checks the flash drive on the driver's [[Amazon Kindle]] and finds pictures of district attorney Frank Crenshaw ([[William Fichtner]]) with [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] (early in the film, a press conference shows Crenshaw highlighting his integrity platform). After evading Collins and Armstrong, they are eventually hit and are separated by an [[SUV]]. The cab falls into the river; Phil and the driver escape, but without the flash drive.  In a subway, Phil determines that Felton obtained the flash drive to blackmail Crenshaw. They return to Grant's apartment, and Grant is reluctant to help after becoming exhausted by their incompetence, but Phil begs and he agrees. Phil and Claire go to an illegal [[strip club]] that Crenshaw frequents, with Claire under the guise of a new prostitute and Phil as her [[pimp]]. After doing a pole dance for Crenshaw, they confront him and tell him they are the Tripplehorns. Collins and Armstrong come in and hold them at gunpoint and take them up to the roof with Crenshaw. Miletto arrives with henchmen and it is revealed that Crenshaw has been paid by Miletto to keep him out of jail. When Phil mentions the photos, a feud escalates between the mobsters and Crenshaw, Collins and Armstrong. Phil asks Claire to count to three (her typical method of calming their children). When she does, a helicopter appears and Arroyo and the [[SWAT team]] come onto the roof to arrest Miletto, Crenshaw, and everyone else. It is revealed that Phil was wearing a wire courtesy of Grant, who informed Arroyo of the situation.  After being declared heroes, Phil and Claire enjoy breakfast at a diner, where Phil admits he would marry Claire and have their kids all over again if given the chance. When they return home, they engage in enthusiastic kissing on their front lawn before lying on their backs and watching the sky.  
Daylight Fades
 Elizabeth, a tough, jaded young woman, and Johnny, a shy, kind-hearted young man, meet at a [[Bar (establishment)|bar]] and quickly become an inseparable couple.  Almost just as quickly, though, Elizabeth, who'd been abandoned by her father before she was born and whose [[stepfather]] is an abusive [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], becomes uncomfortable with just how much she needs Johnny.  Johnny, knowing he just wants to be with her, needs Elizabeth to commit and admit her love for him.  When she can't, they have a falling-out.  One night soon after, Johnny is in a [[car accident]].

Daylight Fades is a film that explores [[Grief|loss]], [[regret]], [[love]], [[Redemption (theology)|redemption]], [[wikt:mortality|mortality]], and the bonds that can keep us together or pull us apart.  It's a story about people who are desperate for a second chance, realizing it may be their last.  
Darling (2010 film)
 The movie starts in the late 1980s when a group of friends celebrate their farewell party. They promise each other to keep in touch. Among them are Hanumantha Rao ([[Prabhu (actor)|Prabhu]]), who has a son Prabha ([[Prabhas]]), and Vishwanath ([[Ahuti Prasad]]) who has a daughter Nandini ([[Kajal Agarwal]]). To reach their professional goals, Vishwanath and Nandini travel to Switzerland, while Hanumantha Rao becomes a criminal lawyer and settles in India. Thus, Prabha and Nandini get separated in their childhood.  Years later, these old friends call for a reunion where a grown-up Prabha is eager to see his lover Nandini, but Nisha ([[Shraddha Das]]), the daughter of a local don ([[Mukesh Rishi]]), attempts suicide when Prabha doesn't accept her love. Her father tries to kill Prabha and his friends, but Prabha gets out of trouble by faking a story about his childhood love Nandini.  During the reunion at Bhadram's ([[Chandra Mohan (Telugu actor)|Chandra Mohan]]) farmhouse, Prabha happens to see Nandini. He tries various tantrums to impress her, but in vain. His attempts are always thwarted by her brother. One day, he knowingly gives a lead about his sister's favorite game of basketball, forcing Prabha and his team to create a basketball court. As they play basketball, in comes Rishi ([[Vamsi Krishna]]), Appala Raju's ([[M. S. Narayana]]) son, who gatecrashes into the game as he is cheered by Nandini. Both Rishi and Prabha vie with each other to impress Nandini, leading to a cold war between them.  Meanwhile, Prasanna, Bhadram's daughter, confesses to Prabha that she was in love with a man and she would marry him if she could pay a dowry of 5&nbsp;million, and she forces Prabha to talk to her father into marrying off her to her boyfriend. Prabha is able to convince Bhadram about his daughter's marriage with the help of his father and his friends. Impressed by his managing skills, Nandini begins to show affection to Prabha. Jealous of Nandini's liking for Prabha, Rishi's friends try to paralyse Prabha by misconnecting the power cable of an iron box. Hanumantha Rao, unaware of their conspiracy, accidentally touches the iron box and gets an [[Electric Shock|electric shock]], leading to a scuffle between Prabha and Rishi. The fight results in Hanumantha Rao ejecting Prabha out of the house.  Later, Prabha finds out that Rishi is not Appala Raju's son, but Vishwanath's nephew. Vishwanath betrayed his father ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) by marrying his girlfriend rather than the girl chosen by his father. As a result, he is ousted by his father. Hanumantha Rao, on Viswanath's behalf, negotiates with his father for a reconciliation. After many attempts, he agrees to forgive Viswanath, but on the condition that his daughter's son should marry Nandini.  Prabha decides not to reveal his love for Nandini and makes up his mind to leave. As Prabha tries to leave, Nandini reveals that she is in love with him all along. She was playing hard to get with him, only to know how much he loves her. But to save his father's reputation, he doesn't reveal his love to her and leaves the place, leaving Nandini heartbroken. Nisha's father too realizes the truth that the story Prabha had said was a lie, and tries to kill him. Meanwhile, Nandini gets to know the truth behind Prabha's silence and injures herself on purpose as she's angry at Prabha's father. She tells Vishwanath that she loves Prabha and she wants to marry him. Feeling bad for her he agrees to her proposal. Hanumantha Rao reminds him of the condition but Viswanath says no and reminds him of their friendship for helping each other. Even Viswanath's father feels emotional about it, forgives his son and allows Nandini to marry Prabha. Outside Nandini runs to Prabha and sees him getting beat up by Nisha's father. He sends his men to kill her but Prabha manages to stop them and save Nandini. He later raises a gun at Prabha but Nandini pleads him to not shoot and shows her love for Prabha. Feeling emotional he lowers the gun and lets them go. They finally get married and live a happy life.  
Darkening Sky
 The film opens with a childhood "abduction" scene, later a memory that the main character (Eric Rainer) flashes back to. Then we encounter adult Eric in the midst of a panic attack: He stumbles outside and stares up at a "Darkening Sky", the stars gradually, impossibly blinking out. When a neighbor (Harold) interrupts and snaps him out of it, Eric cuts the conversation short and goes back inside, where his girlfriend (Lisa) announces that she is tired of his obsession with Alien Abduction—Eric is laboring on a thesis dismissing UFOs as a "modern mythology"—and she breaks up with him. This tips Eric into a removed state of mind; as he focuses on her lips moving, everything fades to silence. Next we encounter Eric returning from a late-night jog. He falls asleep on the sofa and has a nightmare of alien abduction, climaxing with a vision of a strange creature carrying Lisa away.   When Eric wakes the next day he finds Lisa missing but convinces himself everything is okay. Later, Eric meets "Beth", who introduces herself as Harold's (the neighbor's) niece, and for most of the movie, we see Eric pulled into an investigation about what happened to Lisa, encouraged by Beth, who seems driven to convince Eric that aliens are real. We also meet Dr. Connell, a woman whom Eric refers to as his "Professor", but who seems to react to his contact with alarm and concern (later, she even drops in to check up on him). While investigating with Beth, Eric encounters three people who seem to morph into strange creatures in a way that matches reports of "shape shifting" aliens. After narrowly escaping the first, Eric is "forced" to kill the next two: a UFO "expert" Beth convinces Eric to see, then Lisa's sister Cindy, who appears asking too many questions. Eventually, after becoming lovers, everything leads Eric and Beth back to "The Tower", an old, abandoned radio station on a hill outside town. Eric breaks into the Tower using a special alien "key" mysteriously delivered to him, and inside, finds two dead bodies: both people Eric himself killed. Confused and panicking, Eric then finds Harold, his strangely nosy neighbor, who confesses to following Eric and expresses concern for him, describing Eric's recent bizarre behavior and theorizing that Eric might be controlled by aliens. But when Eric notices that Beth—told to wait back at the truck—has vanished, Eric angers and knocks Harold unconscious, then tries calling Beth's cell phone. He then hears it ringing, but it is coming from inside the Tower. Fearing the worst, Eric goes back inside, follows the ringing to a spot right next to the dead bodies, pulls a tarp aside and finds Lisa's dead body, stabbed to death with a large knife next to the corpse. Flashback cuts suggest that it was Eric who did the killing, and finding Lisa's body knocks Eric into the same strange state of mind we saw earlier, with everything slowly fading away to silence as he heads back outside.   Eric kneels by the injured Harold, still gripping the knife, and Harold desperately tries to convince Eric that the aliens are controlling him, asking repeatedly "what they made him believe" to control him. But Eric remains deaf to Harold's pleas and stabs him in the heart. While Eric carves a gaping wound in Harold's abdomen, then reaches in and removes an organ, another flashing montage of images reveals that at every key point of the past few days' adventure Eric shared with "Beth", he was in truth alone. The suggestion here is that "Beth" is the thing that Eric was "made to believe". Reinforcing this idea is the very next sequence, in which Eric hands off Harold's removed organ to an unseen force, eerily reminiscent of Eric's "nightmare" on the night it all began. The movie ends with Eric returning to the truck, where he finds Beth waiting, safe and sound. After one final moment of doubt—when Beth suggests they visit "Dr. Connell", even though Eric distinctly remembers only referring to her as "my professor"—Beth gazes seductively into his eyes, and Eric surrenders completely, starts the truck and drives off to visit (and presumably kill) Dr. Connell, eliminating the last person connected to what has transpired.  
Day & Night (2010 film)
 ''Day & Night'' follows two characters, Day and Night. Inside Day is a day scene with a sun in the center, and inside Night is a night scene with a moon in the center.  Whatever goes on inside of Day or Night expresses normal events that typically occur within a day or night, respectively, and these events often correspond with actions or emotions or actions that Day or Night express. For example, when Day is happy he will have a rainbow inside him, and when Night is happy he will have fireworks inside him.  Day and Night meet and at first are uneasy about each other. They are dismissive of each other because each perceives the other as being different, and their prejudices result in a physical altercation between the two. However, as the characters discovers the many fascinating events that occur in each other, they learn to appreciate them, and learn to like one another. At the end of the film, the Sun descends in Day and rises in Night, so that when the Sun is at the same height above the horizon in each, both characters appear to be identical. As the Sun continues its course, Day becomes Night, and Night becomes Day.

Dazed in Doon
  The film is a [[coming of age]] story about a boy nicknamed "Howly"(Sookrit Malik) with an active imagination who is trying to make sense of life at [[The Doon School]], a prestigious [[independent school|public school]] located in [[Dehra Dun]] in India.  Howly's friend, nicknamed "Boozy"(Aseem Kumar), is an excellent sportsman who is about to win the most coveted award for sports at Doon: the "games blazer". Seeing his friend’s determination to win, Howly cheats on Boozy’s behalf at a high jump qualifier, giving him the points Boozy needs to win the games blazer.  Despite Howly's loyalty and hero-worship of Boozy, Boozy refuses to associate with Howly in front of others, effectively relegating Howly to the role of a [[sidekick]].  After a particularly bad [[School bullying|bullying]] episode that is witnessed by a [[Schoolmaster|School master]], Howly is encouraged to audition for a part in the theatrical version of the [[Mahabharata]].  Howly discovers a natural talent for acting, and is cast in the lead role of the god [[Krishna]].  Thereafter, the mythic world of the Mahabharata, with the philosophical and ethical choices forced upon its characters, merges with Howly's own real-life dilemmas: Boozy discovers that Howly had cheated on his behalf, and that his games blazer had been won unfairly.  Kumar attempted to demonstrate a number of positive qualities that he believed Doon instilled in its pupils: a sense of [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], ethics, friendship, loyalty, the ability to [[Morality|correct moral choices]], and to form independent judgments and decisions. The storyline of the film uses a classic text of ethics (the [[Mahabharata]]) to link the growing pains of a schoolboy with the subtleties of [[Dharma]], as outlined in classical [[Indian philosophy]], by linking these concepts to the ethical choices that the characters have to make in their day-to-day lives.

That night at a special effects warehouse, Drew Flynn sees the late Foster, who accuses him of his murder and transforms into the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]], who uses his powers to animate the models and animatronic film monsters to attack Flynn, and kills him with a gigantic gorilla robot. The Spectre confronts and kills Peter McCoy by controlling his car that repairs itself and crushes him, before taking a suitcase of money.  Arriving at Aimee's house undetected by phasing through the wall, Jim tells Aimee that she is good enough to be an actress in her father's movies. Learning that Aimee was responsible for giving the correct access code for her father's estate to Flynn and McCoy, Jim opens the briefcase with her father's money. Aimee asks Jim that they will get together while she rummages the pistol from the desk drawer, but Jim refuses. Aimee fails to attack Jim, who transforms into the Spectre and kills her by engulfing her in a tornado of money, avenging her father's death.

Dear John (2010 film)
 While serving in the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]] in 2003, [[Staff sergeant|Staff Sergeant]] John Tyree is lying on the ground in Afghanistan, after being shot multiple times with his comrades around him. In a voice-over, he recalls a childhood trip to the [[United States Mint|US Mint]] and compares himself to a coin in the United States Military before stating that the last thing he thought of before he blacked out was "you."  In 2001, John is on leave in Charleston, South Carolina. He meets Savannah Curtis, a college student building homes with a group of co-eds for Habitat for Humanity while on spring break, when he fetches her purse from the ocean. She invites him to a bonfire party where he meets her neighbor, Tim Wheddon, and his son, Alan. Over the course of two weeks, they go on several dates and fall in love. Savannah also meets John's father, who is obsessed with his coin collection.  Savannah mentions to John that his father -like Tim's son, Alan- may have a form of [[high-functioning autism]] known as Asperger's Syndrome. This upsets John, who storms off. Savannah's friend Randy, who also has a crush on her, makes a comment that provokes John to fight, and he accidentally punches Tim, breaking his nose. Savannah sees the commotion, and stops speaking to John. John later apologizes to Tim, who offers to give Savannah a message. She drives to John's house to spend one last day together.  John and Savannah continue their relationship through letters, and John visits her in her hometown to meet her family while on a future leave. As their time apart start as weeks and turn into months and years, Savannah begins to spend more time with Tim, and decides that she wants to work with autistic children; she plans to build a farm and horse stables where they can enjoy the outdoors and animals. John and Savannah makes plans to start a life together after John is discharged from the army in December 2001 - but September 11 happens, and John chooses to re-enlist. Over the next two years, the romance continues through their letters, and one turns out to be a literal "Dear John" letter, in which Savannah breaks up with John, saying that, while she still loves him, she has developed feelings for someone else - she does not reveal that the "other man" is Tim. In a fit of anger, John burns all of Savannah's letters.  John is later wounded and encouraged to return home, but he re-enlists for a second time. Four years pass, and John is informed that his father has had a stroke - instead of being deployed with the rest of his unit, John is being sent home to be with his dad. When John arrives at the hospital, he learns that his father is alive, but in grave condition. In addition to reading his father articles from coin collectors' newsletter (which Mr. Tyree has collected, along with his beloved coins, for decades), John writes a letter to his father, which he reads to him at the hospital; John's voice-over at the beginning of the film was from this letter, in which he told his father that the first thing to cross his mind after he was shot was coins, and the last thing to cross his mind before he lost consciousness was his dad. Soon afterward, his father dies.  After his father's funeral, John visits Savannah at her ranch and learns that she has married Tim, abandoning her dream of a riding camp for autistic kids because of Tim's fight against [[lymphoma]]. She talks to Tim on the phone and tells John that Tim would like to see him. She takes John to the hospital, and Tim tells John that Savannah still loves John; she loves him (Tim), too, but not in the same way she loves John - and Tim can see that. John takes her back to her house and they enjoy a quiet evening together, eating dinner, and are tempted to pick up where they left off years earlier, but do not go through with their feelings and, upset, John leaves. John sells all of his father's coin collection (except the valuable mule coin that he found with his father years ago) in order to raise money to help with Tim's cancer treatment. John returns to the military, carrying the mule coin with him as a charm/talisman. He receives a letter from Savannah telling him that Tim died after two months of treatment. John, now a civilian, eventually returns home; while riding his bike in town one day, he sees Savannah at a coffee shop, and they hug.

Aaron and Michelle have been trying to buy their own home and have children but have been unsuccessful. Aaron envies Ryan because Ryan is a successful author, while Aaron has not yet had his novel published, and resents him because Ryan would rather spend money on a first class airline ticket than help pay for the funeral expenses.  Aaron and Ryan's cousin Elaine ([[Zoe Saldana]]) and her fiance Oscar ([[James Marsden]]) are on their way to pick up Elaine's brother Jeff ([[Columbus Short]]) before heading to the funeral. To ease Oscar's nerves, she gives him a pill from a bottle labeled as [[Valium]]. Jeff later reveals to Elaine that it is a powerful [[hallucinogenic]] drug he has concocted for a friend. Chaos ensues when Oscar hallucinates that the coffin is moving. He knocks it over, and the body falls out of the coffin, shocking everyone and delaying the funeral.   Aaron is approached by an unknown guest, a [[Dwarfism|dwarf]] named Frank ([[Peter Dinklage]]), who reveals himself to be the secret lover of his late father. Frank shows Aaron photos as proof and threatens to reveal them to Aaron's mother unless he is paid $30,000. While in shock, Aaron relays the situation to Ryan, who suggests Aaron to pay the money because Ryan claims that he is in debt. When Aaron and Ryan meet with Frank to pay him, Frank starts to deride Aaron's ability as a writer and Aaron refuses to pay. Frank turns violent, but Ryan and Aaron subdue him, tying him up to prevent him from leaving. Family friend Norman ([[Tracy Morgan]]) enters the room, giving Frank several doses of what he also believes is Valium to try to calm him down. Jeff also enters the room, telling them that it is the same hallucinogen Oscar took earlier.   When Jeff and Norman, who are supposed to be guarding Frank, get distracted by Uncle Russell ([[Danny Glover]]), Frank releases himself from his bonds and is knocked unconscious upon falling over and hitting his head on a table. With Aaron, Ryan, Jeff and Norman believing that Frank has died, they plan to put him in the coffin. While everyone is outside watching Oscar, who is on the roof naked and threatening to commit suicide because he has seen Elaine's ex-boyfriend Derek ([[Luke Wilson]]) kissing her, Aaron and Ryan put Frank in the coffin. Elaine tells Oscar that Derek forcibly kissed her and calms him down by revealing she is pregnant. With everyone back inside, they continue the eulogy. While Aaron awkwardly tries to give his speech, Frank shakes the coffin from inside it, then suddenly forces it open and emerges. The pictures fall out of Frank's pocket, while Aaron and Ryan's mother Cynthia ([[Loretta Devine]]) sees the pictures and screams at Frank, attacking him. Aaron yells for everyone's attention as he delivers a moving and impromptu eulogy, saying that his father was a good man with flaws like everyone else.  Aaron and Ryan say goodbye while Ryan gets a ride to the airport from Martina, whom he had been trying to seduce all day. Aaron and Michelle are finally alone and are going to try to have a baby. Aaron asks where Uncle Russell is and Michelle tells him that she gave him what she believes is Valium to calm him down, shocking Aaron. Uncle Russell sits on the roof naked, like Oscar had been, complaining about how "everything's so fucking green."

Death and Glory in Changde
 In October 1943, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] approaches [[Changde]] from [[Shashi District|Shashi]] and [[Yueyang]] by crossing the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Xiang River|Xiang]] rivers, and surrounds the Chinese city. Yu Chengwan, a division commander in the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]], and his men have received orders to defend Changde to the death. Most of Changde's civilian population have evacuated, leaving behind Yu and his troops to defend the isolated city.  Feng Baohua, a company commander in the division, allows Erhu, a [[Miao people|Miao]] youth, to join his company. Erhu, who turns out to be an excellent [[sharpshooter]], looks up to Feng as a role model. The Chinese forces fight bravely on the frontline, holding off wave after wave of Japanese troops outside Changde until all the external defences have fallen. They retreat into the city and continue to prevent the invaders from advancing beyond the gates. By then, the defenders are already running low on ammunition and supplies but they continue to put up fierce resistance, to the point of secretly salvaging unexpended rounds from the bodies of dead soldiers at night. Feng's fiancee, a singer called Wanqing, is determined to accompany him, so she becomes a nurse and helps to attend to the wounded. Feng and Wanqing are married and they spend one night together.  Changde eventually falls when the Japanese commander Yokoyama Isamu, acting under pressure from his superiors, reluctantly approves the use of [[Chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[Biological warfare|biological]] weapons against the Chinese forces. As the defenders retreat further into the city, fierce fighting takes place in the streets and alleys. Erhu's elder sister is killed by a Japanese soldier who breaks into their house. In one skirmish, Feng is shot and mortally injured when he tries to use a bundle of explosives to kill a Japanese machine gunner in a concealed position. He succeeds in his attempt but dies in the ensuing blast. In the meantime, the Japanese have captured the Chinese medical officer and the wounded Chinese soldiers and made them line up near the city gate while handing out a Japanese flag to each of them. The Japanese attempt to record these "scenes of victory" on camera, but eventually have all the prisoners gunned down when they refuse to play along with their captors.  Yu Chengwan writes a farewell letter to his wife before donning his battlegear and joining his surviving men as they fight their way out of Changde. Off screen, it is stated that only 83 of the 8,000 defenders survived. The Chinese defeated the Japanese and retook Changde a few days later. Yu was court-martialled for abandoning his post at Changde and was sentenced to two years imprisonment, but was acquitted and released after spending four months in prison.

The Debt (2010 film)
  The year is 1997 and Rachel Singer ([[Helen Mirren]]) is honoured by her daughter Sarah ([[Romi Aboulafia]]) during a release party in [[Tel Aviv]] for Sarah's book based on the account Rachel, Stefan and David gave of the events in 1965. Concurrently, David ([[Ciarán Hinds]]) is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan ([[Tom Wilkinson]]) waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck.  The film then flashbacks and it is 1965. A young [[Mossad]] agent Rachel Singer ([[Jessica Chastain]]) on her first field assignment arrives in [[East Berlin]] to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz ([[Sam Worthington]]) and Stefan Gold ([[Marton Csokas]]). Their mission is to capture [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[war crime|war criminal]] Dieter Vogel ([[Jesper Christensen]])—infamously known as "The Surgeon of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau|Birkenau]]" for his [[Nazi human experimentation|medical experiment]]s on [[Jews]] during [[World War II]]—and bring him to [[Israel]] to face justice.  Rachel and David present themselves as an ethnic German married couple from [[Argentina]] and Rachel plants herself as a patient at Vogel's [[obstetrics and gynaecology]] clinic.  At her final doctor appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse (Vogel's wife) to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as [[paramedic]]s and make off with the unconscious Vogel in a faux ambulance. Under cover of night, the trio attempt their exfiltration at [Berlin Wollankstraße station]. As they prepare to load Vogel onto the stopped train he suddenly awakens and sounds the horn of the stolen mail van where he is being held, alerting [East German guards] to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to save the compromised Rachel. The agents are left with no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction.  The agents take turns monitoring and feeding Vogel while leaving him chained to the wall heater. During his shift, David becomes violently enraged after Vogel explains his beliefs that Jews have many weaknesses, such as selfishness, making them easily subdued. David smashes a glass plate over Vogel's head and repeatedly beats him, only to be stopped and restrained by Stefan. Later on, Stefan and David go out, leaving Rachel home to monitor Vogel by herself. After managing to cut through his bonds using a shard of the broken plate, Vogel ambushes Rachel with the shard, leaving her with a permanent scar on her face and escapes.   Panicking and hoping to save face for both himself and for Israel, Stefan convinces Rachel and David to go along with the fiction that Vogel was killed. They agree to lie and use the cover story that Rachel shot and killed Vogel as he attempted to flee.  In the following years, the agents become venerated as national heroes for their roles in the mission.   At a dinner after their daughter's book release party, Stefan takes Rachel aside to set a meeting to discuss new information he has obtained. Later, at David's flat, Stefan provides evidence that Vogel now resides at an insane asylum in [[Ukraine]], and is soon scheduled to be interviewed by a local journalist.  David had been investigating the man at Stefan's request and, according to Stefan, killed himself out of fear that the lie would be exposed. Rachel refutes Stefan's explanation, recalling an encounter with David a day before his suicide, in which he revealed his shame about the lie and disclosed that he had spent years unsuccessfully searching the world for Vogel. He was further disheartened by Rachel’s admission that she would continue propagating the lie to protect those closest to her, particularly her daughter.  Nevertheless, at the direction of the modern day Mossad, Rachel finally feels compelled to travel to [[Kiev]] to correct the mistake made by the trio. She investigates the journalist's lead and is able to identify and travel to the asylum. She reaches the room just minutes before the journalist and discovers the man claiming to be Vogel is an ill old man not Vogel . Describing the encounter to Stefan over the phone, Rachel declares she will not continue to lie about the 1965 mission. She leaves a note for the journalist and prepares to leave, but suddenly spots the real Vogel (in his 80s by now) among the other patients and follows him to an isolated area of the hospital.  After a confrontation in which Vogel stabs her twice with scissors, Rachel kills Vogel by plunging a poisoned [[syringe]] into his back. Later Rachel's note is discovered and read by the journalist. It describes the truth of the mission, ready to be relayed to the world.

He's arrived because Caitlin called and told him about an oddity toy she found within the castle that's able to move. The castle's current owners seldom come there, meaning they're superstitious of everything that's happened in there. The owners decided to empty and sell it to Italian government to make it a historical landmark and keep it open for the public. Caitlin takes them inside the castle and gives them its history. The doll itself was hand carved out of wood with a mixture of fabric elements. Caitlin opens the box and shows them the doll Divoletto. Mr. Butterfield examines the toy and claims it is the oldest toy he's ever seen, made possibly in the 14th century. Caitlin then shows them how it moves. Just tap a wand on the side of the box a couple of times and then it will come to life. After a while, the toy finally moves. Caitlin believes that there are magnets in the wand and when the box is tapped, it sets off the springs and mechanisms inside of Divoletto. However, Lillith thinks differently. Eric suddenly runs in the room and tells them that their cars are gone.

Despicable Me
 Gru, a [[supervillain]], is disheartened when an unknown supervillain steals the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]]. Gru, with the assistance of his colleague Dr. Nefario and his [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]], resolves to one-up this mystery rival by shrinking and stealing the [[Moon]]. As it would be costly to steal the moon, Gru seeks a loan from the Bank of Evil. Bank president Mr. Perkins is impressed by the plan but will provide the money only if Gru can obtain the necessary [[shrink ray]] first. Upon learning that an up-and-coming villain named Vector was responsible for the pyramid theft, Gru starts a rivalry with him.  Gru and the Minions steal the shrink ray from a secret base in East Asia, but Vector intercepts them and steals it for himself. Gru attempts to break into Vector's fortress to recover the shrink ray but is defeated by numerous [[booby trap]]s. However, he notices three orphan girls, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, who are able to easily walk into the base because they are selling cookies. Gru disguises himself and adopts the girls, planning on using them to infiltrate Vector's base so he can get the shrink ray back. However, Gru has trouble nurturing them properly due to their rambunctiousness, their ballet classes, and his own ineptitude as a parent.  Eventually, Gru and the girls arrive at Vector's fortress, and Gru steals the shrink ray. The girls then suggest a day at a theme park; Gru agrees, believing he can abandon the girls there, but instead he warms up to them. Later, Gru contacts Perkins via video chat, stating that he finally has the shrink ray. Margo, Edith, and Agnes interrupt the meeting, and Perkins announces that he has lost confidence in Gru and will no longer fund his operations. As Gru tells the Minions he can no longer pay them for their services, the girls offer the contents of their piggy bank. Gru, inspired, sells parts of his lair to construct a spacecraft. Gru plans to steal the Moon when it is nearest the Earth, but this is the same day as the girls' ballet recital. Gru becomes conflicted, and Dr. Nefario, seeing the recital as interfering with the plan, arranges for the girls to be returned to the orphanage. At the same time, Perkins informs Vector, revealed to be Perkins' son, of Gru's possession of the shrink ray and the adoption of the three girls, encouraging Vector to act.  Gru successfully shrinks and steals the Moon, and rushes back to Earth to attend the recital—only to find a ransom note from Vector, who has kidnapped the girls. After arriving at Vector's headquarters, Gru surrenders the Moon, but Vector reneges on the deal, flying off with the girls and the Moon. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefario has discovered that the effects of the shrink ray are temporary; the bigger the object's original size, the faster the shrinkage will wear off. As the Moon starts to expand in Vector's ship, Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions execute a daring mid-air rescue of the girls just as the Moon explodes out of Vector's ship and launches itself back into orbit, with Vector trapped on it.  Sometime later, Gru has returned the Great Pyramid and re-adopted the girls, writing them a bedtime storybook framed around his own experience. The film ends with the girls performing their own ballet recital for Gru, his mother Marlena, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions.

She has a Buddha figure built overlooking her palace in [[Luoyang]], but an official inspecting the progress mysteriously erupts into flames. Penal officer Pei Donglai and his superior investigate and interrogate the supervising builder, Shatuo, who was formerly imprisoned after he took part in a rebellion. They find nothing and Pei's superior dies soon after erupting into flames.  The Empress orders former detective and rebel [[Di Renjie]] be released from prison after the Imperial Abbot states that he must solve the mystery of the fire. She sends her attendant [[Shangguan Wan'er|Shangguan Jing'er]] to fetch Di from prison, where they are attacked by assassins. Wu reinstates Di as the royal detective and assigns Jing'er to be both an assistant and spy. Jing'er attempts to seduce Di, but is interrupted by assassins. Di meets Prince Li, who fails to recruit him into leading a rebel army. When Pei takes Di and Jing'er to inspect the charred corpses, Di deduces the assassins use a poison that ignites upon contact with sunlight.  Pei joins Di in his investigation. Di reunites with his friend Shatuo, who suspects the poison to be the venom of "fire beetles". He points Di to Donkey Wang, who is hiding in a network of caverns called the Phantom Bazaar. Pei orders Shatuo arrested for not telling him of this before, but Di stops him. At the Phantom Bazaar, Di, Pei, and Jing'er are attacked by a figure who seems to be the Imperial Abbot. After Jing'er and Pei fight him, Pei pursues him to the Abbot's forbidden residence. Donkey Wang reveals that he was the court physician and tried to use fire beetles as medicine. Finding their true danger, he disguised his appearance using [[Acupuncture|acupoints]] and fled.  Prince Li returns Di's mace to him, which was taken after he was imprisoned. Di maintains his political neutrality, and Li is assassinated soon after. Di suspects the Abbot's involvement, but Wu warns him that he will be killed if attempts to enter the monastery. Pei finds the first inspector discovered something in his inspection and takes the diagrams, but he is taken captive. At the monastery, Di learns that the Imperial Abbot is Jing'er disguised using acupoints. Di speculates that the Empress used the Imperial Abbot to justify her tyranny. Jing'er attacks Di but is unable to kill him. She stumbles into several traps set by the assassins and is mortally wounded. Di fulfills her final request by sending her back to court, and she dies in the Empress's arms.  Di finds Pei but is unable to save him. He directs Di to the diagrams, which implicate Shatuo, whom he confronts at the Buddha. Shatuo plans to kill the Empress by collapsing the Buddha upon the palace as revenge. He killed the officials after they noticed his changes to the Buddha and killed Prince Li for insulting him. He took the late Prince Li's army to invade and kill Wu if she survives. As Di and Shatuo fight, Di is drenched in poison. Di is able to divert the statue, and Shatuo heads to the coronation to poison Wu. Di catches up with Shatuo and spills it on him instead, causing him to burn to death in the sun.  Di saves Wu from the collapsing statue and warns her of Prince Li's rebel army. The Empress promises to be a just ruler and to return power to the Tang Dynasty when her reign ends. Refusing Wu's offer of a place in her court, Di resigns as inspector and retreats into the Phantom Bazaar, where he will struggle to live on with Donkey Wang and the incurable poison.

Meanwhile, a waitress enters the smoking room where an ampoule with the logo of the Red Siamese Cats is seen under the sofa. Conan reminisces to Doctor Agasa about the time Ran thought an airship was a Unidentified flying object and asks him to keep it a secret. A waiter overhears Conan in the shadows.  Conan's group is given a tour of the airship; Ran diverges from the group to get a better look at Lady Sky. She meets a waiter wearing a bandage similar to the one she gave to a maintenance personnel and grabs his arm deducing he is Kid in disguise. She then subdues him and threatens to hand him over to [[Ginzo Nakamori (Magic Kaito)|Ginzo Nakamori]]. Kid removes the mask and pretends to be Shinichi Kudo and convinces her by telling her she thought the airship was a UFO once. Meanwhile, the waitress begins to develop a rash on the back of her arms. Jirokichi receives a phone call who tells him the bacteria in the smoking room before hanging up. Nakamori confirms through the ampoule that it is the work of the Red Siamese Cats. Fujioka begins to develop a rash over his whole body and approaches the group whilst in pain before being knocked out by Ran. The waitress with the rash is found unconscious by a short-haired waitress; Fujioka and the unconscious waitress are quarantined in a separate room. Conan leaves to search for The Junior Detective League who are exploring the ship.  Conan finds them in the attic of the airship. There, they witness an unknown culprit unlock the roof allowing the Red Siamese Cats to enter and hijack the ship.

Ran remembers that Fujioka grabbed her arms and is relieved to find no rash has developed. Nishitani laments that the Detective Boys are missing; the Red Siamese Cats overhear this and bring Conan and the Detective Boys to the lobby. Ai informs Conan through the Detective Badge that the Red Siamese Cats are after him but is slapped by the short-haired waitress who is revealed to be part of the Red Siamese Cats.  Conan is thrown out the window by their leader and Kid manages to save him. Meanwhile, Heizo Hattori attempts to deduce the Red Siamese Cats goals, and confirming that if their goal is to get revenge on the Jirokichi, they would crash the airship into the Suzuki company building, the Bell Tree Tower and consequently release the bacteria in the airship to the outside world. Conan informs Heiji about the situation. Conan then calls Inspector Juzo Megure as Shinichi in order to use a police helicopter which he and Kid use to re-board the airship. Conan finds two of the four re-armed bombs in the attic of the airship and grows suspicious as there is no bomb behind the smoking room which would have released the bacteria. Heiji calls Conan telling him the Red Siamese Cats have posted on the internet about the airship causing mass panic to the cities in the airship's path. As the ship approaches Nara, Kid informs Conan that the ship is emitting smoke. Conan realizes the Red Siamese Cats' true motive and sends Heiji to Nara.  Ran begins to develop a rash from where Fujioka touched her and is quarantined in the smoking room. Conan becomes suspicious of the bacteria as it was only supposed to spread by droplet contact and not physical contact. Conan notices the black fingernails from Ran's escort and realizes what the true nature of the infection is. Conan lures the Red Siamese Cats to the attic of the airship and incapacitates them one by one. Heiji, meanwhile, confronts four policemen at [[Kōfuku-ji]] revealing they are part of the Red Siamese Cats and used the airship to evacuate the city in order to steal the priceless [[buddharupa]]s. The four fake policemen are then arrested by the Nara police. Conan enters the smoking room where Ran is quarantined and reveals that the Red Siamese Cats never released a bacterium. He explains the smoking room was sprayed with an irritating [[lacquer]] which causes a rash when it contacts the skin. Conan then realizes that Fujioka was feigning the symptoms of the bacteria and is the mastermind behind the heist.  The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department discuss the identities of the Red Siamese Cats. It is revealed they are all foreign mercenaries hired by Fujioka and are only using the terrorist name Red Siamese Cats as a cover up. Conan confronts Fujioka who explains that they targeted the statues since stolen money is easily tracked with modern technology. He then reveals that Nishitani and Ishimoto are his comrades and that the two remaining bombs are placed in the lobby where the group is held and will be detonated when he and his comrades escape the airship. The group in the cabin are tied to the railings by the two culprits who take Lady Sky as their prize. As Fujioka prepares to kill Conan, the airship passes under a bridge and Conan latches his belt to the airship and inflates the soccer ball, jamming it between the bridge and airship causing the airship to tilt vertically. Fujioka falls into the ocean below and the two culprits in the lobby are knocked unconscious.  Kid enters the lobby and unties Ran from the railing and leaves with Lady Sky. As he examines the jewel in the moonlight, Ran, believing Kid to be Shinichi, asks him to turn himself in to the police. Kid tells her he will comply if she kisses him. As the two approach for a kiss, Ran stops and tells him he is not Shinichi. Conan enters the room and angrily runs towards Kid. Kid places Lady Sky on Ran's finger and leaves through the ceiling. Conan asks what Kid did to her, to which she remarks something Shinichi never does and thinks about how he tried to touch her rear.  
Devil (2010 film)
 Ramirez ([[Jacob Vargas]]) speaks in a voice-over about stories that his mother told him about the [[devil]] sometimes actively seeking out individuals who have sinned while they are still alive on Earth. While taking human form, he traps them in a confined place only to turn them against each other, before killing them one at a time. Ramirez explains that the last victim will die in front of his or her loved one to "make cynics of us all". He says that the signs are set in motion with a suicide, as that is when the Devil first makes his presence known. This story is abruptly interrupted by a violent suicide of a man who had fallen from the thirty-fifth floor of a Philadelphia office building. The truck he falls on rolls silently away.  Detective Bowden ([[Chris Messina]]) is a recovering alcoholic who is assigned to the case of the suicide. He later explains that the reason for his alcoholism was the [[hit and run]] death of his wife and son, five years previously, in which the perpetrator was never apprehended. Meanwhile, five strangers board an elevator, which later becomes stuck between floors. When security finds them, they notice that there is [[CCTV]] and a radio with which they can call into the elevator, but they have no way of hearing the passengers in return. Bowden takes the investigation regarding the elevator as it is the same building from which the suicide victim jumped.  Ramirez is revealed to be one of the security guards and is disturbed by an image of what looks like a screaming face frozen on the video monitor. His boss Lustig ([[Matt Craven]]) dismisses the superstitious suspicions and sends repair technician Dwight (Joe Cobden) to investigate the elevators while Bowden tries to ascertain the identities of the individuals. Only four of the five are accounted for: Vince McCormick ([[Geoffrey Arend]]), a sleazy mattress salesman; Sarah Caraway ([[Bojana Novakovic]]), a pathological liar who plans to leave her rich husband and take his money with her; Ben Larson ([[Bokeem Woodbine]]), a temporary security guard with a history of violence; an unnamed older woman who police mistakenly believe is named Jane Kowski ([[Jenny O'Hara]]) who is seen on video to be a thief, and another man who later introduces himself as Tony ([[Logan Marshall-Green]]), who does not appear to have signed in at the security desk.  The power goes on and off in the elevator, and each time the power is restored, something evil takes place. Dwight falls to his death on top of the elevator, and Lustig is electrocuted trying to restore power. Soon people in the elevator start dying, and the suspicion keeps shifting between all in the elevator. Vince is thrown into a mirror only to have his [[jugular vein]] sliced causing him to bleed to death, the old woman is hanged on a lamp cord from the elevator ceiling, Ben winds up on the floor with his neck twisted, and Sarah's throat is slit by a broken piece of the mirror. Finally, the old woman seemingly returns to life, but with red, staring eyes; it is revealed that she is [[Satan|the Devil]], and that she has come for Tony and Sarah. In order to save Sarah, Tony confesses to having been responsible for a hit-and-run five years ago in which he killed a mother and her son. Detective Bowden hears him apologize over the radio. The Devil, powerless now that Tony has repented for his sin, curses before vanishing, and the elevator comes back online, sparing Tony's life.   As the corpses of Sarah, Ben, and Vince are wheeled away, Bowden decides to take Tony into custody, and, while en route, informs him that he is the husband and father of the mother and son Tony killed in that accident. But despite saying he'd gone over what he'd say, or what he would do if they'd ever cross paths, he forgives Tony.  Ramirez, again in a voice-over, says that his mother always reassured him at the end of her stories, "If the Devil is real, then God must be real too."

The Cajun meets with Victoria and they both go on a boat and down the river.  They hear a woman – Kimberly Taft – asking for help, and they help her in the jeep while Dinocroc chases after them. Cassidy and her father attempt to shoot at Supergator. Cassidy's father, Charlie, shoots Supergator's eye, presumably blinding it, and is devoured.  As Supergator eats Charlie, Cassidy gets in the car and drives off. Supergator then chases her all the way to the mill. As Supergator reaches the end of the tunnel, Bob and Paul blow it up with C-4 explosives so Supergator and Dinocroc cannot escape. The two reptiles engage in battle, which Dinocroc wins after knocking Supergator on its soft underbelly and attacking it.  Paul then throws a bomb for the explosion. After Dinocroc kills Supergator, it spots Paul and walks towards him, as Paul hides in a trough filled with water, protecting himself from the explosives. The bomb explodes, knocking back and killing Dinocroc. Paul is assumed to be killed as well, but he survives the attack. Before Paul and Cassidy leave, the camera then turns to Dinocroc and Supergator, both dead. As Bob, Paul and Cassidy walk away, it shows that in the mill are babies, of either Dinocroc or Supergator – possibly both.

The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya
  Following on from the events of ''[[List of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya episodes|The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'' anime series, the story takes place from December 18 until December 24, a month after the [[Japanese Cultural Festival|cultural festival]]. The SOS Brigade, led by [[Haruhi Suzumiya (character)|Haruhi Suzumiya]] ([[Aya Hirano]]), makes plans to have a [[nabemono|nabe]] party for Christmas. However, on the morning of December 18, [[Kyon]] ([[Tomokazu Sugita]]) arrives at school and finds that the very nature of his reality has changed; Haruhi and [[Itsuki Koizumi]] ([[Daisuke Ono]]) are missing, [[Ryoko Asakura]] ([[Natsuko Kuwatani]]) has mysteriously returned, [[Mikuru Asahina]] ([[Yūko Gotō]]) does not recognize him and [[Yuki Nagato]] ([[Minori Chihara]]) is an ordinary human. Only Kyon is aware that everything is different and no one else remembers anything about Haruhi or the SOS Brigade. The only clue Kyon manages to find is a bookmark left by the alien version of Yuki before everything was changed, telling him to gather "keys" to run a program. While wondering about this clue, he gets to know the new Yuki, who appears to be quite fond of him. As December 20 comes, Kyon learns from [[List of Haruhi Suzumiya characters#Taniguchi|Taniguchi]] ([[Minoru Shiraishi]]) that Haruhi was at another high school the whole time, along with Itsuki and others formerly from his school. By revealing his identity to her as 'John Smith', an alias he had used when he travelled back in time to assist a young Haruhi, Kyon manages to convince Haruhi to believe his story. With her assistance they gather the SOS Brigade together in the club room, thus bringing the keys necessary for a program built by alien Yuki.  Wanting to go back to his interesting life, Kyon activates the program and goes back in time to the [[Tanabata]] of three years ago. After meeting up with the future Mikuru, he obtains an uninstall program from the past's Yuki, which needs to be shot at the culprit right after the change in the early hours of December 18. Returning to the present, they find the culprit, Yuki, who had borrowed Haruhi's power to change everyone's memories except Kyon's, giving him the choice of which world he would rather live in. Kyon questions himself about his choice and thinks to himself that a normal world without the SOS Brigade and Haruhi Suzumiya would be calm and peaceful and thinks Yuki was tired of everything she had to do like monitoring Haruhi's behavior and protecting Kyon, but finally decides that his original world was more interesting and fun. Kyon tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who had retained her psychotic behavior. Before Ryoko can finish him off, he is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself. He wakes up a few days later in a hospital, where the world is back to normal, but almost everyone believes Kyon had been in a coma since December 18 after falling down the stairs. When Yuki mentions to Kyon how the Data Integration Thought Entity would punish her for her actions, Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so the organization would cease to exist. As December 24 comes and his everyday life returns, Kyon decides there is still time before he has to go back in time to save himself and decides to join in on the Christmas party.

Don't Be Afraid of the Dark (2010 film)
 Flashback: At Blackwood Manor in [[Providence County, Rhode Island]], renowned wildlife painter Lord Blackwood summons his housekeeper to the basement where he reluctantly bludgeons her to death with a hammer and chisel. He removes her teeth, as well as his own, and offers them to mysterious creatures down an ash pit within an old fireplace; all of a sudden, the creatures demand the teeth of children. Blackwood begs for them to give back his kidnapped son, only to be dragged down the ash pit by the creatures.  Present day: 8-year old Sally Hurst arrives in Rhode Island to live with her father Alex and his girlfriend Kim, both restoring Blackwood Manor to put it on the market for their client Mr. Jacoby. Sally is depressed due to her mother forcefully putting her in Alex's care and giving her copious amounts of [[Adderall]]. On the first night of her stay, the melodious tune from a carousel-styled nightlight awakens the creatures in the ash pit. The next day, Sally wanders the grounds and finds the hidden basement's skylight. One of the workmen restoring the house, Mr. Harris, warns her, Alex and Kim not to venture into the basement, although they do so, regardless. Sally takes interest in the sealed fireplace where she hears the creatures calling her name and follows the mysterious voices. "BE AFRAID" is written in [[runes]] above it.  Sally opens the fireplace to meet the creatures and finds one of the old housekeeper's teeth. The creatures quickly prove to be hostile, stealing Alex's razor and shredding Kim's clothes. Alex blames Sally and finds a 19th-century silver coin in her possession, which she found under her pillow after the tooth disappeared. Alex and Kim head into town on a business trip and Sally sneaks to the basement to talk with the creatures, but Harris sends her away and tries to seal the fireplace. The creatures emerge and brutally wound him with his own tools and he is hospitalized. Sally's increasingly frightening encounters with the creatures prompt Alex to call a therapist to talk to Sally, who draws a sketch of one of the creatures that attacked her under her bedsheets.  Kim visits Harris in the hospital, who tells her to find the unpublished artwork of Lord Blackwood in the local library. The librarian reveals the artwork, one of which is of a creature whom he describes as being like [[tooth fairy|tooth fairies]], which every now and again turn a human into one of their own. Kim races home as Sally is attacked again by the creatures while having a bath, the lead creature being a transformed Lord Blackwood who proclaims the creatures will make Sally one of their own. Kim finds an undiscovered mural painted by Lord Blackwood in the basement, depicting his son being taken below ground by the creatures. Kim confronts Alex who is more interested in hosting a dinner for Mr. Jacoby and friends. However, he finally realizes what is happening when Sally is trapped in the library by the creatures, but she fends them off by using her camera flash to distract them.  Alex and Kim decide to flee the house with Sally, but both are ambushed by the creatures and knocked out. Sally tries to wake Kim up but also gets ambushed by the creatures and is knocked unconscious. When Sally wakes up, her feet have been tied up with rope, and the creatures are starting to drag her to the basement for her transformation. Kim awakens and goes to the basement to confront the creatures, cutting the rope around Sally's feet but only to get caught herself in the ropes and her leg broken as she struggles to get free. The creatures drag Kim into the fireplace, as a distraught Sally crushes the creature who used to be Lord Blackwood to death with a large flashlight. Alex arrives just as Kim disappears, and the father and daughter mourn their loss.  Some time later, both return to the abandoned mansion to leave a drawing of Kim there. After they leave, a strong draft pulls the drawing into the creatures' lair; the entrance is now bolted with metal. The heroic, caring Kim, who saved Sally, has been transformed. She is heard convincing the creatures to stay in hiding because they "have all the time in the world", and people will forget in time, and others will come to the manor.

Do You Really Want to Know?
 The main subjects of the film are [[Jeff Carroll]], a US Army Veteran and [[Huntington's disease]] researcher from Washington; Dr. [[John Roder]], a renowned cancer specialist at the [[Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto]]; Theresa Monahan of Ohio, who was among the first Americans to undergo [[predictive testing]] for Huntington's disease in 1988, and Dr. [[Michael R. Hayden]], who is the director of the [[Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], and the world's most-cited researcher with regard to Huntington's disease.<ref></ref>  Jeff Carroll's story involves learning about his family's genetic history after he was already married and considering having children. He underwent testing at Dr. Michael Hayden's [[Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics]] and learned that he had inherited the genetic abnormality that will cause him to develop Huntington's disease later in life. Subsequent to his diagnosis, he joined Dr. Hayden's research team and obtained a Ph.D for his research on Huntington's disease. Meanwhile, he and his wife had decided that it would be unethical to conceive children who might inherit the disease from him, so they used [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] to ensure their children were born free of the genetic abnormality. He is now an advocate and frequent public speaker on Huntington's disease<ref></ref> and encourages all at-risk individuals to be tested and to participate in clinical trials so that research into treatment can progress as quickly as possible.  Dr. John Roder and his wife Mary-Lou were already parents when Dr. Roder underwent testing for Huntington's disease in the 1990s and learned that he carried the gene for Huntington's. Roughly ten years later, in his 50s, Dr. Roder began showing symptoms of the disease, including severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and Huntington's [[chorea]], a muscle control and movement disorder typical of the disease. Despite his decline in health, he continued working with the goal of retiring at age 65 as someone with normal health would. When the Roders' two adult children underwent testing, they were both negative for the Huntington's gene, though it was earlier discovered that son Nathan had [[schizophrenia]]. Subsequent to his and Nathan's diagnoses, Dr. Roder changed the focus of his research from cancer and metabolism to schizophrenia and brain diseases.<ref></ref>  Theresa Monahan is from a large family with a history of Huntington's disease. Her mother and eldest brother died of the disease, but her surviving siblings, like most people at risk for Huntington's, have declined to be tested<ref></ref>  over concern that a positive diagnosis could ruin their quality of life long before symptoms affected their health. Without telling her family, Theresa proceeded with testing as part of a landmark study at the Indiana University in 1988, but declined to read her results until her daughter got married and she became concerned about the possibility of passing the disease down to her potential grandchildren. Her results showed she was negative for the HD gene, meaning she would not get the disease. As is typical of people of at-risk people who test negative for HD, she reports feeling some [[survivor guilt]] over her results.<ref></ref>  
Doraemon: Nobita's Great Battle of the Mermaid King
 The film opens with a sunken ship, in which a shark is swimming; an octopus lands on its head next to a mermaid. The Merman tribe destroys another planet while looking for the Mermaid tribe.  Nobita's mother tells him to go shopping, but he plays with Gian instead. His mother asks Doraemon and her husband, but they decline. Doraemon does the shopping; on the list he sees Dorayaki, a snack which is his favourite food. Suneo shows his diving photos in Palau to Gian and Shizuka. Nobita wants to go to Suneo's house to see more pictures, but he is unwelcome and Doraemon comforts him. When Nobita wants to dive, Doraemon uses an underwater pump simulator (架空水面シミュレーター・ポンプ) to pump the water out of Tokyo, causing the city to submerge. That night, Doraemon and Nobita use a diving mask simulator to dive underwater.  Nobita sees a fish tail, and tells Doraemon he saw a mermaid. They take pictures, and hear a scream. The shadows of a mermaid and a shark appear. Nobita's father tells police he saw a shark swim past the cigarette store. Nobita and Doraemon ask how he could see it without his goggles, and see that the fish are still there but the water is gone. A boy, Dekisugi, looks through his telescope and sees a mermaid and a shark. Nobita looks for the shark, who is behind him. Doraemon throws a frog into the shark's mouth. The shark and other fish return to the ocean, and the mermaid falls onto a tree branch.  Nobita notices a fish tail beneath the leaves, and Doraemon finds a girl. In Nobita's room, she drinks juice and begins speaking in an unknown language; Doraemon serves his translation jelly. After thinking Doraemon is a puffer fish, she introduces herself as Sophia. Suneo says he saw a shark, and Gian explains that sharks live in the ocean. Nobita arrives with Doraemon and Sophia, and Gian and Suneo find her attractive. A car nearly hits Sophia, but Doraemon grabs her. She starts to fly high in the sky, but the sun makes her faint and dry. Doraemon puts out his anywhere door, and they go to Shizuka's bathroom. Sophia takes a bath, and Shizuka sees a tiara. Sophia allows her to put it on, after explaining that it is the royal mermaid symbol. Nobita asks Doraemon if mermaids exist, explaining that when he met Sophia she had a mermaid tail instead of legs.  Doraemon's sister, Dorami, comes through a circle and asks Nobita to draw a mermaid; his drawing makes everyone laugh. Dorami explains apparitions, legends and animals mistaken for mermaids. Shizuka tells Sophia she will wash her clothes, but Sophia tells her not to. In Dorami's bedroom, a scream is heard. When they get to the bathroom, Shizuka is a mermaid and Sophia is underwater. Doraemon copies Sophia's clothes and uses his familiar light to help them breathe underwater (where they become mermaids), using his watertight rope to keep water away. Sophia says that Doraemon has powers like the goddess Manatia, and they ask if the mermaid sword exists.  Doraemon uses his mystery ink and scroll, which says that five stars will form a pentagon. The next day, they dive to Sophia's palace. Nobita is tired, and sinks. A giant eel appears behind them; they hide in a cave until they are rescued by a puffer fish and Sophia's soldiers, who accuse Doraemon, Nobita, Gian and Suneo of kidnapping Sophia. They arrive at the home of the mermaid tribe and are put in a fish tank, expecting to be eaten by a Megaladon. Sophia tells the puffer fish to stop the punishment. They are released, and a soldier told Sophia she has been summoned by Queen Undine (queen of the mermaid tribe and Sophia's grandmother). When they arrive at the palace, Queen Undine tells Sophia that she will be queen.  Meanwhile, Nobita realizes that they left Shizuka behind. Gian and Suneo go back to try to find her. However, they can not find her and they theorize that she has been captured by the Merman tribe.  Soon, the King of the Merman tribe arrives and demands the mermaid sword in exchange for Shizuka, who was mistaken to be the mermaid princess because she was wearing the royal tiara. Doraemon creates a fake with Nobita's toy inflated sword and gives it to the mermen. They get Shizuka in return. Once the King of the Merman realize that the sword is not genuine, his troops begin to attack the mermaid castle. Sophia prays to the mermaid god, who reveals the location of the mermaid sword. However, the merman king steals the sword and uses it to wreak havoc by creating an underwater tornado. Doraemon lands in the watertight ring that they were using the day before. After he locates everybody else, he uses a surfing board to spray the merman king with a special gas, allowing him to see the simulated water.  Doraemon then lures the merman king onto an island, where it is revealed that the mermaid sword can not control the simulated water and therefore can not damage them. The merman king challenges Sophia to a duel, in which he breaks her sword. Doraemon uses the Sword Round Lightning to defeat the merman king in a duel. Once Sophia gets the mermaid sword, she uses it to purify the ocean, telling Doraemon that is the true power of the mermaid sword.  Afterwards, Doraemon, Nobita, Gian, Suneo and Shizuka return home.

The Jew Producer reluctantly agrees to help, and he and I.S.R.A.E.L. take off in pursuit of the housemates once again. Clara, Hero, Molly (a corpse Hero believes to be his girlfriend), Xandir, and Ling-Ling arrive at Clara's kingdom, expecting to find refuge. However, nobody there seems to recognize Clara. She encounters the king of the land, who is not her father, and even more shockingly, she sees a woman who appears to be the "real" princess. The guards end up dismembering and eventually killing Clara, but the other three manage to escape.  Meanwhile, Foxxy, Spanky, and Wooldoor visit the set of ''The Suck My Taint Show'' and meet the Suck My Taint Girl, who reveals herself to be a fan of the housemates' show. She tells the group that they were cancelled because vulgar and offensive content is only acceptable when your show "makes a point", and that if they want to get ''Drawn Together'' back on the air, they will need to get a point, which they can do by making a visit to Make-A-Point Land. She tells Foxxy that if she will bring the rest of the ''Drawn Together'' gang to meet her, she will take them to Make-A-Point Land. After tracking down the others, the remaining group return to the set of ''The Suck My Taint Show''. The Suck My Taint Girl agrees to take the rest of the group to Make-A-Point Land so they can get a point.  The wizard of Make-A-Point Land agrees to give the group a point, and presents them with a box containing said point. Spanky protests by claiming that they should not open the box; that he is happier being disgusting for no reason. Some others agree with Spanky. Wooldoor disagrees, determined to get back on the air. He opens the box to find out it contains an eraser bomb which erases him from existence. The wizard explains he was forced to give them the box with an eraser bomb. It is then that the Network Head, the Jew Producer, and I.S.R.A.E.L. show up to erase the remaining cast. Foxxy asks how they knew they were going to the palace, and the Suck My Taint Girl reveals that she blackmailed them and is the Network Head's wife.  I.S.R.A.E.L. prepares to kill the housemates, but the Jew Producer manages to convince I.S.R.A.E.L. that they have a right to exist as she does. She then impales the Network Head on a spike. The Network Head then opens his coat to reveal that he had enough explosive erasers strapped to his waist to destroy all of Make-A-Point Land. As the Network Head drops the remote to explode Make-A-Point Land, the Suck My Taint Girl tries to grab it, but the Jew Producer dives on top of her to stop her. The housemates then make a getaway. The Jew Producer and the Suck My Taint Girl struggle for possession of the detonator, in the process dropping it, erasing all of Make-A-Point Land, including themselves. The housemates make it out just in time with the help of The Giant Who Shits Into His Own Mouth, an aptly-named guard of the palace that saved the housemates after using Clara's arms to prevent him from defecating into his mouth earlier.  The housemates visit the remains of the erased ''Drawn Together'' house. The Jew Producer's son shows up to inform them that he might be able to help them by giving them a direct-to-DVD movie. I.S.R.A.E.L. arrives at the scene and she and the giant become smitten with each other. Everyone happily laughs until Spanky accidentally steps on an eraser bomb caught in the ground, erasing them all from existence.

Dream Home
 In Hong Kong, Cheng Lai-sheung ([[Josie Ho]]) works two jobs with the hope of earning enough money to buy her own apartment with a view of the [[Victoria Harbour]].<ref name="variety"></ref><ref name="fba-review" /> In mixed chronological order, we see scenes from Lai-sheung's past. In her childhood, her family and friends are evicted from their low-rent housing so that developers can build expensive flats. Later in life, she vows to buy her mother and father a new apartment, but is unable to fulfill her promise before her mother dies. When her father becomes ill, she begins searching in earnest for a new place, having an obsession for the ''Victoria Bay No. 1'' high-rise address from a childhood vow that she would one day buy a flat near the harbour so that her uncle would not have to walk there and back on a daily basis and not needing to search for him every evening.  The bank will only give her a 70% mortgage and payments would reach over $15,000. Unfortunately, because of an oversight in declaring her father's medical history, she no longer has insurance to pay for his expensive treatment and has to take a second job. After Lai-sheung does save enough for a down-payment, her father's medical bills become excessive. When she asks her married lover for a loan to cover these, he refuses. One night her father has trouble breathing and, instead of giving him his oxygen, Lai-sheung allows him to die. The insurance payment now adds enough money to her current savings to purchase her dream flat.  On her way to finalize the purchase, there is a hike in the stock market that makes the owners decide to raise the price. This sends Lai-sheung into a frenzy where she goes to the flats and attacks people who live and work there, killing them with low-tech, household items. During the course of the final killings, the police arrive at the flat, demanding entry. A struggle ensues during which both officers are killed.  Returning to her day job, Lai-sheung receives a call from her agent saying the owners of the flat she wishes to buy are willing to sell after all. Lai-sheung suggests that they might want to sell for a lower price, since there were 11 murders in the building the previous evening. That night, Lai-sheung's lover comes round to pick her up, but she turns her back on him and walks away, ending their relationship. The film concludes with Lai-sheung staring out at the harbour as newscasts discuss how America's worsening [[subprime mortgage crisis]] is beginning to have global repercussions.

The Duel (2010 film)
 Ivan Andreitch Laevsky is an educated Russian aristocrat who has run off with a married woman, Nadyezyhda Fyodorovna (Nadya), to the Black sea. He got a job in the civil service, but is careless about his work, mostly drinking and playing cards. By now he has fallen out of love and is bored with Nadya, who is having affairs with other men, and he wants to leave her. He receives a letter telling him that Nadya's husband has died (and therefore she is free to marry him). But he hides the letter in a book and doesn't tell Nadya. That, he says, would be like inviting her to marry him.   Laevsky confides his problem with Alexandr Daviditch Samoylenko, a military doctor, who has befriended Laevsky and looks after him. Samoylenko urges Laevsky to marry Nadya, even if he doesn't love her. Laevsky says he can't marry a woman he has no feeling for. But he can't leave her because she has no money, no relatives, and no means to survive. Samoylenko says that if he must leave her, he must do so humanely, by giving her enough money to live on. Laevsky says he is 2000 roubles in debt and can't afford to do that.   Samoylenko has two boarders in his house, and they discuss philosophy, science and literature around the dinner table and elsewhere. One boarder is Nikolay Vassilitch Von Koren, a zoologist. The other boarder is a deacon in the Russian church. The doctor, the zoologist, and the deacon discuss the new ideas of evolution. In a friendly discussion, the deacon says that man was descended from God. Von Koren says that man was descended from the ape. He explains how the fitter animals survive to pass on descendents, and the weaker animals die off. Von Koren gives Laevsky as an example of a man who is not fit to survive. When Laevsky came to the town, he taught everyone bad habits. First, playing cards. Second, drinking beer. Third, openly living with another man's wife, rather than being discreet about adultry like the townspeople. Fourth, he is a debtor. Von Koren says that Laevsky should not be permitted to reproduce, otherwise there would be worthless Laevskies all over Russia. Laveski is like a microbe, that you wouldn't hesitate to kill. Von Koren says he would like to kill Laveski himself, as you would kill a vermin. Samoylenko and the deacon reject these ideas, Samoylenko arguing from feelings of compassion and the deacon arguing from the love taught by Christ. Samoylenko is offended by Von Koren's insulting his friend, Laevsky. They reject his "German" ideas.   Laevsky decides to leave the town for Petersburg. He says that he will go first and send for Nadya after he is settled, but Samoylenko and Von Koren know that this will be his way to abandon her. But he has no money, so he asks Samoylenko to loan him 100 roubles. Samoylenko agrees, but doesn't have 100 roubles, so he tells Laevsky he will have to borrow it in turn from a third party. After Laevsky leaves, Samoylenko asks Von Koren (his boarder) to advance him 100 roubles. Von Koren gives Samoylenko 100 roubles, but on the condition that Laevsky agrees to take Nadya with him to Petersburg.   Laevsky returns a day later to try to get the money. Von Koren treats him contemptuously, and refers to his "problems." Laevsky becomes furious, and accuses Samoylenko of revealing his personal matters. Samoylenko indignantly denies it. Laevetsky tells them to leave him alone, or "I will fight you." Von Koren twists this to mean a challenge to a duel, and accepts. Laevsky agrees, their friends can't talk them out of it, and they make arrangements for a duel with pistols.   Meanwhile, Nadya is pursued by Kirilin, the police captain. They once had sex, which she calls "a mistake," and Kirilin is blackmailing Nadya into having sex with him again with a threat of exposing her. She cries and begs him but finally agrees to meet him again that night and one more night. Atchmianov, the son of the shopkeeper where Nadya buys her clothes, was also pursuing Nadya, but she rejected him. He finds out about her assignation with Kirilin.   The night before the duel, Laevsky is drinking and playing cards. Atchmianov tells Laevsky to follow him to meet someone about "very important business." He leads Laevsky to the room where Kirilin and Nadya are having sex. Laevsky goes home even more upset about Nadya than about the duel.   Laevsky is still upset the morning of the duel. Their friends try to talk them into forgiving each other, and Laevsky agrees and apologizes, but Von Koren, despite their entreaties, insists on going through. Laevsky's hands shake, and he deliberately fires into the air. Von Koren, who is a practiced pistol shot, takes aim at Laevsky's head. Meanwhile, the Russian Orthodox deacon, who has been hurrying to the scene, appears over a hill and shouts. Von Koren fires and misses Laevsky.   They go home, and Laevsky finally recovers. He falls in love with Nadya again. Three weeks later, they have been married, and Laevsky is transformed. He is working hard to pay off his debts. Von Koren is finally leaving. He is amazed at Laevsky's transformation, and says that if Laevsky had been like this originally, they could have been good friends. He stops by Laevsky's house before he leaves. Laevsky and Nadya greet him warmly, he shakes hands, and they say emotional goodbys.

Instead, she hangs around the house all weekend listening to [[Natasha Bedingfield]]'s "[[Pocketful of Sunshine]]", which is played by a [[greeting card#Types of greeting cards|musical greeting card]] from her grandmother. The following Monday, pressed by Rhiannon, Olive lies about losing her virginity to a college guy.

The school's church group run by Marianne decides Olive will be their next project. Olive confides the truth to her friend Brandon, and he understands because others bully him because of his [[homosexuality]]. He later asks Olive to pretend to sleep with him so that he will be accepted by everyone as a "straight stud".  Olive agrees to help him and they pretend to have sex at a party. After a fight with Rhiannon over her new identity as a "dirty skank", Olive decides to counteract the harassment by embracing her new image as the school tramp. She begins to wear more provocative clothing and, inspired by ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' (which her literature class is currently studying), stitches a red "A" onto everything. Boys who usually have had no luck with girls in the past now beg Olive to increase their popularity by saying they have had sex with her, in exchange for gift cards to various stores.

Olive now has a change of heart and begins to ask everyone she lied for to help her out by telling the truth, but Brandon and Micah have abruptly left town, and with their newfound popularity, no one else wants to tell. When Mrs. Griffith also refuses to tell the truth, Olive threatens to expose her affair, but Mrs. Griffith says no one would believe her.  Out of spite, Olive then immediately tells Mr. Griffith, who believes her and separates from his wife.

She does a song-and-dance number at a school pep rally to get people's attention to watch her via webcast&mdash;the film.

When a quarrel breaks out between the two men, after Maquet passes himself off as Dumas in order to seduce Charlotte ([[Mélanie Thierry]]), a crucial question presents itself: what is the exact part each man has in the work's success? Who is the ''father '' of [[The Three Musketeers|d'Artagnan]], and of ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo|Monte Cristo]]''? In short, who is really the author?  Their formerly peaceful relationship is now in doubt and topples over into confrontation. And not far away, in Paris, a revolution is building which will seal the fate of another relationship—that of [[Louis-Philippe]]— with the people of France.

Edge of Darkness (2010 film)
 At [[South Station]], [[Boston]], homicide detective Thomas Craven ([[Mel Gibson]]) picks up his daughter Emma ([[Bojana Novakovic]]), who comes home to visit and vomits while getting into the car. As Craven prepares dinner at home, Emma suffers a nosebleed and vomits again. As the two exit the house on their way to the hospital, a masked gunman below yells "Craven!", fatally wounds Emma with a shotgun, and escapes as Craven attends to his daughter.  After identifying the body at the [[medical examiner]]'s office, he takes a lock of Emma's hair as a memento and incidentally discovers that it is radioactive. Then, though everyone assumes Craven was the gunman's target, when he finds Emma had a .45 pistol in her [[night stand]], he starts to suspect that possibly Emma was the intended target. At the police station, he checks the gun's ownership and finds that it belongs to her boyfriend David ([[Shawn Roberts]]). David is living in fear of a company called Northmoor, where he and Emma worked. She discovered that Northmoor, a [[research and development]] facility under contract to the U.S. government headed by Jack Bennett ([[Danny Huston]]), was secretly manufacturing [[nuclear weapon]]s using foreign material and foreign specifications. The weapons were intended to be traced to foreign nations if they were used as [[dirty bomb]]s.  Burning Emma's clothing in his backyard, Craven encounters Jedburgh ([[Ray Winstone]]), a British "consultant" tasked with preventing the disclosure of Emma's information, dealing with Craven however he sees fit. Jedburgh takes a liking to Craven, leaving him to investigate. Craven repeatedly has visions of Emma, even having short conversations and interactions with her, typically as the happy young child he remembers and loves. Craven eventually discovers through one of Emma's friends, an activist who is nearly killed by another of Northmoor's agents, that Bennett ordered Emma's murder, as well as those of the activists Emma was working with to steal evidence of the illegal nuclear weapons. They eventually kill a hitman marked as a [[fall guy]] after he is set up for killing Emma.  Craven confronts lawyer and Massachusetts U.S. Senator Jim Pine ([[Damian Young]]) who was contacted earlier by Emma, revealing that Craven knows almost everything that happened. After examining his fridge with a Geiger counter, Craven discovers that his milk has been contaminated, most likely with the poison used on his daughter. His fellow detective and friend, Bill ([[Jay O. Sanders]]), comes to Craven's home while the Northmoor agents break into the house. Craven realizes that Bill set him up before the agents [[taser]] and kidnap Craven, taking him away in an unmarked ambulance. He wakes up handcuffed to a [[gurney]] in the Northmoor facility, but manages to escape.  His health deteriorating rapidly from the poison, Craven heads to Bennett's house and executes the Northmoor agents after forcing one of them at gunpoint to scream the name "Craven," finally identifying him as Emma's killer. Bennett shoots and wounds Craven, but Craven also wounds Bennett, and manages to force some of the radioactive milk, which he has brought with him, down Bennett's throat. Bennett attempts to take some pills to counteract the radioactivity, but Craven shoots him dead.  Jedburgh, who is suffering from an unrelated terminal illness, meets with the Senator and two political advisers who had hired Jedburgh to handle Craven. They want to spin the Northmoor incident in a positive light. Jedburgh suggests that an assassination attempt on the Senator could be an angle to drive Bennett's death out of the headlines. They are pleased with this idea until Jedburgh abruptly kills both advisers and the senator. When a young [[Massachusetts State Police]] officer nervously enters the Senator's room upon hearing the gunshots, Jedburgh asks the officer at gunpoint if he has children. When the officer replies yes, Jedburgh lowers his gun, allowing the officer to shoot him dead.  While Craven lies dying in the hospital from his wounds and [[radiation poisoning]], a young reporter for the local [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] TV station [[WFXT]], who had spoken to Craven a few nights earlier at his home, opens a letter from him which contains DVDs recorded by Emma revealing the conspiracy, with Craven's "good luck" wishes, ensuring Northmoor's end. As Craven dies, the spirit of Emma comforts him. Craven and Emma are then shown leaving the hospital together, walking down the corridor and toward a bright, white light.

Desmond has a girlfriend, Flora, who comes from a wealthy family.  Flora's family moves away from Hong Kong to the United States, affecting Desmond's grades and performance in school. He also gradually becomes aware of the inequalities in Hong Kong society of that time, both through interactions with a cocky British policeman who extorts money from his father in exchange for letting them keep their shop (and who insists that Desmond will never be successful because his English isn't good enough) and through his first time seeing the inside of Flora's family's mansion. Most of this is told through Chun-yi, the film's [[narrator]].  Not long before Flora leaves, Desmond's grades start declining and he takes third place in a race he had hoped to win. One day he collapses suddenly after a [[typhoon]] nearly destroys the family's house, and his father takes him to the hospital, where he is diagnosed with [[leukemia]].

Easy Money (2010 film)
 Johan "JW" Westlund is a man living in Stockholm and is a promising student at the Stockholm School of Economics.  JW is originally from the [[Norrland]] region in Sweden where his father, who has a slight drinking problem, works in a saw mill, while his mother works in a jobs agency.  JW is racked by the disappearance of his sister, Camilla, four years earlier.  JW feigns the appearance of a "Stekare" (in Swedish parlance, a lifestyle based on flaunting one's apparent wealth), actually leading a double life driving taxi illegally to finance his expensive life on [[Stureplan]]. A romance with the upper class girl Sophie leads to him being enticed into the world of organized crime. Abdulkarim, who is running the taxi business, offers JW a job in helping him start his [[cocaine]] business.  Jorge Salinas Barrio is a Chilean man who went to prison after being caught in the drug business. He has now escaped and is on the run from the police. Jorge knows everything about cocaine. He has a plan: to revenge those who snitched on him, among them Yugoslavian mafia boss Radovan Kranjic, and to make one final cocaine delivery and then leave the country for good.  Mrado Slovovic, a hitman who runs errands for the Yugoslavian mafia, is sent by Radovan on a mission to take care of Jorge. At the same time, he has to struggle with taking care of his eight-year-old daughter, who he is forced to take with him on his job because the mother has a drug addiction.  These three characters cross paths through their dreams about quick earnings. Once JW and Abdulkarim have the cocaine sales going, they want to expand. Abdulkarim has heard that Jorge, who has escaped from prison by this time, has learned everything about the cocaine business while in prison. Simultaneously, Jorge has tried to blackmail Radovan, the Yugoslavian mafia boss. Mrado is tasked by Radovan to kill Jorge to prevent him from helping any of Radovan's competitors. Meanwhile, JW is promised 20,000 SEK if he can bring Jorge back to Abdulkarim alive. After noticing Mrado following Jorge, JW tails both of them, losing sight of Jorge when he gets on a bus. JW fortuitously finds them when he notices the car he saw Mrado drive away in standing in a forest clearing. When he enters the forest, he finds Mrado and one of Radovan's henchmen savagely beating Jorge. JW sets off the car alarm of the Serbian attackers to distract them. Meanwhile, Jorge hides from his attackers, who then travel further into the forest to find him. JW approaches a badly wounded Jorge and takes him back to his dormitory. Abdulkarim visits JW and Jorge and helps Jorge recuperate. Though hesitant about keeping Jorge in his dorm room, JW relents when Abdulkarim offers him 1000 SEK for every day Jorge stays. As Jorge recuperates, he learns more about JW and the two become friends.  At one of the jetsetter parties, JW falls for Sophie (Lisa Henni), the on and off girlfriend of jet-setter Carl. JW learns that Carl's father's investment bank is in serious financial trouble and Carl may not be able to afford the extravagant "Stekare" lifestyle. This becomes important when Abdulkarim asks JW to figure out how they can launder the 20,000,000 SEK profit they will eventually earn. JW proposes that they buy shares of Carl's father's failing bank, giving it a stimulus that would not only save the business but immediately increase the price of the shares, making it more profitable. JW acts as the front man for Abdulkarim's cocaine syndicate as they attempt to purchase the bank.  Though Carl's father has reservations, he eventually relents and accepts the deal.  Soon after, JW and the drug syndicate visit Jorge's drug dealer friends in Germany.  The drug dealers show how they smuggle drugs by inserting drug capsules under the skin of dogs and then letting the incision heal and the hair grow back which takes two months according to the drug dealers.  The drug dealers also place drug capsules in the leaves of young cabbage plants and then let the cabbage grow a full size head around the capsule. Abdulkarim's syndicate ultimately negotiates for a shipment of 40 kilos of pure cocaine.  The drug dealers want the money deposited in a Swiss account. JW immediately raises concerns about that plan, arguing that Switzerland is not that secret anymore and recommends an account in Andorra or Liechtenstein instead. This gains the drug dealer's trust and allows the transaction to run smoothly. Later, Jorge advises that JW that he is unlikely to see the money promised by Abdulkarim. JW visits Abdulkarim in his hideout and, while talking with Abdulkarim, realizes that what Jorge said was true.  Mrado is waiting with his daughter at JW's apartment building and offers JW two million for assistance in raiding Abdulkarim's drug shipment.  JW agrees on the understanding that no one will get hurt.  The drugs arrive in an eighteen-wheeler full of cabbages.  Jorge and Abdulkarim's men start repackaging the drugs in a warehouse.  Meanwhile, JW assists Mrado and one of Mrado's Serbian friends in entering the warehouse. A firefight occurs and one of Abdulkarim's men is seriously wounded immediately.  JW is shocked by the turn of events.  Jorge realizes that JW has double crossed them.  Meanwhile, Radovan has phoned the police to report the drug delivery.  JW grabs a weapon and holds off the Serbians as the police arrive and a firefight breaks out.  JW and Jorge escape to the rooftop and eventually get to a car.  Mrado's friend is seriously wounded, but intends to hold off the others so that Mrado can escape.  As Mrado runs from an alley, he is hit and seriously injured by the car with Jorge and JW in it.  JW, the least injured of the three, is angry with Mrado who had promised that no one would get hurt.  JW shoots Mrado.  JW then fires shots at the policemen closing in, thereby allowing Jorge to escape in the car.  JW then surrenders to the police.  Mrado is taken away by ambulance and calls his daughter on the way to the hospital.  Jorge drives off into a forest and is last seen running through a field similar to the field that he ran through after escaping from prison.  The movie ends with JW in prison with tattoos of "JW" and "Camilla" on his arms.  He is visited by Sophie who still cares deeply for JW, but she is leaving Sweden to stay at her parent's house in France.  She asks JW if he cares for her. JW appears to care for Sophie, but says nothing.  As Sophie leaves, she relays a message from Jorge who says that Paola had a baby girl. JW says that if Jorge calls again, tell him that '"Mr. Brains" says 'Hello.'"

Elle: A Modern Cinderella Tale
 Elle Daniels ([[Ashlee Hewitt]]) has dreamed of being a famous singer-songwriter for as long as she can remember. On the day of her audition for [[Berklee]], the plane her parents are travelling in crashes. Crushed, Elle moves in with her uncle Allen ([[Thomas Calabro]]), who runs a small, independent record company called Spunn Records.  Allen offers Elle a job as an intern and even though this means supporting Spunn's biggest act, a bubblegum pop trio called Sensation, led by the horrendous Stephanie ([[Katherine Bailess]]), Elle swallows her pride and tries to forget about her dreams. She becomes good friends with fellow intern Kit (Juliette Hing-Lee), and spends her days phoning radio stations and running errands.  But then Ty Parker ([[Sterling Knight]]), a famous pop singer extraordinaire, shows up at Spunn, saying that he needs something different, even if it means his fans shunning him. Allen agrees to set him up on a duet with Kandi Kane, a British pop star with "a million hits online" and Ty agrees to think about in search of something new and willing to take any risk it takes.  Elle, being convinced by Kit to start singing again, gives herself a makeover, goes to the recording studio and sings "Love is with Me Now", which Ty hears, and mistakes her for the British Kandi Kane, awestruck by her voice. Surprised and pleased, Elle plays along, leaving at midnight when she receives a text from uncle Allen. After discovering that she accidentally over recorded the Sensation single and feeling guilty for lying to Ty, Elle goes into hiding, donning stupid disguises.  Ty, who is all jumpy about signing Spunn, is also shocked to discover that Kandi is anything but blonde on an awkward meeting set up for the two by Allen, and leaves in a fit of rage, snapping at Allen that this time, it's about what he really wants.  Ty is determined to find the girl he met with the help of TJ ([[Brandon Mychal Smith]]) but fails. Stephanie discovers that the song was Elle's and Sensation team up with Kandi to show Elle her place. On Kit's advice, Elle decides to give true love a shot, and with Kit's would-be boyfriend Andy (Shawn Caulin-Young)'s help, she reveals herself through the song she performed in the studio. Ty hears her sing, and Elle is viciously insulted by Sensation and Kandi for being an obsessive fan. Instead of supporting them, Ty walks out and comforts the heartbroken Elle and they start dating. He also convinces her that her talent would never hurt her, and the death of her parents had nothing to do with her. Allen also tells Elle that he admired her parents very much and the song that she accidentally over-recorded was "beautiful."  He also said that Elle helped him remember that he wanted to make music then money, not the other way around.  All seems to be well and Ty convinces Elle to audition for Berklee again. They write a song "Fairytale" together, until Kandi returns for her claim on the single and emotionally tortures Ty to leave Elle or she would sue everyone related to him. Ty calls her a horrible person, but agrees to break up with Elle anyway to protect her.  Heartbroken, Elle misunderstands everything, which causes Kit and Andy to carry out an investigation where they hear the receptionist calling Kandi "Miss Smirkle." Although suspicious, Andy's courage fails, but Kit kisses him for support and he mans up immediately.  Pretending to have a pastry delivery for her by the studio, Andy goes to Kandi, buying Kit time to break into the room, where she is shocked to unearth the fact that Kandi is in fact Brenda Smirkle, an average girl who is using Kandi's identity to make money and is anything but British.  After getting immense proof on tape, Kit reveals Brenda's secret to Allen, who suggests that she leave before he reports her the police for fraud and blackmail. In the process, he also dumps Sensation for their role in Brenda's plot, which Stephanie tries to protest until Kit reveals that Stephanie is bald which causes her and the girls to flee in horror about the secret. Ty rushes to make Elle's audition and arrives just as she is standing tongue-tied on the stage. He backs her up with a guitar and she blows the judges away by singing "Fairytale". She is immediately accepted to Berklee and forgives Ty after the performance. Both of them share a long-awaited, heart felt kiss, where Elle narrates that fairy tales do exist.  The film ends with colorful credits where "Happily Ever After" by Ashlee Hewitt plays in the background, indicating what happened to all the main characters. Elle graduated from Berklee, Ty's album went triple Platinum, Brenda (aka Kandi) was pretending to be a different pop star, Stephanie is a wig model, Jamie and Becky work for Lady Gaga, and Kit and Andy were happily together with their own detective agency.

Guaracy ([[Adriano Garib]]), [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]'s State Secretary for Public Safety, exploits this situation by promoting Nascimento to State Subsecretary of Intelligence and expelling Matias from BOPE, demoting him to regular state police. When Nascimento tries to convince Matias he can settle the situation, he rebukes him and goes to tabloid journalist Clara Vidal ([[Tainá Müller]]), giving her an interview about disregard of BOPE and the government's corruption practices, which leads to his detention. Meanwhile, Fraga leverages his influence to become a state representative in Rio's [[Legislative Assembly of Rio de Janeiro|State Assembly]] and convinces Nascimento's son Rafael that his father is a bad influence on him.  Nascimento continues to focus on his work, expanding BOPE's arsenal, increasing the number of officers and funding the department with armored vehicles and helicopters, enabling BOPE to eliminate drug cartels from multiple [[favela]]s. Despite his beliefs that the equipping of BOPE would ultimately bankrupt [[police corruption|dirty cops]], a group of dirty cops led by Major Rocha ([[Sandro Rocha]]) realize that they can extort money from entire favelas instead of just from dealers. Rocha's group forms a [[militia]], which finances cable TV, water supplies, banks, internet services and deliveries to the residents, forming a racket of money extortion from the favelas to amass money and acquiring political and public support (as they are supposedly "cleaning" the favelas from drug dealers).  Four years later, a group of disguised militia break into a police station in [[Tanque, Rio de Janeiro|Tanque]], one of the few remaining strongholds of Rio's drug trade after Nascimento's interventions, and steal a number of police rifles as part of a plan devised by corrupt policemen and associate politicians to create an excuse to raid the place and get rid of local drug dealers. After listening to 300 hours' worth of tapped phone calls, Nascimento assures Secretary Guaracy there is no evidence that the dealers have taken the weapons. Corrupt Lieutenant-Colonel Fabio Barbosa ([[Milhem Cortaz]]), however, states that an informant of his indicate the dealers as culprits, and the raid is authorized by the Governor. Matias, brought back into BOPE by Rocha's influence, orders to replace corrupt officers in a police station in an escape route to catch the fleeing dealers by surprise. After shooting them dead and [[torture]] drug lord Pepa, Rocha and his men arrive and kill the remaining drug boss; Matias demands explanations, but is shot in the back by Rocha and his men after confronting them.  Devastated by Matias' death and vowing revenge, Nascimento, aware Fraga has been investigating the militia activity, taps his phone. Meanwhile, Clara goes into one of Rocha's favelas with a photographer to collect information about corrupt officers for a scoop, only to find promotional material for the Governor's re-election hidden in a deposit. As she calls Fraga and reveals what she has discovered, they are caught by Rocha and his group, and Fraga overhears Rocha's voice right before he rapes and murders Clara and the photographer. Nascimento listens to the recording of the talk and deduces Fraga is the next target. Since Fraga is with Rosane and Rafael, he records the data, takes it with him and goes after his family. Just after he leaves, Formoso finds out about his tapping of Fraga's phone and warns the corrupt officers about this. Nascimento heads for Fraga's apartment while trying to phone Rosane, but she deliberately ignores the calls. As Fraga, Rafael and Rosane arrive, two men in a motorcycle try to murder Fraga in a [[drive-by shooting]], but end up hitting Rafael in the chest instead. After Nascimento shoots back, but misses.  After Rafael is taken to the hospital, Nascimento sets up a police roadblock near the Secretary's house and brutally beats him up in a fit of rage. The following day, the President of the Legislative Assembly decides to open an investigation over Clara's possible murderer (due to the lack of bodies, the police is treating the case as kidnapping), and Nascimento is forced to step down as Subsecretary for Public Safety for illegally tapping Fraga's phone in an effort to have Nascimento humiliated. The assumption is that the illegal tap had been made with the intention of spying on his ex-wife.  However, the Secretary and his allies decide not to kill Nascimento, as his death during the trial would make him a matyr for human rights and implicate them, causing a national scandal; Rocha, knowing that, if Nascimento testifies, blame will fall on his militia and, by extension, himself, decides to proceed with the assassination despite his superiors' orders not to.  That night, Nascimento arrives at the hospital, where Rafael is slowly recovering after his surgery. He tells Rosane to call him anytime she needs him, and then leaves the hospital, as shown in the opening sequence. As he leaves, a man with a radio informs Rocha about his departure, while another car follows Nascimento. Rocha arrives with his convoy and starts shooting at Nascimento, but the other car's occupants exit and start shooting at Rocha's men, revealing themselves to be BOPE officers shadowing Nascimento, who had predicted the attempt on his life. Despite losing the gunfight, Rocha escapes.  The next day, Nascimento is called to the State Assembly and testifies with Fraga for over three hours at the court, implicating many politicians and policemen. In the aftermath, Gregorio Fortunado ([[André Mattos]]), a state representative and local TV presenter who sides with the militia, is sentenced to prison; many corrupt officers and their allies are murdered as their leaders try to silence them, and Fabio himself lures Rocha to his boat and then murders him and his posse. The governor, however, manages to be reelected, and Guaracy is elected state representative for [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]], as is Fraga; the two start a rivalry. Nascimento ends his narration with a reflection over the influence of politicians on the social issues of Brazil, while aerial images of [[Brasília]] are shown. In the final scene, he visits his son in the hospital just as he first wakes up from his [[coma]].

Elena Undone
  The paths of Elena Winters ([[Necar Zadegan]]), a mother and pastor's wife, and Peyton Lombard ([[Traci Dinwiddie]]), a well-known lesbian writer randomly cross. Instantly, they feel drawn toward one other and eventually fall in love.  The movie opens in two places - following the two protagonists - first, within a church, where Elena's son, Nash, refuses to support an anti-homosexual protest, and then within a memorial service for Peyton's mother.  Elena and her husband Barry ([[Gary Weeks]]) are trying to conceive but it becomes clear that their efforts have been unsuccessful when Barry rebukes Elena after her period starts. Peyton starts cleaning out her mother's things, having flashbacks of her emotionally troubled mother as she works. Peyton finds a tape entitled 'Women's Glory Project' with her things, and becomes obsessed with it for some time.  Elena visits her friend Tyler for advice, telling him that she and Barry are going to adopt instead of trying to have another child. He asks "what's in it for (her)," and insists (as he's apparently done in the past) that Barry is not her soulmate, or "twin flame." Even so, he pushes her to go to the adoption, saying that "someone is definitely coming into (her) life, in a big way."  Peyton and Elena meet at the adoption agency. They briefly speak as Peyton returns Elena's lost keys to her. They exchange business cards after Peyton mentions that she might have use for a photographer (which Elena was prior to marrying Barry).  Peyton's best friend, Wave, drags her to a 'love guru' (Tyler) where Peyton and Elena meet once again. Elena finds out that Peyton is gay as they talk about their marriages. Peyton calls Elena the next day, inquiring if Elena would help her with continuing her mother's Women's Glory Project, and make plans for Elena to visit the next day with her portfolio.  They meet once again, and it's revealed that Peyton's an [[agoraphobic]] with substantial difficulties trusting. They bond over the next few weeks - over picnics with Tyler, and late-night glasses of wine. Later, Elena takes better professional photographs of Peyton for her books, and they discuss their upbringings and how they knew they were straight and gay, respectively.  Peyton calls Wave asking for advice on her feelings for Elena, and her friend tells her to be honest with Elena about said feelings, unaware that Elena has some of her own. She visits Peyton later, after being avoided for some time, showing up at her door with the printed photographs. At the unexpected visit, Peyton discloses her feelings to Elena and suggests that they not spend time together. Elena violently rejects that idea, telling Peyton that she's her absolute best friend, that they need to be in each other's lives, and that Peyton can have "all of (her) except for that (meaning physically romantic encounters)." Subsequently, however, Elena begins to rapidly examine her own feelings. Elena calls Peyton after exploring lesbian websites, saying that she's not attracted to them and doesn't think she's a lesbian, leaving the viewer aware that she is attracted to Peyton. This is followed by an uncharacteristically (up to this point) passionate statement from Elena asking if she and Peyton could agree to call her feelings a serious "crush." Her husband walks up in the middle of the call, causing her to quickly end it, which appears even more suspicious.  The following day, Elena comes over to Peyton's house and makes out with her passionately. As time passes, Elena begins wanting more from her relationship with Peyton. She asks Peyton to make love to her; at first Peyton refuses, saying that "once [they] go there, there's no going back." Elena tells her that she doesn't want to go back. As they're making love, Peyton asks Elena to stay with her, though it's unclear whether she means physically or emotionally.  Over the next several days, Elena and Peyton embark on a secret sexual relationship. One morning, they both get into a bit of an inquisition when Peyton asks how Barry comes on to Elena and when and how often they have sex. Elena tells her that they don't have sex anymore, and also tells her that they're going on an annual vacation to Hawaii together. Peyton writes intimate letters to Elena as she's away, and Nash is the one that finds them as he's looking for some aspirin in her suitcase.  The toll of having two partners starts to eat away at Elena, and she begins to get in more fights with both Barry and Peyton. Nash starts stealing and drinking from the stress of keeping Elena's affair with Peyton secret, and ends up getting caught by the police after getting drunk and returning to the store he stole from. When Elena comes back and confronts him about it, he tells her that he knows of her affair with Peyton and she explains (briefly) that she does not intend to stop seeing her.  Elena returns to Tyler out of desperation for answers as to why she's been set on this path, and meets Peyton later and kisses her in the park, oblivious to Millie seeing them together. Millie then calls Barry and tells him about Elena's affair. Peyton tells her that they should probably break up, because of all the complications arising for Elena. Elena insists that they don't, asking Peyton rhetorically if she ever saw a future of them together. They break up and Elena walks off as Millie goes to Barry and tells him about the affair to his face. Elena breaks up with Barry, telling him that Nash needs the real them, not the fighting couple that they've become.  Six months later, Wave and Peyton are taking a walk in the park and run into Tori and Nash, also doing the same. Elena also comes up, walking with Tyler and his wife, Lily. She's now pregnant, and at first Peyton freaks out, thinking that Elena played her and was sleeping with Barry the entire time they were together. Elena faints, and Nash gets Peyton and Elena to talk together at Tyler's house so Elena can explain that she broke up and is getting divorced from Barry, but still wanted a child, to have some hope in her life and that she received IVF with Tyler's 'contribution,' and asks Peyton to try and understand. Peyton apologizes and they kiss.  The movie ends with another of Tyler's picnics with Peyton and Elena together with their infant.  
The End Is My Beginning
    
Endure
 [[Police detective]] Emory Lane ([[Judd Nelson]]) is called in to investigate when [[Gag (BDSM)|gagged]] 29-year-old hostage, Daphne Mayton ([[Clare Kramer]]), is left in the woods and restrained to a tree late at night; her perpetrator 47-year-old Douglas Macey (Tyler Cravens) is killed in a car accident afterwards. At the crash site, the accident leaves traces, including a photo of a gagged Daphne in front of a tree, a Polaroid camera, blood stains, a cellphone and keys, which are found inside the car.  Captain Ted Stillman (Dennis Neal) of the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]] pairs Emory with rookie detective Zeth Arnold ([[Devon Sawa]]) to work on the case. They all realize it will be a grueling search for the victim due to the acres of land she was left within. Simultaneously, Emory's wife Sirena Lane ([[Joey Lauren Adams]]) suffers from a severe heart condition which often interrupts his duty. After the autopsy is conducted, Zeth investigates the neighborhood that links to Douglas' car registration address, finding out Douglas was a troubled boy growing up. Emory also gathers more info about Daphne from a missing person's report.  Detectives Emory and Zeth discovers the cellphone obtained from the car at the crash site only made one transmission to another phone, and it tracks back to three retailers in [[Alabama]]. After getting a warrant, they search out Douglas' house where they find drawings in a closet, and they head to his workplace to uncover more info. Soon, the police department develop a profile, presuming Douglas was a [[sex offender]] having issues with his own sexuality; they also conclude he was isolated in his adolescent years and sought approval from an accomplice who shares similar interests.  Probing Daphne's house, it becomes known she is pregnant. Emory begins doubting his faith over his dying wife and the missing victim. Meanwhile, Zeth finds help to hack into a [[black market]] [[Ebay]]-like site using a flash drive found at Douglas' workplace which contained access codes and photos. There, Douglas had cryptically interacted with his new found accomplice, Simon ([[Tom Arnold (actor)|Tom Arnold]]), sharing photos and videos of victims and exchanging money for them. The detectives track Douglas' bank records, and this leads to discovering Douglas had lived in Alabama, neighboring Daphne. They also pinpoint the Alabama connection to Simon, known as James Rawlings.  Having the address, the police force enter Simon's house, but he is not there. They find evidence that detail him as a predator, including a bloody torture room in the basement. This makes the force believe they were too late to save the girl. However, Zeth checks Simon's property tax reports which link to [[Sumter County, Florida]], where he had killed a deer, making the force suspect victims may have been taken somewhere there.  They search the woods there at night and find dead bodies restrained to trees. Around this time, Simon, who tracked Daphne using a [[GPS navigation device|GPS locator]], attempts to take her from the woods, but his plans are stood up by an officer who he shoots down, alerting the rest of the force. He drops Daphne and tries to escape. Emory and Zeth find Daphne and continue to pursue Simon, who shoots Zeth in the chest, piercing his armor. Eventually, Emory subdues Simon and he is taken into custody, while Zeth is hospitalized. Emory's wife Sirena soon succumbs to end stages of a [[heart failure]] and dies. At the end of the film, Emory visits Daphne, who gave birth, and a surviving Zeth in the hospital. On his way out, Emory stops by the [[nursery (room)|nursery room]] giving a faint smile of hope before he leaves.  
Enthiran
 After a decade of research, the scientist Vaseegaran creates a sophisticated [[android (robot)|android robot]] with the help of his assistants, Siva and Ravi, to commission it into the [[Indian Army]]. He introduces the robot, named Chitti, at a robotics conference in [[Chennai]]. Chitti helps Sana, Vaseegaran's [[Medical school#Medical students|medical student]] girlfriend, cheat in her examination, then saves her from being assaulted by a group of thugs. Vaseegaran's mentor, Professor Bohra, is secretly engaged in a project to create similar android robots for a terrorist organisation, but has so far been unsuccessful.  Vaseegaran prepares Chitti for an evaluation by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which is headed by Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti attempts to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the evaluation committee that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes. Vaseegaran's effort to prove Bohra wrong fails when he deploys Chitti to rescue people from a burning building. The robot saves most of them, including a girl named Selvi who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked on camera and flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's [[image schema|neural schema]] to enable it to understand human behaviour and emotions, to which Bohra agrees. While nearing the deadline, Chitti becomes angry with Vaseegaran, demonstrating to him that it can manifest emotions.  Chitti uses Sana's textbooks to successfully help Sana's sister Latha give birth to a child. Bohra congratulates Vaseegaran on the achievement and allows Chitti to pass the AIRD evaluation. Chitti develops romantic feelings for Sana after she congratulates Chitti by kissing it. When Vaseegaran and Sana realise this, Sana explains to Chitti that they are only friends. Saddened by Sana's rejection, yet still in love with her, Chitti deliberately fails an evaluation conducted by the Indian Army. Enraged, Vaseegaran chops Chitti into pieces, which are dumped by Siva and Ravi into a landfill site.  Bohra visits the site to retrieve Chitti, which has now reassembled itself, albeit in a damaged state. Bohra embeds a red chip inside Chitti while reconstructing it, converting it into a ruthless killer. It then gatecrashes Vaseegaran and Sana's wedding, kidnaps Sana, creates replicas of itself and kills Bohra. Using its robot army, Chitti occupies AIRD and causes mayhem in the city. After informing Sana that it has acquired the human ability to reproduce, Chitti wishes to marry her so that a machine and a human being can give birth to a preprogrammed child, but Sana refuses. It eventually finds Vaseegaran, who entered AIRD to stop it, and nearly kills him before the police appear. The ensuing battle between Chitti's robot army and the police personnel leads to many casualties and much property destruction. Vaseegaran eventually captures Chitti using a magnetic wall and accesses its internal control panel, whereby he instructs all the other robots to self-destruct. He removes Chitti's red chip, calming it.  In a court hearing, Vaseegaran is sentenced to death for the casualties and damages caused by the robot army, but Chitti explains that it was Bohra who caused its deviant behaviour and shows the court video footage of Bohra installing the red chip. The court releases Vaseegaran, while ordering that Chitti be dismantled. Left with no choice, Vaseegaran asks Chitti to dismantle itself. While saying goodbye, Chitti apologises to Vaseegaran and Sana before dismantling itself.  The film's setting then shifts to 2030. Chitti is now a museum exhibit. A curious school student on excursion asks her guide why it was dismantled, to which Chitti responds, "''Naan sinthikka arambichen''" (''I started thinking'').

Eternity (2010 Thai film)
 The story begins with a young man visiting a village in [[Burma]]. One night, a beautiful woman comes into his bedroom and attempts to seduce him. She suddenly leaves, frightened by the sounds of screams coming from outside. The next day, the young man asks Thip, Ni Han's right-hand man, about the screams. Thip then tells him the story of Yupadee and Sangmong, Ni Han's former wife and nephew.  Sangmong's parents died when he was very young. He was raised by Ni Han, who loved him as a son. Sangmong received a good education and returned home when he graduated. He was a conservative man with traditional values, and his days consisted of reading books and working for his uncle. With very little social life, he seemingly has little interest in women, the opposite of Ni Han who is a womaniser.   Wanting to make Sangmong into a man, Ni Han has Thip take Sangmong to a [[brothel]] for him to learn and enjoy carnal pleasures. Although the woman offered to Sangmong was beautiful, he turns away from her and leaves. Later, Ni Han and Thip ask him why he did not have sex with her, to which Sangmong replies that he wants to wait until marriage. Ni Han respects his decision and promises to find him a proper wife for him to settle down with.  While attending an international sport club in [[Bangkok]], Ni Han meets a widow named Yupadee, and falling for her charms and modern ideas, marries her. When he brings her home to met everyone in the village, Yupadee shows an instant liking to Sangmong. The two become close friends, which Ni Han encourages as he believes Yupadee will help Sangmong break out of his shell and become more sociable.  Yupadee sends Sangmong mixed signals by being affectionate one moment and cold the next. She tells a little bit of her deceased first husband and past. Sangmong meanwhile develops an infatuation with Yupadee, which grows stronger after she nurses him back to health from a fever. Ni Han then announces he must leave on a business trip and decides to take Yupadee with him, but she fakes a pregnancy in order to stay behind and be alone with Sangmong.  With Ni Han away, the two consummate their affair and sneak away to have sex. Many of the servants and Thip know about their relationship but remain quiet, even when Ni Han returned, but one servant bravely tells Ni Han about the affair, which he refuses to believe. He finally learns about them when he secretly catches the two in Sangmong's bed, proclaiming their love for one another until eternity. The next day he reveals that he knows about them, and he gives Yupadee to Sangmong, chaining their wrists–so they can stay together until eternity–and banishes them to a small cabin in the woods.   The lovers initially take his punishment as a joke and enjoy their time together. Soon after, they grow tired and begin to resent one another. They ask Ni Han for forgiveness and to release them; he offers them a gun as his only answer. Refusing to kill himself or Yupadee, Sangmong attempts to run away on a ferry that comes to the village every few months. To avoid suspicion, he tries to cut their chain with an axe. Yupadee stops him, asking if he would leave her if the chain ever breaks. When Sangmong doesn't answer her, she refuses to allow him to break the chain and Ni Han's men find them, and they are taken back to the cabin.  Sangmong takes the gun and offers to shoot himself to release Yupadee, who claims she is pregnant. Yupadee steals the gun from him and shoots herself instead. Sangmong loses conscious afterwards. He awakens to find her rotting corpse and tries to run but is still chained to her. A servant enters the cabin and chops Yupadee's hand off, freeing Sangmong. Sangmong becomes mad with grief and losses his sanity. Ni Han takes Sangmong back when he sees his condition. Through the years, Sangmong has roamed the village, screaming in agony like a wild madman.  Throughout the story, the young man in the beginning has sexual encounters with three beautiful woman in the night. Thip later tells him that the three women are actually Ni Han's women. Frightened, the young man hurries to pack up his belongings. The next day, the young man bravely goes to see Ni Han, who is surrounded by the three women and chains hanging on a column. Ni Han greets him and casually comments that he reminds him of his nephew, much to the young man's horror. Before he leaves, the young man encounters Sangmong, who gives him a book, and the young man thanks him before riding his horse and departing the village.

Even the Rain
 Mexican filmmaker Sebastián ([[Gael García Bernal]]) and his Spanish executive producer Costa ([[Luis Tosar]]) arrive in [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]], accompanied by a cast and crew, prepared to create a historical film depicting [[Christopher Columbus]]'s first voyage to the [[New World]], the imposition of Columbus’ will upon the natives, and the subsequent indigenous rebellion by [[Hatuey]]. Cognizant of his limited budget, Costa elects to film in [[Bolivia]], the poorest country in [[South America]]. There, impoverished locals are thrilled to earn just two dollars a day as extras in the film, and willingly engage in physical labor for set preparation. Costa saves many thousands of dollars by having underpaid extras perform tasks meant to be completed by experienced engineers.  Sebastián casts a local man named Daniel ([[Juan Carlos Aduviri]]) in the role of [[Hatuey]], the [[Taíno]] chief who led a rebellion against Columbus; and Daniel's daughter Belén in a crucial role as well. Their first encounter with Daniel gives Costa pause and causes him to oppose his casting, but Sebastian gives him the role. Sebastian is unaware that Daniel is leading demonstrations against the historically real event of [[Water privatization in Bolivia|water privatization]] that the [[Bolivian government]] has agreed to. Filming begins smoothly despite the alcoholism of actor Anton, ([[Karra Elejalde]]) cast as Colón (Columbus), but when Costa observes Daniel’s revolutionary involvement, he grows uneasy.   Daniel pretends to acquiesce to Costa's insistence that he stop protesting, but actually continues protesting and sustains facial wounds in a clash with police. At this point, Costa [[bribe]]s Daniel to wait for filming to conclude before participating in the rebellion again. Daniel agrees, accepting the money, but spends it on funding the protesters and remains involved, eventually becoming bloodied and imprisoned. Sebastián experiences moral conflict and begins to doubt the likelihood of the film’s completion, but is reassured by Costa, who bribes the police for Daniel’s temporary release in order to film a key scene, in which Colón and his conquistadors execute Hatuey and his rebels. Upon this scene’s completion, police arrive in the Bolivian jungle detain Daniel again but are besieged by the film’s extras, aiding Daniel's escape.   That night, when actors Juan and Alberto see the latest news reports showing violence in Cochabamba, they become so worried that they demand to leave. Sebastián begs them to stay and they hesitantly agree. The next day, as the cast and crew prepare to depart for filming, Costa is met by Daniel’s wife, Teresa, who desperately implores him to assist her in finding her daughter Belén, who has disappeared into the protests and is reportedly wounded and needing hospitalization. Teresa’s persistence wins over Costa’s conscience, and despite Sebastián's equally impassioned insistence against it, he leaves with her.   After Costa and Teresa's obstacle-laden drive through riotous Cochabamba, Belén’s life is saved, but her leg is badly injured and may never fully heal. Meanwhile, the rest of the crew is stopped by a military blockade and all except Antón leave Sebastián to journey home. The revolution ends shortly thereafter with the departure of the multinational water company, but Cochabamba is left in ruins from the conflict. Costa expresses hope that the film will be finished after all, and Daniel emotionally presents him with a vial of Bolivian water in appreciation for his life-saving efforts.  
Everything Must Go (film)
 Salesman Nick Halsey ([[Will Ferrell]]) is fired from his job of 16 years following an unspecified incident in Denver related to his [[alcoholism]]. He sits in the parking garage after leaving the office, drinking from a flask. He then takes the [[Swiss Army Knife]] he was given as a farewell gift and stabs it into his supervisor's car tires, only to leave the knife (which has his name on it) and run away when he is unable to pull it back out from the tire. He immediately drives to a convenience store and buys a large amount of beer. When he returns home, he finds his wife is gone, the locks have been changed, and his belongings have been strewn all over his front lawn. His wife has left him a letter telling him that she is leaving him, also over the Denver incident, and to not contact her.  Nick spends the night on the lawn. In the morning, he leaves to buy beer and food, returning to find his company car being taken back. In addition, his credit cards no longer work, he has been blocked from the joint checking account he has with his wife, and his phone service is terminated. When the police ask him to vacate the premises, Nick gets them to contact his [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] sponsor, Detective Frank Garcia ([[Michael Peña]]), who provides him with a permit for a yard sale, allowing him three more days before he must move on. Nick gets a neighborhood boy, Kenny ([[Christopher Wallace Jr.|Christopher Jordan Wallace]]), to help him sell his possessions, assuring Kenny he will pay him for the help, and also that he will teach him to play baseball. The first day's sale is unsuccessful as Nick is unwilling to let items go.  Nick meets his new neighbor, a pregnant young woman named Samantha ([[Rebecca Hall]]), and invites her to his backyard. There, he tells her that he had been sober for six months until attending a conference in Denver, during which he had gotten blackout drunk with a female coworker; he awoke with no memory of the night before, and soon learned that she had lodged a complaint against him, setting the stage for his firing.  Nick then finds a yearbook with a friendly message from an old classmate, Delilah ([[Laura Dern]]), whom he tracks down and visits. The reunion is awkward, but Delilah nevertheless gives Nick a hug and tells him that he is a good person deep down.  Now completely broke, Nick has to go without alcohol and soon experiences withdrawal. Samantha gives him a [[Valium]] and tells him that he needs help. He replies that she is no better than him because she puts up with her husband's drinking and frequent absences. Samantha storms off, angry and hurt.  The next morning Nick awakes to find Kenny has arranged his belongings on the lawn and has put price tags on them. Most of the things are sold by that evening. Nick apologizes to Samantha, who admits that he was right and that she had told her husband to come home or get a divorce. She, Nick and Kenny then go out to dinner. In the restaurant restroom, Nick encounters his former supervisor, who explains that the incident in Denver probably did not happen. They fired the female employee he got drunk with because it was discovered she has a history of suing fellow employees for sexual harassment, and that Nick probably would have gotten his job back if only he hadn't slashed the supervisor's tires. Nick expresses little reaction to this news, but when the supervisor leaves a glass of beer in the restroom, Nick takes it back to him without drinking a drop.  After dinner, Nick meets with Frank, and answers Frank's phone while he steps out of his office. The caller is Nick's wife, Catherine, telling Frank she is waiting at his house. Nick confronts Frank, who admits Catherine has been staying with him ever since she left Nick. The two men have a fight, and Frank says Catherine deserves better than Nick. It is also divulged that Nick and his wife were both recovering alcoholics. Later, while Frank drives Nick home, he observes that, because Catherine got sober and Nick didn't, their marriage had little chance of succeeding, and proceeds to list the ways Nick failed her as a husband. He then hands Nick a packet of divorce papers for him to sign, along with some spending money and keys to the house. Nick tells Frank to drop him off on the nearest curb; before he gets out of the car, he asks Frank to tell his wife he's sorry. He walks home the rest of the way, at one point stopping to look into the convenience store where he regularly bought beer, but moves on.  The next day, he settles up with Kenny – including repaying him for what he skimmed from Kenny's profits for beer money – and receives an appreciative hug from Samantha, whose husband has come home. She hands him the Polaroid photo she took of him a few days prior, with the message from her fortune cookie taped to the bottom, which says "Everything is not yet lost."  
Exit: una storia personale
 After his roommate committed [[suicide]], Marco([[Luca Guastini]]) begins to realize that his life is very similar to his friend's.  Perhaps even more hopeless. A lack of prospects and a strong sense of inadequacy only darken his mood. Deep in crisis, the young man asks his brother Davide([[Nicola Garofalo]]) to travel with him to the [[Netherlands]], where he wants to accomplish what his friend Maurizio([[Antonio Calamonici]]) had so lucidly planned to accomplish: [[assisted suicide]]. He confesses that he wants to end it all, he wants to stop being such an outsider, stop the suffering.  Davide, who has gotten used to his brother's crises and ravings over the years, doesn't give his requests the least credence. He doesn't know – he cannot know – that Marco's plan has at least a semblance of plausibility. Indeed, the Dutch protocol on [[euthanasia]] extends to the category of [[mental distress]].  The day after the two of them talk, Marco runs away from the Community where he is living, and takes a train to [[Amsterdam]], intent on completing his desperate mission. At the very moment when he’s trying to save his relationship with Nina([[Marcella Braga]]), Davide is forced to acknowledge the gravity of the situation and leave for the [[Netherlands]]. Tired as she may be of watching what she considers to be a sadistic game, Nina is not prepared to leave Davide to face this crisis alone. The unexpected journey offers an opportunity for the couple to be together again, after a period of separation.  On reaching [[Amsterdam]], Marco loses himself in this city of bright lights and attractions. Almost forgetting why he travelled there in the first place, he roams around on a bike, with no particular place to go. He's very much cast adrift, but then he also feels more free than he ever has before. Like a condemned man, he allows itself one last wish: an intimate relationship with a woman – a prostitute([[Joanna Pavoni]]).  Meanwhile, Davide and Nina have made it to [[Amsterdam]] and started to try to find him. One evening, completely by chance, Davide sees his brother streak by on a bicycle. He races after him, and in the end manages to block him near the port. They have a massive argument. Marco has no intention of giving up on his quest, but Davide manages to persuade him that his suicide mission is impracticable. The doctors he has spoken to have told him in no uncertain terms that Marco's condition is not eligible for [[euthanasia]]. And even if his condition was eligible, as a foreign citizen he would still not qualify for assisted suicide. Marco has to face the facts and give up.  The three of them head home. They fly to [[Pisa]], and then drive the rest of the way to [[Rome]]. En route, Davide nods off and they are very lucky not to be involved in a car wreck. Davide decides to turn off the main road and find somewhere to stop and have a snooze. The three of them, all exhausted, fall asleep in the car. A magnificent dawn lights up a desolate and uninhabited stretch of [[Mediterranean]] countryside. A passing train wakes Marco. The young man sneaks out of the car. Nina and Davide are still fast asleep as he strides away from them. Nina wakes up soon after, and realizes that Marco is gone. This is the point at which the epilogue starts, then it is the beginning of the film.  Nina wakes Davide.They come out of the car and go looking for him. Marco, wandering in this wilderness, arrives by chance at a beach.  After a few moments, he instinctively throws himself into the sea. Davide reaches Marco and seeing him in the water, he throws too.  The film ends on Nina, Davide and Marco, the two still wet, returning to [[Rome]].<ref name="CinemaItaliano Film Page"></ref>  
The Experiment (2010 film)
 Volunteers arrive for a psychological study led by Dr. Archaleta (Stevens) in which participants will be divided into groups acting as prison guards and inmates. Among them is Travis (Brody), a proud anti-war protestor, and Michael Barris (Whitaker), a 42-year-old man who still lives with his domineering mother. After interviews measuring responses to various scenes of violence are conducted, a chosen 26 are driven to an isolated building set up as a prison and split into 6 guards and 20 prisoners. Travis is assigned to be a prisoner, Barris as a guard. Basic rules are outlined: prisoners must eat, and fully consume, 3 meals a day; there will be 30 minutes of [[recreation|rec]] daily; prisoners must remain within designated areas. The guards in turn must ensure prisoners obey the rules, and deal with transgressions commensurately within 30-minutes. Archaleta stresses that the experiment will end immediately at the first sign of violence or quitting. If they manage to follow the rules for two weeks, each man will be paid $14,000.  Travis shares his cell with Benjy, a [[graphic novel]]ist, and Nix, a member of the [[Aryan Brotherhood]]. Barris, concerned that some of the guards, particularly Chase, may be capable of violence, tries to dissuade them from aggressive behavior. Instead, the guards grow more forceful in order to make prisoners follow the rules. Barris becomes more and more sadistic. Despite increasing abuse from the guards, Travis remains defiant. Realizing Travis is influencing prisoner dissent, Barris decides to humiliate him, as physical retribution is forbidden. Under Barris' lead Travis is abducted, head shaved, and urinated upon. The red light does not come on, and Barris takes this as a sign that his actions were "commensurate." He reassures the guards they're behaving appropriately. When fellow guard Bosch dissents, Barris pressures him by reminding that quitting early will forfeit payment.  Travis discovers that Benjy, who is taken ill, had concealed his [[diabetes]], thinking he could manage the condition himself. When Travis pleads for Bosche to intervene, Bosche tries to help by locating Benjy's insulin, but is caught by other guards. Barris, to Travis' surprise, gives Benjy his insulin, but later takes revenge by massing all other guards to beat Bosche severely, who is then left among the prison population. Barris also orders Travis to clean the prison toilets as punishment for his defiant attitude and his attempt to help Benjy. Travis taunts Barris, saying he should use his $14,000 for psychological treatment. The guards respond by shoving Travis' head into the toilet, nearly drowning him.  One morning while being humiliated during [[wikt:roll call|roll call]], Travis removes his prison shirt as a sign that the experiment should end, and is followed by the other prisoners. Travis jumps up to one of the cameras and demands that the group be let go, but is dragged to the floor by the guards, who choke him with their batons. When Benjy tries to defend Travis, Barris hits Benjy hard on the head with his baton, leaving him twitching on the floor. Guards throw Travis into an old boiler pipe overnight, attack remaining prisoners, and chain them up across the compound.  While locked in the dark boiler, Travis realizes there's a hidden infrared camera watching him, even there, and as his despondence turns to anger he manages to get out. He interrupts the rape of a prisoner by Chase, knocks him out, and sets the other prisoners free. Upon finding Benjy chained up and left to die, Travis leads an assault against the guards, chasing them through the building. Even as the rest of the guards try to lift the shutters to escape, Barris tries to keep them in. The money is no longer his main concern, instead he is unwilling to let go of his power. A vicious brawl ensues with the prisoners largely overwhelming the guards in sheer numbers. Barris, blaming Travis for causing the unrest, attempts to stab him, but the latter catches the blade with his hand. Barris abruptly pulls away, shocked at his actions before he is tackled to the ground. Travis proceeds to brutally beat Barris, as the siren finally blares. The red light comes on and the doors open, signaling the end of the experiment.  The group emerges into bright sunshine and sit in stunned silence on the grass until a bus arrives. They are shown being driven home on the bus; clean, dressed, and paid for participation in the experiment. Travis and Barris share a silent glance as Barris stares down at his $14,000 check. Nix asks Travis if he still believes humans are higher in the chain of evolution than monkeys. Travis responds that he does because people have the ability to change. Audio news snippets suggest that Archaleta is being tried for manslaughter. Travis meets his girlfriend in India. She notices that his knuckles are bruised, in contrast to the beginning of the film, when she noted his pristine knuckles, an indication that he was, at the time, incapable of violence.  
The Expendables (2010 film)

Jensen instigates a firefight, causing casualties for the pirates. He then tries to hang a pirate, but Yang stops him when Ross and the team discourage it. Ross reluctantly discharges him from the team. Later, Christmas is upset to discover his girlfriend, Lacy, has left him for another man.  Ross and rival Trench Mauser visit "Mr. Church" for a mission. Trench passes the contract to Ross, which is to overthrow dictator General Garza in Vilena, an island in the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Ross and Christmas fly to Vilena for undercover reconnaissance and meet their contact, Sandra, but are discovered.

Ross aborts, but Sandra refuses to leave Vilena. Meanwhile, Jensen approaches Munroe to help and Garza is angered further when Sandra is [[waterboarding|waterboarded]] for information by Munroe. Meanwhile, Lacy has been physically abused by her new man, so Christmas beats him and his friends, revealing what he does for a living. Ross and the group discover that Church is a CIA operative and the real target is Munroe, who has gone rogue and joined forces with Garza to keep the drug money that funds the CIA to himself, but the CIA cannot afford a mission to kill one of their own directly because of bad publicity. Ross meets tattoo expert and friend Tool to express his feelings. Tool makes a confession about letting a woman commit suicide instead of saving her. Ross is then motivated to go back for Sandra alone, but Yang accompanies him. Jensen and hired men pursue them on the road, ending in an abandoned warehouse, where Yang and Jensen fight a second time. Ross shoots Jensen when he attempts to impale Yang on a pipe. Jensen makes amends and gives the layout of Garza's palace. Ross boards the plane with Yang and finds the rest of the team waiting.  They then infiltrate Garza's compound. Thinking Munroe hired the team to kill him, Garza has his soldiers' faces painted, preparing them for a fight. The team plants explosives throughout the site but Ross, while saving Sandra, is captured by Munroe's henchmen. The team saves him and kills the Brit, but is pinned down by Garza's men as Paine wrestles Ross. Caesar fights back and Paine escapes. Garza finally stands up to Munroe, ordering him out and returning his money. Instead, as Garza rallies his men against the Americans, Munroe kills him and escapes with Paine and Sandra. Garza's men open fire against the team, who fight their way through, detonating the explosives and destroying the compound. Toll kills Paine by burning him alive while Ross and Caesar manage to destroy the helicopter before Munroe can escape. Ross and Christmas catch up to Munroe, killing him and saving Sandra. Later, Ross gives his mission reward to Sandra to restore Vilena.  In the final scene, the team has returned home and are celebrating at Tool's tattoo parlor with the recovering and now redeemed Jensen. Christmas and Tool play a game of [[knife throwing]], during which Christmas composes a mocking poem about Tool, then throws a [[Bullseye (target)|bullseye]] from outside the building.

  Valerie Plame is employed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], a fact known outside the agency to no one except her husband and parents. She is an intelligence officer involved in a number of sensitive and sometimes dangerous covert operations overseas.  Her husband, Joseph C. Wilson, is a diplomat who most recently has served as the U.S. ambassador to [[Gabon]]. Due to his earlier diplomatic background in [[Niger]], Wilson is approached by Plame's CIA colleagues to travel there and glean information as to whether [[yellowcake|yellowcake uranium]] is being procured by [[Ba'athist Iraq|Iraq]] for use in the construction of [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons]]. Wilson determines to his own satisfaction that it is not.  After [[2003 invasion of Iraq|military action]] is taken by [[George W. Bush]], who justifies it in a 2003 [[State of the Union address]] by alluding to the uranium's use in building weapons of mass destruction, Wilson submits an [[op-ed]] piece to ''[[The New York Times]]'', claiming these reports to be categorically untrue.  Plame's status as a CIA operative is subsequently revealed in the media, the leak possibly coming from White House officials, including the Vice President's chief of staff and national security adviser, [[Scooter Libby]], in part to discredit her husband's allegation that the Bush administration had manipulated intelligence to justify the invasion of Iraq. As a result, Plame is instantly dismissed from the agency, leaving several of her delicate operations in limbo and creating a rift in her marriage.  Plame leaves her husband, further angered by his granting of television and print interviews, which expose them both to public condemnation and death threats. Wilson ultimately persuades her, however, that there is no other way to fight a power as great as that of the [[White House]] for citizens like them. Plame returns to him and testifies before a Congressional committee, while Libby is convicted of [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] and given a 30-month prison sentence, although President Bush [[Commutation of sentence|commutes the jail time]] on Libby's behalf.

 A teacher at the fictional Wittering College in north [[London]], Robert Anderson ([[David Schofield (actor)|Schofield]]), is hit in the face by a pupil and forced to take three months' leave to avoid being sued by the parents of the child for giving the pupil an F grade, which is against school policy.  Anderson is deeply affected by the incident and upon his return to teaching, he is an [[alcoholism|alcoholic]], emotionally disturbed and separated from his wife, Helen ([[Juliet Aubrey|Aubrey]]). Their daughter, Kate ([[Eliza Bennett|Bennett]]), lives with her mother Helen and has classes with her father, but does not respect him. The headmistress, Sarah Balham ([[Ruth Gemmell|Gemmell]]), loathes Anderson and clearly wants to get rid of him, but the [[National Union of Teachers]] does not allow her to fire him. She indirectly accuses him of bad teaching and bringing alcohol into school.  When Anderson reads about violence in another school, he sends a memo advising all employees at the school about the high number of attacks on teachers and auxiliary staff annually. As a result, he is considered paranoid and delusional by everybody at the school.  One day, after hours, Anderson is overseeing detention, in which he has placed his daughter.

Having left the building, Anderson goes to his car, but finds the dead security guard's torch on the ground in the car park. Meanwhile, Kate is writing her statement in the staff room. Balham realises she can finally sack Anderson and, unable to use the telephone, calls security guard James to ensure that the teacher does not re-enter the school, and Helen, to inform her of the assault.  Balham subsequently finds a body and escapes from two attackers herself, only for them to kill her before she can call the police. Anderson then discovers her corpse, her face badly disfigured. He tries to call the police, but when an attacker enters the room he hides, abandoning the phone, which the attacker crushes.  Leaving the building, Kate is immediately chased back in by one of the attackers. Her boyfriend Eaves, who was waiting outside, enters the building to look for her. She comes across a member of auxiliary staff Gary, ([[Tom Mannion]]), who is unaware of the situation in the school and goes after the attackers, but is electrocuted immediately after discovering Eaves, who is wrapped in barbed wire.  Anderson and James team up to find Kate, who has left a 'Help' note in view of a CCTV camera. They discover Nicky struggling along a corridor, but she has been badly mutilated. Finding the room in which Kate is hiding, they are confronted by a hoodie and in a moment of cowardice, James locks the door with Anderson inside.  Meanwhile, the police arrive and enter the school.

The attackers then find James, who tries to escape but is cornered by the youths.  Anderson finds Kate, but one of the hooded attackers catches the pair off guard, but his attack on Anderson is deflected and he stabs and wounds Kate. Anderson manages to overpower the attacker, grabs the knife and stabs him multiple times, then picks up his daughter and rushes out of the building. However, when they reach his car, they spot Helen's car in the car park and realise that she has arrived at the school.  Anderson has to decide in an instant whether to save his daughter's life by driving her to hospital, or to save Helen by re-entering the school.

The Fair Love
 Hyung-man ([[Ahn Sung-ki]]) is a man in his 50s who leads a lonely, ordered life. He runs a small camera repair shop, and his mastery of this intricate skill draws customers from across the city. He also has a talent for photography, though for him it's more of a hobby than a vocation. He's still single, in fact he has never even dated a woman before. If the world were more fair he would be materially secure, but years earlier one of his best friends, Ki-hyuk, took his life savings and ran off. Since then, his life has never been the same.  Therefore, he is stunned and flummoxed when his former friend Ki-hyuk summons him to his deathbed for an unconvincing apology and, on top of that, a request. Ki-hyuk's daughter Nam-eun ([[Lee Ha-na]]), now in her 20s, will be alone after he is gone, so Ki-hyuk asks Hyung-man to please stop in every once in a while and check on her after he dies. Hyung-man feels rightly that he owes his friend nothing. But the daughter has done him no wrong, so after Ki-hyuk passes away, Hyung-man eventually knocks on her door.  Upon meeting her, he notices that Nam-eun seems to be more distressed over the death of her pet cat than her father's. Meanwhile, Nam-eun finds Hyung-man intriguing, so using his dirty laundry as an excuse, she begins to visit him frequently and gradually falls for him. When she expresses her feelings for him, Hyung-man is at first shocked. But as his awkwardness fades, he realizes that he reciprocates, and he starts to feel and even act like a teenager in love. Despite a twenty-six-year age difference, Hyung-man and Nam-eun decide to embark on a relationship.<ref></ref>

The Fighter
 [[Micky Ward]] is an American [[welterweight]] boxer from [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]. Managed by his mother, Alice Ward, and trained by his older half-brother, [[Dicky Eklund]], Micky became a "stepping stone" for other boxers to defeat on their way up. Dicky, a former boxer whose peak of success was going the distance with [[Sugar Ray Leonard]] in 1978, has become addicted to [[crack cocaine]]. He is being filmed for an [[HBO]] documentary he believes to be about his "comeback".  On the night of an [[Card (sports)|undercard fight]] in [[Atlantic City]], Micky's scheduled opponent is ill, and a substitute is found who is 20 pounds heavier than Micky, a huge difference in professional boxing, constituting two or three weight classes. Despite Micky's reservations, his mother and brother agree so that they can all get the purse and Micky is defeated. Micky retreats from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming, a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender.  After several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, but Micky is concerned it will turn out the same. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions he received an offer to be paid to train in [[Las Vegas]], but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, [[Police impersonation|impersonating a police officer]] to steal the client's money. This is foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them. Micky tries to stop the police from beating his brother and a police officer brutally breaks his hand before arresting him. At their arraignment, Micky is released, but Dicky is sent to jail. Micky washes his hands of Dicky.  On the night of the HBO documentary's airing, Dicky's family, and Dicky himself in prison, are horrified to see that it is called ''[[High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell|Crack in America]]'' and depicts how crack addiction ruined Dicky's career and life. Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison. Micky is lured back into boxing by his father, who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences. The other members of his training team and a new manager, Sal Lanano, persuade Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved. They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence. He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer. During a prison visit, Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent, but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career. During the actual match, Micky is nearly overwhelmed, but then implements his brother's advice and triumphs; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed.  Upon his release from prison, Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train. Assuming things are as they were, Dicky prepares to spar with his brother, but Micky informs him that he is no longer allowed per Micky's agreement with his current team. In the ensuing argument, in which Micky chastises both factions of his family, Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust. Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down. Dicky storms off, presumably to get high again, and Alice chides Micky, only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky. Dicky returns to his crack house, where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlene's apartment. He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together. After bringing everyone back together, the group goes to [[London]] for the title fight against welterweight champion [[Shea Neary]]. Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title. The film jumps a few years ahead, with Dicky crediting his brother as the creator of his own success.

The whole town is deserted, with only flyers announcing a mandatory evacuation due to the storm. Tom is attacked by two deranged men after finding an article showing Silas as the actual killer of his father. Tom manages to fight the two men off and escape back to the farm.  The news article reveals that Silas' father lost the farm because he was drunk, and this enraged Silas so much that he hung him from a tree and left him there for days. When a bank foreclosure agent came by to foreclose on the house, Silas slit his throat, as well.  Silas is shown to have been in prison for the last 20 years related to the two deaths.

Dane, another outcast, has an old, secluded house in the woods which he inherited from his late uncle.  Kurtis is a likable student and an aspiring actor. He invites his schoolmates to a video shoot. There, Bradley and Bernard insult Ravi in the restroom and break his camera. Dane stumbles in, and Bradley intimidates him, revealing that he has been bullying Dane as well. The next day at school, after learning of the incident, Kurtis confronts Bradley, asking him to leave his friends alone.  The outcasts, Emily, Jack, Ravi and Andy and Dane, decide to get revenge on the bullies and send a message to the community. Among their inspirations are horror films and lessons in class about deadly chemicals and torture methods of old cultures. They plan to spare Kurtis, as he doesn't mistreat them. They prepare a costumed party at Dane's secluded house and invite the bullies over. They lace the punch bowl with a drug, causing everyone who drinks from it to fall unconscious. They see Kurtis among the group but still proceed with the plan.  When the teens wake up, they find themselves chained together. The outcasts then declare their intention to make them suffer a fate worse than death, as revenge for the years they have suffered from bullying. In their first act of violence, Jack shoots Miles, a loud-mouthed teenager, with a cattle gun to his face and knee. One boy, Tommy, flees for help, but steps into a bear trap in the woods. Three boys nicknamed The Triplets, who help the outcasts, capture and bring him back to the house.  Immobilized and silenced by a drug, Bernard is then tortured with needles by Emily. Ravi secretly gives Kurtis a key, and he escapes. Dane, obsessed with revenge, stabs and kills Ravi. The torture continues with Emily smearing a corrosive compound on Heather's face. As Bridget apologizes to Emily, she tells her to cut off Bradley's fingers to spare herself. She is unable to do it. When Emily gives the offer to Bradley, he agrees and cuts two of Bridget's fingers off. Emily then smears the compound on half of Bridget's face.  Kurtis encounters Deputy Henessey and asks for help, but the Triplets shoot the Deputy. Kurtis grabs his gun, flees to a neighboring house and informs the owner Parker, an elderly war veteran, of the events in Dane's house. However, Parker doesn't trust Kurtis because he has a gun. After tying up Kurtis to an armchair, Parker goes to Dane's house alone to investigate. He trips over a cord, and a trap severely injures his legs. Despite the injuries, he successfully kills two of the Triplets.  An insane Dane taunts Bradley, who attempts to apologize. Dane severs his spinal cord with a switchblade, paralyzing him from the waist down. After freeing himself, Kurtis calls the police and heads to Dane's house. As Andy is about to cut off Riggs' tongue, Kurtis appears and kills Andy. Dane shoots Kurtis in the arm, but Emily kills him before he can kill Kurtis. Emily says her last words to Kelli, then has Jack shoot her dead. As the police burst in, Jack kills himself after saying: "There are more of us out there".  The next day, a news reporter recounts how the popular kids were abducted and tortured without reason. Kelli, unharmed but traumatized by the events, commits suicide. At school, Kurtis exchanges eye contact with the remaining Triplet. The final scene reveals that Bridget is the disfigured girl from the beginning of the film.  ===Factual references=== The film bears similarity to an actual 2009 plot by two [[Utah]] teenagers to kidnap high school classmates identified as jocks and bullies, then murder them with [[torture murder|slow torture]] while videotaping the experience. As in the film, one of the Utah teenagers was an immigrant from Iraq who had been teased and bullied because of his ethnicity.<ref></ref>

In biology class, Duncan makes friends with fellow outcasts Kenny and Isabel (voiced by [[Dante Basco]] and [[Tia Texada]]), the latter who happens to be a Kaiju-obsessed fangirl who develops a crush on Duncan after he shows her a Gomorradon, a small frog-like Kaiju he caught under cover of apparently making a fool of himself.

The next day, Duncan meets up with "Blitz" Barnes (voiced by [[Reed Diamond]]), undercover as the gym teacher, and defends Kenny from Troy and his friends in a game of [[dodge ball]]. After a confrontation between Duncan and Troy, Blitz takes Duncan to Dr. Pytel (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]) at the M.E.G.T.A.F. base upon the discovery of him being able to breathe fire. Later back at school, Blitz smooths things over with Principal Dave (voiced by [[Gary Anthony Williams]]) to keep Duncan out of trouble.

Belloc finds them and Duncan tells Isabel to run, but before she can escape, Belloc traps her underneath his tail. Duncan demands him to let her go and lures him away, freeing Isabel. Belloc chases Duncan but quickly captures him and takes him away to the Kaiju lair in the desert. Much to Duncan's dismay, he learns that Belloc wants him to become his successor as "King of the Kaiju" and rule over the giant dragon-like monsters, though Belloc believes that the human world has made Duncan soft when he needs to be remorseless. Then Belloc presents Duncan as his heir to the other Kaiju and throws him into a lava pit, Duncan emerges in his Kaiju form and faints. Waking in the desert, he finds his way to Kenny's trailer. Kenny tells Duncan that Isabel told him about Belloc being his father and asks why he was at the party. Duncan replies that Isabel invited him, causing Kenny to become jealous. Back home with his mother, she assures him that the move and deal with M.E.G.T.A.F. were to let him live a normal life and eventually go to college.  Back in school, Duncan is surprised that everyone except Troy now treats him like a celebrity. Isabel reveals that it is because she told them about him ''saving'' them from Belloc. Then Duncan sees Jenna head for the locker room and leaves. Meanwhile, Jenna opens her locker to find an envelope (left by Duncan) with a glowing crystal inside to sell and pay for Homecoming. Later, Isabel attempts to approach Duncan but loses her chance when he and Jenna meet up again. He asks Jenna to be his date for Homecoming, and she agrees. Afterwards, Blitz takes Duncan into the desert planning to use him to locate the Kaiju lair, but they fall under attack. Duncan fights the Kaiju while his father watches, as it is the first of many challenges for the Kaiju throne. Duncan almost kills the Kaiju but refuses to do so. Then Blitz appears with reinforcements and they open fire on Belloc until he abruptly surrenders.   That night, Duncan, Jenna, Kenny, Isabel, and Margeret (as one of the chaperones) go to the dance together. As Jenna and Duncan dance together, Isabel watches them despite Kenny's attempts to get her to dance with him. However, after Troy and Jenna are elected Homecoming King and Queen and go on stage, Isabel dances with Duncan in a romantic embrace, causing Kenny to break them apart and unleash his jealous fury. In the process, Kenny yells at Duncan that Isabel only likes him because of Belloc being his father. Jenna overhears this and backs away from Duncan into Troy's arms, causing Duncan to storm out. As Isabel reprimands Kenny for what he did, two Kaiju named Abbadon and Astaroth appear.  Just as Abbadon and Astaroth start wreaking havoc, putting all the dance participants in danger, Duncan comes to their aid. Changing to his Kaiju form, he fights off the two kaiju while his friends get out of danger. Then he draws them out to the town and into the desert. Meanwhile, Margaret and Jenna head off in a plane to get Belloc's help. Belloc breaks out and hurries to help Duncan. Duncan climbs a cliff only to have Blitz be there and start pounding on him. Then Abbadon and Astaroth reach them and try to eat Blitz; Duncan jumps off the cliff to catch him. As they fall, Duncan gets a new ability: wings, and gets Blitz to a safe place. Then he turns his attention to fighting. During the battle, Duncan gets trapped and Margaret and Jenna arrive, crashing their jet into the kaiju after ejecting themselves. Belloc arrives and then Duncan and Belloc fight together. Duncan, refusing to kill them, causes an avalanche to fall, freezing the two kaiju but sparing the fireborn Duncan and Belloc. Belloc allows himself to be recaptured and carried away in order to stay close to Duncan, Jenna (who has realized that it was Duncan who had left the crystal) apologizes to Duncan for her earlier behavior, and Duncan flies off with his new wings.

Fire in Babylon
  The documentary describes the ascension of West Indies cricket from being a team largely composed of highly talented, entertaining, "Calypso Cricketers" to a determined unit that dominated world cricket for nearly twenty years.  It begins with an introduction to the [[West Indies Cricket Team]]. Using interviews with West Indian cricketing greats, and other people closely associated with West Indies cricket; the idea of culturally and politically different [[Caribbean]] nations playing under the common banner of the West Indies is described.  The history of cricket in the West Indies is briefly described, such as the appointment of [[Sir Frank Worrell]] as the first black man to [[Captain (sports)|captain]] the West Indies Cricket Team, and the emergence of such cricketing greats as [[Everton Weekes]], [[Learie Constantine]], and [[Sir Garfield Sobers]]. However talented these individual cricketers were, they were unable to fetch results, resulting in the West Indies being perceived as "Calypso Cricketers"; people who were entertaining, but would ultimately lose.  The early 1970s saw the emergence of a new crop of West Indian cricketers, ones eager to shake the tag of [[Calypso music|Calypso]], and who could dominate world cricket. However, it is said that when you have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the [[cricket field]]. That man was [[Clive Lloyd]]. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the [[West Indian cricket team in Australia in 1975–76|1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia]].  Australians [[Dennis Lillee]] and [[Jeff Thomson]] destroyed the West Indies with their [[fast bowling]]. Frequent [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]]s and intimidatory tactics led to the spirit of the team being shattered and the tour ended with Australia winning the six-match [[test cricket|test series]] 5-1. At the end of the series, Clive Lloyd realizes that in order to win, it would be necessary for him to also cultivate [[fast bowlers]] as devastating as Lillee and Thomson.  When the [[Indian Cricket Team]] toured the West Indies in 1976, Clive Lloyd tested his new plan of attack, relentlessly getting his fast bowlers such as [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Andy Roberts]], [[Michael Holding]], and [[Colin Croft]] to bowl short-pitched or [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]]s to Indian batsman. While playing at [[Kingston, Jamaica]] the Indian team declared on a second-innings lead of 12, after the management decided that they would rather not risk sending their bowlers such as [[Bishen Singh Bedi]] to face the fearsome fast bowling.  Convinced of the effectiveness of pace bowling as an instrument to success, Clive Lloyd's team departed to their [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1976|Tour of England in 1976]]. England Captain [[Tony Greig]]'s infamous [[Tony Greig#"I intend to make them grovel"|"grovel" comment]] is shown in its entirety, and the effect it had on galvanising the team is described. After some highly aggressive fast bowling against the English batsmen, West Indian fast bowling is seen as being dangerous to the game. However, the West Indians feel that if the Australians could do it, so could they. [[Viv Richards]] is shown as dominating the Test series as a [[batsman]], where he scored 829 [[run (cricket)|runs]] in four [[test cricket|tests]] with two [[Double century|double-centuries]]. Viv Richards' refusal to be intimidated by fast bowling is also seen as the ideal way for a batsman to deal with West Indian bowling.  The documentary then describes the struggle with their board for better pay, and how [[Kerry Packer]] eventually enticed the team to participate in [[World Series Cricket]] in 1977. [[World Series Cricket]] turns out to be a fore-runner of changes in cricket that only became permanent in the 1990s; such as coloured kits, day/night matches, and a greater emphasis on professionalism in play. The West Indian team emerges from the tournament fitter, stronger, and with a more professional outlook to the game.  The 1982 [[South African rebel tours#West Indian tours, 1982–83 and 1983–84|Rebel Tour]] to [[Apartheid]]-ruled [[South Africa]] is described. [[Colin Croft]] chooses to go, earning him a life ban from the [[West Indies Cricket Board]]. The main target of the regime, however, is international superstar [[Viv Richards]]. Richards states that he was offered "a [[blank cheque]]", but decided to not go as it would validate the state-sponsored racism pursued by the South African Government at the time.  It ends with a description of the [[West Indian cricket team in England in 1984|West Indies' tour to England in 1984]]. With the emergence of fast bowling greats such as [[Joel Garner]] and [[Malcolm Marshall]] to take the place of Croft, the West Indies becomes unstoppable. After [[Gordon Greenidge]]'s innings of 214 not out at [[Lord's]], the West Indians become an unstoppable force; defeating England 5-0 in the five-test series. In a turn on the regular term "[[Whitewash (sport)#Cricket|Whitewash]]" to describe such a win, the series was instead dubbed [[Blackwash]].  The documentary ends with a description of how the West Indians earned the respect, admiration, and love of cricket fans and even opposing teams from across the world. As the end credits roll, [[Michael Holding]] describes how between February, 1980 to March, 1995; the West Indies Cricket Team did not lose a single Test series. (it was preceded by the  controversial [[West Indian cricket team in New Zealand in 1979–80|West Indies tour of New Zealand in 1979–80]])

Helped by her three friends, Nam follows the advice of the guidebook ''Nine Recipes of Love'', which supposedly has the magical power to win affection from the boy of choice. The nine steps require Nam to beautify herself by switching her glasses with contacts, wearing teeth braces, and whitening her skin, as well as secretly leaving a chocolate cake inside Shone's motorbike, though all of them seems futile in attracting his attention.

Soon enough, the story that an elderly man going to school becomes national headlines. Mr. Kipruto (Kunene), a superintendent of the school district, is alerted to the situation and strongly disapproves of Maruge's predicament and suggests that he go to an adult educational facility.  Meeting with the head of the education board to plead Maruge’s case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution. Jane later decides to offer him a reprieve, to work as her teaching assistant. As Maruge's story gains publicity and attention, the local press descend on the school, causing friction among the parents. The villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children.

For Colored Girls
  Each woman is represented by a color: Jo Bradmore represents red, Tangie Adrose represents orange, Yasmine represents yellow, Juanita Sims represents green, Kelly Watkins represents blue, Nyla Adrose represents purple, Crystal Wallace represents brown, and Rose represents pink. Additionally, the characters of Alice Adrose, who represents white, and Gilda, who does not represent a color, were made specifically for the film.  The film opens with the nine main characters reciting a poem of their inner thoughts ("Dark Phrases"). Kelly arrives at Tangie's brownstone to see Crystal about the safety of her children. At that time, Juanita arrives to leave her lover, Frank, a potted plant and telling him that she is breaking off their affair ("No Assistance"). Kelly attempts to speak with Crystal's children on how they ended up in the hospital, but is unsuccessful when Crystal's alcoholic boyfriend, Beau Willie, kicks her out. Crystal's nosy neighbor and apartment manager, Gilda, informs Kelly of Crystal's situation ("A Night with Beau Willie Brown") and reveals she was the one who called her. Meanwhile, Alice, Tangie's mother, shows up to beseech Tangie for money, but gets rebuffed instead.  Alice goes out to raise money, and encounters Yasmine, who gives her a little money. Yasmine is boasting to the girls in her dance class about Bill, a man she met on the subway, and agrees to a date, despite her initial hesitance. One of Yasmine's dance students, Nyla, is talking with the girls about her graduation night and losing her virginity ("Graduation Nite"), and later begins to vomit.   Juanita is waiting in Jo's office at Robe Rouge, a fictional magazine company. Crystal shows up for work, having been running late and informs Jo that her 9 o'clock appointment has arrived, despite it already being 10 o'clock. Juanita is then allowed in to interest Jo in giving some money to a non-profit organization that specializes in women's health care, but is rudely rebuffed.  Kelly is with Donald, her partner, at the gynecologist, who informs Kelly that she cannot have children due to scarring in her fallopian tubes caused by an untreated STD. So, Kelly runs off without an explanation. Juanita is at the hospital giving advice on safe sex to women when Frank comes along to ask for forgiveness, but Juanita refuses to give in to his advances. Tangie, who works as a bartender, finds a married man on business and offers to show him a "good time." That same night, Crystal implores Beau Willie to stop drinking, while he only cares about marrying her to increase his welfare benefits. At a restaurant, Jo leaves a voice message on her husband's, Carl, phone, imploring him to call her.  At that same restaurant, Yasmine and Bill have a date night together, recalling a story about her love for Latin dances ("Now I Love Somebody More Than"). Alice comes home to her apartment and it's revealed that Nyla is Alice's daughter and Tangie's sister. Alice gives Nyla the feeble amount of money she made, under the belief that it's for Nyla's college application fees. Meanwhile, Yasmine is walking home from her date with Bill, explaining that she loved dance more than anything until she met Bill ("Now I Love Somebody More Than" <small>cont.</small>).  Tangie takes the married man home with her to sleep with him, but angrily kicks him out after she learns that he thought she was a [[Prostitution|prostitute]]. Nyla shows up to ask Tangie for money, explaining that she needs it for college, but Tangie is not fooled. She then deduces that Nyla is pregnant, but Nyla denies this. Tangie relishes in the fact that Nyla isn't so perfect after all and that Alice will hate her the way she hates Tangie. She then tells her about the time she got pregnant and reveals where to find a back-alley abortionist.  Jo waits impatiently for Carl to return home and it's then revealed that Carl was the man Donald had arrested earlier. The couple then get into an argument about Carl investing into a failed company with Jo's money, which Carl did because he felt emasculated as a man, who is not providing and forfeiting his right to do anything in favor of submitting to Jo's will. Donald returns to his and Kelly's apartment where Kelly then reveals how she got her STD. She explains that long before she was married, she and two of her friends had been seeing the same man and all contracted a disease from him ("Pyramid"). Despite this, Donald reveals that he still loves Kelly regardless of her condition. Juanita drives home to see Frank waiting for her on the stoop. He seduces her into letting him stay at her apartment.  The next day, Jo receives flowers from Carl and calls him to thank him. He reveals that he got tickets to the opera, which he hates, as an apology for last night's argument. During this conversation, he is clearly looking at other men desiringly. Yasmine also receives flowers, from Bill, and is visited by Tangie, who came by to pay the three hundred dollars for Nyla's college fees. She rudely informs Yasmine that Bill only wants to "fuck her," then offers to pay for Nyla's fees, but Yasmine reveals that the dance class is free.  Tangie realizes that Nyla went to see the abortionist, Rose ([[Macy Gray]]), who is terrifying, and probably drunk. Nyla's mind completely goes blank during the abortion as Rose tells her of a story about her life in Harlem ("I Used to Live in the World"). Yasmine excitedly invites Bill into her home for dinner. After some light flirting and some drinking, Bill removes his clothing and savagely rapes her. Jo and her husband are at the opera, watching a performance of ''La Donna in Viola'' (an Italian, operatic version of "Pyramid"). During the performance, Jo watches as her husband cruises another man.  The next day, Jo informs Crystal that she does not have her list of advertisers in her folder and has a very important meeting soon. Crystal offers to take the train to her building, but Jo tells her that'll waste time and offers to drive her there in her limo. Seeing the male driver in the car, Beau Willie believes Crystal is having an affair and the abuse begins, which can be heard in Gilda's house as she watches the kids. She tries to calm their fears by telling them a story about how she met her first husband ("Toussaint").  Beau Willie takes the children from Gilda's to show that he can be a good father and asks Crystal to marry him once again. After she refuses, Beau Willie becomes violent and dangles the children over the fifth-story window, giving Crystal an ultimatum. Gilda frantically runs out into the street and screams for help as Jo, Juanita and several on-lookers witness Beau Willie drop the children to their death ("A Night with Beau Willie Brown" <small>cont.</small>).  Donald interrogates Yasmine at the hospital on her rape, where he informs her that it'll be difficult to press charges as she tells him that women can be raped anywhere by anyone ("Latent Rapists"). At the same hospital, Alice frantically comes in search of Nyla, who passed out in the streets after her abortion. Nyla is being interrogated by Renee and Kelly, and gives them and Alice a vivid detail of her abortion ("Abortion Cycle #1"). Kelly leaves the room to find Crystal screaming in horror at the realization of her children's brutal murder as she is being comforted by Gilda, Jo and Juanita. After being informed of the situation and recognizing Crystal, Kelly becomes visibly upset.  Alice confronts Tangie in her apartment and after a physical altercation, they reveal to each other that Tangie was raped by her grandfather, Alice's father, causing Alice to take her to the abortionist where Alice supervised her, whereas Nyla was unsupervised. Alice reveals that her father took her virginity and was given to a white man at fifteen to have children. All these events explained why Tangie is the way she is ("One" <small>cont.</small>). After kicking Alice out of her apartment, Gilda comes into her house to put ice on the bruise on Tangie's face. She explains that Tangie and mother make a lot of sense before telling her a detailed account of Tangie's exploits ("One" <small>cont.</small>). Tangie believes that Gilda has been snooping again through the wall, but Gilda reveals that she was once like Tangie.  Juanita comes home to find Frank gone and assumes he has left again, but he soon comes home with Chinese food and sees that Juanita is upset, despite trying to appear to be happy and is asked to hold her. Carl comes home to find Jo distraught and reveals what happened with Crystal, stating that she never once knew she was abused and wondering what kind of person she was. Jo and Carl embrace as she sobs into his shoulder. Alice and Nyla return to their apartment where Alice tells her to pray for forgiveness. As Nyla prays, Alice attempts to exorcise her with ashes and hot oil, hurting Nyla. Nyla freaks out, fights off Alice and then runs away to Yasmine's apartment, hoping to find some comfort. However, Yasmine is too traumatized from her rape to answer the door, so Nyla leaves.  Kelly is waiting outside the brownstone as Crystal comes out with a pail and a brush to wash away the blood of her children. Kelly walks up to her and Crystal asks if she's awake, to which Kelly, who is speechless, nods her head. Crystal comments that she does not feel awake and thinks that this is what death must feel like. Nyla passes by and Kelly takes her into Crystal's apartment to wash her up. Hearing Tangie bring in yet another suitor to her apartment, Nyla confronts her. Tangie kicks her suitor out after he asks her to invite Nyla for a threesome. Tangie and Nyla hash out their problems, before Tangie reveals that her life is complicated and she's still learning from her mistakes ("No More Love Poems #4"). Afterwards, Tangie and Nyla reconcile.  Yasmine is practicing an interpretive dance ("Sechita") as Kelly discovers that Crystal has swallowed an entire bottle of pills. Crystal is taken to the hospital as Yasmine is visited by Donald, who has informed her that Bill has been murdered after attempting to rape another woman. She goes into the morgue to look at his body one last time, before slapping him and then leaving. Juanita informs Kelly, Nyla, Tangie and Gilda that the doctors pumped Crystal's stomach and can see visitors as soon as she stabilizes.  That night, Kelly is unable to sleep, feeling guilty for not taking Crystal's children away sooner because she had to see the doctor about her infertility. Donald reassures her that one thing has nothing to do with the other. Juanita comes home with a birthday cake for Frank, only to find that he is not home and his clothes are gone. Juanita vents her frustration to her women's health class ("Somebody Almost Walked Off Wid Alla My Stuff") as Crystal is released from the hospital and goes into therapy. Jo gives Juanita a check for her non-profit organization, Beau Willie is sent to jail, and Nyla returns to dance class with Yasmine.  Tangie knocks on Crystal's door to invite her to Nyla's going away party. Crystal initially declines, but says she'll go if she feels up to it. Tangie begrudgingly invites Gilda, both finally having an unspoken, mutual respect for each other. Juanita finally breaks things off with Frank for good ("No More Love Poems #1"). Gilda comes by Crystal's apartment to see if she's eaten, which she hasn't. Crystal is still wondering how Beau Willie could do such a thing, but Gilda tells her that she also needs to take responsibility for not leaving Beau Willie sooner, and tells her that she needs to get out of the apartment.  Jo confronts Carl on his homosexuality, which he angrily denies at first but Jo tells him that she was not oblivious to the way Carl looks at other men. After venting his frustrations over Jo's controlling nature, he then admits that he has been sleeping with other men and tells her that he's sorry. Jo, however, tells him that she is not accepting his apology, having heard him apologize many times before ("Sorry"). Jo then reveals that she is [[HIV]]-positive from Carl's exploits and tells Carl to leave when she gets back home.  At Nyla's going away party, all the women gather to celebrate.

Fortress of War
 The film opens on Saturday, June 21, 1941. Sasha Akimov, a 15-year-old musician, and his older brother, Andrey, whose parents were killed in the [[Spanish Civil War]], are serving in the 333rd Rifle Regiment of the [[Red Army]] at the [[Brest Fortress]]. Elsewhere, a [[commissar]], Yefim Fomin, discovers he is unable to bring his family to Brest due to a shortage of train tickets. Another officer, Gavrilov, continues to express concern about the readiness of the fort's defenses should an attack come, despite warnings from his friend, officer of the [[Military counterintelligence of the Soviet Army|NKVD Special Department]] Lieutenant Vainshtein, about an imminent war with Germany. That evening, the fortress loses power due to [[Brandenburgers|German commandos]].  The next morning, at 3:58, German forces [[Operation Barbarossa|invade the Soviet Union]]. The fortress is subjected to heavy bombardment by German artillery and [[Stuka]] aircraft, killing many Soviet soldiers and civilians. At 6:30, German infantry attack the fortress, capturing hospital staff and patients [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|many of whom they kill]]. Fomin takes command of the defenders around the [[Kholm Gate]], while Gavrilov rallies the defenders around the Eastern Fort. Elsewhere, [[Soviet Border Troops|NKVD border guards]] under command of Lieutenant Kizhevatov, repel a German sortie into the fortress and Vainshtein thwarts a German commando's attempt to undermine the defense of the [[Internal Troops#History of the Soviet Internal Troops|132nd Independent NKVD Convoy Battalion]] barracks. As the siege commences, Sasha finds himself stranded in one of the barracks. During the fighting for the East Fort, Junior Lieutenant Andrey Akimov (brother of Sasha) is killed while destroying two [[Panzer III]]s with an anti-tank gun, helping Gavrilov repel a German attack.  By the end of June 22, the Soviet defenders are divided into groups: one force under Fomin defending the Kholm Gate, a second force under Gavrilov defending the Eastern Redoubt, while Kizhevatov defends the 9th Frontier outpost, along with a group of civilians and Vainshtein holds on to the barracks of the 132nd NKVD Battalion. The next day, fighting continues for the fortress and Sasha makes it to the Kholm Gate. An [[Polikarpov I-16|I-16]] Soviet fighter aircraft of the 123rd Fighter Aviation Regiment is shot down over the fortress and the pilot is rescued by Fomin's men. He reveals that the Red Army is retreating toward [[Minsk]] and Fomin realizes that the men must leave the fortress or die.  On June 24, Sasha leaves the Kholm Gate to alert the other pockets about Fomin's plan for a breakout. While Sasha finds the 132nd has been overrun and Vainshtein dead, he manages to deliver the message to Kizhevatov and Gavrilov. That night, a breakout is attempted by all three remaining groups but is driven back by the Germans, suffering heavy losses. The next morning, realizing he can't properly defend them, Kizhevatov reluctantly orders the surviving civilians (including his own wife and daughter and also Sasha) to vacate the fortress during a cease-fire.  On June 26, the Germans drop a two-ton bomb<ref>High-explosive bomb [[List of weapons of military aircraft of Germany during World War II#High explosive|SC 1800 "Satan"]]</ref> on the fortress, causing massive damage. The Germans quickly move to eradicate the surviving pockets. The defenders at Kholm Gate are forced to surrender and Fomin is [[Commissar order|immediately executed]] by a German firing squad, as a Jew, a communist and a commissar. Gavrilov orders his remaining men to attempt to break out individually. Kizhevatov and his surviving men manage to regroup in the barracks; Sasha returns to meet them there. After ordering Sasha to take the regimental colors and remember the truth about the defenders, Kizhevatov takes a machine gun to cover his men while they attempt a breakout. The breakout fails and the remaining defenders, including Kizhevatov, are killed as Sasha manages to escape. It is later revealed that Gavrilov was captured on July 23, 1941, but survived captivity. Kizhevatov and Gavrilov were later declared [[Heroes of the Soviet Union]], while Fomin is also decorated with the [[Order of Lenin]].

Four Lions
 A group of radicalised young British Muslim men aspire to be suicide bombers. They are Omar ([[Riz Ahmed]]), who is deeply critical of [[Western world|Western]] society and imperialism; his dim-witted cousin Waj ([[Kayvan Novak]]); Barry ([[Nigel Lindsay]]), a bad-tempered and extremely rash white convert to Islam; and the naive Faisal ([[Adeel Akhtar]]), who tries to train crows to be used as bombers. While Omar and Waj travel to an [[Al Qaeda]]-affiliated training camp in [[Pakistan]], Barry recruits a reluctant fifth member, Hassan ([[Arsher Ali]]). The training trip ends in disaster when Omar attempts to shoot down an American drone and accidentally destroys part of the camp; the pair are forced to flee. However, Omar uses the experience to assert authority on his return to Britain. Omar and Waj don't trust Hassan when they first meet him at the airport, but Omar decides to keep him in the plan because if he kicked Hassan out of the plan he'd have to murder him to stop him from telling the police.  The group begins acquiring materials used to make the explosive [[TATP]] but disagree about what to target. Barry wants to bomb a local mosque as a [[false flag]] operation to "radicalise the moderates", but Omar considers this idiotic. Faisal suggests blowing up a branch of the pharmacy chain [[Boots UK|Boots]], but Omar states it is a not a worthwhile target. Omar's brother visits him and tries to talk him out of doing anything violent, however Omar and his wife mock him for keeping his wife in a small room and squirt him with water pistols, making him flee. Barry, Faisal and Waj blow up Omar's microwave while fireworks are going off and leave Hassan to guard their [[safe house]]. Omar berates Barry for doing this because he thinks that Barry is being watched by the police, but they discover Hassan dancing with an oblivious neighbour ([[Julia Davis]]). The group suspect they have been compromised and transport their volatile explosives to a new location in grocery bags. Faisal trips up while crossing a field and is killed in the explosion. This angers Omar, who berates the others and leaves. Faisal's head is found and Omar visits the others to tell them. They reconcile, and Omar decides to target the upcoming [[London Marathon]] due to having access to mascot costumes, which they use to conceal the explosives.  They drive to London in their costumes and prepare to attack. Waj expresses doubts about the morality of their plot, but Omar convinces him. A police officer approaches the group and they talk to the officer. As he is walking away, Hassan loses his nerve and tries to alert him, but is killed when Barry detonates his bomb remotely. The remaining three panic and run away, and the police start searching for them.   Omar has a change of heart, feeling guilt about manipulating the easily led Waj into dying for a cause he doesn't understand, and attempts to prevent the attack. Police snipers receive Omar's description and shoot at him as he attempts to blend in with the runners, but mistakenly kill a bystander in a similar costume instead. Waj is cornered by police in a [[kebab]] shop and takes the staff hostage and Omar contacts Waj from his mobile phone and convinces him to let most of the hostages go except for one. Barry finds Omar and attacks him and swallows the phone's [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]]. However, Barry begins to choke on it, provoking a passer-by to carry out the [[Choking#Abdominal thrusts|Heimlich manoeuvre]] and in the process detonate his bomb, killing them both as Omar flees.  Omar attempts to buy a phone to talk to Waj, but leaves the shop. Omar spots a coworker and borrows his phone. He attempts to talk Waj down, but his call is interrupted when the police charge in and kill a hostage whom they mistake for Waj. Confused, Waj detonates his bomb, killing himself and the officers. Distraught, Omar walks into a pharmacy and blows himself up. In an epilogue, it is revealed that the police later arrested Omar's innocent brother as a terrorist; that they deflect responsibility for shooting the bystander; and that Omar unknowingly killed [[Osama Bin Laden]] when misfiring his rocket in Pakistan.

From Paris with Love (film)
 A personal aide to the U.S. ambassador in France, James Reese ([[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]]) has an enviable life in [[Paris]] and a beautiful French girlfriend, but his real passion is his side job as a low-level operative for the CIA.  Reese wants to become a higher level agent with more responsibilities.  As the result of a shortage of agents in France, he is assigned as a partner to secret agent Charlie Wax ([[John Travolta]]).  Reese's first test is to have Wax released from airport detention by the [[Directorate-General of Customs and Indirect Taxes|French Customs]] when Wax does not want to surrender the cans of his favorite [[energy drink]].  Despite the apparent triviality of an energy drink that Wax could probably purchase in [[Paris]], Wax continues to verbally abuse French Customs until Reese places a Diplomatic Mail sticker on Wax's luggage containing the energy drink, which makes them [[diplomatic immunity|immune]] from [[customs]] and [[quarantine]] requirements.  Once in the car, Wax apologizes for his behavior while opening the tins and revealing the concealed pieces of his personal [[SIG Sauer P226#P226 X-Five|SIG Sauer P226 X-Five Lightweight]], which he refers to as "Mrs. Jones".  Wax explains that he has been sent to Paris to investigate a drug ring at least indirectly responsible for the death of a woman who happens to be the niece of the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].  During the investigation, Wax reveals that there was no overdose—their goal is to trace the money back to a circle of Pakistani terrorists.  Evidence leads them to the terrorists, resulting in an armed confrontation in which most of the terrorists are killed. Wax and Reese learn that the terrorists plan to infiltrate the U.S. embassy with explosives hidden beneath their [[Burqa|burkas]]. As they collect evidence, they find photographs of Agent Reese pinned to a wall.  Ultimately, Reese learns that the terrorists are targeting a summit meeting.

When confronted, Caroline shoots Reese in the shoulder and escapes through a window. A Volvo picks her up on the street below.  Caroline attempts to detonate an explosive vest while the last remaining terrorist in the Volvo attacks a US motorcade traveling to the summit by speeding towards them, wired with explosives. Wax destroys the vehicle with an [[AT4]] rocket launcher just in time. Reese finds Caroline at the summit and attempts to dissuade her from carrying out her mission by professing his love. She attempts to detonate her vest anyway and Reese is forced to kill her.  As Wax leaves Paris, Reese escorts him to his plane.  Wax offers a full-time partnership. The two play a game of chess on the tarmac, placing their handguns on a utility cart, Reese revealing that he is now carrying a [[Desert Eagle]] pistol and earning another modicum of admiration from his new partner.  
Free Willy: Escape from Pirate's Cove
 Australian teenager Kirra is sent to stay with her grandfather, Gus, in his run-down amusement park in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] after her father was hospitalized for six weeks. Upon arrival, Kirra is met at the airport by Mansa, one of her grandpa's employees. Kirra is initially unhappy about leaving her father, but she eventually makes friends with a boy named Sifiso.  After a fierce storm, a baby male orca was separated from his pod, and became stranded in a lagoon on Gus's property. The next morning, Kirra discovers the animal and names him Willy. Willy proves to be a big hit amongst the park visitors. However, Kirra is concerned about Willy, who is not eating due to stress. Kirra sets herself a mission to take care of it. Kirra tries very hard to get Willy to eat a fish, and finally succeeds after talking to him about her parents.  Gus' competitor Rolf Woods learns about the new attraction at Gus' park, and offers to buy Willy for $500,000, but no deal is made. After much perseverance, Kirra persuades Gus to call the marine rescue center for help in rehabilitating Willy back into the sea. However, Willy had under-developed [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] skills and is unable to survive without his pod, thus making him unsuitable for rehabilitation. Not one to give up, Kirra does much research on how to train Willy to use his echolocation skill, despite being told that there is no known method to do so. She then tries to feed Willy blindfolded, but fails many times.  Rolf, desperate for Willy, hatches a plot to poison Willy to get Gus to sell it at a cheaper price. After his plan fails, Rolf denies all knowledge of the plan, though he offers to buy Willy again.  Kirra then camps out by the lagoon to keep Willy calm after the failed plot. Willy suddenly wakes her up, pulls her into the water, and lets her ride him. After that, Kirra and Willy become a double-act at the park, attracting many reporters and cameramen. The money earned from this publicity is then used to fund the fishes needed for Willy's echolocation training. After many tries, Willy learns to use his echolocation, and manages to catch live fish swimming in the lagoon. In the meantime, Rolf returns to tempt Gus with a lower offer for Willy. Faced with a mounting food bill, Gus agrees to sell Willy to Rolf at 500,000 dollars, and insists the exchange take place after Kirra's departure.  Mansa makes an underwater recording device to record Willy’s sounds, hoping to use the sounds to locate Willy's pod. Despite working hard for days, they do not produce any results. One day, Sifiso invites Kirra to go to his Uncle Rudy's safari park to take her mind off Willy. On their way back, they see a billboard advertising Willy as a new attraction to Rolf's theme park. The pair then hurries back, but was too late as Gus had already signed the agreement to sell Willy. Kirra is heartbroken, and makes Gus promise to make sure that Rolf takes good care of Willy. Later, when Kirra goes down to the lagoon, she sees Willy’s pod. However, Gus does not believe her account.  Kirra and Sifiso go to seek Uncle Rudy's help with their plan to put Willy back into the ocean. However, he is not around, but the two steal a crane truck and drive it back to Pirate's Cove. Later, Gus agrees to help them get Willy back into the ocean if his pod can be found. Kirra and Sifiso then head for the harbour with Willy, while Gus and Mansa stay to distract Rolf, who was on his way over. Eventually they find Willy's family, and Willy is reunited with them. Kirra later jumps into the water to bid Willy farewell.  On the day of Kirra's departure, she says goodbye to Mansa and Sifiso at the airport, and agrees to come back next summer. As she gets on the plane, Gus wipes away a tear. Kirra smiles as she takes a final look on Cape Town. Meanwhile, Willy and his pod swim off into the ocean depths.  
Freeway Killer (film)
 [[William Bonin]] ([[Scott Anthony Leet]]) recollects his life to Ruth Slobod ([[Debbon Ayer]]), the mother of one of his victims, on [[death row]].  The flashback sequence begins with Bonin inviting two hitchhikers for a ride in his Chevy van, charming them into his confidence. Once he has them in his power, he murders one young man and reveals an alliance with accomplice Vernon Butts ([[Dusty Sorg]]). Soon, Bonin stalks Kyle Peterson ([[Cole Williams]]), a timid teenager who works at a local shop. Initially planning to kill him, Bonin becomes intrigued when he learns Kyle has homicidal fantasies, and offers that they bond to take what they want. Bonin begins to harden him by getting him to boldly blow off a date with his girlfriend, Lisa.  Bonin introduces him to Butts, and they show him their "family album" of murders. Taking him under his wing, Bonin "trains" Kyle to give in to his violent impulses, and eventually guides Kyle into committing his first murder. Unsatisfied, Bonin embarks on a hunt for more young men, taking Kyle with him.  Later, Bonin visits his [[alcoholic]] mother ([[Eileen Dietz]]) who is lonely after parting with Bonin's father, against whom she holds contempt. She also regrets abandoning Bonin, and tells him he should hate her. That night, Butts, who resents having been replaced by Kyle as Bonin's protegé, tells Kyle about Bonin's [[homosexual]] experiences in the [[U.S. Air Force]]. Butts states that Bonin has a sickness that makes him think he controls the world, which sends Bonin into a frenzy. Later that night, when Butts [[self-harm|harms himself]], Bonin reconnects with him. After Kyle sees this, he distances himself from the two of them. Bonin tries to contact Kyle, who won't answer his phone.  The next day, Bonin kills two more victims on the freeway. He searches for more accomplices and soon recruits William Pugh ([[Thomas Curtis (actor)|Thomas Curtis]]). This is short-lived after he kills another young victim and Pugh flees, horrified. Bonin looks for Pugh at his house only to discover from his father ([[James Babson]]) that he is in police custody for trying to steal a car. Bonin also learns that police are onto the freeway killer and spots a mysterious car observing him while listening to the news reports on the radio.  He makes a stop at a newsstand to pick up the ''[[Orange County Register]]'', and begins talking to an older man, whom he suspects to be a police officer. Bonin, frustrated, returns home and finds the same mysterious car is stalking his home. He tries to contact Butts, but he won’t pick up. Bonin accosts Kyle at night after work, and attempts to convince him to throw off police by committing "one last murder". Kyle refuses, however, and takes off with Lisa in his new car.  While driving, Bonin becomes aware of a car following him, but still picks up a teenage hitchhiker. Bonin promptly has a nervous breakdown, frightening the hitchhiker into departing his vehicle, but Bonin stops him and strangles him with a tire iron and his victim's own T-shirt. Shortly after, a rescue team arrives on the scene to arrest Bonin. As he is taken into custody, he realizes that Detective St. John ([[Michael Rooker]]), whom he saw at the newsstand, was the one watching him after all. Officers also track down and arrest Kyle. In the interrogation room, Bonin admits to St. John that he committed most of the murders by himself, but that Butts was his accomplice for the later crimes; Butts is arrested, and hangs himself in jail. St. John then confronts Bonin with his psychiatric profile, which reveals that he had been neglected by his mother and [[child sexual abuse|molested]] by his grandfather.  Reverting to the outset of the film, Ruth suspects that Bonin is simply using her for company, and that he knows nothing about her son. Before she leaves, however, Bonin makes up a story about killing Ruth's son to protect Kyle, the actual murderer.  Ruth vows to witness his death, and later attends his execution while carrying a picture of her son.

Friendship!
 Berlin 1989: After the fall of the Berlin wall, Veit (Mücke) and his friend Tom (Schweighöfer) decide to fly to [[San Francisco]]. Veit claims that he wants to travel to San Francisco because of the [[Golden Gate Bridge]] which is "The westernmost point in the world." Tom is also fascinated by the idea and goes there with his friend.  Because the money they have saved is not quite enough they both book a flight to New York.  Arriving there with only 55 dollars, a few clothes and some self-made films, Tom learns the real reason for Veit's desire to travel to San Francisco: Veit's goal above all else is to see his father again, who 12 years ago fled from the GDR and whose only sign of life is an annual birthday postcard.   Veit wants to wait in front of the post office in San Francisco on his birthday - to meet his father when he sends the annual birthday card to him.   They decide to travel further by hitch-hiking, because the remaining money would only buy them a train ticket to New Jersey.  A comic book graphic artist named Daryll takes them both in his AMC Pacer in the direction of San Francisco. Daryll brings them both to a bar where they can show their film in the hopes of earning a little money.   They meet two young girls who invite them to their house. Because the parents come back earlier than expected, Tom and Veit have to leave the house in a hurry and spend the night in the wilderness.  The next morning they get a free breakfast in a diner. Then Veit brings one of the customers - a biker - the wallet which he had forgotten on the table. The gang of bikers takes the two to the West. However, during a rest a fight starts between Veit and a drunk biker. Tom is injured in the teeth as he tries to get between them. Another biker Hope loans Veit and Tom his brother's car, under the condition that they deliver it to Hope's brother near San Francisco. The biker also tells them that he has no key for the trunk. Despite the suspicions of the two that they could be carrying drugs or weapons, they accept the offer. Actually, there are pieces of ''Star Wars'' merchandise in the trunk. The boys only discover this when they were stopped by the police who forcibly open the trunk.  In [[Silver City, New Mexico]], they got to know Zoey, who speaks German thanks to her German mother and at whose place they spend two nights. In the local cinema, they show a documentary about the DDR and are subsequently invited to meet the Mayor. In the town they sell painted pieces of concrete as supposedly authentic pieces of the Berlin Wall so that they can pay for necessary repairs to the car.  At last the trio drives in the direction of San Francisco. At a stopover in [[Las Vegas]], Veit and Tom go to a gay club in Russian army clothes to strip in order to earn money for Tom's necessary dental treatment. While Veit waits in the hotel room for the other two, Tom spends the night with Zoey. This angers Veit, since he is in love with her too, and he drives off alone. Tom has a bad conscience and finally leaves Zoey, and it is unclear if the two will see each other again.  Tom and Veit meet again in front of the San Francisco post office and reconcile. While Veit has gone to get them a pizza, Tom believes he recognizes Veit's father, who is walking to the post office with a postcard in his hand. As a result, Tom speaks to him. After an initial hesitation, the stranger explains that he is not Veit's father, who was shot on the wall as he tried to escape.

They are eager to take one last run down the mountain before they go home; however, the ski resort decides to close early because a storm is moving in.  The friends convince the ski lift attendant to let them on one last time. Before the group gets all the way to the top, the attendant is called into the boss's office and is replaced by a co-worker. As he leaves, he tells the co-worker that there are only three skiers left. Another set of three skiers comes down the mountain. When he sees them, he shuts down the ski lift, stranding the three friends in their ski lift chair far above the ground.  They take it as a joke, but the ski resort's lights are then turned off, leaving the three friends in fear and shock. Parker knows the ski slopes have closed for the week. Dan feels he has no choice but to jump from the ski lift chair and get help, as they will not survive up there in the bitter cold until Friday.  After discussing the danger, Dan decides to jump off the lift. Upon hitting the ground, he suffers a [[compound fracture]] on both of his legs. Soon, his screams and the scent of blood attracts a pack of wolves. Joe, now fearing for Dan's safety, decides to try to get to the ground by traversing the suspension cable between the lifts and [[steel]] support tower. However, as wolves close in on Dan, he returns to the chair and holds Parker as Dan is brutally torn apart by the wolves.  In the morning, Parker awakes with her hand frozen on the bar, which she grabbed during her sleep. She is also suffering severe [[frostbite]]. Joe discusses his previous life experiences with her, before attempting to traverse the ski lift cable, and onto a support pole on the other side. By doing this, he also causes the chair Parker is sitting in to dangerously loosen from the cable. After scaring off a pair of wolves by using a ski pole, he slides down the mountain on Parker's snowboard, planning to return with help. The wolves give chase after him. Joe never returns and Parker spends the night alone on the loose cable.  The next day, Parker begins to climb out of the lift, but the screw comes loose and causes the lift to fall. Blocked by a cable, the lift is hanging a few meters above the ground. Parker jumps and then the lift lands on her ankle. Injured, she begins to slide and crawl down the mountain. She encounters the wolves feasting on Joe's mutilated corpse. Too occupied with Joe's corpse, they ignore her as she continues down, eventually crawling to a nearby road.  The first car that passes doesn't see her but soon a minivan appears and the driver, seeing her outstretched body lying in the snow along the side of the road, stops to assist her. The film ends with the driver saying they are going to a nearby hospital, followed by Parker closing her eyes.

Garo: Red Requiem
 Kouga Saezima travels to a city from his childhood after receiving orders to hunt down the Horror Karma, an ancient female Horror who is one of the infamous Apostle Horrors. By that time, Karma's followers, Kurusu and Shion set up base in a gothic club called Crime to satisfy their mistress's appetite by bringing her various girls and lure them into her realm with false promises of making their dreams a reality. As Kouga arrives, ignoring the memories he has of it, a Makai Priestess named Rekka also arrives in the city and aids a pair of Makai Priests named Akaza and Shiguto in saving a baby from a Horror posing as a mother. However, Kouga arrives and reveals the "baby" to be a Horror that Zaruba identifies as the cannibalistic Apostle Horror Babel. Though Rekka meddles in the fight, Kouga managed to kept her aside before donning his armor and slaying Babel. As he leaves, Kouga is approached by Akaza as he introduces him and his associates to him and Zaruba. When Kouga reveals his mission to find and destroy Karma, Rekka reveals having a personal vendetta against Horror and refuses to allow anyone to rob her of her chance to kill the fiend. However, Kouga and Zaruba are unable to find Karma despite the evil presence they are feeling around the city.  The following day, Kouga find Rekka playing her flute, a Madou Brush, and learns how Rekka became a Makai Priestess so she can hunt Horrors. But Kouga reminded her that Horror-hunting are the duties of Makai Knights, not hers as a Makai Priestess; Rekka argued that's only a rule for their convenience as they are no female Makai Knights. But Zaruba argued the Makai Knights were created because the Makai Priests alone are incapable of handling the Horrors. As Rekka walks off after sealing Zaruba's mouth after finding him irritating, her intentions remind Kouga of his time training under a Makai Knight named Kengi. Deciding to find leads on Karma, Kouga arrives to Akaza's shop for aid. However, the Makai Priests have no clue on Karma's location yet mention Karma being impossible to kill by conventional means and the only way to effectively defeat her is to enter the demon mirror, which can only be done unassisted through suicide. The only way to safely enter Karma's realm and return alive is through the use of a Demon Sword of Rubis, which Akaza happens to have one. Leaving the blade to Akaza until he finds Karma's lair, Kouga watches Rekka practice before being forced to defeat her to prove that she lacks the ability to back her intentions. Later at night, Kouga traveled around the city before Zaruba senses Shion as she was about to deliver Karma another victim. Realizing, Shion is forced to discard the woman to escape the Makai Knight. Tracking her down to Crime when Karma devoured another woman, Kouga and Zaruba find a barrier erected around the club. As soon as Kouga found the barrier talisman and destroyed it, Rekka appears and confirms that someone betrayed them as the barrier is the work of a Makai Priest.  Once inside, as Kouga looks around, he finds Shion luring Rekka to Karma using the image of Rekka's Makai Knight father. But before Rekka could fall for the Horror's trick, Kouga shatters the mirror. However, Karma enters a round mirror as Shion spirits it away with Rekka in pursuit. Kouga is forced to fight Kurusu, who enables Karma to forcefully control some of the patrons into fighting Kouga and Rekka. As Rekka knocks the possessed humans unconscious without hesitation in her pursuit to his dismay, Kouga cracks the mirror to break Karma's hold on the humans. With no one left to hold their enemies off, Kurusu assumes his true Horror form to overpower Kouga and Rekka. When Kouga attempts to don his armor, Shion pointed the mirror at him as Karma sucks the Garo armor into her dimension. Without his armor, Kouga is severely injured in his attempt to keep Rekka from being devoured by Kurusu. However, Akaza and Shiguto arrived with an army of shikigami ninja to drive the Horrors off. After the battle, Rekka forces Akaza to admit he betrayed them as Kouga tries to stop her from killing him. Kouga is brought to the shop to have his wounds treated, having a dream of the last time he saw Kengi, Rekka's father.  Coming to, Kouga explains to a guilt-ridden Rekka of what he learned from Kengi and how by keeping her alive, many others will be saved by her hands some day. Soon after, after unintentional encouragement by Zaruba, Kouga finds Akaza and learns that Karma exploited the man's desire to see his dead wife and daughter and was given a mirror that allowed him to see his loved ones once again, in return for allowing her to feed incognito. Although he knew that was only an illusion, he could not bring himself to toss away the mirror and intends to accept the consequences of his actions. Taking the Demon Sword of Rubis from Akaza to prevent him from going on a suicide mission, Kouga intends to regain his armor. With one of her young Makai Dragons returning with the location of Karma, Rekka, Kouga, and Shiguto arrive to the building that the Horrors are hiding in without knowledge that they are walking into a trap. The three are joined by Akaza, who wishes to redeem himself. After the Makai Priests seal the building so the Horrors' evil aura would not spill outside, Kouga and the others search for Karma while dealing with numerous phantoms created from her many victims. As Kouga fights for his life against Kurusu, Rekka kills Shion before finding Karma's mirror and alerting the others to her location.  Finding Shion dead again and remembering his old life as a human before he sold his soul to Karma and became a Horror, a rage-filled Kurusu arrives to stop Rekka as Kouga arrives. But Rekka succeeds in using the Demon Sword of Rubis to open a gateway, with all three entering the gateway for a final battle while Shiguto sets up a barrier outside the room to ensure no interference from the phantoms. Once inside, as Kurusu reveals his original form before assuming his Horror form, Kouga dons the Garo armor and destroys Kurusu with ease. Forced to deal with Garo personally, Karma changes the battle field as she assumes an enlarged harpy-like fighting form as she attempts to offer Garo immortality for his undying loyalty. The odds of the battle was stacked heavily against Garo until an astral projection of Akaza delivers Rekka's flute which she had dropped earlier before entering the mirror realm, telling her to play it to summon the spirits of the fallen Makai warriors that Karma devoured. Briefly reunited with Kengi, Rekka watches as her father and other spirits give Garo the power to destroy Karma. Returning to their world, Kouga and Rekka learned that Akaza sacrificed his life for his spirit to enter Karma's realm just so to deliver the flute. Soon after, staying behind to look after the city and Shiguto, Rekka gives Kouga a young Makai Dragon if either needs to contact the other for help. On their way back to their territory, thinking up a name for the young Makai Dragon, Zaruba decides to call it "[[List of Garo characters#Kaoru Mitsuki|Kaoru]]", much to Kouga's annoyance.  
Gandu (film)
 The movie is set on the life of an unnamed protagonist Prateek Chutiya ([[Anubrata Basu]]) who is called Gandu by most who address him in the movie (an Indian slang/swear word that would literally translate to 'of the ass', the English translation running in the subtitle translates it to the English 'Asshole'). Gandu is portrayed as a frustrated teenager whose state of mind is shown by intercuts of him rapping in Bengali (it is later revealed in the movie that the protagonist is a member of a rap band). Gandu's mother ([[Kamalika Banerjee]]) seemingly supports the family through the magnanimity of her 'lover' Dasbabu (an unvoiced character who appears frequently) Gandu's mother and Dasbabu ([[Silajit Majumder]]) are shown having graphic sex a number of times. Gandu himself is shown repeatedly sneaking into the room of the copulating couple to steal money from Dasbabu's wallet. Gandu seemingly has complex emotions regarding this stealing and takes care to hide from his mother .  Gandu is also apparently quite lonely. His choice of hairstyle (shaved nearly bald) and general proclivity to drugs and rap makes him an object of ridicule in front of most of his peers, who mock him as 'an Egglike Gandu'. His loneliness is dispelled when he literally bumps into Ricksha ([[Joyraj Bhattacharjee]]), a cycle rickshaw driver, who slaps Gandu and then scares him off by a bizarre show of Kung Fu (it is later revealed that Ricksha literally worships Bruce Lee and models himself on his idol) That night Gandu has a dream of himself and Ricksha in a near naked embrace (this has led to the common perception that Gandu and Ricksha share a homosexual relationship but the movie itself never shows this explicitly and it maybe a more symbolic element)  On one of his stealing missions, Gandu's mother sees him and hides him from Dasbabu and seemingly laughs in complicity. This causes Gandu great anguish and he curses in frustration. His mother comes naked and then knocks on his door. He is late in responding and she slaps him angrily and walks away.  Gandu urges Rickshaw to 'take him away' Ricksha and Gandu then go off to consume [[Datura stramonium|Dhatura seeds]] which causes them both to go on a strange and extremely intense trip. When they come to their senses they find they have no money. In a meta narrativistic scene the director Q himself drives into the scene and Gandu is told by Ricksha how Gandu is a character in a movie being shot by Q. Gandu cannot quite comprehend this.  Gandu comes back to [[Kolkata]] to find that he has won the Bhutan State lottery of fifty thousand rupees; then he gives his mother some of the money and goes on a crack binge with Ricksha. Ricksha then admonishes him for never having actually sleeping with a woman despite incessantly rapping about vagina and sex. Gandu then has a surrealistic and very explicit sex scene (the only colour part in the movie and the reason being this is the only colorful/worthwhile moment in his life) with an unnamed hooker ([[Rii Sen]]), who constantly meows (symbolizing a 'pussy' i.e. female's genital in slang term) and at the end of coitus she whispers 'demo' to him. Gandu and the hooker have very erotic sex, which has been very boldly shown. Gandu goes back to Ricksha telling him how he will now record a demo of his rap and show it to ADF (Asian Dub Foundation) The movie closes with Gandu finally becoming successful.  The film is shot mostly in black and white stressing on the bleak existence of the protagonist. At the end of the movie, the film shifts to the color mode (the reason being his life shifts from the dull black and white phase to an adventurous colorful happy life).  Gandu also ponders on the meaning of life and what we must do with it.

The Ghost Writer (film)
 A British [[ghostwriter]] ([[Ewan McGregor]]) is hired by the [[Publishing|publishing firm]] Rhinehart, Inc., to complete the autobiography of former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] Adam Lang ([[Pierce Brosnan]]). His predecessor and Lang's aide, Mike McAra, has recently died in an apparent drowning accident. The writer travels to Old Haven on [[Martha's Vineyard]], [[Massachusetts]], where Lang and his wife Ruth ([[Olivia Williams]]) are staying, along with Lang's personal assistant (and implied mistress), Amelia Bly ([[Kim Cattrall]]). Amelia forbids the writer from taking McAra's [[Manuscript format|manuscript]] outside, emphasising that it is a security risk.  Shortly after the writer's arrival, former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] Richard Rycart ([[Robert Pugh]]) accuses Lang of authorising the [[extraordinary rendition|illegal seizure]] of suspected terrorists and handing them over for [[torture]] by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], a possible [[war crime]]. Lang faces prosecution by the [[International Criminal Court]] unless he stays in the US (or one of the few other countries that does not recognise the court's jurisdiction). While Lang is in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], the writer finds items in McAra's room suggesting he might have stumbled across a dark secret. Among them is an envelope containing photographs and a phone number the writer discovers is Rycart's.  During a bike ride, the writer encounters an old man ([[Eli Wallach]]) who tells him the current couldn't have taken McAra's body from the ferry where he disappeared to the beach where it was discovered. He also reveals a neighbour saw flashlights on the beach the night McAra died, but later fell down the stairs and went into a coma. Later, Ruth admits to the writer Lang had never been very political, and until recently always took her advice. When he tells her the old man's story, she suddenly rushes out into the rainy night to "clear her head." Upon returning, she reveals Lang and McAra had argued the night before the latter's death, and the ghost writer and Ruth have a [[one night stand]] while Adam is away.  The next morning, the writer takes the [[BMW X5 (E70)|BMW X5]]<ref>2009 BMW X5 xDrive30d [E70] in The Ghost Writer, Movie, 2010 http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_325926-BMW-X5-E70-2009.html</ref> McAra used on his last journey. Unable to cancel the pre-programmed directions on the car's [[Satellite navigation|sat-nav]], he decides to follow them. He arrives in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] at the home of Professor Paul Emmett ([[Tom Wilkinson]]). Emmett denies anything more than a cursory acquaintance with Lang, despite the writer showing him two pictures of the pair among photographs found in McAra's possessions, as well as another on the wall of Emmett's study. When the writer tells Emmett the sat-nav proves McAra visited him the night he died, Emmett denies meeting McAra and becomes evasive. The writer leaves, and successfully eludes a car that is pursuing him. He boards the ferry back to Martha's Vineyard, but when he sees the pursuit car drive aboard, he flees the boat at the last moment and checks into a small motel by the ferry dock.  With no one else to turn to, the writer redials Rycart's number, asking for help. While waiting, the writer does research on Emmett and links his [[think tank]] to a [[Arms industry|military contractor]]. He also finds leads connecting Emmett to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. When Rycart arrives, he reveals McAra [[News leak|gave him]] documents linking Lang to so-called "torture flights," where terrorist suspects were placed on private jets owned by Emmett's company, to be tortured while airborne.  Rycart further claims that McAra found new evidence, which he wrote about in the "beginning" of the manuscript. The men cannot, however, find anything in the early pages. The writer discusses Emmett's relationship with Lang, while Rycart recounts how Lang's decisions as Prime Minister uniformly benefited US interests. When the writer is summoned to accompany Lang on his return flight by private jet, he confronts Lang and accuses him of being a CIA agent recruited by Emmett. Lang derides his suggestions.  Upon leaving the aircraft, Lang is assassinated by a British [[Anti-war movement|anti-war]] protester, who is in turn shot by Lang's bodyguards. Nevertheless, the writer is asked to complete the book for posthumous publication, as in light of Lang's death it will be a certain best-seller. Amelia invites him to the book's launch party in London, where she unwittingly tells him the Americans tightened access to the book, as the "beginnings" contained evidence threatening national security. She also tells him Emmett, who is in attendance, was Ruth's tutor when she was a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholar]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]].  The writer realizes the clues were hidden in the original manuscript in the opening words of each paragraph, and discovers the message: "Lang's wife Ruth was recruited as a CIA agent by Professor Paul Emmett of Harvard University." He concludes Ruth shaped Lang's every political decision to benefit the USA under direction from the CIA.  The writer passes a note to Ruth revealing his discovery. She unfolds the note, and is devastated. When she sees the writer raising a glass, she is kept from following him by Emmett and other assistants. As the writer leaves the party he attempts to take a taxi, without success. As he crosses the street off-camera, a car accelerates in his direction to an impending collision. As witnesses react in horror, the pages containing McAra's manuscript are blowing in the wind, leaving the writer's fate unconfirmed.

Shinpachi and [[List of Gin Tama characters#Elizabeth|Elizabeth]] are ambushed by the assassin [[List of Gin Tama characters#Nizo Okada|Nizo Okada]], a previous antagonist known to the Yorozuya as Nizo the Butcher, who claims to have killed Katsura, showing them the hair he cut off. Gintoki comes to protect Shinpachi and Elizabeth but is overwhelmed by Nizo and the Benizakura, which is revealed to be no ordinary cursed sword. Before Nizo lands another fatal hit on Gintoki, Shinpachi slashes off one of Nizo's arms, forcing the latter to retreat when people started to gather at the commotion.  Meanwhile, Kagura, with the help of her pet [[Inugami]] [[List of Gin Tama characters#Sadaharu|Sadaharu]], finds hints of Katsura's whereabouts in a ship owned by the Joi terrorist group Kiheitai led by Gintoki and Katsura's former ally, [[List of Gin Tama characters#Shinsuke Takasugi|Shinsuke Takasugi]]. After the Kiheitai subdues Kagura, it is revealed that Nizo is one of them and that Murata Tetsuya has been acting as an accomplice in hopes of perfecting the Benizakura, which they had been mass-producing as a bioweapon. While Gintoki is recovering from his wounds, Murata Tetsuko reveals her brother's intentions and requests him to stop her brother. Shinpachi and Elizabeth discover Kagura's location through Sadaharu, with Shinpachi infiltrating the ship to save Kagura while Elizabeth leads Katsura's faction to attack the Kiheitai. While under attack, Takasugi slashes at Elizabeth only to be attacked by Katsura who has been hiding in the ship disguised as another Elizabeth. In the middle of the chaos between the two factions, Katsura blows up the factory and destroys all the remaining Benizakura, save for the one Nizo holds. Katsura wishes to confront Takasugi once again with Kagura and Shinpachi aiding him, facing off against two of the Kiheitai's core members: [[List of Gin Tama characters#Matako Kijima|Matako Kijima]] the gunslinger and [[List of Gin Tama characters#Henpaita Takechi|Henpeita Takechi]] the strategist, respectively.  Testuko gives Gintoki a new sword she created to battle Okada on their way to the Kiheitai's ship. Despite not having fully recovered yet, Gintoki manages to stay on par with Nizo's enhanced skills due to the latter's body suffering great stress from the Benizakura. Even as the Benizakura exerts Nizo's body to strengthen itself, Gintoki eventually overpowers Nizo as stated by Tetsuya that "the life or death confrontation [may have] awakened memories of battle that lay dormant inside of [Gintoki]." Nizo is eventually consumed by the Benizakura and goes berserk, interrupting Shinpachi and Kagura's respective battles. As Shinpachi, Kagura and Tetsuko try to save Gintoki from Nizo, Tetsuya sacrifices his life to protect his sister, realizing the error of his ways. Having briefly recovered, Gintoki uses Tetsuko's sword to finish off Nizo and destroys the Benizakura.

God of Love (film)
 Raymond Goodfellow rides on a country road on his motor scooter.  His voice over explains, “You can’t control who you love.  You can't control who loves you.  You can't control where it happens, or when it happens, or why it happens.  You can't control any of that stuff.”  The film flashes back to three months earlier to Ray’s time as a confident, self-centered lounge singer/dart thrower.  Ray’s band consists of his friends Fozzie (guitar), Frank (stand-up bass) and the “love of his life” Kelly (drums).  Before he joins the band onstage, Ray prays to God asking him for assistance in getting Kelly to love him.  Despite Ray’s ongoing affection to her, she seems drawn to Fozzie who, claiming he's genuinely uninterested, is rejecting Kelly’s advances.  After Ray’s crowd pleasing performance, he is informed by the bartender that someone has left a package for him.  The package contains “love darts.”  The instructions for the darts explain that when someone is poked with love dart they are immediately attracted to the first person they see.  This attraction lasts for  6 hours.  At the end of the 6 hours if the love is meant to last it will, but if the love wasn't meant to be, it won’t.  Ray tells Fozzie about the darts and they both agree to have a test run.  While the band walks home from a gig, Ray throws a love dart catching a prissy [[New Jersey|Jersey Girl]] named Angela.  The first man she sees is Ray’s  quiet, low-key bandmate Frank.  Just as the instructions promised, Angela falls in love with Frank immediately.  Ray and Fozzie follow the new couple around.  After exactly six hours, Angela appears to still be in love with Frank and Ray declares the darts “effective.”  Ray enlists Fozzie’s help in creating the “most romantic six hours” ensuring that Kelly will remain in love with Ray after the love dart’s initial power ends.  Fozzie is able to offer several tips, knowing a surprising amount about Kelly and the things that are important to her.  Ray goes to Kelly’s house and strikes her with a dart.  As promised by the dart’s instructions, she immediately falls in love with him.  They go on their date which goes perfectly.  Towards the end of the six hours they kiss.  When the six hours end, Kelly looks uncomfortable, thanks him for the evening, and leaves.  It is clear that the love from the dart did not last.  Ray consoles himself by poking one woman after another until he has a whole flock of women (and one man) who are completely in love with him for six hours.  During this time all he can do is talk about getting Kelly to fall in love with him again.  He even contemplates convincing her that she has diabetes so she has to poke herself with the love darts over and over again.  The love darts wear off and he is alone again, ready to try his last dart on Kelly one more time.  Walking home from another gig with his band, Ray prepares for his final throw at Kelly.  Moments before throwing the dart he realizes that his loyal friend Fozzie is really in love with her and that she is really in love with him.  Instead of striking Kelly with the dart, he hits Fozzie right as he looks up at Kelly.  The two instantly fall in love with each other.  A wiser and less self-centered Ray returns to his apartment.  He finds another mysterious box outside his apartment with a note that says “nice work.”  He opens the box and finds [[Cupid]]’s bow and arrow.  The film flashes forward to three months in the future at the point the film began.  The band continues but without Ray; Angela is the new singer.  Frank & Angela and Fozzie & Kelly are still very much in love.  Ray is many miles away driving on his motor scooter on the country road his bow and arrow tied to his back.  He repeats “you can’t control who you love, or who loves you.”  He ends by saying that love doesn’t make sense.  He knows all this because “I am the God of Love.”

Six months later Erin is doing well with her career, having written her first front page story, and Garrett has not been with any woman since Erin. He quits his job and starts managing The Boxer Rebellion, the first band he and Erin saw together. He sends Erin tickets to their show and she goes, not knowing that he is the manager. She runs into him there and he tells her he has moved to Los Angeles. Since that is only a few hours away from San Francisco, they have another chance at a relationship. Late that night they go back to Corrine's house, and interrupt Corrine and Phil [[non-penetrative sex|dry humping]] on the dining-room table (like Garrett and Erin earlier in the film). The film ends with Erin's niece, Maya, descending from upstairs during the awkward moment, and they all scream "Maya! Statue!" (a running joke where Corrine always yells "Maya! Statue!" at her daughter to quiet her and make her stop moving around).

Gohine Shobdo
 Nura is a street beggar. During [[Bangladesh liberation war|1971 liberation war]] in [[Bangladesh]] his one leg became useless and paralyzed. The [[Razakars (Bangladesh)|Razakars]] anti-liberation forces attacked him, making him a crippled man. But as a father he is extraordinary. He begs in the street in rain and sunshine to make his dream a reality — to educate his daughter Swapna. She is a university student.  Nura took part in the liberation struggle against the [[Pakistan Army]]. His attitude to life is different. He does not regret over his poverty, rather he enjoys begging as he sings in his mother-tongue [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. He feels that Bangladesh would not have been liberated if he had to speak and sing in [[Urdu language|Urdu]]: an alien language for him.  On the other hand, the Talukder family is rich and well educated. The senior Talukder was a pioneering personality in [[photojournalism]] starting from the [[Bengali Language Movement|language movement of 1952]] to the 1971 liberation war. These are all now historical documents. But nobody is happy in this family. The senior Talukder tries to implant progressive ideas to his grandchildren because the present generation are not aware at all of this liberation struggle. At the same time, the anti-liberation forces try to exploit the liberation war in their won interests. Niloy — a scion of this family — is in contrast with the poor Swapna, the university student daughter of Nura the beggar. Niloy fell in love with Swapna listening to her songs while preparing for the [[Bengali New Year]] celebration. He proposes to her.  Swapna tries to convince him that this is rather impossible as they are poles apart. She tells him her parents are almost starving to educate her. Led by impulse, Niloy vows to marry her — saying he would go deep down her heart, explore the dark resonance of her heart, and marry her. But Niloy is defeated before the reality of life: He can never accept the fact that his would-be father-in-law is a street beggar. He escapes from life, escapes from her, fleeing to another country.  The film ends with a song where an eminent singer arranges a concert for the beggars. They circle around and move singing with lamps in their hands. The life cycle is complete. Occasionally the life cycle is disturbed but it never stops. Human beings like Swapna start a new life, and the life cycle begins again.

She has become obsessed with the story of a recent spate of serial murders committed in the area, and scours newspapers for stories about each victim. The latest victim is a co-worker who last spoke of a blond, muscular man she met at the bar, and with whom she had a drink after she got off work at midnight.  Louise's wheelchair-bound neighbour, Spencer, shares her interest to a point but values his privacy and solitude.  When Victor, an awkward and talkative elementary school teacher, moves in to their apartment complex, he ingratiates himself into their lives and attempts to strike up a friendship, which they reluctantly accept.  Louise, who prefers the company of her cats to humans, warms to Victor when he reveals that he is also a cat owner.    When their abusive Francophone neighbor Valérie poisons Louise's cats, Louise spends more time at Victor's apartment, though she requests alone time with his cat.  Victor, who has developed a crush on Louise, invents an imaginary love life with her and tells his friends that they have become engaged, though Louise denies any romantic feelings for Victor when Spencer probes her.  When Spencer dispassionately reveals to Victor that he was paralyzed in a car accident that killed his wife, Spencer  rejects Victor's sympathy and later reacts angrily when Victor installs a wheelchair-accessible ramp in the building.  During the cover of night, Spencer sneaks out his window and climbs the fire escape, secretly enjoying the city's nightlife.  During one of his secretive outings, one of Victor's friends spots him, though Victor dismisses the possibility that it could be Spencer.  Louise uses sensationalist media reports to plan the murder of Valérie.  After seducing Victor, she collects his sperm and uses it to give the impression that Valérie has been raped.  On the way back to her apartment, holding evidence of her guilt, she runs into Spencer, who has gone out for a nighttime jog; caught in compromising positions, the two awkwardly acknowledge each other without asking any questions.  Curious about the noise, Victor looks out his window and sees Spencer, whom he begins to suspect is the serial killer.  Following a dinner party, where the three cautiously probe each other for information, Spencer outright suggests that Louise and he frame Victor for the deaths.  At the same time, Victor proposes that Louise and he set a trap for Spencer.  Louise agrees to both plans.  As Spencer breaks into Victor's apartment, the police rush to his help, and Spencer flees to the fire escape toward Louise's apartment.  Worried for her safety, Victor confronts Spencer, and Spencer falls to his death; Louise disinterestedly ignores the conflict as she feeds Victor's cat, whom she has adopted.

Green Zone (film)
 On [[2003 invasion of Iraq|March 19, 2003]], Iraqi General Mohammed Al-Rawi ([[Yigal Naor]]) flees his residence amid the bombardment of [[Baghdad]]. Before leaving the compound, he passes a notebook to his aide Seyyed, instructing him to warn his officers to get to their safehouses and wait for his signal.  Four weeks later, [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Warrant Officer (United States)|Chief Warrant Officer]] Roy Miller ([[Matt Damon]]) and his platoon check a warehouse for [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraqi weapons of mass destruction]]. To Miller's surprise, the warehouse has not been secured, with looters making their way in and out, as soldiers from the [[101st Airborne Division]] are too few to do much. After a firefight with a sniper, Miller finds that the warehouse is empty, the third consecutive time he has found nothing. Later, at a debriefing, Miller brings up the point that the majority of the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intel]] given to him is inaccurate and anonymous. High-ranking officials quickly dismiss his concerns. Afterward, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA agent]] Martin Brown ([[Brendan Gleeson]]) tells him that the next place he is to search was inspected by a [[United Nations|UN team]] two months before and that it too has been confirmed empty.  Meanwhile, [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] official Clark Poundstone ([[Greg Kinnear]]) welcomes returning Iraqi exile politician Ahmed Zubaidi (Raad Rawi) at the airport. There Poundstone is questioned by ''Wall Street Journal'' reporter Lawrie Dayne ([[Amy Ryan]]). She says she needs to speak directly to "Magellan", but Poundstone brushes her off.  Meanwhile, while checking another unpromising site, Miller is approached by an Iraqi who calls himself "Freddy" ([[Khalid Abdalla]]). Freddy tells him that he saw some [[Ba'ath Party]] VIPs meeting in a nearby home. They include Al-Rawi and his officers and aides in Baghdad, who are discussing the current situation. Al-Rawi decides to wait for the Americans to offer him a deal, and attack if they don't. As the meeting ends, Miller and his men burst into the house. Al-Rawi narrowly escapes, but Seyyed is captured. Before Miller can extract much information, Seyyed is taken away by [[Joint Special Operations Command|Special Operations]] personnel - however, Miller keeps Al-Rawi's notebook. Dayne complains to Poundstone again, but he states that the stakes are much larger than her role in selling newspapers.  Miller goes to Brown's hotel room in the [[Green Zone]], where he tells him what happened and gives him the notebook. Brown arranges for Miller to get into the prison where Seyyed is being interrogated. Miller is then approached by Dayne, who questions him about the false reports of WMDs. Miller bluffs his way in to see Seyyed. Near death after being tortured, he tells Miller that they "did everything you asked us to in the meeting." When Miller asks what meeting he is talking about, he says one word: "Jordan." Miller then confronts Dayne about the bogus intel she published, but she refuses to identify Magellan, her source. After Miller tells her he suspects that Al-Rawi is Magellan, Dayne reluctantly confirms that Magellan met with a high-ranking official in February in Jordan.  Miller realizes that Poundstone's men are hunting Al-Rawi, and can think of only one reason: Al-Rawi confirmed there was no Iraqi WMD program and is now a major liability. Poundstone confiscates the notebook from Martin; it contains the locations of Al-Rawi's [[safe house]]s. When Miller tries to arrange a meeting with Al-Rawi, he is abducted by Al-Rawi's men following Poundstone's announcement of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2|decision to disband the entire Iraqi army]]. Al-Rawi tells Miller that he informed Poundstone that the WMD program had been dismantled after the [[Gulf War|First Persian Gulf War]]; Poundstone, however, reported that Al-Rawi had confirmed there were WMDs so the US government would have an excuse to invade. Poundstone's men attack the locations listed in the notebook. When they get to the general's hiding place, he flees, ordering one man to kill Miller. Miller manages to kill his captor and races after Al-Rawi. Miller finally captures Al-Rawi, but Freddy suddenly appears and shoots the general, telling Miller that "the fate of Iraq is not yours to decide". With his only witness against Poundstone now dead, Miller tells Freddy to flee.  Later, Miller writes a scathing report. He confronts Poundstone in a meeting and gives him the report, but Poundstone dismisses it, telling Miller that WMDs do not matter. Poundstone then rejoins the meeting, only to see Iraqi factional leaders reject Zubaidi, the US's choice as leader of Iraq, as an American puppet and storm out. Afterwards, Dayne receives Miller's report by email. The recipient list includes reporters for major news agencies around the world.

 Florence Marr ([[Greta Gerwig]]) walks the Greenberg family dog, Mahler. She picks up Phillip Greenberg's dry cleaning and heads back to his house, where the entire family is packing for a trip to Vietnam. Phillip ([[Chris Messina]]) explains that his brother, Roger, will be staying in the house while they are away, and he asks Florence to help Roger if he needs anything. His wife, Carol (Susan Traylor), confides that Roger has just been released from a hospital after suffering a nervous breakdown.  Roger is a carpenter and has been hired by Phillip to build Mahler a dog house. It is implied throughout the film that Roger actually does little work, and Carol is skeptical about him actually finishing the project.  When Roger ([[Ben Stiller]]) arrives, he calls Florence to ask about the people swimming in the pool. Florence explains that they are neighbors who are allowed to use the pool. She comes to the house to pick up her paycheck and feed Mahler. She has a very brief and awkward conversation with Roger, before offering to pick up groceries for him. He gives her a two-item list, requesting whiskey and ice cream sandwiches.  Roger's friend Ivan Schrank ([[Rhys Ifans]]) stops by and invites him to a barbecue at the home of their mutual friend Eric Beller ([[Mark Duplass]]). At the party, Roger is uncomfortable, and Eric is visibly hostile towards him. He runs into Beth ([[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]), an ex-girlfriend, and she agrees to meet up with him for some drinks. He explains that he is in [[Los Angeles]] to simply do nothing for a while. She replies that it is brave for a man in his mid-forties to have no ambition.  Meanwhile, he calls Florence to meet up for a drink. Since as a New Yorker, he does not drive, she picks him up. They stop at her apartment to pick up her purse, which she forgot. Roger comes on to her, and they begin to have sex. Having just come out of a long relationship, Florence stops Roger, not wanting to have meaningless sex.  Eric and Roger have dinner, where Eric vents his anger over the fact that Roger declined a major label recording contract that their band was offered fifteen years ago. Eric marvels over the fact that Ivan will even talk to Roger anymore, given how devastated Ivan was by losing the contract. Roger insists that conforming to the commercial contract would have been impossible for the band.  One day, Roger notices that Mahler is lethargic. He calls Florence to take them to a vet, where they learn that the dog has an [[auto-immune disease]]. Roger did not want to get involved with Florence, but as they encounter each other during Mahler's treatment, they keep escalating their relationship, with Florence falling hard for Roger.  When Roger meets up with Beth for drinks, it is her turn to be uncomfortable. She barely remembers their relationship; whereas, he remembers the most minute details from their time together. Roger muses, to Beth's astonishment, that they would have probably gotten married and had kids. When Roger asks her out on a date, she says it would be a 'terrible idea' and abruptly asks for the check.  After Florence and Roger finally have sex, they end up in an argument, where he yells at her for always coming back to him, despite the fact that he does not want to get involved. The next day, Roger remorsefully calls her, and Florence is getting drunk in her apartment alone. She confesses that she is due to have an abortion the next day. Roger convinces her to let him take her to the clinic. Since he does not drive, Ivan has to drive Roger and Florence to the clinic. She undergoes  [[general anaesthesia]] and stays in the clinic overnight.  Back at the house, Roger's college-age niece, Sara ([[Brie Larson]]) has turned up. She is heading to Australia the next morning with her friend, Muriel ([[Juno Temple]]), and they throw a house party with dozens of their friends. Roger does drugs with the kids. Ivan shows up and gets into an argument with Roger, where his hurt feelings over the record contract come up. Roger confesses that he had no idea that his personal concerns about the contract would put a stop to the entire deal, and he admits to feeling an immense burden of guilt over it. Both Ivan and Roger bemoan the fact that they have ended up in lives that they did not plan to have; however, Ivan has made peace with his. Before leaving he tells Roger that he had heard from Florence that Roger had been hospitalized, which Roger had never brought up. Having had a similar experience he laments he could have helped him and in disgust says that they never talk about anything good or meaningful. Dejected, Roger ends up calling Florence's phone and leaving her a long voice mail where he confesses that he really likes her.  The next day, Roger's niece invites him to Australia, and he jumps at the invitation. He convinces the neighbors in the pool to take care of Mahler, but on the way to the airport, he changes his mind. Instead, he goes to pick up Florence at the hospital, and they return to her apartment. The film closes as she listens to Roger's voice mail.

Everyone fearfully takes off, and a still paralyzed Wiley gets his foot impaled by the arrow.  
Gulliver's Travels (2010 film)
 Deeply depressed at his [[dead-end job]] in the mail room of a [[New York City]] newspaper, [[Lemuel Gulliver]] decides to talk to journalist Darcy Silverman. He convinces her he could write a report about his (false) extensive world "travels" saying his dream is to become a writer. After suffering [[writer's block]] and thinking that Darcy will not want to hang out with a "guy from the mailroom", he [[plagiarism|plagiarises]] a report from other publications on the [[internet]]. The next day, Darcy, impressed by his writing, presents Gulliver with a new task – to travel to the [[Bermuda Triangle]] and write an article about the legends of ships mysteriously disappearing there.  Upon arrival in [[Bermuda]], Gulliver rents a boat and travels into the triangle. After falling asleep at the helm of his ship, he's caught in a freak storm and the boat is overwhelmed by a [[waterspout]]. He washes up unconscious on the shore of [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliput]], where he is immediately confirmed as a "beast" by the town's tiny people. After the citizens claim him to be dangerous because of his huge size, he is captured and imprisoned in a cave. Here, he meets another prisoner named Horatio who was jailed by General Edward because he loves Princess Mary of Lilliput, whereas Edward also wants her. After the island across from Lilliput, Blefuscia, infiltrates commandos to kidnap Princess Mary, Gulliver manages to break free of the plough-machine he is forced to work and then rescues the princess from being kidnapped. Gulliver also saves her father, King Theodore from a [[fire]] by urinating on it.  Gulliver is declared a [[hero]] by Lilliput's citizens and makes up a deal of lies saying he is the President of Manhattan, says [[Yoda]] is his Vice-President and a living legend in his homeland. Edward, however, becomes enraged due to the luxurious accommodations that have been built for him, and even being presented as an honorary [[general]] of the Lilliputian Army complete with uniform. When the townspeople find Gulliver's boat and his things, Gulliver gets angry [[voicemail]]s from Darcy, saying she has to take his place and travel to Bermuda now, and also found out about his plagiarism and now hates him. The next day, chaos ensues as the Blefuscian Navy lay siege on the city when Edward shuts down its defense system as an act of revenge for Gulliver's treatment. Gulliver defeats the armada, invulnerable to the [[Round shot|cannonballs]] being fired at him (although he receives numerous welts on his stomach). Embarrassed once more, and with Mary no longer wanting to do anything with him, Edward defects to the Blefuscians and brings with him blueprints of a robot coming from Gulliver's ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock|Guitar Hero III]]'' game manual. The Blefuscians secretly build the robot, with Edward as the [[Mecha|pilot]].  The Blefuscians invade Liliput and the robot-wielding Edward makes Gulliver admit to the people that he is "just the guy from the mail-room" and nothing more. Edward banishes Gulliver on the shores of "the island where we dare not go" ([[Brobdingnag]]). There, he is snatched up by a "little" girl ([[Glumdalclitch]]) who towers over him. She captures him easily by trapping him inside a glass cup. When Gulliver wakes up, he finds himself dressed up in a pink dress and is played with by the "little" girl, which ends with him being tucked in bed. Horatio, who has gone to find Gulliver after being spurned by Mary, reveals to Gulliver that Darcy has been imprisoned by the Blefuscians when she is lost in the Bermuda Triangle in the same manner as Gulliver. Gulliver narrowly escapes with him, using a [[parachute]] that he took from a dead [[U.S. Air Force]] pilot sitting in the [[dollhouse]].  Once again accepting a duel from Edward, this time not only for Lilliput's freedom but for its fate as well – as Edward threatens to destroy it should Gulliver fail – Gulliver ultimately defeats him with the assistance of Horatio, who disables the machine's electrocuting weapon. Horatio is hailed a hero and gets King Theodore's permission to court the princess. Edward, reaching the point of insanity, threatens to kill the princess, but the princess, finally having enough of Edward, beats the traitor up in frustration. Gulliver then helps to make peace between the rival island-nations by reciting [[Edwin Starr]]'s "[[War (Edwin Starr song)|War]]" and he, along with Darcy, return to [[New York City]] on their repaired boat. The film ends with Gulliver, now a travel writer, taking Darcy to lunch while holding hands, after returning from another travel assignment.

Growth (film)
  In 1989 on Cuttyhunk Island, scientist Mason Lane used microscopic parasites to advance human evolution. The experiment resulted in stronger, smarter, healthier humans, but something went wrong and three quarters of the island's residents died.  20 years later, a man pursued by police through the woods. As he reaches the shoreline, the writhing of a tiny parasite is seen beneath his skin. Trapped, the man dives into the ocean. As the police arrive at the shore, they hear a scream and see the man's remains disintegrating in the ocean.  Teenagers Jaimie Ackerman ([[Mircea Monroe]]), (daughter of the scientist who spearheaded the project), Kristen, Marco, and Justin, take a boat ride to Kuttyhunk Island. Their lodge is shown to be occupied with another couple who wake up to find their daughter infected with parasites only to be consumed by them as well. The group reaches the lodge afterwards with no idea what happened. Kristen decides to run in the morning before encountering a procession of men and women in mourning. She heads back to her lodge under watch by a mysterious figure.  The film cuts to two scientists, one being Dr. Macavire, studying a cadaver that has previously been infected by the parasite, and the male proceeds to explain that the idea came about from medical history. Parasites like tapeworms or leeches were used to control blood or prevent obesity in earlier time periods, but it was only until recently that they were utilized to alter DNA of their hosts. So the male researcher began genetically engineering parasites to help oysters form the most pristine pearls, and once that project was successful, he decided to develop helpful parasites for humans. For a long time, the project saw fruitful results, but then realized that the humans started suffering since the parasites had to feed. He mentions that every parasite’s weakness has been salt and shows by putting one of the human parasites in a solution of salt water. The research is called out by his superiors, one of them being Larkin and one of the parasites in the cadaver exits the corpse and makes its way to the female scientist. After a verbal scuffle with Larkin and his police compatriot, the male scientist returns to see the woman convulsing, causing the policeman to shoot her in the head.  Kristen returns to Justin who is woodchopping and tries it out for herself. Jaimie has more memories of her lodge, remembering her father bringing up the idea to his wife who has some skepticism about the project. Her memories are interrupted by a knock on the door who turns out to be Larkin, and after a minor argument about title deeds, realizes that she will be losing money from her inheritance of Kittyhunk. The film cuts back to the mysterious figure watching Kristen and Justin play a game about truth and lies. Kristen vocalizes her interest in Justin, who at first lies about reciprocating interest before Kristen realizes his ploy. They reach a river and Kristen says if Justin treads water and sees a bird, then he’ll “get whatever he wants.” As he heads out to the river, the mysterious figure is at the other end of the bank, and sends one of the parasites after him.  Meanwhile, Jaimie and Marco find a compartment underneath their mattress and proceed to open it. The film returns to Kristen and Justin, and Justin has already decided to exit the river since it is too cold for him. Right as he puts his hands on the bank, Kristen tells him to look at a bird in the sky, so now they wonder what will happen next. Kristen gives him her jacket to warm him back up, and they make-out. They continue the foreplay until the parasite enters Justin’s heel, and immediately he stops and feels his senses heightening.  The film returns to Jaimie and Marco, and she has a brief flashback as she touches the clown doll she found. Then they watch a VHS clip of Larkin commemorating Mason Lane the scientist, who begins a speech about evolution and progress. There is a thump behind the window to his left, and when Larkin lifts up the curtain, screams from within are heard and part of the glass breaks. Kristen runs back to Jaimie and Marco and tells them something is wrong with Justin. All who attended are evacuated as the VHS changes to another scientist who says the parasites feed on adrenaline and grow within due to their insatiable appetite. The trio return to Justin who is convulsing, and the parasite is seen traveling throughout his body before they pick him up and take him back to his room. Kristen asks specifically about what she saw in his belly, and Marco hastily suggests that it might have just been a muscle spasm. Jaimie gets help from Sarah, and they head to the nearest house to borrow a phone to call a hospital, while Marco takes a bike to the hospital. Jaimie wonders if they are being followed, but still exits the car to knock on the door. She spots the inhabitant inside, but does not realize that the parasites have already consumed him.  Kristen is now playing an accordion while someone outside is watching her. She heads to the bathroom to pretty herself up and the door is broken open to reveal Justin back to full health. They kiss and Justin says, “Round two?” and Kristen says she’ll take a bath as well. Jaimie and Sarah reach another house, but Jaimie again notices the same car parked not too far away, and before she exits the car, Kristen tells them over walkie-talkie that Justin is all better. So they head back; meanwhile, Marco can’t reach anyone over walkie-talkie, and spots a payphone near him. Justin wakes up in the middle of the night, feeling that the ticking of alarm clock is too loud for him. He puts it in a drawer, and walks outside, and feels his eyesight focusing and going out of focus. He hears sounds better now too, as exemplified by hearing a couple having coitus in a cabin or hearing a dog bark far away. He meanders about the woods a bit, which lets one of his parasites detach from one of his calf muscles. He heads back to his cabin and puts in tissues in his ears so the noises don’t bother him as much. He puts his hand down Kristen’s pants, but she says she is too sleepy. Meanwhile, his minion parasite heads up to the cabin of Sarah. Justin puts on clothes and Kristen’s sunglasses before heading to a local bar to get some lady attention. There within, he drinks a bit of whiskey before spotting a target among a group of three. After drinking he picks her up before another man steps to try and break them up. Justin offers to fight outside, and they do. Justin’s heightened abilities enable him to evade and redirect the man and his entourage’s blows, and Justin threatens to throw a chunk of the stone used to make a street before his lady friend stops him from doing so. They make-out and grope before the girl realizes that the parasite is within Justin’s ear, and Justin begins to choke and rip out a part of her neck. Justin wakes up, and wonders whether it was a dream or not. Jaimie comes in with breakfast and they discuss a bit about the wedding of their stepparents. Justin suddenly vomits into the toilet and sees numerous parasites in his vomit.  Kristen has gone for another morning run along the same path she took, but breaks off to find a curious trail. Justin has suddenly become good at woodchopping, and breaks wood in half with his bare hands. He punches a nearby tree and looks down at his hand. Kristen has found a large cemetery of numerous individuals, all dated 1989, and the mysterious figure attacks her, only to be thwarted by her mace. Justin finds a parasite writhing about outside the back of his hand, pulls it out, and returns to woodchopping before encountering Marco who tells him he is planning to ask Jaimie’s hand in marriage. Justin hears screams twice, and runs off in the direction of Kristen. Kristen believes she escaped the man, but the man catches her from behind and shoves the parasite in his mouth down hers. Marco sits with Jaimie, who tells him the financial situation. At that point Larkin and Dr. Macavire ask to see Justin since they traced Kristen’s sunglasses to him by the body of the woman he murdered last night. Jaimie and Marco run away to warn Justin, and infected Sarah looks out to see what has been going on. Justin has found Kristen’s mutilated body as the militia approach him. Justin’s pupils disappear and adopt a singular gray hue as the parasites heighten his body’s abilities. He does quick work of every militia, but not before they gun down Marco. Jaimie was kidnapped by the mysterious figure before she could reach Justin, and Justin returns to his senses as he realizes the manslaughter he committed. He apologizes to Kristen before running away. Dr. Macavire, a policeman, and Larkin appear to murder any infected individuals and kill the larvae with salt. The policeman notices a parasite sliding back up Dr. Macavire’s leg and shoots him promptly.  Jaimie finds herself trapped in the mysterious figure’s house, who reveals himself to be Mason Lane, Jaimie’s father, she has another flashback of him killing his first wife, Jaimie’s biological mother, in order to obtain the antidote against his parasite. Mason explains he developed another formula to keep the parasites he houses at bay in order to retain their ability-enhancing features. Justin is shown to be even further consumed by the parasites, and begins to run. Jaimie manages to escape with an antidote to combat him and alert Larkin. Larkin appears to confront Mason, giving Jaimie time to hit Mason with a part of the antidote and escape. Larkin takes the rest of the formula to hurt Mason, but Mason easily parries his strike and breaks the needle. Jaimie douses Mason in salt water, causing him to disintegrate and release the bevy of parasites within him. Together, Larkin and Jaimie escape the laboratory as the parasites swarm after them.  Larkin reveals that Dr. Macavire was trying to lure Jaimie back to the island with suggestions of inheritance of the island, assuming that Jaimie had carried the antidote with her. Larkin revealed that his ploy about the loss of money was an attempt to get her back off the island. He also reveals that he managed to get Jaimie off the island because that would enable the antidote to not be destroyed by Mason, and that is why Jaimie’s mom died protecting her. They come upon Sarah’s car with Sarah’s head on the horn while her baby is crying. As Jaimie tries to take the baby, Sarah reanimates and shoots a parasite at Jaimie’s hand, which Jaimie promptly removes. Larkin succeeds in strangling Sarah and they return to the car.  Larkin drives her to a boat shack that houses the pearls and salt to deter any parasites. Larkin tells Jaimie to get one of the boats to escape, but at that point Justin emerges to stop them. Jaimie starts getting the boat to leave with the baby, and Larkin tries to confront Justin with salt. He scalds Justin’s right side of his face, before Justin kills him. He starts chasing the boat, but does not notice that Jaimie took a rowboat. Just when Jaimie believes she has escaped, Justin appears behind her on the shoreline, reactivates his human side, and pleads with her not to leave him on the island. Jaimie still escapes without him, and spots a boat far away. She sneezes, and sees larvae in her snot, and so she dunks her hand in the salt water, only to realize her hand is also reactive to the salt and is therefore infected as well. She realizes that she can leave her clown doll, which carried her personal information, with the baby, and jumps into the sea to destroy the parasites. The final clip of the boat is a few days later when a motorboat comes upon the baby and the boat.  6 months later in Seoul, South Korea, a woman enters a jewelry store to try and return a ring she got from her husband. The requirement of a receipt incites anger in her, and she boisterously announces she will return with her husband. Meanwhile, in one of the glass cases, a pearl ring breaks open to reveal a parasite.

Griff hears this and realizes the fact that everything is his imagination. He destroys the costume and all computers he was using in his imaginary world.  He goes to Melody's house for dinner where she realizes Griff no more believes in his imaginary world. Soon afterwards she comes to Griff's home and tells him he was the only one who went into her world and that was the reason she loved him, but now, he also is behaving like normal people, so she can't love him anymore. With saying that, she leaves his house and cries leaning on his door. Suddenly, she falls through the door (as she was seen trying earlier) and lands in Griff's room. Griff takes her into his arms and she utters, "You can believe it." They share a passionate kiss. Soon after, a package falls through the mail slot of Griff's door with Melody's name written on it. Tim is then shown walking away with his new girlfriend. Griff runs into his room to put on his invisible suit, and Melody opens the box. Inside is a note from Tim that says, "Use these to be the only one who can see Griff when he's invisible. So he doesn't have to wear the hat." The device resembles a [[ViewMaster|View-Master]] stereoscopic toy. Griff enters unseen into the room, and when Melody holds up the device to her eyes, she can see him standing there again.

Guardians of the Lost Code
 During a field trip to the history museum, students Freddy, Atzi, and Kimo discover a stone disk called the Codex in a storage room,  and the Brije within it reveal to them that they are the three people chosen to restore the ancestral alliance between humans and brijes, an alliance that was fractured with the emergence of science and technology.  The brijes are magical animal spirits that have been in contact with human beings since the beginning of time. Every human had a brije; the human cared for his brije and vice versa. When the human turned 13, a human shaman taught both partners a bonding technique that allowed them to synchronize and transform into a warrior form, gaining extraordinary strength to perform various acts of heroism.

The Brije in the Codex created and sealed themselves within it to protect the knowledge of the warrior form bonding technique from the forces of darkness that seek it.  To fulfill this mission, the Codex presents the chosen ones with their respective brijes (Hopper, Cloko and Bri) and shows them clues that will lead them to find the missing piece of the same to activate it, all while fighting against the forces of darkness.

Gunless
 In 1878 a hardened American [[gunfighter]] arrives in a small town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, a place that doesn't understand or appreciate the brutal code of the [[American Old West|American Wild West]].  Gunslinger Sean Lafferty ([[Paul Gross]]), known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States.  He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell (Melody B. Choi), he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack ([[Tyler Mane]]), the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men.  When she witnesses this, Jane Taylor ([[Sienna Guillory]]), one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill. Sean proceeds to go with her and stays in a sod house at her farm, alternately working on the windmill and repairing the gun. After a few days, however, the Kid begins to develop feelings toward Jane while also becoming friends with the townsfolk.  In the meantime, a roaming band of American bounty hunters crosses into Canada and heads for the town to claim the price on Sean's head. They terrorize a camp of [[Chinese Railroad Workers|Chinese railroad workers]] to find out his whereabouts.  By now - with the addition of a part repaired by the very blacksmith he intends to duel - Sean has finally fixed Jane's pistol. He proceeds to Jack's smithy to demand the duel, gives Jack the gun, and tells him to draw. However, Sean adjusts his aim so that he is pointing his six-shooter slightly to Jack's left (in a way that his shot will miss the blacksmith), providing an indication that he is done running and may want to die. The Kid tells Jack to pull the trigger, but the gun jams. The Kid takes the gun back from Jack to inspect it, but accidentally sets it off instead, with the ricocheting bullet hitting Jack in the left buttock (replicating the wound that the Kid himself had earlier in the film). After Dr. Angus Schiffron ([[Jay Brazeau]]) removes the fragmented bullet from Jack's buttock, the Kid agrees that he and the blacksmith are now even. He then prepares to leave town.  As the Kid is riding out of town at one end, the bounty hunters are riding in behind him at the other end. They threaten the townsfolk in an effort to get them to turn over the Kid. The townsfolk instead train their rifles and shotguns on the bounty hunters with the intent of defending themselves.

On the bus, she looks at a photo, and the scene immediately goes back to 1996. Sae and Kouhei met on a train ride to their respective college entrance examinations. The train hit a deer, causing Sae to worry about being late for the examinations. They went to a nearby house to ask if the owners could give them a lift. Sae spotted a key in the truck parked at the porch. She asked Kouhei if he would "borrow" the truck to take her to the exam center. However, when Kouhei tried to overtake a slow cow truck, he narrowly avoided an incoming crane, and went off the road into a ditch. They were brought to a police station and Sae was disqualified from her examinations.  Sae worked hard to get into a university while Kouhei always supported her. However, he had mixed feelings about her going to Tokyo, because that would mean that they would be separated. Hence, when Sae managed to get into [[Waseda University]], Kouhei at first refused to see her off. However, at his friends' urging, they got onto a boat and chased after Sae, and when they saw her, they rolled out a banner reading, "Good Luck Sae!".  At Waseda University, Sae met Kitami Junichi, a senior who likes taking pictures of children in third world countries. He helps Sae find a night job teaching English at a [[cram school]] and became good friends with her. When Kouhei visited Sae in Tokyo, upon seeing Sae and Kitami talking together, Kouhei got jealous. During the dinner date with Sae, Kouhei refused to eat anything and stormed out of the restaurant. On his way, a group of delinquent youths knocked down a box that contained Kouhei's present for Sae, and mocked him. A fight ensured, and Kouhei was injured. Sae brought Kouhei back to her apartment, where they made up. Kouhei then gives Sae the ship, which was similar to the one Kouhei was on when he saw off Sae. Sae worries that their relationship will not last very long.  Four years later, a graduating Sae is unable to find a job in Tokyo. She met Junichi, who asks her to go to [[New York City]] together with him. Kouhei was also told by his father that their fishing boat was about to be repossessed by the bank, and he must find another job. Kouhei then contacts Sae, telling her that he plans to go to Tokyo to find her. However, on the fishing boat's last trip, Kouhei's father had a heart attack and died. Kouhei is then unable to leave for Tokyo, as he had to take care of his mother and younger sister.  Later, Sae leaves for New York and meets up with Junichi, and they worked together in the same company. Junichi proposed to Sae later on. Sae returned to [[Kushiro]] to attend her friend Minami's wedding, and she found out that Kouhei was married to Ritsuko. However, Ritsuko was jealous of the way Sae and her husband were interacting. Kouhei then met Sae at the lighthouse, and Sae tells him that this might be the last time she visits Japan since she may get married. Having seen each other after such a long time, they can't resist anymore and they embrace each other passionately in front of Sae's house while dropping her off, but their responsibilities towards their better halves (in her case, her fiancé) force them to reluctantly part ways. When Kouhei returned, he found Ritsuko waiting for him on the steps with bad news - the bank might make them bankrupt. Kouhei manages to settle the problem, but he found Ritsuko's divorce papers on the table when he returned. The scene ends with a news report stating that Junichi was killed in [[Iraq]].  2 years later, Sae visits her hometown in Canada.

Hatchet II
 Picking up immediately where the [[Hatchet (film)|first film]] ended, Marybeth ([[Danielle Harris]]) is attacked by Victor Crowley ([[Kane Hodder]]), but manages to escape. Jack Cracker ([[John Carl Buechler]]) finds her, pulls her out of the river, and takes her back to his cabin. After finding out her last name, he forces her to leave, telling her that if she wants help, she needs to see Reverend Zombie ([[Tony Todd]]). Moments after she leaves, Jack views Shapiro's camcorder, which he found in the swamp. The footage shows Shapiro filming different topless women, including Misty and Jenna. It also further reveals Shapiro's plan to venture into the swamp. After Jack finishes watching the video, he is killed by Victor Crowley, who gouges his intestines out and strangles him with them until he decapitates him.  Marybeth returns to Reverend Zombie's shop and, after demanding to speak with him, he reluctantly lets her in. It's revealed that Rev. Zombie had a small business going on with Shawn, the tour guide who was murdered the night before, and the boat was one of his own. After learning her last name, he tells her that her father was one of the boys responsible for causing the fire that led to Victor Crowley's death. He also tells her that Thomas, Victor's father, cheated on his wife Shyann with her nurse Lena after she was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Moments before dying, Shyann placed a curse on the child conceived by Lena from the affair. Months later, Lena died after giving birth to the deformed Victor Crowley. After Thomas accidentally kills Victor whilst trying to save him, he confronts the three boys responsible for the fire, but due to his violent attitude, and the [[shotgun]] he threatens them with, they, along with their parents, deny it. Thomas becomes a shut-in and eventually dies ten years later of a broken heart. The story is then complemented by various scenes in which the undead Victor slaughters anyone who wanders into Honey Island Swamp.    Marybeth tells Reverend Zombie she wants to go back and retrieve the remains of her father and brother. He agrees, but tells her she must bring a family member with her. After she leaves, Zombie calls Justin ([[Parry Shen]]), Shawn's brother, and reveals Shawn never returned with the boat. He lies, saying they are going into the swamp to find Shawn and the boat. He tells Justin to summon a group of hunters, specifically a man named Trent Graves ([[R. A. Mihailoff]]) to go with them. Marybeth returns home, where her uncle, Bob ([[Tom Holland (director)|Tom Holland]]) promptly shows up. He tells her she must stay away from Reverend Zombie, but reluctantly agrees to accompany her to a recruitment meeting in Zombie's shop. Zombie tells the hunters he will pay them $500 each to retrieve his boat and $5,000 for the head of Victor Crowley. He tells Trent he will pay him double to go, and Trent agrees. The hunters proceed to venture into the swamp with Marybeth and her uncle.   As night descends, they find the boat and, as the rest leave, two of the hunters, Cletus and Chad (Ed Ackerman and David Foy) stay by the boat while the others fan out. Marybeth, Zombie, Justin, Bob and Trent look for Crowley's shed, as well as the bodies of his victims. Along the way, Zombie explains to Justin that Trent and Marybeth's father and uncle were the kids who started the fire that led to Victor's death. Zombie believes that if Crowley kills Bob and Trent, his soul will be at peace and he will finally leave the swamp. After not finding the bodies in the shed, they check the main cabin. Meanwhile, the rest of the hunting party are systematically murdered by Victor: Chad is violently hacked in the face with Victor's hatchet, and Cletus' face is mutilated by a boat propeller.  While Layton ([[AJ Bowen]]) and Avery (Alexis Peters) are having make-up sex, Victor appears and decapitates Layton. Avery tries to run away, but Victor chops her between the legs and in the chest with his hatchet. Finally, John and Vernon (Rick McCallum and [[Colton Dunn]]) are simultaneously split in half from the groin up with a long chainsaw. While searching the cabin, the remaining party members hear Victor outside.  As they hide, Justin tells Marybeth of Zombie's plot to get her uncle and Trent killed after Marybeth tells Justin that Shawn is dead. As she runs to warn Bob, Justin jams the door shut with a chair, but Victor appears behind him and kills him by wearing half his head away with a [[belt sander]]. Bob, in an attempt to save Justin, accidentally releases Victor. Marybeth attempts to attack him, but is tossed against the wall. Victor then spears Trent against the wall and the two stumble into the kitchen where an epic battle ensues. Despite Victor's strength, Trent uses the nearby surroundings to his advantage, temporarily pinning Crowley against a support. He beats Victor with tables and chairs, but Victor finally breaks Trent's leg, then severs the top half of his head by kicking it against a table. Meanwhile, Zombie grabs Marybeth and drags her out of the house, trapping Bob inside with Victor. Zombie restrains Marybeth while she screams as she hears Bob being murdered by Victor inside. She falls to the ground in tears, and Zombie declares, "That's it. All over," and claims Victor Crowley is dead.  Marybeth tells Zombie that she will report his crimes to the police, but Zombie responds by preparing to shoot her. Only now does Marybeth reveal that Bob was not her real uncle; her father's brother had died of [[leukemia]] when she was twelve, and Bob was her father's best friend. Zombie turns to see Victor breaking through the wall of the cabin, now realizing his plan to kill Victor Crowley has failed. Zombie advances towards Victor and attempts to choke him, but Victor kills him by severing him in half before ripping out his severed spine, effectively skinning him alive. Just after Victor tosses Zombie's skinned upper body into the woods, Marybeth strikes him in the forehead with his own hatchet, knocking him to the ground. She then hysterically beats his head into a bloody pulp. She eventually stops and walks off, just as Victor's hand twitches. She then returns with Zombie's shotgun and fires the gun into the remains of his head, seemingly killing him.

Jung-sik and Kyu-nam are taken to a hospital, where doctors are unable to save Jung-sik, but Kyu-nam recovers almost immediately.  Blaming Cho-in for Jung-sik's death, Kyu-nam resolves to bring the psychic to justice. With the help of Ali and Bubba, he breaks into Utopia's back room to recover the [[CCTV]] tape with Cho-in's appearance. The three are forced to flee from a mob of people controlled by Cho-in, and Kyu-nam is separated from the others. He manages to knock Cho-in out and take him to a police station, but the officers ignore his warnings and are mind-controlled. Kyu-nam chases Cho-in to a metro station, where Cho-in commands a mother to throw her infant child against a speeding train. Kyu-nam saves the child, but is struck by the train and left by Cho-in to die. However, he recovers from his wounds once more.  Kyu-nam contacts Ali and Bubba, who agree to help him hunt down Cho-in. Ali modifies an old van and constructs a [[flare gun]] with the intent of countering Cho-in's ability. Both Kyu-nam and Cho-in come under investigation by the authorities, who send a team to search Cho-in's hotel room. Cho-in murders the investigators and leaves the apartment, taking with him only a toy figurine of a young man. He robs a bank and visits his mother, who is also being questioned by the authorities; again, Cho-in kills the officers, but is unable to take his mother's life, instead leaving her with a large sum of money. Kyu-nam confronts Cho-in in an apartment complex, where Cho-in mocks him and forces several people into suicide to torment Kyu-nam. Outside, Ali and Bubba attack Cho-in with the flare gun, but it proves ineffective and they are captured.  Back at Utopia, Kyu-nam is ambushed by Cho-in, who then [[hanging|hangs]] him alongside Ali and Bubba. Kyu-nam escapes, but cannot save his friends in time. Cho-in takes Yeong-sook hostage and causes a large traffic accident to stop Kyu-nam; however, Kyu-nam survives as Ali's and Bubba's apparitions instruct him to activate a speed booster in his van, installed there by Ali. Kyu-nam corners Cho-in on a rooftop, where Kyu-nam is shot but manages to throw both of them onto the street below. Cho-in is killed by the fall while Kyu-nam, once again, lives; he notices Cho-in's toy figurine and reflects on whether in different circumstances, the two of them could have been friends.  At a metro station, a [[quadriplegic]] Kyu-nam (who uses a wheelchair) meets up with Yeong-sook, who has fulfilled her dream of becoming a [[flight attendant]]. A woman attempts suicide by lying down on the train tracks; she is rescued in the nick of time by Kyu-nam, who seems to have made another miraculous recovery.

He's on Duty
 Bang Tae-sik is perennially unemployed as he drifts from one job to another, from manual labor to serving coffee. His appearance (dark skin and short height), being rather atypical for a Korean is to blame it seems, but best buddy Yong-cheol persuades Tae-sik to make better use of these disadvantages: Desperate and having nothing better to do, he adopts a strange accent and ethnic hat and is reborn as Bang-ga (a twist on his family name) from [[Bhutan]], and immediately lands a job at a chair manufacturing factory.  Despite a shaky beginning ― due to his unredeemable clumsiness, rather than doubts about his alleged Bhutani roots that are all too convincing ― Tae-sik gets along with his co-workers, and even starts romancing the lovely Jang-mi from [[Vietnam]]. He is even voted to become president of a migrant workers labor union and competent Korean language instructor, and joins in a harmonious effort to win a local singing competition for foreigners.

Helena from the Wedding
 Recently married Alex, 39, a lawyer by schooling, but currently an unsuccessful playwright, and Alice, his younger wife by about five years, invite three other couples to Alex’s parents cabin in the snowy woods for New Year’s weekend. Don and Lynn arrive first, Don bringing party hats, but forgetting the wine. Lynn, also a lawyer, recently received a better position, and, though she tells Alice that  Don, a writer, is ‘good with the kids’, she complains about his bad business ideas. Nick, recently separated from his wife, arrives next but alone, claiming his new, much younger girlfriend, is sick and couldn’t make it to the event. While Alice and Lynn chat in the kitchen making dinner, the guys are outside standing around the barbecue, listening to Don’s latest scheme: ‘The Naked Maid’ cleaning service he’d like to start. Also mentioned is his old Jeep that he has to keep in constant repair so that he has ‘something to do’.  Just before dinner, Alice and Alex are alone when she, displaying her insecurity, asks him “Do I look okay?”, and he replies “You look amazing”.  During dinner, when it becomes clear Lynn is an alcoholic, and that Don and Lynn’s relationship is rather strained, a phone call from Eve of the third couple lets everybody know that they are bringing along Helena, ‘from the wedding’. After dinner and more wine-drinking, Don and Lynn head off to bed. Alice excuses herself to retire too, and Alex goes with her to tuck her in, as Don and Lynn nosily go ‘at it’ (copulate) upstairs. Alex returns to Nick to converse, but the noise drives them outside, where Nick discloses his girlfriend has left him.  Back inside, over [[backgammon]], Nick asks about Helena. Alex tells him she was a bridesmaid along with Alice at Eve’s wedding. Nick senses Alex was attracted to her, though he was engaged to Alice at time. He says “You tried to fuck her!”, but Alex replies “Will you keep it down … No, I didn’t.”, and they both retire for the night.  At breakfast the next day, Don and Lynn find out about Nick’s break-up. Eve, pregnant, and Steven, a wealthy lawyer, arrive with Helena, as Nick descends from upstairs. Both Nick and Alex are clearly ‘distracted’ by the presence of younger Helena, a very attractive British model. A bit later, Lynn, asserting her dominance in the relationship, insists Don fetch wine and cigarettes from the store, even though there is plenty of wine in the cabin.  Alice and Eve go for a walk, while Alex, Nick and Steven go for a hike. Even though it is morning, Lynn heads back to bed for a nap, while Helena stays indoors to read.  Eve tell Alice she thinks Steven is having an affair, after finding condoms in his briefcase. Eve asks Alice about having kids, telling her “Well, you have a little time left; enjoy the honeymoon period, as it is brief.”  Nick begs off the hike, to return to the cabin to hopefully connect with Helena (to no avail). Alex asks Steven for a job, but the prospects aren’t good for someone his age and his academic credentials i.e. the law school he attended. All return to the cabin, where Alex tells Alice that Steven is a ‘douche-bag’. Don, Lynn, Alice, Nick and Steven head out to ‘4-wheel’ in the snow. Eve naps, while Alex stays behind to hopefully somehow connect with Helena (to no avail). Helena takes a bath, and Alex grabs a pair of binoculars, goes outside, and attempts to ‘peep’ at her through the bathroom window, then he lays in the snow, staring into the sky, fantasizing or thinking.  As Helena exits the bath, wrapped in a towel, Alice, who has returned alone, catches Alex, unaware, looking at Helena, and is distressed.  That night, everybody parties and gets drunk, and several do some cocaine. Outside (in Don's Jeep) after doing some 'blow', Nick hits on Helena, but she rebuffs him. Then he asks for a kiss on the cheek, and she again says no. Back inside, as music blares, Alex watches Alice and then Helena dancing. Lynn tells Don to go get cigarettes again, but he is drunk. Alice and Eve go to the store, Eve driving. They’re delayed at the store due to a dead battery. Alex, drunk, gets annoyed and wants to check on the ladies, but his friends stop him from driving. Then he attempts to attack Steven, as Lynn and Helena watch, but the other two stop him. Nick talks to Alex, and he calms down. Alex apologizes to Steven, and Steven tells him he has no sway in hiring Alex, as his partners hate him. They haze him, including putting condoms in his briefcase. Alex realizes Steven is just as ‘hapless’ as he is.  Fireworks are set alight as midnight approaches; the group watches, and Eve and Alice return to the cabin. Alex and Alice go to their bedroom, where they look at each other and touch, resigned to their loving relationship.  
Heartbreaker (2010 film)
 The bulk of the story takes place in [[Monaco]]. Charming attractive Alex ([[Romain Duris]]), his sister Mélanie ([[Julie Ferrier]]), and her husband Marc ([[François Damiens]]), operate a unique business for concerned third-party clients—breaking up relationships, but only where the woman is "not knowingly unhappy." The trio concoct elaborate, custom, and sometimes expensive ruses to deceive the women. After each woman has fallen for his act, Alex tells her she has made him come alive again, but that it is too late for him. The women presumably leave their relationships to seek men who make them feel the way Alex has.  They are hired by a wealthy man (Jacques Frantz), who is a florist and gangster, to prevent the wedding of his daughter Juliette ([[Vanessa Paradis]]) to a wealthy Englishman of whom he does not approve, Jonathan ([[Andrew Lincoln]]). The main problem is that they only have ten days to do so before the wedding. The task is further complicated because, after doing a lot of research, the couple appear to be truly in love and absolutely perfect for each other. They also could not find the usual "flaws" in the couple that they use to cause break-ups. So, at first, Alex turns down the job, but, massively in debt to a loan shark through his own lavish spending on the business, he is pressured into putting aside his honourable principles to complete the seemingly impossible task with only five days until the wedding.  Alex becomes Juliette's 'bodyguard' in order to gain close and constant access to her. While on the job, Alex finds out things that Juliette likes and pretends to like these things as well to impress her; some of these things include the movie ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'', [[Roquefort]] cheese and the music of [[George Michael]]. Eventually the two develop feelings for each other but the early arrival of Jonathan disrupts Alex's access to Juliette. The night before the wedding, Juliette is restless, and she and Alex sneak out and have a wonderful time, including recreating the 'climactic lift' scene from ''Dirty Dancing'', and early the next morning Juliette confesses her feelings for him. Alex begins his usual script but, realising he cannot be with her after how he has deceived her, abruptly changes it and says she should get married.  The next day, as the group leave the hotel, Marc inadvertently drops Juliette's case file in front of her. Seeing the surveillance photos and her background information, she realizes her father has hired Alex to try to stop the wedding. At the airport Mélanie, after carefully observing the 'goings on' the last several days, chides Alex for walking away from real love to return to an empty life of fake seduction. He runs toward the wedding from the airport.  Meanwhile, Juliette's father tells her that while Jonathan is a decent man, she will be bored with him. As they are walking down the aisle, he tells her that Alex refused to take any payment for the contract. Before reaching the end of the aisle, Juliette turns and runs away from the ceremony to find Alex. The two meet and kiss after Alex confesses that he hates Roquefort and George Michael and had never seen ''Dirty Dancing'', is broke and sleeps in his office, but he needs to see her every day.  As the [[end credits]] roll, back at the 'non-wedding', it is revealed that the loan shark to whom Alex owes money actually works for Juliette's father, while Juliette's scheming friend Sophie flirts with Jonathan. Later, Mélanie and Marc alone attempt another 'seduction', but Marc doesn't quite have Alex's charm to pull it off successfully.

Help (film)
 A woman, Susan Alves, is in a mental asylum on the island of [[Mauritius]] in 1990. She frantically scribbles demonic images on her cell walls. Her husband, Joe Alves, comes to visit and they discuss their daughter, Pia. Susan panics and says she can't bear it and commits suicide in front of Joe.  In present-day [[Mumbai]], Pia ([[Mugdha Godse]]) is now married to horror film director, Vic ([[Bobby Deol]]). However, their marriage is strained. When Pia's friend Carol ([[Sophia Handa]]) from Mauritius informs the couple that Pia's father, Joe, has suffered a heart attack, they travel to the island and stay at Pia's childhood home, where it's revealed that Pia had a twin named Dia, who she was very close with. That night, Pia has a nightmare of a girl's ghost and inanimate objects in the house are seen moving around. The next morning, Pia has a flashback of Joe carrying a dead Dia out of the pool. She is very disturbed by this memory as she recalls that normally she was with her sister at all times, but the day Dia drowned, she wasn't. During dinner, when Pia goes outside to check on Tracy, the dog, who is barking ferociously at something invisible, she has another encounter with the girl's ghost.  Pia discovers she is pregnant. Meanwhile, Joe shares old photos with Vic and points out Dia's favourite doll, which was buried with Dia. Pia tells Vic of her pregnancy; the news mends their relationship and the couple is once again happy. However, unusual events continue occurring in the house. One night, Dia's ghost jumps down on Pia from the ceiling. The next morning, Pia is clearly not herself. When Tracy is found dead, Pia seems completely unfazed, which concerns Carol, as Pia loved the dog. Carol contacts her friend Aditya ([[Shreyas Talpade]]), a parapsychologist for help, informing him about the unnatural happenings in the house and Pia's unusual behaviour.  Carol has an encounter with the ghost and flees but is hit by a truck and dies. At the funeral, Aditya senses that Pia's life is in danger and tells Vic. After encountering the ghost himself, Vic seeks Aditya for help. He searches the attic and finds the doll that was buried with Dia, a video cassette, Susan's diaries and some extremely morbid paintings by Susan, featuring images of suicide and inner turmoil. Vic visits the mental asylum and the janitor there tells him that Susan wasn't insane but in fact possessed by an evil spirit.  Vic and Aditya watch the video cassette, which shows Pia drowning Dia before giving the camera an evil smile. However, they suspect the clip only shows half the truth. After repeated viewings of the video, Aditya realises Susan was already possessed even before Dia's death. He also notices the reflection of a third girl in the mirror: it cannot be Pia, as she is the one videotaping and it is not Dia, who is in front of the camera. It is the spirit, meaning Pia was not the one who killed her, and that through her uncovered doll, Dia was trying to send them a message about her true murderer.  Vic discovers Susan was pregnant with a third child and it seems that the women in the family become possessed when pregnant. A possessed Pia kills Joe. It is revealed that Susan was pregnant not with twins but with triplets. Dia and Pia came out fine, but there were major complications with the third child, and Joe had to take the decision to save Susan over the child. After realising it is the triplet's spirit taking revenge against the family, Vic and Aditya try to destroy the spirit. Aditya is killed and but Vic manages to trap the spirit in the other realm.  7 months later, Pia delivers a healthy baby. However, while Pia sleeps, the baby is seen squirming and writhing; its eyes suddenly go blank like the spirit's, implying the spirit is now in the baby.

George enrolls in a cooking class taught by one of San Francisco's leading chefs. Its  students are paired-up, resulting in George being partnered with a young woman named Melanie. The two hit it off and after attending their second class decide to put their new culinary skills to use by preparing an Italian dinner at George's place. All goes well until they hear an ill-timed phone message from his brother, which inclines George to reveal his past as a psychic to Melanie. Curious, she presses George to do a reading for her. George explains his reluctance, but acquiesces. They contact the spirit of Melanie's father, who ends the session by asking her forgiveness for what he did to her as a child. Melanie flees George's home in tears, and she doesn't return to the cooking class.  Having been in talks with a publisher before her trip to Thailand about a biography of [[François Mitterrand]], Marie now stuns them with her new manuscript entitled "''Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence''". The publisher rejects the manuscript but soon steers her toward other publishers who might be interested, the most promising of them in London.  Marie learns from Didier that he does not intend on having her back at the job he urged her to take leave of, because her public interest in the hereafter damages her reputation as a serious journalist, and that he is having an affair with the woman who replaced her on the TV news program.   George is laid off from his factory job, and is persuaded by Billy to revive his psychic practice. Still heartbroken over the fiasco with Melanie, he changes his mind and impulsively leaves San Francisco to make a new start elsewhere. He travels to London and listens every night to audiobook readings by [[Derek Jacobi]] of [[Charles Dickens]]' works. As a Dickens devotee, he also visits the Dickens Museum and attends Jacobi's live reading of Dickens at the [[London Book Fair]]. There, one of the presenters is Marie, reading her now published book, ''Hereafter''. While handing a signed copy of her book to George, their hands touch and George has a psychic flash of Marie's tsunami drowning.  Marcus and his foster parents are also at the London Book Fair. Asking leave of them, Marcus spots George, someone he has read about and seen online. Marcus attempts to speak with the medium, who brushes him off and returns to his hotel. Marcus follows him, standing outside the hotel until nightfall. Eventually George asks him in and agrees to do his reading.  Through George, Jason tells Marcus that he is happy in the afterlife. He instructs Marcus to stop wearing his cap and says it was he who knocked it off his head at the train station. It was used, he says, to keep Marcus from the doomed train but now he must stand on his own. Jason tells him not to fear this "because we are one". As Marcus leaves George, he says he is sorry about "the French woman" as he could tell that "you like her." The last time we see Marcus, he is visiting his mother in a rehab center. She is visibly better and he is not wearing Jason's cap.  Marcus lets George know where Marie is staying. George leaves an anonymous note for Marie, saying he believes her book to be true. She decides to join the anonymous fan for lunch and discovers George. While she is looking for him, George sees a vision of them kissing at the same meeting. Their shared glimpses of the hereafter having made them appreciate this life all the more, George and Marie sit together in the cafe.

He and his passive, depressed and pill-taking father Paul ([[Rainn Wilson]]) live with T.J.'s grandmother Madeleine ([[Piper Laurie]]), where they are soon joined by a squatter, Hesher ([[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]]), a foul-mouthed, tattooed, [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]-loving lout.  After school, Dustin, a bully from the towing service, finds his car vandalized and blames T.J., who is saved and taken home by Nicole ([[Natalie Portman]]), a grocery store clerk. Hesher witnesses Dustin attacking T.J., but does nothing. Later, Hesher sets Dustin's car on fire, leading to police questioning T.J., but lack of evidence forces them to let him go. T.J. proceeds to spy on Nicole at the grocery store when Hesher appears and follows her home with T.J. She causes a fender-bender and is verbally assaulted by the other driver, when Hesher comes to her rescue by threatening him. He then takes Nicole and T.J. to a random house that is for sale. There, Hesher trashes the swimming pool and lights the diving board on fire before he shocks Nicole and T.J. by leaving them there alone. When the pair get back to Nicole's broken down car, it has a ticket in the window, at which point Nicole breaks down and cries about how bad her life is.  Later that night, T.J. and Paul get into an argument over dinner. Madeleine is saddened that there is 'nothing she can do', and goes to her room. Hesher says he'll walk with her in the morning, but the next morning, he finds her dead. T.J. steals his dad's credit card and takes money to buy the car back, but is told it's been removed. He decides to give the money to Nicole, but when he gets there she is having sex with Hesher, so he damages his van while telling both of them he doesn't want to see them again and leaves.  He threatens Dustin at his house and finds out the car was taken to be crushed. Dustin begins attacking T.J. until Hesher, who has been following him, appears and drags Dustin off him. T.J. tells him he still doesn't want to see him again and then goes to the junkyard. He climbs in the wrecked car and sleeps, dreaming of his mother's death. He wakes up when the car is going to be crushed and falls out. He returns home after seeing it destroyed. While getting ready for his grandmother's funeral, Nicole comes and asks for forgiveness and leaves him. At the funeral, T.J. is asked to say words for her, but has nothing to say.   Hesher walks in drunk, resisting efforts to throw him out and demands that the mourners listen to him. He tells a story about how when he was younger he blew up the gas tank of a car and shrapnel destroyed one of his [[testicles]]. He then explained that he got caught up in the loss of his testicle focusing on it so much that he forgot he had a right testicle and working penis.  He then draws the parallel: you lost a wife, and you lost a mother; I lost a testicle.  He then announces that he promised Grandma he’d go on a walk with her and proceeds to push the casket out of the room.  T.J. and Paul stand agape and watch Hesher pushing the casket through the road. After a brief hesitation T.J. and Paul run to catch up and take a place on each side with their hands on the casket to help Hesher push and also to join the walk with Grandma.  The next day, Paul shaves for the first time in weeks and tells T.J. that Hesher is gone. Then he shows T.J. the compacted remains of his mother's car, which sits in the driveway.  The screen draws back and then we see on the roof Hesher has spray painted in huge white letters, “Hesher was here."

Hitler's Grave
 The hero of the film is a Moslem woman "Atossa", played by Taies Farzan who starts the whole story based on her promises to her brother. [[Daryush Shokof]] suggested in an interview after the film that he specifically wanted to show the important role of women in Iranian society and how he admires their courage and honesty.Shokof intends to show how he feels about Iranian women and their ability to free Iranians from under the fundamentalist Islamic regime that has governed the Iranian nation for over 37 years now.Therefore his hero is a woman, and it is the woman who promises a word and keeps it, and delivers it rather than a man in an all too male and macho oriented religious society and government that he believes has brutally dictated backwards rules upon Iranians that have in his opinio taken Iranians back to the dark ages of religious fanatacism. The hero of the film is Atossa who is the sister of the dying brother making two idealistically rare and odd and strange and hopeful promises.She sets out to travel to Berlin, Germany to first find the grave of Hitler who all believe does not exist and then to make the situation more round she continues with the second promise that remains a mystery until the final moment of the film. Atossa is passionate, sincere, daring, powerful and a well trained fighter ( we see her fighting masterfully in a training in the first moments of the film where another fighting trainee tells her about the grave situation of her brother,s fate). She encounters many unfortunate typical encounters on the streets of Berlin to finally finding the Rabbi played by the great German actor Vadim Glowna who suggests to her a sight where Hitler could be buried under. However, he also tells her the truth about the nature of many mysteries throughout the history of mankind while explaining to her that we human being adore mysteries and there are some amongst us that are masters at creating stories and mysteries from who the prophets were to how Marilyn Monroe died and or who really killed Kennedy or whatever suddenly happened to Michael Jackson on the same eve of the day where Iranian regime was almost about to fall?! The plot suggests many clever details and secretive and thought provoking questions about why we all somehow are victims but keeps the audience awake by simplicity of the story and how it progresses as it sticks to her pursuit of finding the solution to her second promise. After she finds out the presumably the grave spot of Hitler,she is now overjoyed, convinced, and is positively motivated to continue her mission in order to deliver the second promise. She arrives at her hotel room to rest a while, turns on the T.V. screen and is shocked to see the shooting death of Neda, the innocent Iranian student during the protests on the streets of Tehran. The horrifying pictures of the final dying moments of Neda takes her by storm. Here the film takes the daring turn to free Atossa from the grip of religion fanaticism over her life as she runs out of the hotel in a fury and runs aimlessly to mere exhaustion. There and finally she walks over the bridge where the wide calm rivers flow heavy under the bridge.There she finally takes the mandatory scarf off her head and throws it into the river as it disappears into the deep waters. Now she feels free again for once after being out of the country, and starts walking through the streets of Berlin, goes to dance alone in a club , gets drunk and is saved from being attacked by drunk wild men in the club by the hotel keeper who has a feeling for her ever since the first minute she arrived in the hotel. She battles Nazis, beats the life out of two low life city slickers masterfully who wanted to take her for a ride and show her a fake grave plot as the spot where Hitler's grave is supposed to be.At the police station she encounters similarities between all establishments on Earth where the police distrust her and set out a detective to watch every move she makes from this point on.  The detective "Karlsson" who is commissioned to watch after everything she does from her second day of her arrival in the city is always on her tails until he finally is the witness to a most moving final moments between Atossa and Lars in the last scene of the film. This is also the scene were we find out the hilariously surprising nature about the second promise.

Keller is talked into taking on the same two anonymous men spying on him the previous day, who are revealed to be plastic surgeons Dr. Carlton ([[Dean Cameron]]) and Dr. Hamilton ([[Christopher Showerman]]) from their own company NuBoobs.  Keller signs an agreement that if he wins, he'll get $50,000, but if the surgeons win, Keller becomes a test patient for any projects they have in mind.  It's soon discovered that the same guy helping Keller hustle people on the course has now appeared to help these two surgeons hustle Keller instead.  After Keller loses, he attempts to bail on the surgeons but gets tazed unconscious.  Keller wakes up the next morning in his own home only to discover he's been given breast implants overnight by the surgeons.  Along with Tyler, Keller visits the surgeons demanding the operation to be reversed, but they'll only do it for $50,000 and give Keller two weeks to get said money or else they mail his post-surgery pictures out to his family and friends.  Tyler attempts to get rapper Darius "Ice Pyk" Vernon to sponsor PAHR, but he brings Mark to the meeting, whose dialogue gets both of them kicked out of Ice Pyk's building.  Convinced by Tyler to do so, Keller heads back to the golf course and begins winning rounds of golf for money against various people, eventually becoming comfortable in golfing with implants.  During these series of events, Keller is pursued by a repo man ([[Dean Cain]]) who is constantly trying to collect Keller's mustang that he's behind with payments on; the repo man eventually succeeds, but immediately wrecks the vehicle after the brakes were cut by Mark, who was only attempting to repair them.  Together, Keller and Tyler earn $42,000 in two weeks, just falling eight grand short of the surgeons' demands.  Keller makes one more offer to the surgeons, stating that if he and Tyler can beat them, the surgeons reverse the operation free of charge, but if the surgeons win, Tyler gives up PAHR to them.  During the match, Keller struggles until Mandy shows up with Keller's father.  It was revealed that the surgeons went back on their word and mailed Keller's post-surgery pics to his father.  Mandy forgives Keller for his actions, and his father convinces Keller to pursue a career in golf after seeing how much money he had won in two weeks.  This is enough for Keller to get his groove back and win the match by one stroke over the surgeons.  The surgeons declare that they won't reverse the surgery despite losing, but are soon chased down by Ice Pyk's bodyguards, while Ice Pyk himself agrees to work with PAHR, much to Tyler's delight.

Hot Tub Time Machine
 Three estranged, [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] friends: Adam Yates is dumped by his girlfriend; Nick Webber-Agnew is a henpecked husband with a [[dead-end job]]; and Lou Dorchen is a party animal in his 40s. They reconnect when Lou is hospitalized for [[carbon monoxide poisoning]]. To cheer him up, Adam and Nick arrange for Lou to join them at Kodiak Valley Ski Resort, where the three enjoyed fun times in their youth; Adam's [[Recluse|reclusive]] nephew Jacob tags along. During a night of heavy drinking in their hotel room's hot tub, the four douse the console with an illegal Russian [[energy drink]] called "Chernobly".  The next day, the friends go skiing and, after many strange occurrences (1980s fashion, music videos on [[MTV]] and [[Michael Jackson]] still being black), they realize they have traveled back to 1986. Adam, Lou and Nick have also assumed their younger bodies: they appear normal to each other, but to others (and in their reflections) they look like their younger selves. Jacob's appearance has not changed, though he occasionally flickers.  A cryptic hot tub repairman appears and warns them not to change anything, as it might affect history. To minimize the [[butterfly effect]], the guys plan to re-enact their experiences. Adam has to break up with his girlfriend Jenny and get stabbed in the eye with a fork; Lou must pick a fight with and get beaten up by Blaine, a ski patrol [[Bullying|bully]]; Nick must have sex with a groupie and give a poor performance with his band at an open mic event. They discover Jacob's [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] mother Kelly, Adam's sister, is also at the resort.  The guys find their tasks difficult; Lou gets punched to the floor by Blaine and loses his backpack, but realizes he must face him again later at night, so he reluctantly challenges Blaine again. Adam finds his attraction to Jenny reignited, but is distracted when he meets laid-back music journalist April during the resort's [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] concert. Nick worries about cheating on his wife, even though the events occur before he even meets her. Later on, Lou tries to capitalize on his knowledge of football game outcomes; it works until he risks everything on a game-winning touchdown, only to have a squirrel from the resort (which he vomited on earlier) crash the field and ruin the play.  Jenny turns the tables on Adam when she initiates their breakup, but Adam soon re-encounters April; they break into a nearby home and become intimate. Nick changes his destiny by covering the more upbeat "[[Jessie's Girl]]", followed by a "preview version" of "[[Let's Get It Started]]". When the repairman informs Jacob that a chemical was the key to their time travel, Jacob realizes it was the Chernobly. The guys prevent Lou, once again beaten up without his friends, from falling off the rooftop. They go to Blaine's cabin to search for the drink, during which Lou finds and seduces Kelly. When Jacob suddenly vanishes, the guys realize that Lou is Jacob's father; after Lou and Kelly make love, Jacob reappears. Leaving Kelly, Lou finally assaults Blaine; the four friends retrieve the Chernobly and return to the hot tub where they create a vortex. Jacob and Nick enter the tub, but Lou decides to stay in 1986, admitting to Adam that his carbon monoxide poisoning was attempted [[suicide]]; knowing the future, he wants to make investments and be a good father to Jacob. Adam insists upon staying too, but Lou pushes him into the vortex at the last moment.  Back at the present, Adam, Nick, and Jacob discover that Lou has changed history by founding the immensely successful Lougle, which affords him a luxurious lifestyle with Kelly. Adam discovers that he is happily married to April, while Nick is a successful music producer married to a happy and caring wife. The guys reunite at Lou's mansion with their families, satisfied with their new lives.

Meanwhile, Hetal lies to her father, Batuk Patel ([[Boman Irani]]), that Bob owns a mansion and they have a child, so she can meet him after so many years. On the other hand, Sandy tells her brother that Aarush is quite well to do too. The four are then forced to rent a mansion to make Hetal's dad believe that Bob owns it. Confusion prevails and somehow Batuk accidentally believes that Aarush is married to Hetal, and Bob is the cook. In the confusion they bring an African child and pretend that it is the baby.Then, Krishna turns up earlier than expected, much to Aarush's horror that Krishna was the one who punched him earlier leading to more lies and the two couples making him believe that Aarush owns the mansion.  For half of the term, the four must pretend that the mansion is owned by Bob, and the rest must pretend that Aarush owns it. Batuk Patel and the Landlady are Aarush's pseudo parents while Hetal is his sister and Bob is his brother in law. An overly suspicious Krishna goes to the casino as his bag was exchanged with Kishore Samtani.

While this is happening, two workers, Santa ([[Suresh Menon]]) and Banta Singh ([[Manoj Pahwa]]), are meant to be installing air conditioning gas for the place. However instead they accidentally supply the hall with laughing gas causing everyone to break into an outburst of laughter. During this laughter, the truth is let out but no one seems to be in the right state of mind.  The two workers meanwhile stop the gas from spreading – everyone comes back to their senses. Aarush is still telling Krishna the truth, leading Krishna to break off Sandy's engagement. However, after Sandy tearfully pleads with him, Krishna lets the two get married. In the end, Hetal and Bob live together with Batuk Patel, and Aarush's luck changes for the better.  
How I Ended This Summer
 Meteorology student Pavel "Pasha" Danilov ([[Grigoriy Dobrygin]]) is spending the summer as an intern at an isolated, Soviet-era weather station on a remote Arctic island with only the older, experienced [[Geophysics|geophysicist]] Sergei Gulybin ([[Sergei Puskepalis]]) for company. Their sole job is to collect the weather and tide statistics every four hours on antiquated equipment, which they do in shifts, and report the readings by radio to the state meteorology center. Pasha is respectful and friendly, but he is afraid of the gruff Sergei, who is condescending to him, as he resents Pasha's temporary stay and is jealous that he knows how to operate their only computer.  Sergei takes the boat on an unauthorized fishing trip for a few days, and tells him not to mention this. When the radio operator urgently requests to speak with Sergei,  Pasha dutifully makes up excuses why he cannot come on the radio. Eventually Pasha is told to take down a [[radiogram (message)|radiogram]] that Sergei's wife and young son have been "gravely injured" in an accident, although it is apparent they've been killed. He is told that a ship is headed to get them and instructed to simply give Sergei the message and then "leave him alone." The sad news keeps Pasha awake, but when he does sleep he oversleeps; the data goes unrecorded. Seeing Sergei's boat, he hastily grabs the logbook to fill in fake numbers, and in doing so knocks his radiogram under the desk. When Sergei comes ashore with the trout, he is in a good mood. He tells Pasha a warm story about his wife craving salted trout during her pregnancy. Pasha starts to say something, but Sergei interrupts and teaches him how to properly fillet a fish.  Once inside, Sergei quickly figures out that the Pasha made up the numbers in the log and explodes in anger, dragging Pasha inside and berating him. He tells him that the station has been continuously occupied since 1935, and that no matter how bad the conditions got, never had anyone just faked the numbers out of sheer laziness, and that now all their work is worthless. He accuses Pasha of being a "tourist" in the Arctic in order to write a pointless essay, "How I Ended This Summer" (a play on the clichéd "How I Spent My Summer Vacation.") Sergei tells him an intimidating  story about the time one geophysicist apparently killed the other due to their strained relationship.   The frightened Pasha does not tell Sergei about his family and temporarily sabotages the radio. When Sergei leaves to get more trout, Pasha is told that the ship is stuck in ice, but that a helicopter will instead come before the weather worsens. Pasha, carrying a rifle, heads to the lagoon to meet the helicopter, but the pilot cannot see the flares due to the heavy fog and flies away. Pasha then notices a polar bear, which begins to chase him. He runs away but eventually trips and falls down a steep embankment.  Pasha wakes up in Sergei's boat. As they disembark, Pasha tries to confess to Sergei that he needs to tell him something but Sergei ignores him. Pasha finally blurts out to Sergei that his family is dead. Sergei turns around and comes toward him, and Pasha, frightened and with an injured leg, falls to the ground. Thinking Sergei is going to attack him, Pasha fires at him but misses. He then gets up and runs away while Sergei picks up his gun and fires at him, and then keeps shooting into the air.  Pasha takes up residence in an old abandoned cabin. He wakes up to hear Sergei outside and hides, still afraid. Sergei calls to him and says he wants to talk to him. Sergei, who is carrying his rifle, hears Pasha step on something that makes a large cracking sound. Thinking Pasha fired at him, he fires his own rifle. The terrified Pasha runs away.  Pasha, freezing, huddles by an old [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator|isotope beacon]] to keep warm before realizing he has exposed himself to [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation]]. He sneaks into the cabin when Sergei is away and tries to contact the main station for help but cannot reach anyone.  Starving, he steals Sergei's fish and nearly chokes to death on a fishbone. He screams and curses Sergei. He hangs fish up on the isotope beacon; he later sneaks back into the cabin and replaces Sergei's stash of fish with the contaminated fish.  One night Sergei sees the disheveled Pasha looking in the cabin window watching him eat the fish. He signals to Pasha to come inside, and then invites him to sit down and have some fish. He says the ''Academic'' made it through the ice after all and will be there in three days. Pasha confesses that the fish has been contaminated. Sergei says nothing, but goes to vomit up the fish he has just eaten. Pasha checks the cupboard and sees Sergei has eaten all of the contaminated fish. Sergei returns and says only that they don't have to tell anyone what has happened.  The ''Academic'' arrives and Sergei tells Pasha he plans to stay on the island. Pasha threatens to tell what has happened to force Sergei to get medical help. Sergei insists he needs to be there alone and embraces Pasha.<ref></ref>  
How Do You Know
 Softball player Lisa Jorgenson is devastated when she is left off the [[United States women's national softball team|Team USA]] roster. Unsure what to do next, Lisa begins dating Matty Reynolds, a pitcher for the [[Washington Nationals]]. She also receives an intriguing phone call from a young executive, George Madison, who was advised by a friend of Lisa's to give her a call. George calls out of politeness because he wants to explain that his relationship with his girlfriend has just become more serious. But life takes an abrupt turn for the worse for George when he suddenly finds himself the target of a federal criminal investigation for corporate [[malfeasance]] at a company run by his father, Charles Madison. George is fired from his job and abandoned by the company, with the exception of his father and his pregnant secretary, Annie.  Still reeling from this blow, George goes to his girlfriend for sympathy and is stunned when she immediately breaks up with him. On a whim, George calls again to invite Lisa to dinner and she accepts. It turns out to be a disaster; George is so overwhelmed with his troubles that Lisa eventually asks that they just eat in silence, and they part ways not expecting to see one another again. Soon, Lisa moves in with Matty, who has a penthouse in the same upscale building where George's father lives. Matty is rich, well-meaning and fun, but is also immature and insensitive, and continues to have casual affairs with other women.  George is indicted and could face prison time. Annie is so loyal that she tries to give him inside information in advance, but he urges her not to lose her own job. Matty tries to do better in Lisa's eyes, promising to consider seeing fewer women on the side. He inadvertently offends her, so Lisa moves out and spends a pleasant, tipsy evening at George's modest new apartment. George's father then drops one last bombshell on his son: It was he who committed the illegal act for which George is being charged. Due to a previous conviction, Charles would spend at least 25 years &mdash; basically, the rest of his life &mdash; in prison, whereas George would only do three years at most.  On the night Annie's baby is born and her boyfriend proposes, Lisa begins to reconsider her previous reluctance to settle down. George is clearly smitten with her, but Matty pleads for another chance and she accepts. George makes a proposition to his father: He will take one more shot at persuading Lisa to be with him; If she will, Charles must go to jail, and if she won't, George will take the rap for his dad. At a birthday party that Matty throws for her, George confesses his feelings for Lisa and  goes outside to give her time to think it over, Charles looking on from above. Finally, Lisa says goodbye to Matty and joins George outside. At the end of the movie, they are seen boarding a bus together.  
The Housemaid (2010 film)
 The film opens with a bustling city street, where a young woman commits suicide by jumping from a building ledge to her death. Eun-yi, who works as a worker in a restaurant, persuades her coworker and roommate to drive her to the scene of the suicide, and she stands distraught over the chalk outline where the woman's body had lain. The next morning, an older woman by the name of Byeong-sik visits her small apartment and later expresses interest in giving her a job.  Eun-yi is hired as an [[au pair]] for Hae-ra (pregnant with twins) and her rich husband Hoon. Eun-yi's primary task is watching the couple's young daughter, Nami.  Eun-yi is eager to connect to Nami, who gradually warms to her. Hoon begins to secretly flirt with Eun-yi, enticing her with glasses of wine and his piano playing, and they eventually begin a sexual relationship. Despite the affair, Eun-yi is still warm and friendly to Hoon's oblivious wife, Hae-ra; she even expresses enthusiasm and delight at the progress of Hae-ra's pregnancy.  Byeong-sik, aka "Miss Cho" (the other live-in maid, originally Hae-ra's childhood maid) witnesses Eun-yi and Hoon having sex. She tries to subtly pry details from Eun-yi, but Eun-yi brushes her off casually. Later, Miss Cho reveals her suspicion to Hae-ra's mother that Eun-yi is pregnant. Hae-ra's mother then visits the family and stages an "accident," resulting in Eun-yi falling from a ladder positioned at the top of a set of stairs. Dangling from a chandelier, Eun-yi begs Hae-ra's mother to pull her over the railing. Hae-ra's mother does not oblige, and Eun-yi falls. Suffering only a [[concussion]], Eun-yi spends the night in the hospital.  During her stay, she learns that she is pregnant and contemplates [[abortion]]. Meanwhile, the affair is revealed to Hae-ra.  Hae-ra's mother, Mi-hee, instructs Hae-ra to ignore the affair; she insists that all wealthy husbands will eventually cheat and that if Hae-ra ignores it she can "live like a queen." Later that night, Hae-ra stands over Eun-yi's bed with a golf club but is unable to strike the sleeping woman. The next day, Hae-ra and her mother confront Eun-yi, offering her $100,000 to have an abortion and leave. Hae-ra knows that Eun-yi would not abort her child "for all the money in the world," so she takes matters into her own hands by poisoning the herbal medicine packets Eun-yi drinks every day.  Hae-ra goes to the hospital and delivers her twin sons. Hoon visits the hospital, where Hae-ra makes her ill will toward him known.  Furious, he returns home alone and finds Eun-yi in his bathtub. She reveals that she is pregnant and plans on keeping the baby.  Eun-yi succumbs to the effects of the poison, and Mi-hee arranges an abortion without Eun-yi's consent. After the abortion, Miss Cho reveals that she told Mi-hee about Eun-yi's pregnancy. Eun-yi is angry, but forgives Miss Cho and vows to get revenge on the family. After recovering from her abortion, Eun-yi sneaks into the house with Miss Cho's assistance. Hoon finds her [[breastfeeding]] one of the newborn babies. Hae-ra insists that Miss Cho chase Eun-yi out of the house, but Miss Cho refuses and quits her job on the spot. Eun-yi then confronts the entire family (Hae-ra, Mi-hee, Hoon, and Nami), hanging herself from the same chandelier she once clung to, then lighting her body on fire as the family watches in horror.  The final scene depicts the family outdoors in the snow celebrating Nami's birthday, all speaking English. While Hae-ra sings "Happy Birthday", Hoon hands a glass of champagne to Nami. Both appear insane as Nami looks on.  
The House That Drips Blood on Alex
 In a movie theater, a mysterious stranger sits next to two girls and starts to tell them a scary story that he claims is true:  Alex moves into an old house at 3 Blood Street. He is excited about moving in, until his friend Thomas points out that the house is dripping blood onto him. Alex is nonchalant about this, saying that it is just the house's paint job, although Thomas observes that nothing is painted this color. They ignore this, but after more blood drips on Alex later, the pair agree to approach the landlord to report the "leak".  The next day, they discover that the landlord's office is vacant, appearing to have not been used in years. Alex finds this odd, saying that the office was open yesterday. Alex hopes the landlord will call him and explain the dripping blood, but starts to worry as the problem continues.  Thomas explains the whole story to his friend Bobby the next day. When Alex meets up with them, Thomas offers Alex a place to stay until the problem stops. Alex declines, saying that he is not going to let some "leak" make him move.

The previews start, and the first trailer is for a horror film called "3 Blood Street" that has the same plot as the stranger's story.

How to Train Your Dragon (film)
 On Berk, a [[Vikings|Viking village]] located on a remote island from which dragons periodically steal [[livestock]], Hiccup, the awkward fifteen-year-old son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, works as a blacksmith's apprentice. As he is too small and weak to fight the dragons, he instead fashions mechanical devices under his apprenticeship with Gobber, the senior blacksmith, though his inventions often malfunction or backfire. During one attack, Hiccup shoots down a Night Fury, an extremely rare and dangerous dragon, with a bola launcher of his; he later finds it in the forest trapped in his [[bolas]], but finding that he cannot bring himself to kill the dragon, he instead sets it free.  Stoick assembles a fleet to find the dragons' nest, entering Hiccup in a dragon-killing class taught by Gobber. Hiccup returns to the forest to find the Night Fury still there; he realizes the dragon is unable to fly properly because of its crippled tail fin. Hiccup befriends the dragon, gradually taming it and giving it the name 'Toothless' due to its retractable teeth. Feeling guilty for crippling Toothless, Hiccup eventually makes a harness and [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] fin that allows him to guide the dragon in flight.  By observing Toothless's behavior, Hiccup becomes increasingly proficient in subduing the captive dragons during training nonviolently, earning him the admiration of his peers but causing Astrid, a tough Viking girl on whom Hiccup has a crush, to become increasingly suspicious of his behavior. Meanwhile, Stoick's fleet arrives home unsuccessful, though he is cheered by Hiccup's unexpected success in dragon training. Astrid eventually discovers that he is training Toothless. Hiccup takes her for a flight to demonstrate his relationship with the dragon before she can tell the village. Toothless unexpectedly takes the pair to the dragons' nest where they discover a gargantuan dragon named the Red Death, which eats the smaller dragons unless they bring it stolen livestock; the pair realize that the dragons have been attacking Berk under its control as opposed to of their own free will.  Back at the village, Hiccup, having won dragon training, is given the task of killing a captive Monstrous Nightmare dragon; he, instead, subdues it in front of his father and village instead of killing it in an attempt to prove that the dragons are harmless. However, Stoick inadvertently angers the dragon into attacking. Toothless attempts to protect Hiccup in the ensuing panic but is instead captured by the Vikings in the process. Hiccup accidentally reveals to Stoick that Toothless is capable of locating the dragons' nest; Stoick disowns his son and sets off for the nest with Toothless chained to the lead ship as a guide.  The Viking attack force locates and breaks open the dragon's nest, allowing most of the dragons to fly out but also awakening the Red Death, soon overwhelming the attack force. Hiccup, Astrid, and their fellow pupils fly in riding the training dragons from Berk, providing cover fire for the attack force and distracting the Red Death. Hiccup almost drowns trying to break Toothless free, but Stoick saves them both, reconciling with his son. Working together, Toothless and Hiccup destroy the Red Death; Hiccup, however, is injured in the fight, losing his lower left leg and requiring a prosthesis. Hiccup regains consciousness on Berk to find himself admired amongst the tribe and by Astrid, with the Vikings and the dragons now living in harmony.

Hunter Prey
 A group of elite interstellar commandos crash lands on a planet while transporting an alien prisoner. Amidst shifting loyalties among the group, they must track down and recapture the escaped creature, alive. The escaped prisoner sets traps and picks off the commandos one by one. When only Commander Karza and Lieutenant Centauri 7 are left, Centauri suggests they kill the prisoner, but the commander insists that he be taken alive, regardless of the mounting cost. The two engage each other in a tense standoff, and the commander reveals that the prisoner, the last survivor of a planet destroyed during a war, has threatened to destroy their planet in retaliation.  The standoff is interrupted when the commander is killed by a sniper shot. The prisoner declines a shot on Centauri and ambushes him. After he knocks the Sedonian unconscious, the prisoner reveals himself as a human. The human steals Centauri's supplies but leaves him alive. The human attempts to access the Sedonian computer database through a stolen communications device but is denied access. Centauri and the human, now able to communicate with each other, discuss the background of the war: Earth was destroyed because it accepted refugees of a Sedonian enemy. When a bounty hunter lands on the planet and attempts to take the human alive, Centauri intercepts him and captures the human, Lieutenant Orin Jericho.  Centauri calls for extraction and sits down to wait. Jericho criticizes the Sedonian atrocities, but Centauri says that he sees nothing wrong with enslaving other races and destroying those who oppose their way of life. When Jericho reveals that the humans have launched a cloaked ship full of enough explosives to destroy the Sedonian homeworld, Centauri appeals to Jericho's sense of honor. Jericho appears to relent, and Centauri grants him access to the Sedonian database so Jericho can reveal the ship's coordinates. However, Jericho later reveals the ship as a decoy and claims to have engineered the entire situation; using his access to the Sedonian database, he relays the coordinates of their homeworld to the true ship, which was hidden on the desert planet.  Disguised in Centauri's armor, Jericho eliminates the Sedonian extraction team. As Jericho enters a hatch buried in the sand, Centauri has a clear shot at him that he declines. Centauri watches through a scope as Jericho drops into the hatch and launches the bomb ship. Centauri recovers a communications device from the extraction team, and Jericho monitors a conversation in which Centauri mutinously responds to his superiors. The Sedonians demand Centauri take action against the human, but Centauri responds that Jericho is already on his way toward the homeworld. As Jericho and Centauri agree that they will have something to talk about when they next meet, Centauri begins to look for the bounty hunter's ship.

Hunt to Kill
 Four years ago, border patrol agent Jim Rhodes ([[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]]) was stationed in Texas. Jim and his partner, his longtime friend Lee Davis ([[Eric Roberts]]), are staking out what looks like an empty trailer. As a gift, Lee gives Jim a watch that has a band made from climbing rope. The band can be unraveled and used in case of emergency.  After Jim calls for backup, Jim and Lee decide to go in. What they find is a meth lab that looks abandoned. But two men come up from a door that was built into the trailer's floor, and they open fire, shooting Lee.  Jim kills the two men, and another man opens fire from under the trailer. Jim makes the man come up through the same door the other two came through, and the man sets the trailer on fire. Lee kills the man, and Lee tells Jim to run, just before Lee dies. Reluctantly, Jim leaves Lee behind, running out of the trailer as it explodes because of the highly volatile chemicals used for producing meth.  Now, Jim and his rebellious teenage daughter Kim ([[Marie Avgeropoulos]]) are living in the mountains in Lowery, Montana. In Reno, Nevada, a man named Lawson ([[Michael Hogan (Canadian actor)|Michael Hogan]]) and his crew of thieves have just robbed the Hotel Palacio casino.  Lawson takes the millions of dollars in [[bearer bonds]] they stole, and leaves a bomb behind in a warehouse to kill the rest of the thieves, who include his psychopathic right-hand man Banks ([[Gil Bellows]]).  Banks defuses the bomb, and with the help of a tracking device, Banks thinks he knows exactly where Lawson is going. Banks and the other thieves—Jensen ([[Gary Daniels]]), Geary ([[Michael Eklund]]), Crab ([[Adrian Holmes]]), and Dominika ([[Emilie Ullerup]])&mdash;vow to find Lawson and get the bonds back.  In Montana the next day, Kim says she's going to her friend Megan's house to help Megan pack for a trip. Later, Jim gets a call from Sheriff Westlake ([[Donnelly Rhodes]]), who says he has Kim in his office for shoplifting. Jim goes to Westlake's office, and finds Banks and his crew there, beating Westlake up.  Banks believes that Lawson is in Montana, and is planning to cross into Canada by foot. Banks wants to find Lawson and get the bonds, and Banks says that Westlake is not being very accommodating. Banks kills Westlake.  Banks wants Jim to guide them through the mountains, to find Lawson. In order to make Jim do it, Banks takes Kim hostage. Banks tells Jim that if Jim screws up in any way, Kim dies.  In the mountains, it's a grueling trek. At one point, Crab tries to rape Kim, and Jim beats Crab up, breaking several of his bones. After that, Jensen fatally shoots Crab. After they find Lawson and the money, and Dominika fatally shoots Lawson, Banks sends Jim plunging off a cliff, and leaves him to die.  Jim survives, and while Banks is forcing Kim to guide him and his crew, Jim carves some sharp points into some branches to make spears out of them, and finds a bag with a crossbow in it. Jim starts hunting Banks and his crew, who have left a wounded Geary behind after Banks beat Geary up for arguing with him.  Jim shoots Geary three times with the compound bow. Geary tells Jim that Banks has taken over Lawson's plan to go into Canada. As Geary begs Jim not to shoot again, Jim shoots an arrow into Geary's chest, killing Geary.  Next, Jim tracks the others down and confronts Jensen, who is a martial arts expert. Jim ends the grueling fight by fatally stabbing Jensen with a broken tree branch.  Banks wonders where Jensen is at, and Banks is feeling uneasy. Dominika, who is using a rope to hold on to Kim so she does not get away, tells Banks that they have to keep moving. Jim tracks them down, and throws one of the wooden spears he carved. Banks jumps out of the way, and the spear hits Dominika, killing her. That infuriates Banks.  Kim tries to escape, but Banks doesn't let her. Taking Kim with him, Banks finds an outpost where there are three Canadian cops, and three ATVs. Banks kills the three cops, punches Kim and knocks her down, and then takes off on one of the ATVs. Jim finds Kim, and he tells her to take one of the remaining two ATVs and go for help while Jim goes after Banks with the other one.  Jim chases Banks down, and they fight. Jim chases Banks down a hill and into what looks like an abandoned factory. Banks even fires a flare gun at Jim. They try to hit each other with shovels. Banks hits Jim a couple of times, and then Jim beats Banks up and hits Banks in the face with a shovel, knocking Banks down.  Jim thinks it's over, but Banks gets back up and tries to shove Jim through the nearby catwalk's guard rail. Jim turns the tables, and shoves Banks down onto the pile of wooden skids below.  Jim, taking the bonds with him so he can return them, goes outside and sees Kim, who says she couldn't leave him. Banks stumbles outside, and he says "Did you think you could take my money?" Jim tells Kim to get back, and Jim gets on one of the ATVs. Banks says "You can't kill me!"  Jim says "When I hunt, I hunt to kill." And then Jim floors it, and rams the ATV right into Banks, pinning Banks up against a wall just inside the building, and gas is leaking from the ATV. Jim starts walking away. Again, Banks says "You can't kill me!" Kim urges Jim to kill Banks for what he's done. Jim fires the flare gun at the ATV, causing an explosion that kills Banks.  Jim and Kim are glad they've survived, but they know they have a long walk home.

She takes the daughter to the park and, when Storch tracks her there, Jennifer knocks him unconscious and kidnaps him. When he wakes, Jennifer anally rapes him with his shotgun and reminds him that she was just as innocent as his own daughter. She has attached one end of a string to the trigger and the other end to the wrist of the unconscious Matthew, who is seated in front of Storch. When Matthew wakes up, and his movements trigger the shotgun, which fires a round that tears through Storch's body and blows apart his face before hitting Matthew in the chest, leaving both men dead.

 The story is set in the 1980s in [[Tronoh]], a small town in [[Perak]]. Twenty-year-old-plus Botak ([[Ah Niu]]) is the younger of a Chinese coffeeshop owner's two sons. A reserved, quiet young lad with prickly hair, having been shaved during childhood (thus gaining his nickname ''Botak'', which means baldy in [[Malay language|Malay]]), he harbours a secret admiration towards Chew Anqi (周安琪), or Fighting-Fish ([[Angelica Lee]]), daughter of a ''char kuey teow'' seller, Yue Feng (月凤) ([[Angela Chan]]), who rents a stall in the same coffeeshop. However, he was never bold enough to confess his love towards her and only conveyed it through drawing portraits of her.  Anqi entered Botak's life when he was a young boy, when Yue Feng sought refuge with Botak's mother after she could no longer stand physical abuse by her husband. This resulted in Anqi (named after 'Angel') often being teased as being fatherless by another childhood friend, a bully yet coward to stronger forces, Ma Linfan (马麟帆) ([[Gary Chaw]]), son of parents who ran an illegal betting syndicate. As children, Anqi, Ma Linfan and 'African' (later called Prince Charming in adulthood) ([[Victor Wong (singer)|Victor Wong]]), often competed playing marbles (bakuli/''buah guli'') or fighting fish with each other. Anqi always won these games. After losing a game, Ma Linfan teased Anqi. She became angry and beat Ma Linfan, thus giving her a strong, fierce personality. Because of this, Anqi was given the nickname ''Fighting-Fish''. Whenever she was upset, she would eat ''[[ais kacang]]'' (spelt as Ice Kacang for the movie) together with Botak, or idle away by the river chatting with him. She would always say that when she grew up, she would return to Penang to look for her father and move to a faraway place, which Botak desired not to realise. As a 20-year-old something adult, she was in a cold relationship with her mother, blaming her being estranged from her father.  Ma Linfan, frustrated at losing to Fighting-Fish each time in fighting fish duels, decided to steal hers, but was caught red-handed and escaped. The second time, which could have been a success, he ended up with a tussle with Fighting-Fish, which had her brushing against him on the lower bodies, causing him to have an erection. Because of this, he believed that he fell in love with Fighting-Fish and went to great lengths to win her love.  Ma Libing (马丽冰) ([[Fish Leong]]), the younger sister of Ma Linfan, was secretly in love with Botak. Throughout the story, Ma Libing was a quiet girl and was often seen holding a packet of iced barley drink (thus the nickname ''Barley-Bing'') whenever she went. She chanced upon Botak's love letter to Fighting-Fish in her brother's room. She became upset after reading the letter and sought to win his love with even more determination. The letter somehow ended up with Yue Feng, who then knew of Botak's secret admiration of her daughter and later discovered Botak's portraits of Fighting-Fish in his room.  After a heated quarrel with her mother over her disapproval of her wanting to marry another man, Fighting-Fish travelled to Penang to look for her father with Botak. They arrived at her old home at [[Chew Jetty]] (姓周桥), a neighbourhood of wooden houses on water, occupied by Chinese families with the surname Chew (周 zhōu), only to discover that her father ([[Eric Moo]]) now operates an illegal gambling den and had remarried with a 5-year-old son and an unborn child. The reunion was disrupted with a raid by the police. Botak, Fighting-Fish and her father managed to escape, but she realised the predicament that her mother was in 10 years ago. She sought to mend ties with her and expressed her desire to further her studies in Singapore.  Botak went after her on the day of her departure, bringing a packet of ais kacang and the unread love letter. During the journey, he was met with two accidents but was only bruised from head to toe. He handed the packet to Fighting-Fish, moving her to tears (she had also discovered Botak's portraits of her during the night before). In the haste, Botak also forgot to hand the letter to her and left the scene drenched from rain. Botak's younger sister submitted one of Botak's portraits to a drawing competition, which won the first prize, even appearing in newspapers. When Botak found out, he ran away in tears, unwilling to embrace the fact that he had hesitated to confess his love to Fighting-Fish.  Towards the end of the scene, all of the young characters had left the town, each on their own career paths. The final scene showed Botak, now older and with a girlfriend, at a pedestrian crossing in [[Kuala Lumpur]], not knowing that Fighting-Fish was also nearby. They both walk away in different directions.

Ik Kudi Punjab Di
 ''Ik Kudi Punjab Di'' tells a richly textured tale from a keenly female perspective set against the backdrop of male-dominated Punjabi society. It does so with a Shakespearean credo of “all the world’s a stage” and a lively cast.  SP Singh ([[Amrinder Gill]]) is a boy from a wealthy family who meets Navdeep ([[Jaspinder Cheema]]), the girl of his dreams,  at his college drama class. They quickly bond, much to the chagrin of bad-boy student Vicky (Aman Dhaliwal) who prizes Navdeep for himself.  The male-chauvinist Vicky has no chance with the progressive-minded Navdeep. Even Singh, the man who she admires enough to call a friend, is in for a shock. Navdeep doesn’t want to get married; she’s intent on being the guardian of her loving parents because the family lacks a male heir. Few scene were also filmed in Post Graduate College Sector 11 Chandigarh.  Singh tests his own view of women by agreeing to all of Navdeep’s demands, including moving in with her family after marriage. This is seen as both revolutionary (by her classmates) and an affront to Punjabi society and tradition.<ref>[https://www.straight.com/article-346790/vancouver/ik-kudi-punjab-di-gives-gender-equality-entertaining-treatment Manmohan Singh's Ik Kudi Punjab Di: gender equality gets an entertaining treatment]</ref>

The property is believed to be haunted by the ghost of the mistress who was killed 70 years before. Thomas Kutty proves to his friends that these ghosts can be easily made by men, by keeping some men and women and disturbing Mahadevan and Govindan Kutty in their sleep. He also tells them that he had stayed there many days before he bought the bungalow, all alone. The three agree to stay with Thomas Kutty in the bungalow and bring their wives along.  In the middle of the journey they see Father Dominic, who warns that the foursome are in the path of bad things. They do not pay heed to his words, but then the housekeepers employed by Thomas Kutty leave on the pretext of the house being haunted. At this point Thomas Kutty reveals that he had lied to the others about having stayed alone in the days before purchasing the bungalow. This revelation startles the four, who start fearing for their own and their wives' safety. After a series of unpleasant events, the four decide to apologise to Father Dominic and ask him for help.  Fr. Dominic accompanies the four to the house and attempts to [[Exorcism|exorcise]] the house.  But things sour on their first meeting, when Dominic mentions he is in no way associated to any church and he is a person involved in paranormal activities.  However, before the 2 leaves his house, he warns of a threat from fire to one of their spouse. This turns true, the same night, when Thomas kutty's wife's dress catches fire, but she is rescued in the nick of time, and to a doctor sent by Father Dominic.  Post this incident, the priest visit's the house, after his earlier advice to stay away from alcohol, meat and women is not followed by the friends, leaving Father Dominic injured in the left hand by an unknown force. Here things takes a bad turn, when the maid servant is seen possessed by the ghost.  While exorcising the ghost, Father Dominic suffers a heart attack, and is declared dead.  Thomas kutty sells the house to Dorothy for half the price.  On their return journey, Mahadevan receives a call from Father Dominic, who says he faked his death. The Father reveals the doctor is his partner, the maid who was possessed was actually one of his minions, who had a twin sister. However Mahadevan reveals that he realised Father Dominic was a fraud, when after his first encounter with the ghost in their house, Dominic accidentally bandaged his right hand instead of his left. Similarly Appukuttan reveals he knew the doctor had lied about his death, as he had checked his pulse.  Govindan reveals they bribed the registar with double the amount and he had revealed that Dorothy and Father Dominic are the same people.  And as a final coup de grace, Thomas kutty reveals they have the property and the amount he has the full amount he paid to Dorothy/Dominic for purchasing the property.

In a Better World

In Sudan, he often treats female patients who are the victims of a sadistic [[warlord]]. Anton is married to Marianne ([[Trine Dyrholm]]), but they are separated, and struggling with the possibility of divorce over an affair that Anton had with another woman. They have two young sons, the older one being 12-year-old Elias (Markus Rygaard).  Christian (William Jøhnk Juels Nielsen), who has just moved from London with his father, Claus ([[Ulrich Thomsen]]), is a new boy at Elias' school. Christian's mother recently died from cancer, and Christian blames his father for lying to him that she would get well, and that, in a late stage of her disease, he "wanted" her to die. Elias is bullied at school, until he is defended by Christian, who assaults the main bully and threatens him with a knife. Christian gives Elias the knife, and both boys lie to the police, and their parents, about the incident.  When Anton separates his younger son from another child, while they are fighting at a playground, the father of the other child, a mechanic, tells Anton not to touch his child and slaps Anton in the face. Anton later visits the mechanic at his work, accompanied by his children and Christian, to discuss the matter, and to show the children that he is not afraid of the man. The mechanic slaps Anton several more times, but Anton does not flinch from the blows.  Later, in Sudan, the warlord comes to Anton's hospital for treatment of his wounded leg. To the horror of his staff and others, Anton treats the man, after demanding that no weapons, and only two of his guards, be allowed inside the hospital. However, after the warlord shows contempt for one of his victims, Anton drags him away from the clinic, allowing him to be beaten to death by local people.  In Denmark, Christian and Elias decide to make a bomb to destroy the mechanic's car, on a Sunday morning so that no passers-by might be hurt. With the fuse already burning, they see two joggers approaching (a mother and her young daughter), and Elias leaves his protected position to warn them. He is knocked unconscious, but saves the joggers from harm. Christian is questioned by the police and then released, with the incident being addressed as an extreme case of vandalism. He goes to the hospital to visit Elias, but Marianne does not let him see the boy, instead telling him that he has killed her son. Christian, believing that Elias is dead, climbs to the roof of a silo, contemplating suicide, but is rescued by Anton. Christian is relieved that Elias is doing well, and he is now allowed to visit him.  Christian is reconciled with his father, and Anton and Marianne have sex, apparently resuming their marriage.

 Suzy Jackson (Froggatt) is a [[Private (rank)|private]] returning from service in [[Iraq]] during the [[Iraq War]] to be reunited with husband and fellow soldier Mark ([[Mel Raido]]) and young daughter Cassie ([[Chloe Jayne Wilkinson]]) in [[North East England]]. Suffering from recurring nightmares related to her experiences while on tour and displaying paranoid behaviour, Suzy distances herself from her husband and tells her army superiors that she is fine aside from some insomnia due to jet lag.  Confused by her rejection of his affections, Mark begins to suspect that Suzy is having an affair with one of her fellow squaddies, his suspicions focussing on Paul ([[Andrew Knott]]). Paul and Suzy do a presentation for some school children arranged by Suzy's teacher sister Marie ([[Janine Leigh]]). At this presentation Suzy reveals her feelings of guilt over the death of an Iraqi girl who was executed by local militia for accepting a bag of sweets offered to her by Suzy.  Concerned about Suzy's state of mind, Paul visits her house to talk to her and she expresses her wish to keep Cassie safe in a way that she failed to do with the Iraqi girl. Mark returns to the house and discovering the pair deep in conversation confronts Paul and threatens him off, beforehand showing him grisly mementos of his own tours in Iraq that he has stored in his garage. He then discovers that Suzy has moved Cassie's bed into their bedroom "for safety", which he believes to be a ruse to avoid intimacy with him and so accuses her of having an affair.  Suzy and Mark go drinking with friends at their local [[working men's club]] and Paul turns up, pleading with Suzy to get counselling and to leave Mark, whom he confronts and accuses of being a psychopath before being bundled out of the club. In the taxi home, Mark picks an argument with the [[Muslim]] driver by making racist remarks. Subsequently their house is daubed in anti-British graffiti, an incident that is witnessed by Cassie, who wakes her father, but missed by Suzy who has taken [[sleeping pill]]s.

Inception
  Dominick "Dom" Cobb and Arthur are "extractors", who perform [[corporate espionage]] using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the [[Unconscious mind|subconscious]] of their targets and extract valuable information through a [[shared dreaming|shared]] [[Dream world (plot device)|dream world]]. Their latest target, Japanese businessman Saito, reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly impossible job: planting an idea in a person's subconscious, or "inception". To break up the [[energy industry|energy]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischer's son and heir, Robert, to dissolve his father's company. In return, Saito promises to use his influence to clear Cobb of a murder charge, allowing Cobb to return home to his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts a powerful [[sedative]] for a stable "[[false awakening|dream within a dream]]" strategy; and Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with designing the [[labyrinth]] of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobb's father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles. While dream-sharing with Cobb, Ariadne learns his subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife Mal.  When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney, Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to Los Angeles, which the team (including Saito, who wants to verify their success) uses as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream. At each dream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a "[[Hypnic jerk|kick]]" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be successful, these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated due to the nature of time which flows much faster in each successive level. The first level is Yusuf's dream of a rainy Los Angeles. The team abducts Fischer, but they are attacked by armed projections from Fischer's subconscious, which has been specifically trained to defend him against such intruders. The team takes Fischer and a wounded Saito to a warehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into "[[Limbo#Cultural references|limbo]]", a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult, if not impossible, and a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream. Despite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.  Eames impersonates Fischer's godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest Fischer reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives the van as the other dreamers are sedated into the second level. In the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur, Cobb persuades Fischer that he has been kidnapped by Browning and Cobb is his subconscious protector. Cobb persuades him to go down another level to explore Browning's subconscious (in reality, it is a ruse to enter Fischer's). The third level is a fortified hospital on a snowy mountain dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Cobb takes Fischer into the equivalent of his subconscious. Yusuf, under pursuit by Fischer's projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge and initiates his kick too soon. This causes an avalanche in Eames' level and removes the gravity of Arthur's level, forcing him to improvise a new kick synchronized with the van hitting the water. Mal's projection emerges and kills Fischer; Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs to his wounds. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to rescue Fischer and Saito, while Eames sets up a kick by rigging the hospital with explosives.  Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to Limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology. Sedated for a few hours of real time, they spent fifty years in a dream constructing a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to return to reality, Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem (an object dreamers use to distinguish dreams from reality) and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real. However, when she woke up, Mal still believed that she was dreaming. In an attempt to "wake up" for real, Mal committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of Professor Miles.  Through his confession, Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes Fischer up with a kick. Revived at the mountain fort, Fischer enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in Limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in Limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake on the plane and Saito makes a phone call.  Upon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies him to his home. Using his totem—a [[spinning top]] that spins indefinitely in a dream world but falls over in reality—Cobb conducts a test to prove that he is indeed in the real world, but he ignores its result and instead joins his children in the garden.

The Infidel (2010 film)
 Mahmud Nasir is a husband, father and a British Muslim who listens to rock music, particularly the long deceased pop star Gary Page, and occasionally drinks alcohol. His son, Rashid, wishes to marry Uzma, but they need the blessing of her devout Muslim cleric stepfather, Arshad Al-Masri. Mahmud agrees to put on the act of devout Muslim for the occasion.   Mahmud, while clearing out his recently deceased mother's house, stumbles across an adoption certificate. Mahmud learns he was actually adopted by his Muslim parents when he was two weeks old; his birth parents were Jewish, and his real name is Solomon "Solly" Shimshillewitz. This comes as a shock to Mahmud, who is somewhat anti-Semitic, exemplified by his relationship with his American Jewish neighbour, Leonard "Lenny" Goldberg.  During an argument with Lenny, Mahmud lets slip his ethnicity and his real name, and Lenny mentions a similarity to the name, Isaac "Izzy" Shimshillewitz, a local man, who may be Mahmud's biological father. Mahmud tracks his father to a Jewish old age home. He tries to visit, but a rabbi refuses him entry, saying it would be a shock for Izzy, a Jewish man, to see his son, a Muslim, and advises him to learn to act more like a Jew if he desires to see his father before he dies.   Lenny agrees to teach Mahmud what he knows about being a Jew, such as dancing like Topol and learning basic Yiddish, but the frequent trips to Lenny's house arouse Mahmud's family's suspicions, especially when Mahmud's [[kippah]] is spotted during a Muslim rally. Mahmud publicly burns the kippah in desperation as a symbol of his supposed hatred of Jews. Mahmud later attends a [[Bar Mitzvah]] with Lenny and unintentionally tells a very crude joke to the audience in broken Yiddish, only to be greeted with laughter from the attendees. Mahmud and Lenny attempt to see Izzy, but the rabbi still refuses to let Mahmud inside when he cannot say his [[Shema Yisrael|Jewish Sh'ma]] or name the [[Five Books of Moses]] in Hebrew.  Mahmud and Lenny have a bitter argument and Mahmud storms off, vowing to tell his family the truth immediately, but when he gets home, he sees that Arshad, Uzma and their friends are already there. Arshad, impressed with Mahmud's supposed devotion to Islam after having seen him burn the kippah on TV, gives his blessing to Rashid and Uzma's union, but the police arrive, along with the media and a crowd of angry Jews and supportive Muslims, to arrest Mahmud for burning the kippah. In desperation, he yells out in front of everyone that he is Jewish, exonerating him of the crime. A disgusted Arshad leaves with Uzma and his friends.  Mahmud's family leaves him for his dishonesty, one of his colleagues at work resigns, and he starts drinking. He becomes suicidal, but is rescued by Lenny, who saw his announcement on the news. Mahmud goes to the old age home and demands to see his father, but learns that his father has already died. Mahmud is allowed inside Izzy's room where he finds a video of his announcement in Izzy's video machine, which Lenny had sent Izzy. Mahmud's only solace is a sticker on the video with the name "Solly" on it, indicating that even after all these years, Izzy still remembered his long-lost son.  Mahmud appears at Arshad's next rally and delivers a speech on behalf of himself, Jewish citizens and Muslims. Mahmud also tells the crowd of another discovery which he's made: Arshad is actually Gary Page, who staged his own death following his fall from fame after a racist remark, resurfacing much later with a whole new identity as a devout Muslim cleric. Arshad escapes from the rally, comically dressed in his old Gary Page clothes. Rashid and Uzma, dressed in Indian clothing, are married in a Bollywood style wedding, attended by both Muslims and Jews. Lenny has taken a job with the mostly-Muslim taxi firm at which Mahmud works.

One night, Dalton is drawn to the attic when he hears creaking noises and sees the door open by itself.  He falls from a ladder while investigating and sees a figure in the shadows.  Hearing his terrified screams, Renai and Josh rush to his aid.  The next day, Dalton falls into an inexplicable coma.  After three months of treatment without result, Renai and Josh are allowed to take Dalton home.  Soon after, paranormal activity begins to occur; Renai begins hearing voices over the [[baby monitor]] when no one is in Cali's room.  Foster says that Dalton sleepwalks at night, Renai sees a frightening figure of a man in Cali's room, who vanishes when Josh comes and the burglar alarm is repeatedly triggered for no reason.  After Renai finds a bloody hand print on Dalton's bed, she questions Josh about the house, but he ignores her.  That night, Renai is attacked by the figure from Cali's room, and the Lamberts decide to abandon the house and move elsewhere.  In the new house, Renai sees the ghost of a dancing boy who leads her to Dalton's room.  Josh's mother, Lorraine, visits them one day, and says she had a dream in which a dark figure in Dalton's room replies "Dalton" when she asks what it wants.  At the same time, she sees the same dark figure, a monstrous red-faced demon standing behind Josh and screams, while Dalton's room is ransacked and Dalton himself is found lying on the floor.   Lorraine calls [[demonologist]]s Elise Reiner, Specs, and Tucker.  Elise senses a presence in the house and upon entering Dalton's room sees something on the ceiling.  Specs draws the demonic, red-faced figure Lorraine saw.  Elise explains that Dalton is not in a coma; he was born with the ability to travel mentally to the [[astral plane]], and had been doing so in his sleep, believing his abilities to merely be dreams.  He had traveled too far and became lost in a purgatory realm called "The Further", a place inhabited by the tortured souls of the dead.  Without his mental presence, Dalton's body appears comatose and spirits can use it to enter the physical world.  Josh is skeptical until he realizes that drawings in Dalton's bedroom hinted at his astral projection abilities and the same red-faced demon Lorraine had seen.  Elise performs a seance to communicate with Dalton, but they contact the demon who uses Dalton's body to attack them until it is stopped by Elise.  Elise reveals that her acquaintance with Lorraine is decades old, because she previously performed the same service on Josh when he was eight years old.  Josh was terrorized by night terrors that always included the parasitic spirit of an old woman.  Lorraine dismissed his nightmares until the spirit showed up in her photos of Josh, progressively getting closer each time.  Josh also possesses the ability to astral project, though he [[Memory inhibition|had suppressed his memory]] of the ability years prior with Elise's help.  Dalton has inherited this trait from him.  Elise tells Josh that the only way to rescue Dalton is for him to go into the Further.  Elise puts Josh in a trance and he is able to project himself to their previous house.  He goes to the attic, but is attacked by the same figure that attacked Renai.  After defeating him, Josh enters the Demon's lair, where Josh finds Dalton chained to the floor.  Josh frees him, but they are caught by the demon while the spirits of the Further invade the real world and terrorize Elise, Renai, and the others.  After managing to escape, Josh confronts the old woman that haunted him as a child.  The old woman dissolves into darkness after Josh shouts at it to leave him alone.  When Josh and Dalton return to their bodies, they wake up in their new home and the spirits seem to disappear.  As they celebrate the apparent end of their ordeal, Elise starts packing her equipment with Josh, when she senses that something is wrong, noticing Josh's hands look old and dirty, she takes a photo of him.  Josh, enraged by this, strangles Elise to death.  Renai is horrified when she discovers Elise's dead body and searches for Josh.  Renai picks up the camera and sees that the image Elise took of Josh is the old woman that haunted him as a child, implying that Josh has been possessed.  Josh suddenly puts his hand on her shoulder, says "''Renai, I'm here''",  and she turns around and gasps.

Ip Man 2
 [[Wing Chun]] master [[Ip Man]] and his family move to [[Hong Kong]] in the mid-1940s after their escape from [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese-occupied]] [[Foshan]]. There, Ip desires to open a school to propagate his art, as well as make a living during the difficult times, but he has difficulty attracting students due to his lack of reputation in the city. One day, a young man named Wong Leung appears and promptly challenges Ip to a fight, but is easily defeated. Wong leaves humiliated, only to return with some friends to gang up on him. Ip beats them as well. Stunned and impressed by his skills, Wong and his friends become Ip's first students, bringing more disciples to help the school thrive.  Wong is later caught posting promotional posters for the school by some [[Hung Ga]] students. One of them challenges Wong to a fight and loses, but his friends take Wong hostage in revenge and demand a ransom from Ip. Ip goes to the local wet market as directed, but the meeting ends in a confrontation with a growing mob of Hung Ga students. Ip and Wong fight their way outside to meet Jin Shanzhao, a martial artist and former bandit, who comes to their rescue with his own gang. The students' master and head of the coalition of Hong Kong martial arts clubs, Hung Chun-nam, arrives to break up the fight. Ip introduces himself, and Hung informs him that before setting up a school, he needs to attend a special fighting ceremony to test his worth. Ip, Wong and Jin are subsequently arrested by Officer Fatso for disturbing the peace but are later released on bail. Hung and Fatso are then shown to be acting as reluctant collectors for the martial arts schools (including Hung's) as part of a protection racket headed by Superintendent Wallace, a corrupt officer in the Hong Kong police.  Ip attends the ceremony and defeats his first challengers, before striking a draw with the last challenger, Hung. Ip is allowed to keep running his school on the condition that he pay his monthly protection fees, but he declines. Hung thus has his students loiter in front of the Wing Chun School and harass anyone interested, causing a street brawl between them and Ip's disciples. Ip is thus forced to close up and move the school nearer to home. Ip soon confronts Hung, who blames him since he wouldn't pay his protection fees, whereas Ip criticizes Hung's management of his students. Hung insists that he is doing what he must and also insists they finish their fight, but during this encounter, Ip stops Hung from accidentally kicking his son as he suddenly appears, earning respect from him. Ip leaves, and the next day, Hung invites him to a British boxing match he has helped to set up, quietly coming to terms with him.  The boxing competition allows for a demonstration by the various martial arts schools to help promote themselves and their Chinese culture. However, the event's star boxer, Taylor "The Twister" Miller, an arrogant, racist and brutal man, openly insults and attacks the students, causing chaos as the masters try to restore order. Hung accepts Twister's challenge to a fight so that he can defend his culture. Although Hung has the upper hand at first due to his wider range of skills, he later weakens from his asthma and is eventually beaten to death by Twister, as he refuses to concede and allow the man to insult his culture and people. News of Hung's death rapidly spreads throughout the enraged Chinese populace, causing a scandal that spurs Wallace to hold a press conference where he lies that Hung was the one who challenged Twister, Hung's death was an accident and that he was a weakling who died after a few punches. Twister announces that in order to clear his name he will accept any challenge from the Chinese to participate in a fair, public boxing match, but boasts on that he could kill every Chinese boxer in Hong Kong and that he doubts any of the Chinese are brave enough to face him. Ip Man arrives and challenges Twister to a fight.  As his wife goes into labor, Ip finishes training and begins his fight with Twister, using his more diverse techniques and great speed against Twister's sheer muscle. Ip later receives an illegal punch from Twister, and is banned from kicking due to the judges changing the rules during the match, allowing Twister to seemingly overwhelm him. Inspired by Hung's patriotic spirit, Ip changes his strategy by attacking the boxer's arms and eventually defeats Twister. While the Chinese celebrate, Wallace is arrested by his superiors for corruption, as Fatso has secretly reported him before the match. Ip then gives a speech to the audience, stating that despite the differences between their race and culture, he wishes for everyone to respect each other regardless of their status. Both the Western and Chinese audience give him a standing ovation while Twister's manager walks away, unhappy at the defeat. Ip goes home and reunites with his family, including his newborn second son, Ip Ching. Ip is later introduced to a boy named [[Bruce Lee]] who wishes to learn Wing Chun in order to beat up people he does not like. Ip smiles and simply tells him to come back when he has grown up.

Iron Man 2
 In Russia, the media covers [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]]'s disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], whose father [[Crimson Dynamo#Anton Vanko|Anton Vanko]] has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later, Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father [[Howard Stark|Howard]]'s legacy.  The [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant [[Pepper Potts]] CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]], where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, [[Justin Hammer]], fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, [[U.S. Air Force]] Lieutenant Colonel [[War Machine|James Rhodes]] dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the U.S. Air Force.  [[Nick Fury]], director of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], approaches Stark, revealing "Rushman" to be Agent [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]] and that Howard Stark was a S.H.I.E.L.D. founder whom Fury knew personally. Fury explains that Vanko's father jointly invented the arc reactor with Stark, but when Anton tried to sell it for profit, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material; a hidden message in the [[diorama]] of the 1974 Stark Expo proves to be a diagram of the structure of a new element. With the aid of his computer [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]], Stark synthesizes it. When he learns Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.  At the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of the Mark II armor to Rhodes. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko seemingly commits suicide by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.  At a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of Stark's difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism. In a [[post-credits scene]], S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Phil Coulson]] reports the discovery of [[Mjolnir (comics)|a large hammer]] at the bottom of a crater in a desert in New Mexico.

Jaggubhai
 Jagannathan ([[Sarath Kumar]]), fondly known as Jaggubhai, is an Indian police officer with sharp methods. His way of dealing the criminals strikes terror in the underground world. Tough is just an ordinary word to describe this upright, straightforward police officer. Jaggubhai is sent to Australia on an important mission to deal with antisocial elements there. In Australia, Jaggubhai meets Ilavarasi (Srisha) and they both fall in love with each other. Jaggubhai fails in his mission for which he came to Australia and the brief romance with Ilavarasi also ends abruptly. Jaggubhai returns to India as a dejected officer, failing in his official duty and personal life.  But fate had something in store for him. 20 years later, or as he says it 21 years later, he gets a call from Australia stating that Ilavarasi is dead and has left him a will. He reaches Australia and is shocked to know that the brief encounter with Ilavarasi had resulted in a daughter Monisha ([[Shriya Saran]]), now a teenager. Jaggubai realizes that he has left behind his daughter and her wish that he should protect her.  Monisha thinks that he is her mother’s friend and tries to act cranky. Threat comes in the form of some antisocial elements who want to eliminate Monisha. These thugs were the same ones who had tricked Jaggubai 21 years earlier and who, as Jaggubhai learns, had killed Ilavarasi. Now, it is Jaggubhai’s duty to save his only daughter and settle old scores with the thugs. He now meets his former colleague Kaaliyappan or MIB ([[Goundamani]]). With his help, he kills the thugs and their leader. Monisha accepts Jaggubhai as her father.  
The Jailhouse
 Small town, the American dream. A blue-collar family living the idyllic rural lifestyle. Nothing is out of place except for the lack of white picket fences and the old jail that occupies the second floor of their century old home. Seth Delray ([[C. Thomas Howell]]) knew the possibilities before he moved his wife and two kids into the old jailhouse, but the Sheriff assured him that it would be an act of God to put that place back into service. Times are tight, and it was just too good of a deal to refuse. That is, until the county jail caught fire. The Sheriff hands were tied and he had to put the displaced inmates anywhere he could find iron bars with a locking door. The Delray's were his only option. For Seth the worst wasn't the locked up criminals above his living room, it was the mortal fear in his children's eyes, the piercing cold looks from his wife. The deep, dark creeping recognition that something had happened there, something terrible, something that would rip his soul with a hundred year old hands.  
Jackass 3D
  [[Beavis and Butt-head]] introduced the film by explaining 3D technology. The opening sequence features the cast lining up and then being attacked by various objects in [[slow-motion]]. The opening sequence, as well as many of the stunts, were filmed with [[Vision Research Phantom|Phantom high speed cameras]] which shoot at 1,000 frames per second.  ''Jackass 3D'' follows the same premise of the previous movies and the television series. It is a compilation of various pranks, stunts and skits, and has no plot. Some of the stunts featured included [[tether ball]] being played with a [[beehive]] filled with [[Africanized bee]]s, one of [[Ehren McGhehey]]'s teeth being pulled out with a [[Lamborghini Murciélago]], using super mighty [[glue]] to take off chest hair and much more. The final stunt includes [[Steve-O]] being launched in the air while inside a [[portable toilet]] (which was achieved by connecting the port-a-potty to bungee cords) filled with [[excrement]].  The closing skit is done in a similar fashion as the introduction, but uses explosions as objects are thrown at the cast to the tune of Tchaikovsky's [[1812 Overture]].

Jonah Hex (film)
  During the [[American Civil War]], [[Jonah Hex]] ([[Josh Brolin]]) served as a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] cavalryman until his commanding officer, [[Quentin Turnbull]] ([[John Malkovich]]) ordered him to burn down a hospital. Hex refused, and was forced to kill his best friend, Turnbull's son Jeb. After the war, Turnbull and his enforcer, Burke ([[Michael Fassbender]]), tie up Hex and force him to watch as his house is burned down with his wife and son inside. Turnbull then brands Hex's face with his initials and leaves him to die.  Days later, [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] revive Jonah with their mystical powers, giving him the ability to temporarily resurrect the dead.  When Turnbull apparently dies in a hotel fire, Hex satisfies his hunger for vengeance by turning to [[bounty hunting]] and sears the branded side of his face to cover up Turnbull's initials.  In [[1876]], Turnbull, alive and well, hijacks a train carrying components of an experimental "superweapon", slaughtering its military guards and civilian passengers alike.  When informed of the theft, [[Ulysses S. Grant|President Grant]] ([[Aidan Quinn]]) surmises that Turnbull is planning a [[terrorist]] attack for July 4, during the American centennial. Grant instructs Army Lieutenant Grass ([[Will Arnett]]) to hire Hex to stop Turnbull.   Jonah spends the night in a brothel with Lilah ([[Megan Fox]]), a [[prostitute]] attracted to the disfigured man for more than just professional reasons. As he prepares to leave the next morning, Grass' men burst in and tell him that Turnbull is still alive. They show him a captured thug from the train hijacking who told them Turnbull is headed northwest, before dying during interrogation. Jonah briefly resurrects the man, who knows only that he was recruited by ex-Confederal Colonel Slocum ([[Tom Wopat]]), who is running an illegal [[deathmatch]] pavilion in [[South Carolina]].  With the help of a corrupt Washington aristocrat, Adleman Lusk ([[Wes Bentley]]), Turnbull steals the remaining components of the weapon, invented by [[Eli Whitney]].  When Hex confronts Slocum in South Carolina, Slocum refuses to talk, sarcastically telling Hex to ask Turnbull's dead son, Jeb, where his father is. Jonah then overpowers Slocum's men and throws Slocum himself into the ring, to be killed by his own fighters. After setting fire to the ring, he frees a dog being tormented by Slocum's handlers, which starts to follow him around.   In a cemetery in [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania|Gettysburg]], Jonah digs up and resurrects Jeb (an uncredited [[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]]). Jonah apologizes for killing Jeb, and says that his father has to be stopped before he murders more people. Jeb reveals that his father is at Fort Resurrection, before returning to the afterlife.  After entering the fort, Jonah confronts Turnbull, killing several of his men, but Turnbull escapes and Hex receives a near-fatal wounding from Burke, but escapes. He collapses in a field, hovering near death for several days. Turnbull, anticipating Hex's return, sends Burke to bring him "something Hex loves," so Burke kidnaps Lilah from the brothel. Turnbull test-fires the "superweapon" on a small town in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which is leveled to the ground, killing hundreds. When Grant receives the news, his aide reports that they have no idea where Turnbull will strike, and that they do not have enough military manpower to guard every centennial celebration.  Hex is found by his Native American allies, who perform a ceremony that heals him. He relays a message to Lt. Grass that Turnbull plans to attack [[Washington, D.C.]], then rides to Independence Harbor alone to stop him. When Jonah attempts to infiltrate the harbor where Turnbull's [[ironclad warship]] is anchored, Burke spots him and attacks him. Hex overpowers and kills him, then resurrects him just to incinerate his body completely. Turnbull holds Lilah at gunpoint and forces Jonah to surrender. With Jonah and Lilah captive in the hold of his ship, Turnbull steams toward Washington. A [[monitor (warship)|monitor]] commanded by Lt. Grass intercepts Turnbull, but is quickly destroyed with the weapon.  Lilah frees herself and Jonah, and holds off the guards while Jonah rushes up to the deck to stop Turnbull. Turnbull gains the upper hand and orders the weapon to fire, but the fight takes them into the engine room, where Hex jams the weapon's belt feeder, trapping its trigger shell. He then brutally beats Turnbull and traps his neck in a gear, before saving Lilah. The pair jump into the water just as the trigger shell ignites, killing Turnbull and all his men. The next day, President Grant rewards Jonah with a large sum of money, a full pardon, and offers him a job as Sheriff of the entire United States. Jonah declines, but assures the president that if they need him, they'll be able to find him. Lilah is waiting for him outside the [[White House]], and they leave the city together.  Jonah visits Jeb's grave to apologize for having to kill his father, then rides out of the cemetery with his dog.

Heading to her basement to attempt suicide, she curses the hidden tormentor and refuses to give them the satisfaction of seeing her hang herself; but as she tries to remove the noose from her neck, the stool beneath her is kicked away, leaving her to die. Miles away, Sara's twin sister Julia collapses at work, sensing something amiss with her sister.  Finding Sara's corpse, Julia is suspicious, and is repeatedly tormented by the feeling of another presence nearby. Despite her husband Isaac's insistence that she stop investigating as the stress is causing her eyes to deteriorate faster, she lures him to a hotel where Sara stayed after an eye surgery that was not successful.  The following morning, Julia is approached by a janitor who warns her of 'men who live in shadows' and informs her that the parking lot where Sara's mysterious boyfriend kept his van was under 24-hour surveillance. Sending Isaac to collect the tape, he vanishes. After Julia goes looking for him, so does a security guard.  Julia is convinced that the 'invisible man' stole the tape, sabotaged the cameras and has kidnapped Isaac, though the police are skeptical. Returning to the Hotel Romero to question the janitor, they find him electrocuted in the bath from a fallen light above the water: however, the police declare it accidental. Isaac's credit card is found to have been used in a nearby hotel, however, when Julia and the inspector return to the house to look for any sign of his return; another power cut sends Julia stumbling through the darkness, brushing against what appears to be a man in the basement where Sara died. Upstairs, the inspector finds a note left on the bed, before being alerted by Julia's screams. When he arrives with his flashlight, Isaac's corpse is found swinging from the spot where Sara died; with Julia cowering, unable to see at all - her vision has gone completely.  At the hospital, the police inform a grieving Julia that the note found on the bed was written in Isaac's hand, declaring that he could not live without Sara, with whom he had been having an affair for six months. However, an eye donor is found, so the operation to save Julia's sight goes ahead. She is told she must wear bandages to protect her eyes for two weeks, and returns to Sara's house despite her doctor's protests with a day carer, Iván, to assist her. Strangely, the key she found, which she believes was left by Sara's boyfriend, has disappeared. At first, Julia is plagued by disorientation and nightmares while convinced that somebody is lurking in the house; but Iván's patience and coaching help her regain her independence. Four days before Julia is due to remove her bandages, a starlit dinner culminates in a kiss, after which Iván leaves hurriedly, uncomfortable. That night, an unseen man almost succeeds in drugging Julia while she sleeps; however, she wakes, panicked, and accidentally hits the intruder as she sits upright. Terrified, she flees to the house of Sara's neighbour, Señor Blasco, who makes advances on her: as she turns to escape his house, she finds the key she had lost hanging on the wall - believing that Blasco is the 'invisible man', she escapes, paging Iván, who finds her hiding outside in the rain and escorts her to his apartment.  In Iván's home, while he goes to get his spare bed for him to sleep in, Julia hears the voice of Blasco's shy daughter Lía, who tells her that her nurse - Iván - is the 'invisible man' who tormented Sara, has walls covered with photographs of Julia and her twin, and now seeks to drug her with sedatives slipped into her tea. Lía tells Julia to meet her in the bathroom moments before Iván returns. Conflicted, Julia goes to the bathroom where, four days early, she tears off her bandages, desperate to see for herself if Lía's word is true. A sudden bang causes Iván to come looking for her. Still in the bathroom, she replies that she heard it as well but did not know what it was. Iván heads out of the apartment momentarily. Julia exits the bathroom and sees Iván's walls are covered with photographs of the twins as well as Lía's bloodied body that is held to the wall with a kitchen knife through her mouth. Iván returns to the apartment to find Julia sobbing in the room with Lía. She pretends that she is crying because her operation has failed and she is blind which he believes. Behind Iván's back, she swaps her drugged tea for his; however, he guesses what has happened and leads her to a chest freezer where the body of the real nurse Iván is hidden. Julia's scream betrays the fact that she can see the corpse, and her ruse is over. Terrified, Julia suffers another attack of blindness.  When her vision returns, Iván has driven Julia back to Sara's house, where she escapes and flees to the house of Señora Soledad. 'Iván' pursues her into the house and addresses Soledad as 'Mamá', revealing himself as her missing son Ángel. A candle and pair of reading glasses betray the fact that Soledad is not in fact blind as she knocks Julia out, at which an enraged Ángel almost strangles his mother and injects her eye with a substance designed to break down the optic nerve and render her blind again. Julia awakens in the basement of Sara's house, where Ángel tells her he loves her and wants them to be together as long as her sight is gone; since blind people are the only ones who sense the existence of a man who lives in shadows. Julia escapes and manages to contact the police before being cornered by Ángel when the police finally arrive. She uses a flashlight to show the police a bloodied Ángel hiding in a corner of the room. Finally visible, he is defeated, and slits his own throat while begging the police not to look at him.  At the hospital once more, Julia is told the damage to her new eyes is irreversible and she will not see the dawn. Using her last few hours of vision, she goes to say goodbye to Isaac's corpse, where it is revealed that he donated his eyes to her.

The horror of Chinese government design in Tibet is being matched by the destruction of global economics elsewhere. Zanskar, ringed by high Himalayan mountains in northwest India, one of the most remote places on the planet, has been safe until now. But that’s changing.  In 3–5 years a road connecting Padum, the heart of Zanskar, with Leh, the heart of neighboring Ladakh, will be finished. The route which previously took up to two days by car will take only 4–5 hours. As economic growth descends on Zanskar it will bring with it an end to this unbroken Buddhist social tradition. Will the native language, culture, and religious practice be able to survive?  The Dalai Lama has instructed two monks from Zanskar’s Stongde Monastery to do everything in their power to insure that it does. The monks are building a school to educate the children from surrounding villages in their own language, culture, history, and religion. Presently, the government school teaches none of those subjects, and is closed most of the year. The nearby private school also doesn’t teach those subjects and is additionally unaffordable for the area’s poor families. At Stongde, along with indigenous traditions, the children will be educated in the best Western curricula.  The monks are racing against the clock. While they complete the school they are also placing local children in other schools and monasteries in the city of Manali and beyond. This requires walking over a 17,500 foot pass. On foot. On horseback. Led by yaks... Whatever it takes.

Just Wright
  Leslie Wright ([[Queen Latifah]]) is a straight-shooting physical therapist and die-hard basketball fan who is tired of being a guy's best friend or as Morgan called her the "homegirl" type. She and her god-sister, Morgan ([[Paula Patton]]), are living together; Morgan dreams of becoming a [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] trophy wife.  After a [[New Jersey Nets]] basketball game, Leslie helps star player Scott McKnight ([[Common (entertainer)|Common]]), at a gas station. He offers to open her door for her, but the task proves difficult as the door to her old car is stiff and hard to open. She has a dent in the side of her door that she refuses to get fixed because her grandfather gave her the car and he had a dimple in his left cheek just like the car.  He invites her to his birthday party, where she shows up with Morgan. He meets Morgan and suddenly takes an interest in her. After a quick relationship, Scott proposes to her.  At the [[2009 NBA All-Star Game]], Scott suffers an injury that could possibly ruin his career (along with the rumor explained below). Morgan suggests that he enlist the help of Leslie, since she did not approve of his previous gorgeous physical therapist, so Leslie moves into their home. Rumors circle that Scott's career would end quickly if he did not recover by the playoffs, which causes Morgan to leave Scott through a letter.  Scott becomes extremely upset, discouraged to continue recovery. Leslie encourages him and helps him get back in the game, the two of them spending a lot of time together. Scott is able to return to the NBA right before the playoffs, winning his first game back. Leslie and Scott decide to spend a romantic evening together, but Leslie wakes up to Morgan at Scott's door hoping to reconcile. Leslie quickly moves out as Scott and Morgan reunite. Because Leslie helped Scott recover in such a short amount of time, many teams offered her the position as an athletic trainer. Most likely to make the [[Philadelphia 76ers|Sixers]] her new team, Scott quickly stops her when he realizes that he is in love with her. They are shown a year later, with Leslie working as one of the [[Brooklyn Nets|Nets]] team athletic trainers and she and Scott are now married.  
Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths
 In an [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]] where the roles of the heroes and villains are reversed from their counterparts in the mainstream DC Universe, heroic analogues of [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (called the Jester) are stealing a device called the "Quantum Trigger" from the headquarters of the [[Crime Syndicate of America|Crime Syndicate]]. When an alarm is tripped, the Jester sacrifices himself to allow Luthor to escape and kills J'edd J'arkus and Angelique (alternate versions of [[Martian Manhunter]] and [[Hawkgirl]] respectively) with a bomb. Luthor is nearly captured by the remaining Syndicate members ([[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]], [[Superwoman]], [[Power Ring (DC Comics)|Power Ring]], [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Owlman (comics)|Owlman]]) but escapes to the Earth of the heroic [[Justice League]] by activating a dimensional travel device.  Luthor locates a police station, but is mistaken for the evil Luthor and ends up strip-searched. The Justice League is summoned and [[Superman]]'s [[x-ray]] vision confirms Luthor's reversed organs indicate that he is from a parallel Earth and that the evil Luthor is still incarcerated at [[Stryker's Island]]. The Justice League take the alternate Luthor to the [[Justice League Watchtower|Watchtower]], where they learn of the Syndicate threat. As the Justice League debates the matter, Luthor hides the Quantum Trigger on the satellite. With the exception of Batman, the rest of the Justice League (Superman, [[Wonder Woman]], [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]], [[Wally West|Flash]] and Martian Manhunter) travel to Luthor's Earth.  Arriving at the parallel Justice League's base, the heroes attack Syndicate targets. After a successful series of raids in which they capture Ultraman, the League confront United States President [[Deathstroke|Slade Wilson]], who releases Ultraman and explains that acceding to the Syndicate's demands saves millions of lives. His daughter, [[Rose Wilson|Rose]], however, regards him as a coward. Martian Manhunter inadvertently reads her mind and explains that as a military man her father actually holds life more dear than others. Martian Manhunter later foils an assassination attempt on Rose, and the pair fall in love.  Owlman has developed a weapon, the Quantum Eigenstate Device or Q.E.D., which the Syndicate intend to use as the equalizer to the threat of a nuclear reprisal. When pressed by Superwoman, Owlman reveals that he's secretly planning to overthrow Ultraman and take control of the Crime Syndicate. He also admits the weapon can [[Planet killer|destroy entire worlds]]. Believing there are many parallel Earths, and that each one develops from the choices that each person makes, Owlman becomes obsessed with the idea that [[nihilism|nothing he does can possibly matter]], as there will always be parallel worlds where he explored another option. As a result, he searches for Earth-Prime, the very first Earth from which all other universes originated, intending to use the Q.E.D. to destroy it and spark a chain reaction that will erase the entire multiverse, as it is the only action that would not result in the creation of another universe. Superwoman agrees to help him, as it would give her the power to kill everyone who's ever lived. Owlman sends Superwoman with three of her lieutenants to the League's dimension, and on the Watchtower they battle Batman, [[Aquaman]], [[Black Canary]], [[Black Lightning]], [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]], and [[Red Tornado]]. Superwoman and one of her lieutenants escape with the Quantum Trigger, but are followed by Batman.  Batman defeats Superwoman and summons the League. J'onn and Rose bond, and Rose decides to learn the location of the Syndicate base to allow the Justice League to confront them. The League arrive at the Crime Syndicate's moon-base with the captive Superwoman, and eventually battle the Syndicate. Owlman fights off Batman and takes the Q.E.D. bomb to Earth-Prime, finding it to be uninhabited and lifeless, having suffered an unknown cataclysm that caused it to leave solar orbit. Luthor speculates that a speedster might be able to vibrate and match the temporal vibration of the teleported Q.E.D. device and open a portal. Flash volunteers but Batman states that he isn't fast enough, only [[Johnny Quick]] is. Johnny agrees and opens a portal.  Batman pursues Owlman to Earth-Prime and engages in a brutal battle with his doppelganger. Batman manages to teleport Owlman and the Q.E.D. device to another uninhabited Earth, and triggers the Q.E.D. Seeing what is about to happen, Owlman does not even attempt to defuse the bomb, simply saying "It doesn't matter" after realizing that an alternate Owlman in the multiverse would do the opposite action regardless of his choice. The bomb destroys the alternate Earth, killing Owlman in the process. Batman returns to the Syndicate's Earth, where the strain of acting as a vibratory conduit has aged Johnny Quick to near death. Before dying, Johnny correctly deduces Batman lied about Flash not being fast enough and knew what would happen. Despite this, he shows no ill will toward Batman, dying with a smile. Martian Manhunter returns, accompanied by President Wilson and the U.S. Marines, and together they arrest Ultraman, Superwoman, and Power Ring.  Wilson thanks the heroes for helping save their world and tells them he had ordered the Marines to support the local police forces and resume on arresting the remaining members of the Syndicate. Although Rose asks Martian Manhunter to remain with her, the group return to their dimension. Batman and Superman later discuss a membership drive with the five heroes summoned previously greeting the Justice League.

As he is adding sugar-free cubes into his coffee, Tanu notices him from a distance and again assuming that he is adding poison to his coffee rushes to his side and knocks down the tumbler from his hand before he takes his first sip. Siddharth, by now evidently tired of her unsolicited good Samaritan  ways, lashes back. He tells her that he was only trying to see the depth of the cliff at the suicide point, and was trying to splash some water on his face at the lake and that he was adding sugar-free cubes into his glass, all of which she misunderstood as suicidal attempts by him. He walks away after assuring her that he is NOT suicidal.  Later, at a railway station, while waiting for his train Siddharth sees Tanu running into the station trying to catch a departing train.

Kanasemba Kudureyaneri
 A story has a beginning, middle and an end, but it's not necessary that they be in that order. Girish Kasarvalli's award-winning ''Kanasembo Kudureyaneri'' (based on Amaresh Nugadoni's ''Savaari'') is a classic example of this.   The film applies a back and forth narrative to tell the story of gravedigger Irya and his belief in Siddhas, nomads whose arrival is considered auspicious. It is believed that if the death of a person coincides with the arrival of a Siddha, the soul is sure to go to heaven.    Irya and his wife are made known of their arrival through dreams. In fact for Irya, if a Siddha appears in his dream, it denotes a death in the village. However, once despite dreaming of a Siddha, Irya is told that there is no death in the village. He goes to the house of an ailing village elder, anticipating his death but is sent back by the caretaker saying all is well.  As if this is not enough, a Siddha not arriving in the village despite his wife having dreamt of his arrival, crushes Irya's faith in Siddhas, who he believes are his protectors. Is Irya an easy prey to superstitions or are scheming villagers exploiting his dreams for their own good?   The film beautifully exposes the materialistic attitude of people. It leaves you wondering whether destroying one's beliefs is the only way to progress; whether there are chances of beliefs being mistaken for superstitions just because the ones who hold these beliefs are not part of the mainstream.   While the first half of the film may have you raise your brows at Irya's and Rudri's dreams and faith, the second half sets out to suggest that what may look superstitious to one may be a way of life to the other. It also shows how sometimes what looks real may be unreal and vice versa, and that with faith in our beliefs, we can achieve anything.  
Kattradhu Kalavu
    
The Karate Kid (2010 film)
   Dre Parker and his mother Sherry Parker move from [[Detroit]] to [[Beijing]] after Sherry gets a job transfer at her car factory. After a day in a park, Dre develops a crush on a young [[violinist]], Meiying, who reciprocates his attention, but another boy Cheng, a rebellious [[Chinese martial arts|kung fu]] prodigy whose family is close to Meiying's, attempts to keep them apart by violently attacking Dre, and later bullies him at school. During an attack, the maintenance man, Mr. Han comes to Dre's aid, and when Cheng and his friends try to interfere, Han defeats each of them in close combat, revealing himself as a kung fu master.  After Han mends Dre's injuries using [[Cupping therapy|fire cupping]], Dre asks if Mr. Han could teach him kung fu. Han refuses, but meets Cheng's teacher, Master Li, at the Fighting Dragon studio to make peace. Li, who teaches his students to show no mercy to their enemies, challenges Dre to a fight with Cheng. Han instead proposes that Dre compete against Li's students at an open martial arts tournament, and also requests the students leave Dre alone to train in time for the tournament. Li accepts the offer, but warns Han that if Dre does not show up during the tournament, he will personally bring pain to Han and Dre.  Han promises to teach Dre kung fu and begins to train Dre by emphasizing movements that apply to life in general, and that serenity and maturity, not punches and power, are the true keys to mastering the martial art. He teaches this by having Dre go through various actions with his jacket, which teaches Dre [[muscle memory]] moves. Han then takes Dre to a Taoist temple in the [[Wudang Mountains]] where he trained with his father, and Dre witnesses a woman making a cobra reflect her movements and drinks the water from an ancient Taoist well.  As Dre's friendship with Meiying continues, they share a kiss at the festival. Dre persuades Meiying to [[Truancy|cut school]] for a day of fun, but when she is nearly late for her violin audition which was brought forward a day without their knowledge, her parents deem him a bad influence and forbid her from spending more time with him.  During the course of their training, Han gives Dre a day off. Dre goes to Han that night and finds Han, apparently drunk, smashing a car he was working on. Han tells Dre that he crashed the same car years ago, and that his wife and ten-year-old son were with him and died in the car crash. Han fixes the car every year but smashes it to remind himself of what happened, which makes Dre work much harder in his training in order to help Han forget about the incident. Han assists Dre in writing a note of apology to Meiying's father in Chinese; he accepts and promises that Meiying will attend the tournament to support Dre.  At the tournament, the under-confident Dre is slow to achieve parity with his opponents, but soon begins beating them and advances to the semifinals, as does Cheng, who violently finishes off his opponents. Dre comes up against Liang, one of Li's more sympathetic students and the least vicious of Dre's tormentors, who (under Li's goading) severely hurts Dre's leg and Liang is disqualified as a result, while Dre is taken to the infirmary.  Despite Han's insistence that he has earned respect for his performance, Dre convinces Han to mend his leg by using fire cupping in order to continue. Dre returns to the arena, facing Cheng in the final. Dre delivers impressive blows, but Li orders Cheng to break Dre's leg. Cheng is horrified at the order, but obeys under Li's intimidation. As the match continues, Cheng seizes Dre's leg and delivers a vicious blow, doing further damage. Dre struggles to get up, and attempts the reflection technique to manipulate Cheng into changing his attack stance. Cheng begins reflecting Dre's movements and it goads him into charging Dre, but Dre flips and catches Cheng with a kick to his head, winning the tournament along with the respect of Cheng and his classmates. Cheng, instead of the presenter, awards Dre the trophy, and the Fighting Dragon students bow to Mr. Han in respect, accepting him as their new master.  ===Alternate ending=== Li attempts to strike Cheng out of anger for Cheng's failure in the ring, but Han appears and prevents Li from doing so, resulting in a vicious fight with Li. While Li momentarily bests Han, Han pins Li down with a leg to head lock, and angrily reminds him his own rule: no mercy. Before Han attacks his nemesis, Dre appears, and discourages Han from his intentions, the Fighting Dragons students bow to Mr. Han, and the two leave. As a defeated and humiliated Li rises, Sherry and Meiying leave. However, Sherry stops to turn around briefly and punches Li in the jaw, presumably from finding out that he ordered his students to brutally attack her son.

Khaleja
 A remote village named Pali in Andhra Pradesh is struck by an unknown disease, with several villagers dying each month. The village Tantrik ([[Rao Ramesh]]) predicts that a powerful man will come to their rescue as God. He assigns his assistant Siddhappa ([[Shafi (actor)|Shafi]]) with the duty to find a man with such supernatural power and bring him to their village.  Meanwhile, Alluri Seetarama Raju alias Raju ([[Mahesh Babu]]) is an eccentric orange cab driver who lives in Hyderabad with his grandfather ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]), a teacher. Raju is currently in Rajasthan in search of the family of a man named Bilavar Singh. In his journey, he meets a Gemini TV reporter Baabji ([[Sunil (actor)|Sunil]]), who comes to Rajasthan to shoot a travel documentary.  Raju introduces himself to Baabji and tells him the reason for him being in Rajasthan. He describes a woman named Subhashini ([[Anushka Shetty]]), whom he considers brings bad luck to him. Previously, he encountered her in various occasions in which she damages his taxi due to her reckless driving. Raju lands in the hospital one day when Subhashini mixes epsom salt laxative in Raju's coffee thinking that it meets her at a coffee shop to collect the compensation for his taxi's damages from her, though this was meant for someone else. For this reason, he considers her bad luck.  One day, he drives two men, geology scientist Dr. Paranji and his assistant Bilavar Singh to their destination the Geological Survey of India. But he sees them getting gunned down by some henchmen, and Bilavar falls out of a window and lands straight on Raju's taxi, completely destroying it. Since Bilavar has insurance, Raju's boss tells him to deliver the insurance check of Rs. 5,00,000 to Bilavar Singh's family in Girdwala, Rajasthan and get Rs. 1,00,000 in return to pay for his car damages.  Meanwhile, Subhashini's father, business magnate Durga Prasad ([[Tanikella Bharani]]), brings her a match, another business magnate GK's ([[Prakash Raj]]) son ([[Amit Tiwari]]). The main reason for the proposal is to establish a strong business partnership. GK's son takes her to Rajasthan for a date. But Subhashini runs away after she sees a condom packet drop from his pocket and realizes his true intentions. GK finds out about it and informs Durga Prasad and promises to bring Subhashini back. He sends his henchman Govardhan ([[Subbaraju]]) to Rajasthan in search of Subhashini. To Raju's dismay, Subhashini finds Raju and Baabji and learns that she is in Rajasthan. Subhashini, Baabji, Raju, and a [[botanist]] Tom Cruise ([[Ali (actor)|Ali]]) find Girdwala and hand over the check to Bilavar Singh's family, but Raju refuses to ask for the Rs. 1,00,000 when he sees the family's poverty. Tom remains in the village as the villagers want to punish him for cutting a sentimental plant. Baabji goes away with his shooting team but does not offer them a ride as he is scared of Subhashini's reckless behavior.  As Raju and Subhashini return, Govardhan's men attack, stab Raju, and take Subhashini after knocking her unconscious. But Raju survives, fights, and kills almost all of Govardhan's men, while Govardhan escapes from the scenario leaving Subhashini behind. Just as Raju goes unconscious, Sidhappa finds him and believes he is the God after seeing the omens. Sidhappa and Subhashini take Raju to Pali, where the villagers treat his wounds. After waking up, he finds all of the villagers praising him as their God. He finds out from Subhashini that they are in Pali, and that the villagers see him as the supernatural godsend that the Tantrik was describing about, and who will rescue the village. Initially reluctant to help them out, he escapes to [[Hyderabad]] where he hands over Subhashini to her father. After realizing that Tom and Siddappa followed him to Hyderabad, Raju puts fate to the test and when he understands the concept of deityhood and god, he makes it a goal to solve the mystical series of deaths in the village. After tracking down a doctor (who works for GK), the dean of the medical college run by GK (who set up the medical camp in Pali), Govardhan, and Miriyam ([[Brahmanandam]]), GK's lawyer, Raju discovers that the plastic factory in Pali deposits its wastes in the drinking water source nearby, thus contaminating and killing the villagers. While Tom and Siddappa think this is the end of the story, Raju suspects that there is more to the story, that so many villagers are dying due to the plastic factory waste that is being contaminated with drinking water, and GK actually wants the villagers in Pali to die, which was why GK had the Government's medical camp removed periodically. He finds GK's assistant ([[Veda Sastry|Archana]]) and suspects that she has something to do with GK's plan as she did not get into his taxi along with Geologist Paranji, indicating that she knew beforehand that he was going to be killed. Raju inquires her about GK's intentions, who reveals that Paranji discovered earlier that there is a large [[iridium]] deposit under Pali, which is worth billions, and informed GK about it.  Despite GK's warning to Paranji of not revealing it to anybody else, he tries to inform the Geological Survey of India about the deposits, which was why he and Bilavar Singh, who was with him, were killed that day. GK suspects that Raju might also know about the iridium deposit because he was with Paranji when he was killed which was why GK sent Govardhan to kill him, not to retrieve Subhashini. Raju was lured to Girdwala under the cover of delivering the insurance check to Bilavar Singh's family (GK had the insurance documents planted) and was attacked by Govardhan. GK needs the strong plastic glass from the plastic factory to pack the iridium. He wanted the Pali villagers to vacate (to dig the iridium ore without trouble) on their own to avoid suspicion, which was why he poisoned Pali's environment using the plastic factory's waste.  GK kills his assistant and Govardhan for their failures. GK then heads to Pali to kill all the villagers before the truth goes out to the public. The village head warns GK that Raju is their God, that he would bring death to GK, and keep the Pali's population at 534, not letting any more die in the process. Raju arrives at Pali along with Sidhappa. GK immediately shoots Sidhappa and kills him, reducing the population to 533. Before dying, Siddhappa looks into Raju's eyes, dying happily after. Enraged, Raju kills all of GK's goons and severs GK's palm. A terrified GK starts escaping with Raju in pursuit. Raju catches up to him, and GK dies when a religious knife hanging from a nearby tree falls and stabs him in the neck after Raju curses him to die. The village head finally reveals that Raju fulfilled his mission as God to save the village, because although Sidhappa was killed, another baby was born to keep the village's population at 534. The film ends with a new flag being put up in honor of the new birth.

Now, Himanshu has one ambition since childhood, that is to have a memorable, legendary love story. It is all together another matter that he is not in love with anyone and neither is he capable of getting any sensible girl to like him. But as Babuji ([[Anang Desai]]) often wisely says, "for every idiotic Praful ([[Rajeev Mehta]]), there is an even more idiotic Hansa made", his prophecy turns out to be true. Parminder ([[Kirti Kulhari]]), Himanshu's neighbor, falls in love with Himanshu for no logical reason and the 2 get engaged to get married. That is when the story line takes a turn – Himanshu realizes on the eve of the wedding that the impending ceremony would mean impending doom to his desire to have a legendary love story, as nothing interesting has happened in his love story to make it memorable.

So, in order to make the Himanshu–Parminder love story a legendary one, Himanshu, along with Babuji, Praful, Hansa and Jayshree ([[Nimisha Vakharia]]), sets out to stall the wedding. And then begins their journey to create all those missing stages in Himanshu's love story in order to make it legendary.

At the request of Sheriff Bob Maples ([[Tom Bower (actor)|Tom Bower]]), Lou visits Joyce Lakeland ([[Jessica Alba]]), a prostitute who is having an affair with Conway's son, Elmer ([[Jay R. Ferguson]]). When Joyce objects to Lou's treatment of her, he violently beats and spanks her until her buttocks are bruised. Joyce [[sadomasochism|enjoys pain]], and she and Lou begin a passionate love affair. Joyce suggests that Lou would never leave town with her, but they devise a plot to extort $10,000 from the Conways. Sheriff Maples and Chester Conway ask Lou to oversee the pay-off. But Lou has other plans: he brutally beats Joyce to the point he believes her to be dead, and when Elmer arrives, Lou shoots and kills him. He then plants the gun on Joyce, hoping to make the scene look like the two have killed each other, however Joyce survives the ordeal. Then Conway announces his intention to see her executed for killing Elmer.  Lou's reputation begins to falter: his girlfriend and fiancée Amy ([[Kate Hudson]]) suspects him of [[Infidelity|infidelity]], and the county district attorney Howard Hendricks ([[Simon Baker]]), who has arrived in town to investigate the murders, suspects that Lou could be the killer. Lou accompanies Sheriff Maples and Conway in taking Joyce to the hospital in [[Fort Worth]]; Conway wants her alive so he can interrogate her. Lou waits in a hotel room while the surgery takes place. Maples tells him that Joyce died on the operating table. Lou and Maples return to west Texas.   Back at his home, Lou discovers explicit photographs of a woman inside a Bible. The woman was Helene, a housekeeper and babysitter from his youth who bears a resemblance to Joyce. Lou recalls that Helene introduced him to [[sadomasochism]], urging him to strike her. Lou burns the photos.  Hendricks arrests Johnnie Pappas ([[Liam Aiken]]), a local youth whom Lou had previously befriended as a suspect in the murders of Elmer and Joyce. He was found with one of the $20 bills that Elmer was supposed to give to Joyce in the pay-off; Conway had the bills marked in order to blackmail Joyce if she didn't leave town. Because Lou is close to Johnnie, Hendricks asks Lou to persuade him to confess, but it was Lou himself who had given Johnnie the marked $20 bill as a tip. In the prison cell Lou confesses to Johnnie that he was the one responsible. When they are alone in his cell, Lou hangs Johnnie to make it appear as though he committed [[suicide]] out of guilt.  Johnnie's death only makes the town more suspicious of Lou. Journalist and union organizer Joe Rothman ([[Elias Koteas]]), who had previously suggested that Conway had Lou's foster brother Mike killed, implies that he knows that Lou killed Elmer and Joyce. Lou coaxes Amy to elope with him as he proposes to her. To sate Lou's violent predilections, she acquiesces to his desire to spank her. An [[alcoholic]] bum ([[Brent Briscoe]]), whom Lou had previously burnt with a cigar, has been trailing Lou and knows that he was responsible for the murders of Elmer and Joyce. He demands $5,000 to keep quiet, to which Lou agrees. On the day which Lou and Amy had planned to elope, Lou beats Amy to death, and when the bum sees her body, he runs for help. Lou chases the bum, shouting that he has murdered Amy. Another deputy, Jeff Plummer ([[Matthew Maher (actor)|Matthew Maher]]) opens fire on the bum, and shoots him dead.   The next morning Plummer informs Lou of Sheriff Maples suicide, convinced of Lou's guilt and heartbroken over his crimes. Hendricks and Plummer try to get a confession from Lou, who cockily refuses. They have a letter that Amy intended to give to him before they eloped, in which Amy begs him to come clean. Lou is arrested, and after a week in prison is sent to an [[insane asylum]]. While there, he suffers hallucinations of Amy and Helene. After a few weeks, a slick lawyer named Billy Boy Walker ([[Bill Pullman]]) has him released and drives him home. Walker has been hired by Joe Rothman to protect the union man. Lou tells Walker his whole story and concludes that he doesn't want anyone else to die.    Lost in his violent fantasies, Lou douses his home in gasoline and alcohol, arms himself with a knife, and sits in his study to await retribution. As police vehicles and armed policemen arrive, Lou sees a car pull up with Hendricks, Conway, Plummer and the still-alive Joyce. As Joyce tells Lou that she refused to cooperate with the authorities, Lou tells her he loves her, then stabs her in the stomach. Plummer opens fire, hitting both Joyce and Lou and igniting the gasoline in the house. Outside, the approaching policemen see the house engulfed in a huge fireball, which it appears Lou has ignited to kill himself.  
Killers (2010 film)
  After a break-up with a boyfriend, an overcautious Jen ([[Katherine Heigl]]) travels to [[Nice]], [[France]], with her parents ([[Tom Selleck]] and [[Catherine O'Hara]]). After getting into an elevator to go to her hotel room, she meets Spencer Aimes ([[Ashton Kutcher]]). Spencer asks her out for drinks, and she accepts. The scene then changes to Spencer sneaking onto a boat, putting a remote controlled bomb on the bottom of a helicopter, then taking out a guard. He then swims back and goes on the date with Jen.  After the helicopter takes off, Spencer triggers the bomb using his phone.  After a night of drinking, Jen reveals that she is not the spontaneous person she's been pretending to be and, in return, Spencer bluntly tells her that he's an [[assassin]], albeit unhappy about being one. Unfortunately, she's already passed out and hasn't heard. In spite of this, Spencer decides that Jen's the woman he's been looking for and decides to marry her. When Spencer tells his boss, Holbrook ([[Martin Mull]]), his plan, the response is that quitting is not an option. Spencer is defiant and goes ahead with his plan.  Three years later, they are settled into their new normal life. After Spencer surprises Jen with a remodeled office, she gives him a birthday surprise: tickets to Nice to celebrate his birthday and their three years. Because of his dubious connections to Nice, Spencer is less than enthusiastic. When Jen's friends ask about his reaction, they take it as a sign that he might be getting bored and fill her head with doubts.  Meanwhile, Spencer gets a postcard from his old boss and the ultimatum to take another assignment. While trying to refuse him long distance, Jen's father shows up to take Spencer to dinner, so Spencer hangs up the phone, prompting suspicion in Mr. Kornfeldt. This is fueled further when Jen's dad sees the postcard and quizzes him about the XOXX (hugs and kisses), being odd coming from a former boss. Stopping home to change, Spencer finds that the dinner invitation is just a detour to bring him to a surprise party. While Spencer navigates drunken friends, Jen's friends continue to fill her head with doubts over Spencer's lack of enthusiasm for the Nice trip. This is further irritated, when the following morning, despite her attempts to be physical with him, Spencer rushes Jen off on her business trip.  A little while later, Jen comes back (without having gone on her trip) to find Spencer being tossed around their house by Henry ([[Rob Riggle]]), Spencer's best friend and co-worker. Spencer screams for her to get his gun (of which she was unaware) and she shoots Henry in the arm. While interrogating him, Henry reveals that there is a $20 million bounty on Spencer's head. An unidentified sniper takes shots at them, and Spencer and Jen flee.  Henry goes after them; and, after a car chase through the neighborhood, they end up in a construction zone, where Henry crashes his car.  Spencer rams him into a trench, impaling his car on [[rebar]] and killing him.  They then go to the hotel room where Spencer's old boss is staying but find that someone has already killed him. Jen demands that they go to her Dad for help, but Spencer disagrees. In the middle of their argument Jen vomits and declares that she might be pregnant.  Heading back to his office for Jen to take a pregnancy test, Spencer is attacked by his secretary ([[Katheryn Winnick]]) and realizes that there are others who know about the contract. Jen then reveals that she is pregnant and is leaving Spencer. Left alone, Spencer is attacked by a delivery driver, who is then run over and killed by Olivia ([[Lisa Ann Walter]]), Henry's wife, another killer vying for the contract. She then tries to run over Spencer, but Jen returns and smashes Olivia's car into a fuel tank, which Spencer then shoots at and explodes, killing Olivia. The two discuss their possible future and return to their neighborhood, which is holding its annual [[block party]]. When they first arrive, they are attacked by two more assailants who, in a chase through backyards, crash their car, giving Jen and Spencer a chance to flee into the block party. As they walk through it, they receive many suspicious looks from neighbors. They enter their house to retrieve guns and their passports. Spencer is grabbing the guns when he is attacked by the two assailants again, whom he eventually kills.  Meanwhile, one assassin, Kristen ([[Casey Wilson]]), one of Jen's best friends, holds Jen's mother as a hostage in a [[Mexican standoff]] with Jen. Jen's father arrives and kills Kristen. He then explains that he was the one who put out the bounty on Spencer. He knew of Spencer's previous work all along, and hired the neighbors and co-workers three years before, in case Spencer started working for his old boss again, who Jen's father says had "gone dirty." After seeing the postcard from Holbrook in Spencer's office, he came to the conclusion that Spencer had re-accepted his old job and [[Sleeper agent|activated]] the assassins. He reveals that he had been an operative as well, and that he was actually the target Spencer was supposed to kill in Nice three years earlier.  In a standoff between Spencer and Jen's father, he does not trust that Spencer is really out of the game.  Wanting to prove that he really did get out, Spencer drops his gun, and tells Jen's father he has no intention of killing him. Jen, now convinced, reveals her pregnancy to her parents.  Jen's father, after killing one last wounded assassin, drops his gun as well. The family makes peace by building a trust circle, in which Spencer reveals that English is not his first language, and that he wanted to be the first one to say "I love you" to Jen. The movie ends showing Spencer and Jen's father working on some wires near Spencer and Jen's baby's crib. Spencer has grown a moustache just like Jen's father. Spencer and Jen then leave to let Jen's mom and dad babysit. They all leave the room, but Spencer comes back in to activate the lasers protecting the baby.  
The Killing Jar (film)
 Several people are gathered at a diner—Noreen, a friendly and talkative waitress; Lonnie, a dim-witted cop; Jimmy, the short-tempered owner; Billy and Starr, a young couple on their way to elope; John, a meek salesman on his way to New York City; and Hank, a quiet regular. A radio is playing, and the group hears of an entire family murdered gruesomely in a neighboring county. Noreen, shocked, becomes increasingly agitated and nervous after an aggressive man in a black leather jacket enters. Noreen covertly asks Lonnie to investigate the newcomer, but Lonnie brushes aside her concerns. After Noreen spills the man's coffee, Hank urges Lonnie to do something.  When Lonnie questions him, the man becomes antagonistic and belittles Lonnie, who pulls his gun on the man. Lonnie sheepishly apologizes when Hank reports the man's vehicle does not match the police reports. As the patrons relax, the man leaves the diner, only to return with a shotgun and pistol. After he kills Lonnie and Jimmy, he takes the rest of the diner hostage. He orders Noreen to collect all the wallets and cell phones, and he forces Hank to dispose of the corpses. The gunman catches Noreen trying to sneak a cell phone, and threatens to kill her if she does it again. Hank quietly proposes that they rush the gunman, as he has used up several rounds already, but Noreen and John refuse. The lovers, frightened, huddle at another table.  A new customer enters the diner, introduces himself as Mr. Greene, and seems minimally surprised by the situation. He hands the gunman a suitcase full of money and addresses him as "Smith". When Greene attempts to leave, the gunman takes him hostage and demands answers. After being severely beaten, Greene eventually reveals that he is a corrupt land developer who hired a professional hit man to kill the neighboring family when they refused to sell their land to build a shopping mall. With no heirs to the family's life insurance policy, Greene would buy the land from the bank.  Disgusted, the gunman kills Greene for not giving enough information and reasons that one of the people in the diner must be the hit man. Noreen begs him to let them go, but the gunman says that he intends to see the situation through. He also tells her he uses extreme methods to extract information from certain people.  The gunman immediately discounts Noreen and the young couple. He first interrogates Hank, who, after being shot in the leg, reveals that he is an ex-soldier who is cheating on his wife. After being shot, he admits that he has sex with women and men at truck stops, gas stations, and bathrooms. Satisfied that Hank has held nothing back, the gunman kills him.  He then handcuffs and interrogates John, who quickly gives up his pretense of being a salesman. John matter-of-factly recounts killing the family but rejects comparisons between himself and the gunman, whom he calls insane. The gunman threatens to torture John, but John coolly laughs it off as pointless, as he will not reveal any details about his employers except that they are powerful and well-connected.  John turns around his interrogation, and the gunman reveals that he is also ex-military, forced out because of mental instability and jailed for two years. With the situation now reversed, the gunman unsuccessfully attempts to bargain with John. Convinced that whatever he does will result in his being marked for death by the organization, the gunman panics and kills the young couple. As the gunman prepares to kill John, Noreen lunges at him with a knife and slashes his throat. John gratefully asks her to free him, but when she hesitates, he again drops his friendly demeanor and tries to cruelly bully her into surrendering. Noreen admits that she has trouble standing up for herself and that she is afraid of change but surprises him by instead shooting him with the last round in the pistol. Rather than call the police, she plays music on the Jukebox, takes the money and walks out of the diner.  
King of Devil's Island
  At the Bastøy prison for youths, the newest arrival, Erling "C19," soon becomes friends with Olav ("C1"). Under the rule of Håkon, Erling comes to terms with the harsh winter, the mistreatment by the staff, and the hated Housefather Bråthen. Later, Olav sees Bråthen molesting "C5", Ivar, a timid, shy boy in the laundry room. When he raises this with the Governor, the boys are severely punished and C5 is reassigned to duties far away from Bråthen. However, after hearing that Bråthen expects him to be back in the laundry room tomorrow Ivar drowns himself in the freezing Norwegian waters, while the rest of the boys are chopping wood. Bråthen is apparently fired, to the overwhelming delight of the other boys. Olav is paroled and is planning to leave, but on the way to the departing boat, walks past Bråthen, who had been sent away on a shopping trip until Olav, the only witness to Ivar's rape, had left Bastøy. Olav and Erling attack Bråthen and as punishment they are locked in the freezing solitary confinement. They are freed by Bjern, one of the few Bastøy boys who has remained on the island as a caretaker. Olav again pursues Bråthen, and the attack inspires a mass uprising. The boys ransack the prison, and drive away the staff. Bråthen is repeatedly hanged and released and then beaten.  The barn he is in is set ablaze, but Erling drags him to safety. The navy is brought in and violently puts down the uprising. Olav and Erling manage to escape across a frozen fjord back to the mainland, but Erling falls through a gap in the ice close to shore and quickly freezes to death.   Olav is shown later, older, as a member of a ship's crew, watching Bastøy pass by the side of his ship.  
Kimi ni Todoke (film)
 Sawako Kuronuma has always been avoided by her classmates because her name, her appearance and her manner too strongly resembles that of "Sadako", the main character in the 1998 horror film ''[[Ring (film)|Ring]]''. They believe that when one stared into Sawako's eyes for more than three seconds, bad luck will befall the person. They also believed that she could summon ghosts. These rumors got worse because Sawako is unable to express her views straightforwardly. All of the students call her 'Sadako', instead of her real name, and tell over and over again misfortunes that have befallen other students supposedly because of Sawako. However, Sawako is a kind person whose motto is "to do one good thing once a day". Shota Kazehaya, on the other hand, is an outgoing student who is popular with his schoolmates, especially the girls.  On the first day of school, Sawako helped Kazehaya, who was lost, to find his way to the school. Since that day, Kazehaya treats Sawako with kindness, making Sawako respect and admire him. Sawako also made friends with her classmates Chizuru Yoshida and Ayane Yano after she agrees to play the role of the ghost in their class's "Bravery Challenge" activity. With their help, she manages to gain self-confidence and interacts better with her classmates. The rumors about her also began to subside. However, Ume Kurumizawa, an admirer of Kazehaya, starts to become jealous of the way Sawako is being treated by Kazehaya.  Strange rumors like "Ayane has slept with 100 guys" started spreading. Sawako distances herself from her new-found friends, believing that they were targeted by the rumors because they were close to her and she did not want them to get hurt because of her. Both Chizuru and Ayane felt hurt after they overheard Sawako saying that she did not regard them as friends. However, with advice from Kazehaya, Sawako stands up to the people who were spreading the rumors. Sawako did not back down in spite of violence, and Chizuru and Ayane were greatly touched by Sawako's actions. Their friendship becomes stronger.  At a sports festival, Kurumizawa, on the pretense of being Sawako's friend, confessed her feelings for Kazehaya to Sawako and asked Sawako for her help. Sawako refused, saying that Kazehaya was also special to her. Kurumizawa then tried desperately to turn Sawako's attention to Ryu, even to the extent of secretly arranging a meeting between them so that she could "coincidentally" walk past with Kazehaya. However, the plan backfired as Kazehaya got jealous and grabbed Sawako's hand and pulled her away. Chizuru and Ayane later discovered Kurumizawa's plot and cornered her, warning her about breaking apart Kazehaya and Sawako. However, Sawako begged both of them not to reveal this incident to Kazehaya. Kurumizawa later confessed her feelings for Kazehaya, who rejected her but said that he was happy that she confessed to him.  As winter came, Sawako's father requested that she take a bus home instead of walking because he was concerned for her safety. When applying for the student concessionary pass, her teacher misplaces her student handbook, which contains treasured items such as a [[cherry blossom]] petal Sawako picked up on the day she first met Kazehaya, causing her grief. Kazehaya and Sawako also begin to spend less time together, because Kazehaya used to walk Sawako home. Kazehaya then tries desperately to go with her on a date and to confess to her, but Sawako always misunderstands and invites Chizuru along.  Out of desperation, Kazehaya suddenly confesses his feelings for Sawako and asks her to be his girlfriend. He also asked if she could go out on a date with him on Christmas Eve. Sawako rejected him and ran to the bus, leaving Kazehaya feeling dejected. To make matters worse, she did not turn up at a Christmas Eve party that she promised to go to, leaving Kazehaya in a foul mood at the party. Chizuru and Ayane suggest that she go apologize to Kazehaya on New Year's Eve, when he volunteers at a festival every year. However, Sawako's father's orchestra has a concert that night, leaving Sawako conflicted over which to choose. Sawako eventually decides on Kazehaya, and apologizes to her father. Meanwhile, Kazehaya, after seeing Sawako's handbook that the teacher passed to him, finally understands Sawako's feelings towards him. Eventually, they meet up just after New Year's Day and properly convey their feelings.  
Killjoy 3
 Some time passes and Killjoy is once again called, this time through a blood pact. Immediately he resorts to using the blood spilled by his summoner to create three underlings, which he dubs new evil clowns, ''Punchy'', ''Freakshow'' and ''Batty Boop''. However the man does not name a victim for Killjoy, leaving the scene without doing so. This causes Killjoy and his posse to vanish and return to their world.   Meanwhile, a college student named Sandy is watching over her professor's house while he is gone from town, along with her friends Rojer, Erica and Zilla. While fetching the morning newspaper, Rojer finds a sack on the professor's doorstep. He carries it into the house, however Sandy protests against opening it. They decide to uncover the contents that night when Erica and Zilla return, and doing so, they find an ornate mirror which they hang on the professor's wall. That night [[Mirror#Literature|Zilla inspects the mirror]] on his own, whereby he is transported to [[Killjoy (film series)|Killjoy's world]]. Killjoy stages a boxing match between Zilla and Punchy which nearly kills Zilla, however his friends discover his physical body and successfully resuscitate him, rescuing his consciousness from Killjoy's world. Furthermore, a barrier has been placed over the house, trapping the group indoors.   Erica is the next to fall victim to the mirror, and soon enough Killjoy makes his presence known by communicating with the three students through the mirror, beckoning them to join him in his world. He reveals his plan to dine on Erica, and invites the group to his feast. The professor (the man who summoned Killjoy earlier in the film) returns home and is quickly informed of the situation, however he is not surprised, having summoned Killjoy in the first place. Sandy, Rojer, Zilla and the professor enter Killjoy's world through the mirror, and each person faces a different demon. Zilla manages to convince Punchy not to be Killjoy's slave, the professor escapes Freakshow and Rojer is seduced by Batty Boop, while Sandy leads Killjoy on long enough for Boop to jealously confront him. Killjoy berates her for ironically coming onto another man, and then destroys her. The group then fails to save Erica at the dinner, before Killjoy's posse slices her apart on a silver platter; it is revealed that Erica was pregnant, and Killjoy's magic causes her fetus's umbilical cord to almost strangle Zilla. A battle ensues wherein Freakshow is vanquished with salt (which repels evil spirits) by Zilla, Rojer is killed during the encounter by having his head whacked off with a [[Mallet|giant mallet]] by Killjoy and Zilla suggests Punchy take this opportunity to strike back against Killjoy, who slays him for his insolence.    Having allowed the deaths of Erica and Rojer as distractions, the professor finally enacts his plan to say the name Killjoy originally went by in antiquity, in an effort to subdue him. He also reveals himself to be the father of Michael, whose soul Killjoy exploited before destroying. The professor chose not to name a victim while initially summoning Killjoy because the target of his revenge was ultimately Killjoy himself. The clown applauds the professor for his deviousness in using both himself and the students alike to achieve his revenge. Killjoy proclaims that the souls he consumes become a part of him, and the spirit of Michael appears, consoling his father. With the professor's guard down, Killjoy slays him as well by smashing him with the giant mallet. The two survivors, Sandy and Zilla, resort to laughter to quell the clown, but Zilla is killed when Killjoy taunts them while actually trying to be humorous. Sandy continues to laugh at Killjoy while shouting his original name, which incapacitates him long enough for her to return to the mirror and be transported to her world. Killjoy then explodes in a fit of innards. The Magic mirror disappeared from the wall. Sandy is shown to be committed for insanity, having not stopped laughing since the ordeal, and under the suspicion of murdering her friends and the professor.  
Killer by Nature
   
The King of Fighters (film)
 At a museum in [[Boston]], Rugal Bernstein steals three relics: The Kagura Mirror, the Yagami Necklace and the Kusanagi Sword. He uses them to disappear into a dimensional portal to awaken the mythical entity known as the [[Orochi]], which grants limitless powers. The sword is revealed to be a fake and the quest is delayed. Mai Shiranui is told by an injured Chizuru Kagura the real sword is with Saisyu Kusanagi at a mental institution. She is warned she must defeat Rugal and her boyfriend, Iori Yagami, should not be involved. At the institution, Mai meets a catatonic Saisyu and his son, Kyo, but Iori's presence suddenly breaks Saisyu's catatonic state, and the elder Kusanagi threatens to kill Iori before losing consciousness and dying.  At another hospital, Chizuru is recovering from her injury and is informed by her colleague, Scott, that Rugal has altered the King of Fighters database and issued challenges to fighters around the world. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Terry Bogard enters Chizuru's room, demanding information on Rugal's whereabouts and the tournament. She tells that different dimensions exist, but he does not believe. Chizuru tells Terry to go to Seattle and ask Mai, who is an undercover operative sent by the CIA to infiltrate Chizuru's organization a year ago.  At a cemetery in [[Seattle]], where Saisyu is buried, Kyo and Iori confront each other. Iori explains that both Kusanagi and Yagami clans were destined to be enemies. Mai hitches a ride with Kyo to his home, where she explains that she is looking for the Kusanagi Sword. Kyo tells her that centuries ago, a Yagami ancestor attempted to release the Orochi, but it consumed him with murderous rage. Kyo's ancestor killed the Yagami and returned the Orochi into its world. Mai tells Kyo that Rugal is out to unleash the Orochi. Kyo wants to confront Rugal, who destroyed his father's mental state.  At a hotel, Mai and Kyo meet up with Iori and Terry. Rugal is using the tournament dimension to merge it with the real world. After Mai blows her cover in front of Kyo, Iori puts on his Bluetooth headset and enters the tournament dimension to confront Rugal. There, he defeats Rugal's servants, Mature and Vice, only to have his mind consumed by the Orochi.  The next day, Kyo is lured into the tournament dimension, where he first fights Rugal and loses, but is allowed to live as a warning. Kyo brings out his ancestral sword and joins Chizuru and Terry into the tournament after Mai is dragged in by Rugal. When the four meet up, they are separated into different dimensions, with Kyo fighting Rugal, and Mai and Terry facing Mature and Vice. Rugal is about to decapitate Kyo, when Iori appears and intervenes. Rugal reveals to Kyo that several years back, he battled Saisyu, Chizuru and Iori over control of the Orochi. During that fight, Iori allowed the Orochi to take over his body, defeating Rugal, but also destroying Saisyu's mental state by bashing his head against a wooden barrier several times. This leads to a fight between Kyo and Iori. Kyo slashes Iori in the back, releasing the Orochi from his body.  Disappointed by the outcome of the fight, Rugal sends Kyo, Iori and Mai into another dimension to face them with his full potential. Chizuru and her multiple clones appear, revealing that she has found the mirror and the necklace. The heroes fail in their first attempt to combine the relics and trap Rugal, with Chizuru mortally wounded. Mai takes her place as the mirror holder, but as she, Kyo and Iori corner Rugal, they are once again overcome by his powers. Rugal destroys Kyo's sword, but as he is about to finish him off with a fireball, Kyo magically generates a new sword to block it. He then throws the sword and destroys Rugal.  Back in the real world, Scott places a lantern on the ocean in memory of Chizuru. Kyo decides to keep the family tradition by continuing with the tournament. He reflects on his late father's teachings while Iori stares at him from the other side of the pier.  
Kites (film)
  Jai ([[Hrithik Roshan]]) is a dance teacher in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. As a sideline, he marries immigrant women to get them green cards in exchange for money. When Gina ([[Kangana Ranaut]]), the rich daughter of a powerful [[Anglo-Indian]] casino owner Bob ([[Kabir Bedi]]), falls for him, Jai goes along to marry into money. He discovers that his future brother-in-law, the vicious, homicidal Tony ([[Nicholas Brown (actor)|Nicholas Brown]]), is about to marry a Mexican woman named Natasha ([[Bárbara Mori]]), whom Jai knows as Linda, the last of the immigrant women he married. On the night before "Natasha" and Tony's wedding, Linda and Jai spend a romantic but chaste night, humorously agreeing to a "divorce". A jealous, gun-wielding Tony arrives at her apartment while Jai is there. After he hits her, Linda impulsively knocks him out with a heavy object while he tussles with Jai. Linda and Jai go on the run toward Mexico, with Tony and police in pursuit. They are helped by a friend of Jai, Robin ([[Anand Tiwari]]).

The Kingdom of Solomon
 Solomon is a wise prophet selected as the crown prince by his father King [[David]] (Dawud in Islamic texts) when he was 9. Following Prophet David's death, Solomon succeeds to the crown and God appoints him as a prophet. Requesting from God the establishment of a divine kingdom, Solomon takes the wind under his command and [[jinn]]s and [[demon]]s under his control. Inviting rulers of the neighbouring lands to the monotheistic religion, Prophet Solomon continues his divine mission in as much as Balqis, the [[Queen of Sheba]] professes [[monotheism]]. At the end, while leaning on his cane, Solomon bids farewell to the world, and the jinns and demons get out of reign and return to their own world.  ===Part one=== Solomon, the prophet and king of Judah, asks God to grant him an ideal kingdom and a promised paradise not to be given to anyone until the end of the world. For this to be fulfilled, he should face the world of the devils (jinns and demons), their materialization, and an imminent and cruel war with them. Filled with disbelief and blasphemy, the heads of the different tribes of the Israelites reject his calls for help. When disaster strikes and the people get demonic and lunatic, barely can Solomon control the crisis. But as soon as the creatures take material form, he prays for God's help and favour to overcome their onslaught. So God helps him and the devils get scared of Prophet Solomon.  ===Part two=== Filming of this part has not begun yet but its production and casting is under review: Solomon is announced by God in the Qur'an to have control over various elements, such as winds, to use them for different purposes including transportation. He travels to several territories and builds towers and monuments using the power of jinns. He also sets up a crystal palace in [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem al-Quds]]. Then he meets the [[Queen of Sheba]] and, according to Islamic texts, introduces her into Islam ("submission to God").  
The King's Speech
 At the closing of the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], the [[George VI|Prince Albert, Duke of York]], the second son of [[King George V]], addresses them with a strong stammer. His search for treatment has been discouraging, but his wife [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth]] persuades him to see the Australian-born [[Lionel Logue]], a non-medically trained Harley Street speech defects therapist. "Bertie," as he is called by his family, believes the first session is not going well although Lionel (he insists that all his patients address him as such) manages to have the potential client recite, on an [[Acetate disc|acetate recording]], [[Hamlet]]'s "[[To be, or not to be]]" soliloquy sublimely all the while hearing piped-in classical music on a pair of head phones. Bertie is disappointed and Lionel gives him the recording as a souvenir.  [[File:Royal broadcast, Christmas 1934 (Our Generation, 1938).jpg|thumb|left|George V delivering the Royal Christmas Message in 1934]]  Bertie's father, King George V makes his 1934 [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas wireless address]], and he explains to Bertie that the machine will play a significant part in the role of the Royal Family invading the homes of the people and that Bertie's brother's neglect of his responsibilities make training on it necessary. The attempt is a failure. Bertie in frustration plays the recording Lionel gave him. Bertie returns for daily treatments of exercises and practices to overcome the physical and psychological roots of his speaking difficulty.  George V dies in 1936, and his eldest son David ascends the throne as [[King Edward VIII]]. A constitutional crisis arises with the new king over a prospective marriage with the twice-divorced American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]]. Edward, as [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England|head of the Church of England]], cannot marry her, even if she receives her second divorce, since both her previous husbands are alive.  [[File:Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter filming.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter as the Duke and Duchess of York]] At an unscheduled session, Albert (Bertie) expresses his frustration that while his speech has improved when talking to most people, he still stammers when talking to David and reveals the extent of Edward VIII's folly with Simpson. When Lionel insists that Bertie could be a good king, Bertie accuses Lionel of speaking [[High treason in the United Kingdom|treason]] and quits Lionel. Bertie must face the Accession Council without any assistance from Lionel.  Bertie and Lionel come together after [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|King Edward decides to abdicate]] in order to marry Simpson, and Bertie becomes King George VI. The new Royal pair visit the home of Lionel before the Coronation, much to the surprise of Mrs. Logue when she comes upon Queen Elizabeth having tea at her dining room table, and learning that the King is her husband's patient.  Bertie and Lionel's relationship comes to be known to the King's advisors when there are preparations for his coronation in [[Westminster Abbey]]. It comes to light that George never asked for advice from his advisors about his speech defect treatment and that Lionel never had formal training to be a medical doctor. Lionel explains that at the time he started with speech defects there was no formal training and that the only known help that was available for returning [[World War I|Great War]] [[shell-shock]]ed Australian soldiers was from personal experience.  Bertie remains unconvinced about his suitability as king until provoked into expressing his voice, angered by Lionel's disrespect for [[King Edward's Chair]] and the [[Stone of Scone]]. Only after this pivotal moment is Bertie able to rehearse with Lionel, and then complete the coronation ceremony.  Now [[King George VI]], Bertie is in a crisis when he must declare over the wireless in 1939 Britain's [[British and French declaration of war on Germany|declaration of war]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. Lionel is summoned to [[Buckingham Palace]] to prepare the new king for his wireless address to Britain and the [[British Empire|Empire]]. Knowing the challenge that lies before him, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Winston Churchill]], and Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] are present to offer support. The King and Logue are then left in the broadcasting room. He delivers his speech with Logue conducting him, but by the end he is speaking freely. Preparing to leave the room for the congratulations of those present in the palace, Logue mentions to the King that he still had difficulty enunciating 'w' and the King jokes back, "I had to throw in a few so they'd know it was me".  The Royal Family step onto the balcony of the palace and are applauded by the crowd, a [[title card]] explains that Logue was always present at King George VI's speeches during the war and that they remained friends for the rest of their lives.

Knight and Day
   After colliding with Roy Miller ([[Tom Cruise]]) twice in the airport departure terminal on the way home from [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] to pick up car parts, June Havens ([[Cameron Diaz]]) is told she has been [[overselling|bumped]] to a later flight. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] Agent John Fitzgerald ([[Peter Sarsgaard]]), believing Havens is working with Miller, puts her back on the plane. Completely taken with Miller, Havens goes to the restroom to prep herself up. Meanwhile, Miller fights and kills everyone else on the plane, even the pilots, who were all agents sent by Fitzgerald. After Havens reemerges and gives him a kiss, Miller crash-lands the plane in a cornfield. He drugs a shocked and confused Havens, warning her about the agents who will come after her and that she is not safe with them.  Waking up at home, Havens struggles through a day fitting a [[bridesmaid]]'s dress for her sister's ([[Maggie Grace]]) [[wedding]], and is shocked to learn her sister would like to sell their father's 1966 [[Pontiac GTO|Pontiac GTO tri-power]], which Havens had planned on finishing as a wedding present. Havens is then picked up by a group of [[intelligence agent]]s, led by Fitzgerald. Miller arrives and, through a long gunfight on the highway, kills several agents and reclaims Havens. She flees at the first opportunity and contacts Rodney ([[Marc Blucas]]), a [[firefighter]] and former boyfriend. Believing Havens is merely stressed and is playing out a fantasy, Rodney takes her out and she tells him everything that has happened to her, though he still does not understand. Miller then arrives and pretends to take Havens hostage while holding everyone else at gunpoint, fleeing with her.  Miller explains that Havens is safer with him and she agrees to follow him as they go to pick up Simon Feck ([[Paul Dano]]), a genius inventor who has created a [[Perpetual motion|perpetual energy]] battery called the Zephyr. Traveling to [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]], Miller and Havens discover that Feck has fled from the warehouse he was hiding in, leaving a clue for Miller about his location. They are then attacked by henchmen sent by Spanish arms dealer, Antonio Quintana ([[Jordi Mollà]]). After again being drugged, Havens drifts in and out of consciousness between their capture and escape from Quintana's men, and Miller brings her to an island that is [[off-the-grid]], which Miller uses as a safe house. Accepting a call from her sister after leaving in frustration, Havens accidentally leads Quintana's men straight to the hideaway. They try to kill Miller and Havens with an unmanned aerial vehicle. Before they escape by helicopter, Havens is knocked-out by Miller since she is afraid of flying.  Miller reunites with Feck and they, with Havens, get on a train heading for Austria. Havens is attacked by Bernard ([[Falk Hentschel]]), an assassin sent by Quintana to retrieve the Zephyr and Feck, and kill Miller. But Miller and Havens fight him and he is killed by another train. Arriving at [[Salzburg]], the three check into a hotel. Miller later leaves to meet with Naomi ([[Gal Gadot]]), Quintana's henchwoman, to make a deal. Havens follows him and listens to Miller's conversation, mistaking that he does not care for her. She is then picked up by Fitzgerald and C.I.A. Director Isabel George ([[Viola Davis]]), who reveal that Miller was using her at the airport to smuggle in the Zephyr when they bumped into each other and convince her that he doesn't love her. They also tell her that Miller is the traitor and plans to trade the battery with Quintana. Heartbroken, Havens allows the C.I.A. to find Miller back at the hotel. Miller escapes with the battery, but is seemingly shot on the rooftop and falls to his death in the river. Feck is taken into custody afterwards to Schwedelbach, Germany, though it is later revealed that Fitzgerald has been the real traitor all along and he captures Feck.  Returning home, Havens heads to an address she remembered from Miller's [[iPhone]], where she finds his parents and learns that his real name is Matthew Knight. They believe their son, a former [[Army]] [[sergeant]] and [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], is dead; but they are fabulously wealthy from winning [[lotteries]] and [[sweepstakes]] they don't remember entering. Leaving a message on her own answering machine that she has the Zephyr, she is captured by Quintana's men and taken to [[Sevilla]], Spain. She is drugged with a prototype [[truth serum]] before being rescued by Miller, who was tracking Fitzgerald, who was delivering Feck to Quintana.  Chaos erupts throughout the streets and Quintana is killed by a bull stampede. At the docks, Miller saves Feck from a [[bullet wound]] after handing over the Zephyr in a small pouch. Feck later reveals that the battery is unstable and it explodes, killing Fitzgerald. Miller collapses from the gunshot and is hospitalized in [[Washington D.C.]]. George apologizes to Miller about him and Fitzgerald, but tells him to let go of Havens and return to the C.I.A., however, she uses euphemisms that imply he will be killed by the agency the next day, saying he “will be safe” and “he will be transferred to a secure location” (code language revealed to Havens earlier in the film that means a person will be killed). Miller has a look of realization that the agency will not risk him possibly going rogue again and will likely kill him to prevent it. Shortly after George left the room, the nurse who was in the room (who heard the coded language) drugged Miller and is revealed to be Havens. After Havens breaks Miller out of the hospital, he wakes up in the rebuilt GTO that belonged to her father. After Miller asks what day it is, Havens kisses him and says it is someday. This is a reference from the start of the film that they both have things they want to do someday, and Havens begins to drive towards [[Cape Horn]]. As the credits begin to roll, Miller's parents unwittingly receive tickets to Cape Horn in the mail and accept to go.  
Kohi Mero
 Kohi Mero is the fun, flirtatious, youthful story of four friends who embark on a journey to discover the meaning of love and friendship. Each of us desire love, and each of us desire a specific kind of love and a specific way of illuminating our lives through it. Abhi, Ashna, Prayash and Dibya are similarly in search of a special kind of love. Ashna and Prayash, two friends who have known each other forever, are separated by circumstance from Abhi, their mischievous but poetic friend who chooses ambition over friendship. Years later, at a fateful time in their lives, he realizes that he has to choose again, between keeping his friendship and going after the love of his life.  Similarly, Ashna faces the choice between being true to herself and doing right by her family and society. Love demands sacrifice, they all learn: the bigger the sacrifice, the sweeter the reward, sometimes as freedom, and sometimes as the knowledge that the person you love has gained everything you'd wish for them.  "Kohi Mero" is a story about the search for that special person and the special sacrifice it takes for us to show our love for each other.

Kshema Bhoomi
   
Kutty Srank
 Kutty Srank (translated as junior boat captain in Malayalam) is a film about a mariner who operates a cargo vessel near the sea port of [[Kodungalloor]], once a roaring port town in [[Kerala]].<ref></ref>  One day, the local police station discovers an [[unidentified decedent|unidentified body]] that has washed ashore. A Buddhist nun, Revamma, comes forward to claim that she can identify the rotten body, and she recognises it as that of one kutti Srank. Police enquire her relationship with kutti Srank. Meanwhile, another Latin Christian woman, Pemenna, too claims to recognize the dead man. Both women assure the investigators that the body is that of kutti Srank. Finally a mute woman, Kali, joins them and seeks permission to see the corpse. She, however, rejects the claim made by the other women and argues that the body is not that of kutti Srank. Pemmanna identifies Kali and tells Revamma that Kali is kutti Srank’s wife. Eventually each woman share her different acquaintance and relation with kutti Srank.  ===Story=== Revamma (Padmapriya) is the first person to come forward and identify a corpse, which has been found on the beach. She explains her connection with Kutty Srank in a flash back sequence. Her father Moopan is the local don in their area near Malabar and is a man literally steeped in blood.  Revamma’s memories of her early life are related to blood in some way and blood features heavily throughout the first scenes. Adding to all this symbolism, Kutty Srank has an intermittent nose bleed and his nostrils are permanently filled with the smell of blood. Revamma has returned from studying overseas and overthrows Moorpan’s great plans for her by announcing that she is going to become a Buddhist. Her father’s reaction is fairly predictable but his plans backfire when he uses Kutty Srank to dispose of a Buddhist monk who was with Revamma.Kutty Srank’s loyalty to Moopan is unwavering and unquestioning until this betrayal and Revamma takes immediate advantage of Kutty Sranks despair and confusion, using this vulnerability as a way to engineer her escape. Despite the overly heavy blood symbolism this part of the story is fairly logical and the characters react in understandable if rather extreme ways.  Mamooty plays the swaggering thug Kutty Srank to perfection, making him violent but with enough shadows and depth to hint at much more to the man. Moopan’s rather grandiose living conditions are a nice contrast to the rest of the film and his affectations make him easier to despise.  Revamma seems to have been driven insane by her early experiences and her behaviour is very irrational and disturbed. The only normal people here are Revamma’s aunt and uncle who seem to be genuinely trying to help her and deal with her father as best as possible.  The escape takes Revamma and Kutty Srank close to Cochin where he meets Pemmana (Kamalinee Mukherjee), the second woman who turns up to identify the body.It Appears that Kutty Srank has worked as a ferryboat captain in Pemmana’s village previously, but skipped out under dubious circumstances as is his usual habit. He is great friends with Pemmana’s brother, Loni (Suresh Krishna) who picks Kutty Srank to play the lead role in their annual Chavittu Nadakam about Emperor Charlemagne.This traditional drama provides an excuse for some fantastic costumes, singing, dancing and stomping around the stage by the various members of the village. It also allows Mammootty to showcase the more human and fun side to Kutty Srank’s character. Although the menace is still there, the interactions between Kutty Srank and Loni give him an opportunity to laugh, joke and drunkenly sing as they roam around the village. The local priest is not happy to hear of the irreligious Kutty Srank taking part in the play and also taking over the affections of Pemmana. Father Yonas (Siddique) has been enlisted by the feckless Joppan to push his match with her and as Joppan seethes with jealousy, Father Yonas whips up fear and mistrust of Kutty Srank.Tensions escalate in the village and there is plenty of scope for betrayal and murder – it rapidly becomes merely a question of who and when. Moopan’s henchmen also turn up on the river again in a very groovy speedboat. This, along with the death of his best friend, means that Kutty Srank is ready to skip town again. Avoiding the attentions of Pemmana and escaping a murder hunt are purely side benefits.The third woman who turns up to identify the body is a mute, Kali. She has been living with an older woman who has amazing interpretative skills and understands exactly what Kali is trying to say. She is introduced as Kutty Srank’s pregnant wife and sensationally states that the body is not her husband. The final flashback tells her story which starts after Kutty Srank has moved on to Travancore trying once again to elude Moopan’s men .  Kutty Srank has taken up with Unnithan (Sai Kumar) who presides over an unhappy family where tragedy has been the normal order for the past 10 years. Unnithan blames this on Kali, a local mute who lives in the forest, and has tried a number of ways to be rid of her. As his trusted man, Kutty Srank heads off in a drunken rage to kill Kali but when he finds her and sees her pitiful existence he is unable to go through with the execution. He ends up being cared for by Kali following a snake bite and eventually becomes her husband.We see a more tender and caring side of Kutty Srank through the eyes of Unnithan’s daughter in law Nalini who romanticises the couple in an escape from the misery of her own daily existence.  In the end Kali and Kutty Srank have to make a run for it as Moopan’s men have again put in an appearance.   The last scene takes place back in the village where the play must go on, and this leads to the final chapter in Kutty Srank’s life.

Arjun introduces Geetha to his father ([[Radha Ravi]]) expecting him to approve & bless their marriage but his father, seeing to further his political ambitions, engages a Minister's daughter (who is shown to be a spoilt girl of questionable character), for Arjun. So Arjun escapes with Geetha who is helped by Kutty. Kutty, Arjun, Geetha are chased by Arjun's father's men but are unable to catch them. Meanwhile, old wounds renew between Kutty and Arjun. After an intense (kung-fu) fight with the henchmen (where Arjun runs & Kutty fights) Arjun leaves Geetha with Kutty without saying anything to either of them. Kutty takes care of Geetha, which touches her. She soon realises the love he has for her and regrets not having met him before her commitment to Arjun. She tries telling the same to him, but Kutty thinking that Geetha is scolding him closes his ears and does not hear what she actually said to him (he does that a couple of times in the movie). Arjun arrives at the scene his father in tow, now all happy for their marriage. Geetha leaves with Arjun to marry him. On the wedding day of Arjun & Geetha, Kutty wanders here and there to look after wedding related works. His friends understand his internal pain and ask him to cry. While Geetha is on her way to the ceremony, Kutty stops her and openly expresses his pain of his love and how he is going to miss her and asks if his love did touch her at least once, without knowing that his love touched her already. (He then laughs & passes it off as a prank). Geetha does not answer him. Kutty's kids friends present Geetha a gift (from Kutty) in which she finds her lost anklet and the poem page where she wrote a reply while she was in Kanyakumari. Kutty was the person who jumped into the sea to take her anklet and was assumed dead, by Geetha. Geetha finally realises her love for Kutty, rejects her marriage with Arjun and goes to Kutty and accepts his love finally.

A motorist notices the zombie walking along a deserted road, picks it up, and dies in an accident moments later. The zombie recovers from the crash, and reanimates the driver by penetrating a wound in the man's chest with its monstrous penis. The ghouls have sex, which ends with the first zombie ejaculating black semen, and stumbling away as the motorist sits among the wreckage of his vehicle, in awe of what had just transpired.  The zombie reaches Los Angeles, and after perusing shopping carts full of discarded objects, ventures to the [[Los Angeles River|L.A. River]], where it sees [[White-collar crime|a white collar criminal]] being shot to death by his partner. The zombie drags the deceased lawbreaker to a soiled mattress, and resurrects him via coitus with the bullet wounds in the man's back. The undead criminal and the zombie have sex, which is followed by the zombie wandering away, washing itself, and going to a [[Coffeehouse|café]], where it purchases a cup of coffee.  The zombie steals some clothing, and finds the dumped body of a gang member who was shot in the head. The zombie brings the hood back to life by molesting the hole in his forehead, and has sex with him.

Kyōfu
 Two [[neurosurgeons]], Etsuko Ōta and her husband, Yukio, watch a [[16mm film|16mm]] [[documentary film]] of a secret experiment with [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Manchu people|Manchu]], and [[Russians|Russian]] subjects concerning the electrification of the [[temporal lobe]] of the brain, ending with the subjects projecting a blinding white light. Their children, Miyuki and Kaori, watch the film as well. Years later, a group consisting of Miyuki, Kazushi, Takumi and Rieko, conduct a mass suicide assisted by Etsuko's assistant, Hattori, though it is actually a masquerade for their initiation to a similar neurosurgery experiment conducted by Etsuko. Miyuki wakes up inside a facility to another of Etsuko's assistants, Hisae, who insists that she has died and is currently [[astral projecting]], even presenting her with her corpse as proof. Miyuki and Rieko are later found to have escaped the facility unnoticed.  After having lost contact with her sister for six months, Kaori visits the hospital where Miyuki once worked and meets with Miyuki's fellow worker and lover, Motojima, who introduces her to Detective Hirasawa. Miyuki's laptop contains a suicide website that Miyuki might have used. Hirasawa questions a witness who saw a figure inside Miyuki's apartment after her disappearance. Kaori realizes that she has dreamed of being in Miyuki's apartment and seeing a white light nearby. Miyuki visits Kaori in a dream that night to tell her to stop looking for her and that she is "no longer her sister". Kaori is confronted by Etsuko and taken to the facility to learn about the experiment. Kazushi and Takumi have long since died, unable to contain the experiment. Witnessing how Miyuki has bended realities around her since the experiment, Etsuko conducts the experiment on herself and Kaori, revealing that she and Yukio have always wanted to know the "true" reality beyond the current one to achieve a [[spiritual evolution]], and the film had provided them with the means to it. However, she stops the experiment just when Kaori sees a young Miyuki and herself staring at the white light, apparently because Kaori would have been consumed by it.  The next day, Kaori tells Motojima that her father committed suicide following a neurosurgery failure, while her mother is a skeptic of the [[afterlife]], and believes that there is [[Mu (negative)|nothing after death]]. The two visit Kaori's childhood home and meet with an ethereal Miyuki. It is revealed that Motojima was the one who informed Miyuki of the suicide website and has been in league with Etsuko, who tracks the sisters and kills Hirasawa. All of them go back to the facility with Rieko, now pregnant despite being a virgin. Motojima reveals that Miyuki's corpse is actually a [[hologram]] meant to fool her and the other three subjects and she is still very much alive. Motojima shows the film to Kaori and Miyuki, with Etsuko explaining that the white light actually projects what the viewer is dreaming. Yukio wanted to further the spiritual evolution, so the light "followed" him back in reality until he could not take it anymore and killed himself. However, Rieko is suicidal and wants nothing more, so the light impregnated her with the "afterlife", i.e. nothing. Rieko gives birth to the "afterlife", who consumes Hattori and Motojima, while Etsuko is consumed when she experiments herself as well. At the forest, Kaori and Miyuki walk together until Kaori realizes that Miyuki had "died" long ago when she found that she could not fit herself with the world and runs away from her sister.  The film closes with an alive Hirasawa inspecting the bodies of Miyuki, Kazushi, Takumi, Rieko, and Hattori and Kaori lamenting of remains on the ground.  
The Last Airbender
  15-year-old [[Sokka]] and his 14-year-old sister, [[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]], are near a river at the Southern Water Tribe, a small village in the [[South Pole]]. While hunting, they discover an iceberg that when broken open shoots a beam of light into the sky. Inside of the iceberg is a 12-year-old boy named [[Aang]] and a giant flying bison named [[Appa (character)|Appa]]. Unknown to them, Aang is the long-lost Avatar – the only person capable of "bending" all 4 elements of Air, Water, Earth and Fire. A century has passed since the Fire Nation has declared [[World war|war]] on the other 3 nations of Air, Water, and Earth in their attempt to conquer the world.  [[Zuko]] is the scarred 16-year-old exiled prince of the Fire Nation on a quest to find the Avatar and bring him to his father, [[List of Avatar: The Last Airbender characters|Fire Lord Ozai]], so he can regain his honor. Seeing the light that appeared from Aang's release, Zuko and some Fire Nation soldiers arrive at the Southern Water Tribe to demand the villagers hand over the Avatar. Aang reveals himself and surrenders to Zuko on the condition that he agrees to leave the village alone. On the ship, Aang is tested by Zuko's paternal uncle [[Iroh]] to confirm he is the Avatar. After being informed that he is to be their prisoner for passing the test, Aang escapes using his glider and flies to his flying bison brought by Katara and Sokka. Aang and his new friends visit the Southern Air Temple where they meet a winged lemur, who Aang later names [[Momo (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Momo]]. Aang also learns that he was in the ice for a whole century and that the Fire Nation wiped out all of the Air Nomads, including his guardian, Monk Gyatso. In despair, he enters the Avatar State and finds himself in the Spirit World where he encounters a Dragon Spirit. Katara's pleas bring Aang back out of the Avatar State.  To seek shelter, Aang's group arrives at a little Earth Kingdom village controlled by the Fire Nation, but they are arrested and taken to a prison for Earthbenders surrounded by earth <ref></ref> because Katara tries to help a young boy escape from Fire Nation soldiers. They incite a rebellion by reminding the disgruntled Earthbenders that Earth was given to them. Aang tells Katara and Sokka that he only knows airbending and he must master the other three elements. Katara is given a waterbending scroll that she uses to greatly strengthen and hone her waterbending abilities and to help Aang learn as they make their way to the Northern Water Tribe (where Aang will be able to learn from waterbending masters) and liberate more Earth Kingdom villages in the process, weakening the Fire Nation's food and water supplies.  During a side track to the Northern Air Temple on his own, Aang is betrayed by a Southern Earth Kingdom peasant and captured by a group of Fire Nation archers, led by [[Admiral Zhao|Commander Zhao]], a Fire Nation Commander appointed by the Fire Lord. However, a masked marauder, the "Blue Spirit", helps Aang escape from his imprisonment, fighting off the Fire Nation soldiers under Zhao's command until the blue spirit realises they will be overwhelmed, at which point he takes Aang hostage to negotiate their way out. During the prison break, Zhao realizes that Zuko is the masked vigilante. He arranges to kill the prince, first by having a crossbowman fire a bolt over a huge distance that shatters the lower half of Zuko's mask and knocks him out, however Aang uses his skills to bend a cloud across the bridge connecting the prison to the other side of the valley, causing the Fire Nation soldiers in pursuit to stop in fear. With the cloud covering their escape, Aang escapes with an unconscious Zuko into a nearby forest and watches over Zuko until morning, when he leaves to reunite with Sokka and Katara. Zhao tries again to kill Zuko, this time by rupturing a gas pipe running through Zuko's quarters on Iroh's ship. Noticing the danger, Zuko manages to survive the attempt on his life with Iroh's help. He sneaks aboard Zhao's lead ship as his fleet departs for the Northern Water Tribe, which is a heavy fortress, to capture the Avatar. Upon arriving, Aang's group is welcomed warmly by the citizens of the Northern Water Tribe. Sokka quickly befriends the Northern Water Tribe princess, [[Princess Yue|Yue]]. After a few agreements, a waterbending master, Pakku, teaches Aang waterbending. Katara also becomes a much stronger and more powerful waterbender due to her training with Master Pakku.  Soon, the Fire Nation arrives and Zhao begins his attack while Zuko begins his search for the Avatar on his own. After defeating Katara in a battle, Zuko captures Aang as he enters the Spirit World to find the Dragon Spirit to give him the wisdom to defeat the Fire Nation who tells him to let his emotions "flow like water". Returning to his body, Aang battles Zuko before Katara freezes him. Before leaving to join the battle, Aang lowers the ice so that Zuko can breathe. As the battle escalates, Iroh watches Zhao capture the Moon Spirit, with which its Ocean Spirit counterpart had assumed the form of a fish. Despite Iroh's pleas, Zhao kills the Moon Spirit to strip all of the waterbenders of their ability to waterbend. Iroh, enraged by Zhao's disrespect for sacredness and by his actions to unbalance the world, reveals the extent of his mastery of firebending by using his chi to create huge flame jets from his wrists, scaring Zhao and his entourage of Fire Nation Soldiers out of the sacred cave. Yue explains to everyone that the Moon Spirit gave her life and, with Iroh's help, realises she can give her life back to the Moon Spirit as she dies in the process. With the tables turned, Zhao finds out Zuko survived. They almost fight before Iroh appears and tells Zuko it's not worth it. Zhao attempts one more time to kill Zuko with a massive blast of fire, which Iroh manages to deflect. Zhao is drowned by waterbenders after Zuko and Iroh leave him to his fate. Aang remembers his life before being trapped in the ice, including when he left his home, seeing his master's face. With his waterbending powers and his emotions "flowing like water", Aang enters the Avatar State and raises the ocean into a gigantic wall to drive the armada back. Aang now fully embraces his destiny as the Avatar as he, Katara and Sokka prepare to continue their journey to the Earth Kingdom to find an earthbending teacher for Aang. The Fire Lord learns of the defeat; angry over the betrayal of his brother Iroh and the failure of his eldest son Zuko, he tasks his youngest daughter, Zuko's sister, [[Azula]] to stop the Avatar from mastering Earth and Fire before the arrival of Sozin's Comet.

Now insane, Javier beats Sergio mercilessly in the face with a trumpet, leaving him mauled and near death. As Javier escapes through the sewers, the circus troupe takes Sergio to the closest doctor – a [[veterinarian]] – for medical care. The doctor is able to save Sergio, but his face is horribly scarred with a [[glasgow smile]]. The circus is forced to close down. Natalia and several of the other troupe members become performers in a nightclub.  Javier lives in the forest, naked and covered in filth. He survives on wild animals that fall into his cave. One day he is captured by hunters – including Salcedo, who recognizes him. Salcedo forces him to behave as a hunting dog but ultimately intends to kill him. At one point Javier viciously bites Generalísimo [[Francisco Franco]], one of Salcedo's guests. As a consequence he is locked in a room while Salcedo plans exactly how to kill him. Javier has a vision of Natalia, as the Virgin Mary, ordering him to become her [[Destroying angel (Bible)|Angel of Death]]. He scars his face with [[sodium hydroxide]] and a clothes iron to make it look permanently like that of a clown, then dons a clown's costume patterned after a [[bishop]]'s vestments. He then kills Salcedo and escapes into the city.  Afraid that Sergio intends to harm her, Natalia prepares to leave the nightclub. Sergio and Javier both arrive at the same time, Javier armed with machine guns. Forced to choose between them, Natalia chooses Sergio, and they drive away together. Police try to arrest Javier, but some of the remaining troupe members help him escape. Repulsed by Sergio's mauled face and crude ways, Natalia leaves him again. Javier steals an ice cream truck and stalks her through the city. He uses the occasion of [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]'s successful attempt on [[Luis Carrero Blanco|Admiral Carrero Blanco]] (Franco's heir apparent) to kidnap Natalia. He takes her to the Valle de los Caídos, hewn from rock, where the circus has kept its animals since going out of business. There he pleads with her to love him for his mind and body as much as she loved Sergio for his. At first she refuses but admits she no longer loves Sergio.  Sergio, meanwhile, has learned of Javier's hideout. He informs the military police, which has been looking for Javier in connection with the terrorist bombing, and accompanies them on their attempt to arrest him. Sergio puts on his clown make up and chases Javier and Natalia through the Monumental Cross at the Valle de los Caídos where they climb to its highest point, several hundred feet off the ground. Natalia admits her love for Javier and they attempt to escape by wrapping lengths of drapery around their waists and lowering themselves to the ground. Before this can be accomplished, Sergio arrives and fights with Javier. Seeing an opportunity to save Javier, by ensnaring Sergio's leg in drapery, Natalia leaps from the ledge, dragging Sergio with her. Natalia is killed when the drapery draws taut around her waist and snaps her spine.  The military police place Sergio and Javier in custody. As they sit opposite one another, the Funny Clown and the Sad Clown begin crying so hard, it appears they are laughing.<ref></ref>

She decides to travel from [[Boston]] to [[Dublin]], to propose to him on February 29, leap day, while he is there at a conference. Anna wishes to invoke an Irish tradition that a man who is proposed to on leap day must accept the proposal. During the flight, a storm diverts the plane to [[Wales]], where Anna hires a boat to take her to [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. The severity of the storm, however, forces her to be put ashore at a small seaside village called Dingle, where she makes her way to a local tavern. Anna tries to enlist the help of Declan O'Callaghan ([[Matthew Goode]]), the surly Irish innkeeper. She requests him to taxi her across the country to Dublin. At first he refuses, but after his tavern is threatened with foreclosure, he agrees to drive her for [[Euro|€]]500. The two set out in his old beat-up car. Along the way, he makes fun of her fancy [[Louis Vuitton]] luggage, which he calls "Louie". He also mocks her belief in a leap year "tradition" of women proposing to men.  Their travel is interrupted by a herd of cows blocking the road. Anna steps in cow-dung while attempting to move the animals, and tries to clean her expensive shoes while leaning on Declan's car which causes it to roll downhill into a stream. Continuing on foot, Anna flags down a van with three ne'er-do-wells who offer her a lift. Ignoring Declan's warning, Anna accepts the ride and hands them her luggage. Before she can enter the van, they drive off without her. Anna and Declan eventually make their way on foot to a roadside pub, where they discover the three van thieves going through Anna's luggage. Declan fights them, displaying unexpected strength for a man of his size, and retrieves Anna's bag. Anna and Declan are ejected from the pub by the owner for fighting on the premises.  Anna and Declan reach a railway station and decide to wait for the next train. While waiting, they hike up a hill to the ruins of a nearby castle. They ask each other what they would grab if their homes were on fire and they had only 60 seconds to flee. In doing so, Declan also tells her of an old Irish legend about a young woman promised to an elderly lord that she did not love. So she gave her wedding guests a sleeping potion so she could run away with the man she does love. The legend told is loosely based on "[[The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gráinne]]".  During the story they lose track of time and miss the train. That night they are forced to stay at a local bed & breakfast at Tipperary, where they pretend to be married, taking the name "O'Brady-Callaghan" so that their conservative hosts will allow them to stay. During dinner, when other couples kiss to show their love for each other, Anna and Declan are "forced" to kiss as well. This stirs feelings that neither had expected. That night, they sleep in the same bed, but do not admit their new feelings for each other.  The next day while hitch-hiking down the road, Anna and Declan are caught in a hail-storm and take shelter in a nearby church, where a wedding is taking place. They are invited to the reception. But during the reception, Anna drinks too much. Anna begins to question her own intentions with Jeremy and realizes that she loves Declan. Just as the two are about to kiss, Anna vomits and passes out. The following day they arrive in Dublin, as they make their way on foot from the bus terminal to the hotel, Declan reveals that he was once engaged but his fiancé ran off to Dublin with his mother's claddagh ring and his best friend. Anna suggests to him, now that he is in Dublin, that he should ask for his mother's ring back. When they arrive at the hotel where Jeremy is staying, Jeremy surprises Anna by proposing to her right in the lobby. She accepts rather hesitatingly. Anna then turns around to look at Declan just to see that he had already walked out of the hotel.  At their engagement party in Boston, Anna learns that Jeremy decided to propose because he thought it was the only way to appease the co-op board of the apartment building the couple had wanted to move into at the beginning of the film. Dismayed, Anna pulls the fire alarm and waits, testing the 60-second concept she had discussed with Declan earlier. When the alarm sounds, Jeremy's instinct is to retrieve all of their electronic materials such as mobile phones, laptops, etc and shows no concern for Anna's well-being. At that moment, Anna fully realizes that there is nothing in the apartment that means anything to her, including Jeremy. Meanwhile, in Dublin, Declan had already retrieved his mother's claddagh ring from his ex-fiancé.  Sometime later, Anna arrives back at Caragh's Tavern in Dingle, where Declan is busy running his seemingly successful business, having pulled together the balance he owed to his property owner with the help of the community. She reveals to him that she has broken off her engagement to Jeremy and tells Declan that she has come to believe that all she needs/wants is right in Dingle. When she proposes that they get together, Declan leaves the room without saying a word. Thinking that she had been rejected, Anna rushes outside and makes her way to the edge of a nearby cliff overlooking the sea. Declan emerges, revealing that he had walked out simply to retrieve his mother's claddagh ring so that he could give it to her. Taking her offer even further, Declan proposes to Anna on the cliff, and she happily accepts.

One night, Chen discovers that the Japanese are planning to assassinate General Zeng, the son of a northern warlord, and push the blame to General Zhuo, a rival warlord. Zeng's death will spark off a civil war between the two warlords and aid the subsequent Japanese invasion. Chen disguises himself as a masked superhero and defeats the assassins and saves Zeng.  With the operation failed, Tokyo sends a name list of anti-Japanese activists to Colonel Chikaraishi Takeshi, the leader of the Japanese secret agency in Shanghai, ordering him to kill the people on the list. Chikaraishi leaks out the list, causing panic among the populace, and pays a visit to the nightclub. Chikaraishi is aware of Chen's true identity and he challenges Chen to save the people on the list. Chen and Chikaraishi engage in a race of time to save and assassinate the activists respectively. Some are killed while others managed to escape from Shanghai. Eventually, Chikaraishi's younger brother Sasaki leads a team of assassins to murder the editor of the ''Shanghai Times''.

Chikaraishi starts to distrust Kiki and forces her to kill General Zeng's girlfriend, one of her close friends. The blame is pushed to General Zhuo and the angered General Zeng attacks Zhuo with support from Japanese forces. One night, the Japanese corner Chen on the street and bring him to their headquarters to torture him. Concurrently, Chen's friends stage a raid on the Japanese headquarters and cause serious damage with explosives before fleeing the scene.

Chen is thrown out of a car in front of the nightclub and remains in coma for days while he recovers from his injuries, as the Japanese are attacking the Chinese.  With the Japanese invasion underway and General Zhuo killed in action with his forces in full retreat, there seems to be nothing that the resistance movement can do to prevent the Japanese from occupying Shanghai. Chikaraishi challenges Chen to fight him, and kills Kiki after she shows up. In anger, Chen defeats many Japanese combatants all at once, even crushing the testicles of an officer who insults women and raping a girl, after which he faces Chikaraishi in a one-on-one bout and wins. At the end of the film, Chikaraishi is replaced with another officer, a female Captain while Chen continues to help the resistance movement oppose the invaders.

He also reveals that Charlie's baby must stay alive, as it is destined to be the savior of mankind; Michael disobeyed God's order to kill Charlie's baby, as he still has faith in humanity. The next morning, Sandra discovers Howard crucified behind the restaurant and covered with huge boils. She tries to rescue him, but he violently explodes into acid. Percy dies shielding Sandra from the blast. Sandra is driven insane and must be restrained. Meanwhile, the remaining survivors hear a radio transmission that reveals there are other pockets of resistance. One such refuge is nearby, but Michael advises them not to go, since they would be too vulnerable on the move.  That night, a second wave of possessed people attack. Kyle is lured into a trap and killed while Charlie goes into labor. Audrey and Michael help to deliver the baby as [[Seven trumpets|trumpets]] sound, signaling the approach of the Archangel [[Gabriel]] ([[Kevin Durand]]). In a panic, Sandra breaks her restraints and tries to give the baby to the possessed, but she is executed by Michael. Moments later, Gabriel enters the diner and fatally wounds Bob. Michael urges the group to escape and tells Jeep to "find the prophets, learn to read the instructions". The hordes of possessed humans are unable to approach Charlie's baby; Jeep, Audrey, Charlie, and the baby go to Michael's cruiser. Gabriel and Michael fight to a standstill before Gabriel stabs Michael through the chest with his [[Morning_star_(weapon)|morning star]]. Michael dies and his body disappears. Dying, Bob uses his lighter, which is engraved with "hope," to ignite the diner's gas main and blow up the diner, incinerating himself and the remaining possessed.  Jeep's body is covered in the same mysterious drawings seen on Michael's body; Jeep concludes that the tattoos are his instructions. Gabriel appears and flies onto the fleeing car. Audrey jumps on him and yells at Jeep to slam on the brakes, sending her and Gabriel through the front windshield, as the car crashes, and buying Jeep and Charlie time to get away, but in the process Audrey is killed. Eventually Gabriel corners them in the nearby mountains and is about to kill them when Michael descends from Heaven, an Archangel again. Michael tells Gabriel that Gabriel gave God what he asked for, but Michael did what God needed, giving humanity another chance; Michael says this was God's plan to test his angels and that Gabriel failed Him. Ashamed, Gabriel leaves. Michael explains to Jeep that he is the child's true protector and that they will see Michael again, before flying away. Charlie and Jeep reach the top of the mountain and see a small town in the valley below. Sometime later, Charlie, Jeep, and the baby drive away in a station wagon.  The shot widens to show that the back of the car is full of weapons.  
Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole
  Soren, a young [[barn owl]], lives in the Tyto Forest with his family; his father, Noctus; his mother, Marella; his older brother, Kludd; his younger sister, Eglantine; and Mrs. P, the family's nest maid, a kind [[Leptotyphlopidae|blind snake]]. Soren enjoys listening to Noctus's stories of the "Legends of Ga'Hoole", which are mythical tales of warrior owls called the Guardians who fight against the Pure Ones. Kludd berates his brother's dreams, having grown tired of listening to the stories. When their father teaches them the first steps to flying, Kludd becomes jealous of Soren's talents at branching. Later, when practicing branching while their parents are hunting, Kludd pushes Soren off a branch which forces them both to fall to the ground. They are attacked by a [[Tasmanian devil]] (who scars Kludd's face) but are saved, and then kidnapped, by two owls, Jatt and Jutt, who work for the Pure Ones.  Along the way, more owlets are revealed to have been kidnapped. Soren meets Gylfie, a young female [[elf owl]] who is also kidnapped. At St. Aegolius, the owlets are greeted by the Pure Ones' queen Nyra, who says that they will be divided into either soldiers or "pickers". When Soren and Gylfie protest, they are sorted as pickers while Kludd, who admires Nyra, betrays Soren, and is sent to be a soldier. Soren and Gylfie avoid being "moon-blinked" (a catatonic state caused by sleeping under a full moon) while the others do not know and become moon-blinked. They are forced to "pick" through owl pellets, scouring for bits of metal "[[Magnetism|flecks]]", which are being used to build a superweapon. They are spotted by Grimble, a [[boreal owl]], who reveals that he works under the Pure Ones only to keep his family safe and that he isn't really a Pure One at all. He teaches them to fly, but Nyra finds out whilst coming to invite Soren to become a soldier. Kludd decides to remain with the Pure Ones, despite Soren's pleas for him to come with him. Grimble and Nyra engage in a battle, and Grimble is later killed. Following his instructions to seek the Great Tree of Ga'Hoole and warn the Guardians, Soren and Gylfie fly out. Along their journey, they meet Twilight, a [[great grey owl]], and Digger, a [[burrowing owl]], and rest with them in their shared hollow. Soren is reunited with Mrs. P who is brought in by Twilight, having captured her for dinner while she searched for Soren and Kludd. She agrees to go with them to find the Guardians.  The band flies towards the sea of [[Bass Strait|Hoolemere]] where a flock of crows chaotically guides them to the legendary shrine and gateway of the Guardians, kept by an oracular [[echidna]], who provides comic, but accurate, descriptions of the quintet and guidance to the object of their quest. He sends the owls out to sea to find the island of Ga'Hoole. During flight, the band encounters a fierce storm and Digger's wings freeze, causing him to nearly drown in the sea, but they are saved by Boron and Barran, the king and queen of the Guardians who lead them back to the Tree of Ga'Hoole. There, Soren tells the Guardian council about the Pure One's plans. The Guardians are skeptical, but an elderly [[whiskered screech owl|screech owl]] named Ezylryb is convinced by Soren's sincerity. Boron sends a great grey owl called Allomere out with two scouts to investigate St. Aegolius.  The band is shown refuge at the Tree of Ga'Hoole, guided by a young Guardian-in-training named Otulissa, a [[short-eared owl]]. Soren develops a crush on her, to Gylfie's annoyance. They are sent to attend different classes called "chaws". During one lesson in the middle of a rainstorm, Soren grasps a brief hold on gizzard-flying (flying purely with instinct) but loses control and falls towards the sea. Ezylryb rescues him and orders Soren back to his hollow. There, Soren learns that Ezylryb is, in fact, the famous hero Lyze of Kiel; the legendary leader of the Guardians who fought and defeated Metal Beak, the ancient leader of the Pure Ones, and Nyra's mate. But Soren is disheartened when he learns that his hero is a battle worn veteran who scoffs at his own past. Allomere returns from his scouting mission with news that his two wingmen were killed in an ambush. He brings back with him two moon-blinked owlets, one of which is Eglantine. Seeing the evidence, the Guardians arrange for battle and fly out towards St. Aegolius. Before leaving, Ezylryb instructs an anxious Soren to tend to his sister. When she finally snaps out of her trance, Eglantine tells Soren that it was Kludd who moon-blinked her and gave her to Allomere, confirming that Allomere is a traitor and that the Guardians are actually flying into a trap. The band then follows the Guardians where they find the Guardians subdued by the flecks, contained in a machine operated by bats.  Twilight, Gylfie and Digger fend off the bats sent by Metal Beak to kill the paralyzed Guardians. This causes Metal Beak to distrust Allomere, and, believing he lied to him about bringing all the Guardians, has him dragged away by several bats, and is apparently killed in the darkness. Meanwhile, Soren flies through a forest fire, igniting a lamp of oil, and manages to disable the fleck trap. Freed and recovered, the Guardians fly into battle and Ezylryb goes straight for Metal Beak, who with Nyra begins to overpower him. Soren flies into the battle after spotting Kludd, but Kludd attacks him, throwing him into the forest fire. The two brothers briefly fight while Soren tries to talk some sense into Kludd but Kludd replies that the Pure Ones believe in him like no one ever has, and that Metal Beak has instilled in him the belief that the strong will triumph, the broken will be put out of their misery and that honor is just another word for weakness before he leaps onto Soren, causing them to fall down a tree. Injured, Kludd tries to trick Soren into helping him up, but as he attempts to do so, Kludd attacks him again, only for the branch Kludd is holding onto to snap, causing him to fall into the fire and disappear, seemingly killed. Furious at Kludd's apparent death and betrayal, Soren grabs a flaming branch and attacks Metal Beak, but the evil warrior easily gains the upper hand on Soren. His over-confidence proves his undoing, however, and as he dives at Soren, the younger owl manages to stab him with a flaming branch, killing him. Nyra, shocked at her mate's death, retreats with the remaining Pure Ones, vowing revenge on them.  When they return to the tree, Soren and Eglantine are reunited with their parents, who have just arrived. The band is then welcomed and initiated as new Guardians. Some time later, Soren tells the story to a group of owlets, revealing that Nyra is still out there with a contingent of Pure Ones. He also reveals that Kludd's body was never found. Meanwhile, back in the smoking remains of the canyons, a shadowy figure with glowing red eyes (most likely Kludd who survived the flames) is shown looking at Metal Beak's body and mask. The movie ends with Ezylryb and the band flying off into another storm.  
Leonie (film)
 The film opens on a beach. A window overlooks the beach.  In a dark room, [[Isamu Noguchi]], grown old, is chipping away at a large stone with a hammer and chisel.  "Mother, I want you to tell the story." The film periodically returns to this scene of Isamu at work.  [[Bryn Mawr College|Bryn Mawr]] 1892.  After a class in which she argues with a professor about the importance of artist [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], Leonie ([[Emily Mortimer]]) befriends Catherine Burnell ([[Christina Hendricks]]). Later, they meet [[Umeko Tsuda]] ([[Mieko Harada]]), a graduate student. In Tsuda’s room, Leonie gazes at a print of [[Hokusai]]’s ''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''.   The story now alternates between [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] 1904—where Leonie, living in a primitive tent with her mother Albiana ([[Mary Kay Place]]), bears a child temporarily named "Yo,"—and New York, where Leonie met Japanese poet [[Yone Noguchi]] ([[Shido Nakamura]]). She and Yone succumb to passion while collaborating on his anonymous novel, ''[[The American Diary of a Japanese Girl]]'', published by [[Frederick A. Stokes]] ([[David Jensen]]). They quarrel when Yone returns unannounced from London with an apparently drunk [[Charles Warren Stoddard]] (Patrick Weathers). The [[Russo-Japanese War]] begins and Yone, declaring he will return to Japan, greets Leonie's announcement of pregnancy with angry disbelief. Leonie tells her sad story to the now unhappily married Catherine, who reminds her of her advice not to be boring. In California, Leonie fends off a racist attack against her son and decides, against Albiana's advice, to accept Yone's invitation to come to Japan.  In [[Yokohama]] when the [[steam ship]] arrives, Yone finds Leonie and the child, on whom he now bestows the name Isamu. Welcomed somewhat coldly by Yone, Leonie accustoms herself to unfamiliar customs and meets three [[Tokyo University]] students Yone has arranged for her to tutor. Angered by Yone's belated confession that he now has another wife, she moves out, against Yone's protests. She begins tutoring the children of Setsu Koizumi, whose stories of her idyllic marriage with the late [[Lafcadio Hearn]] starkly contrast with her own. She also visits [[Umeko Tsuda]] to ask for a job at her now famous school, but Umeko, fearing scandal, refuses her. Leonie then gives birth to a daughter, [[Ailes Gilmour|Ailes]] whose father was one of Leonie's Japanese students. When they visit Yone, he calls her a slut. She decides to build a house in [[Chigasaki]], allowing Isamu, who is unhappy in a Yokohama school, to stay home and supervise the construction.  [[Yokohama]], 1918: Isamu now wants to go to America. At the ship Yone tries to stop him; Leonie tells him to go, and he obeys. Because of the war, Leonie does not receive Isamu's letters explaining the school has been closed due to the arrest of founder [[Edward Rumely]] ([[Jay Karnes]]) for alleged treason. Rumely belatedly appears and makes arrangements for Isamu, now Americanized as Sam Gilmour.   Leonie and Ailes ([[Kelly Vitz]]) arrive in New York and surprise Isamu (Jan Milligan) who, on Rumely's advice, is studying medicine. Leonie objects, telling Rumely Isamu is destined to be an artist, and he is soon seen neglecting his medical studies for drawing and sculpture. As Isamu gains artistic success and Ailes enters the world of dance, Leonie grows old, eking out a meager existence selling Japanese knickknacks. After an argument with Ailes, she becomes ill and is hospitalized. By the time Isamu makes it to her bedside she has died. At the small funeral Isamu meets Catherine.  In a closing scene shot in [[Sapporo]]'s [[Moerenuma Park]], Leonie watches children play in the playground designed by Isamu.  
Let Me In (film)
 In March 1983, in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico]], a disfigured man is taken to the hospital. An unnamed police detective tries to question him about a recent murder. While the detective answers a call outside the room, the disfigured man jumps out of the window, leaving behind a note that reads "I'm sorry Abby."  Two weeks earlier, Owen, an unhappy and lonely 12-year-old boy who is neglected by his [[Divorce|divorcing]] parents, sees a young girl, Abby, and an older man moving in next door. Owen and Abby become close friends and start communicating by [[Morse code]] through the walls of their apartments. At school, a teenage bully named Kenny and two of his friends constantly terrorize Owen, who lies to his mother about it but tells Abby the truth. Abby encourages him to retaliate, and pledges to protect him.  Abby's companion, Thomas, abducts a local teenager and drains his blood into a jug, only to accidentally spill all of the jug's contents. Starving, Abby attacks a neighbor and [[Vampire|drinks his blood]], killing him and forcing Thomas to dispose of the body.  On another night, Thomas hides in the back of another car, but is discovered. In the ensuing struggle, the car falls into a ditch and flips over. Trapped, Thomas pours [[Concentration|concentrated]] [[sulfuric acid]] on his face, rendering his features unrecognizable and bringing the story back to the first scene. Abby learns what happened and visits Thomas, who lets her drink his blood before falling to his death. That night, Owen is awakened by Abby, who insists he verbally invite her in. She spends the night in his bed and agrees to be his girlfriend.  The next day, Owen's class goes ice-skating on a river. Cornered by the bullies, Owen hits Kenny with a metal pole, splitting his left ear. At the same moment, the students spot the neighbor's body encased in the ice.  Later, Owen tries to make a blood pact with Abby. Seeing blood, Abby reveals her vampire form and flees, feeding on another neighbor. The next night, Abby admits to Owen that she is a vampire and that Thomas was not her father. Owen discovers an aged photo of her with Thomas as a young boy.  Owen sneaks out to spend the night at Abby's. In the morning, the detective forces his way into Abby's apartment and finds her asleep, only to be distracted by Owen. Abby wakes and attacks the detective, killing him. Abby tells Owen she will have to leave town. They share a kiss and he watches tearfully as she enters a taxi and leaves.  During swim class, Kenny, Jimmy (Kenny's older brother), and their friends ambush Owen and begin to drown him, only to be [[Dismemberment|dismembered]] by Abby. The next day, Owen leaves town on a train, traveling with a large trunk. From inside, a message in Morse code is tapped out. Owen smiles and taps out a response.

Lego: The Adventures of Clutch Powers
 Clutch Powers tunnels underground in search of a crystal to power Lego City. He eventually finds one, but the Crystal King guarding it wakes up and chases Clutch to an underground Power Miners base. Clutch escapes into a tunnel after temporarily slowing the monster, but finds out that the crystal is actually a baby rock monster. He returns it to the King, who gives a crystal to Clutch. Clutch then returns to his base in [[Lego City]] and gives it to his boss Kjeld Playwell who assigns him some new teammates: Brick Masterson ([[Roger Rose]]), a [[firefighter]], Peg Mooring ([[Yvonne Strahovski]]) a [[biologist]], and Bernie von Beam ([[Jeff Bennett|Jeff Glen Bennett]]) an [[engineer]]. Playwell informs of an incident on the [[Space Police]] prison planet when chaos occurs regarding to the imprisonment of the three most wanted criminals in the galaxy. Clutch and his team investigate the situation at once, despite the team's lack of cooperation and Clutch's intent of working alone. They soon arrive at the planet.  They see that someone is stuck in one of the prisoners' cells, but they are attacked by an unseen [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]], who was one of the criminals leading the other two. The criminals then disappear and Clutch and his friends break the person out of the cell, revealing himself to be the Watch Commander. Clutch and his team attempt to go after the criminals, though the Watch Commander comforts them by stating that he removed the [[spark plug]]s of all ships to ensure that the criminals will never escape from the planet. Unfortunately, the criminals have taken the team's ship (due to the team having left it open after squabbling with each other) and destroy the other ships, inciting the Watch Commander to berate the team for their arguing and their lack of cooperation. Feeling guilty, Clutch decides to take action and builds a new ship for the team, declaring that a team arguing with each other while being ordered to do their tasks is the sole reason why he always works alone. During the trip back, the team is informed by Playwell that the symbol on the Watch Commander's prison pod refers to Omega, one of the two criminals led by the evil wizard, and that the criminals have gone their separate ways following the escape. Playwell also informs that the evil wizard who planned the escape is none other than Mallock the Malign, infamous for terrorizing a [[medieval]] planet named Ashlar. The planet's ruler, the late King Revet, sacrificed his own life to ensure his kingdom's safety and Mallock's previous imprisonment. He left his son Prince Varen with his powerful golden sword to rule, despite Prince Varen's incapability of preparing in battle. Playwell then orders Clutch and the team to travel there to capture Mallock. The team manages to get to Ashlar, but their ship accidentally knocks down Lego-Henge (a spoof of [[Stonehenge]]). They get off and take refuge in a seemingly abandoned medieval mine with extra parts, but not after witnessing a group of armed skeletons marching down the forest, realizing that Mallock has gained a stranglehold of Ashlar around his fortress with a joint skeleton/goblin army acting as his own forces. As Peg, Brick, and Bernie build a battle chariot, Clutch leaves to get Prince Varen to convince him to fight against Mallock. Meanwhile, in the fortress, Mallock learns of the team's presence and orders his two skeleton henchmen Skelly and Bones to go after Clutch so they can find the prince and the golden sword to finalize his takeover of Ashlar. Back in the forest, Clutch ends up at a bridge but a troll named Hogar refuses to let him across until Clutch solves three riddles. Though Clutch gets them all right, Skelly and Bones catch up with him after a failed attempt to trap him, demanding Hogar to surrender Clutch to them at once. Hogar attempts to ward off the skeletons by hypnotizing them, but they don't fall for it, prompting an annoyed Hogar to swallow Clutch whole. He hits the skeletons with his club, and runs away to a secret doorway that is painted like the forest to escape the skeletons.  Having escaped Skelly and Bones, Hogar spits Clutch out on the other side of the wall and shows him the way to the castle of Prince Varen, telling him about the history of his father and the golden sword. Hogar also tells Clutch that he was the only troll who was on the kingdom's team and that he was assigned to protect Varen. Back at the medieval camp, Bernie develops a crush on Peg, who leaves to look for the animal that made mysterious tracks, and befriends a dragon. Back at the castle, Clutch finds Prince Varen and helps him wield a sword but he fails and gets angry at Clutch. Clutch protests that he was trying to help him defeat the wizard's forces, but Varen rejects him, confessing that he's scared of Mallock. Enraged, Clutch goes back to the camp and sees that a dwarf will help them so they set out to stop Mallock on their own.  Eventually, Prince Varen, Hogar, and their knights find out that Clutch was telling the truth and decide to help them in their battle against Mallock. Varen and Clutch sneak in the back of Mallock's castle by disguising Peg as Varen. Unfortunately, Mallock plays wise to their moves and traps them in a bone cage above a lava river and the skeleton army forces the knights to retreat. Attempting to avoid a Troll battle machine, Brick, Peg, and Bernie crash the chariot into a ditch. Back in the castle, Mallock makes a screen in front of the clouds to show them that Clutch and Varen will be killed unless the golden sword is surrendered to him immediately. Having no choice, Hogar brings the golden sword's chest to Mallock so he can free them, only to find that it's empty at the last minute. Enraged, Mallock traps Hogar in lightning and projects him back to the edge of the wall surrounding Varen's castle, leaving him trapped. Varen and Clutch send a message to the team so they can rely on themselves. Bernie gets fueled up by hope and they rebuild their broken chariot (which resembles the high-speed attack jeep used by [[Dr. Inferno]]'s henchmen from the [[Lego Agents]] theme) They reunite with the knights and they attack the skeleton army. Back in the castle, Peg gets the dragon to destroy the cage, freeing Clutch and Varen, who then retrieve the golden sword that Varen dropped earlier, since Mallock didn't bother to search for it. After much convincing from Clutch, Varen finally decides to face his fear of Mallock to ensure his kingdom's safety. Around the same time, Mallock attempts to lure Clutch into giving the sword to him by promising to lead him to his father, but Clutch refuses, saying that "I already found him!".  As Clutch watches Varen using the golden sword to fight against Mallock, Brick uses a [[jet pack]] to land on Mallock's fortress, where he battles Skelly and Bones. Despite Brick being outnumbered, Bernie helps him by throwing a gear at the skeletons and they get knocked apart. Back inside the fortress, Mallock taunts Varen of retaining his title as Prince of Ashlar as he uses his staff to attack Varen. However, Varen finally takes enough power from Mallock's staff into his sword, allowing the sword to unleash its full power, much to Mallock's shock. Taking the opportunity, Varen uses the sword to trap Mallock with a glowing chain, declaring Mallock under arrest and himself the new King of Ashlar. Following Mallock's defeat, Hogar is freed from his restrains and the skeleton army disappears into puffs of smoke, leaving Clutch's team and the knights to celebrate their victory. With peace declared open in Ashlar, Varen is then officially declared the new King, and when Clutch and his team pack up to transport the chained Mallock back to Lego City, Varen thanks him for being loyal and for being part of the team. The team then returns to Lego City, allowing the authorities to send the imprisoned Mallock in a cage back to the prison planet. Congratulating the team for their efforts, Playwell tells them that Omega and the other unnamed criminal (who resembles Squidman from the Lego Space Police line) are still on the loose, and they have gotten reports of the unnamed criminal's location on another planet. Encouraged with a new-found belief of teamwork, the team head onward to a new adventure to capture the criminal.

Let the Bullets Fly
 Set in [[History of the Republic of China|China]] during the [[Warlord era|warring 1920s]], "Poxy" Zhang (张麻子; [[Jiang Wen]]) leads a group of bandits, each of whom is numbered rather than named, and ambushes a government [[Horsecar|horse train]] carrying Ma Bangde (马邦德; [[Ge You]]), who is on his way to Goose Town (鹅城 ''E-cheng'') to assume the position of county governor.  Ma's train is derailed, killing both his bodyguards and his adviser, Counsellor Tang (汤师爷 ''Tang-shiye''; [[Feng Xiaogang]]).  Ma has no money, having spent it all to bribe and buy his position.  To avoid being killed by Zhang's bandits, he lies to them claiming that he is Counsellor Tang and that his wife ([[Carina Lau]]) was the dead governor's wife.  He tells the bandits that, if they spare him and his wife, he will help Zhang to impersonate Ma and pilfer Goose Town's finances.  At Goose Town, Zhang's appointment is opposed by local mobster boss Master Huang (黄老爷 ''Huang-laoye''; [[Chow Yun Fat]]), who lives in a fortified citadel.  Huang greets the governor's party by sending his best hat in a palanquin instead of himself.  Ma tells Zhang that previous governors would split with Huang the majority of taxes levied from the town residents. However, Zhang is not interested in taking money from the poor.  Champion Wu (武举人 ''Wu-juren''; [[Jiang Wu]]), one of Huang's subordinates, severely injures a citizen, and as governor Zhang rules against Wu in the town court.  In retaliation, Huang frames Zhang's godson, Six (老六 ''Lao-liu''), for theft.  Six kills himself one the process of proving his innocence.  Zhang vows to destroy Huang, but Ma advises him to use cunning rather than brute force.  Huang invites Zhang to a meal at his citadel, and there Huang pretends to have his subordinates killed as a sign of good faith.  Not realizing the governor is actually the bandit chief, Huang raises a plan to hunt down and kill Zhang Mazi.  Zhang pretends to agree to this plan, so long as Huang finances the expedition.  That night, Huang disguises his subordinates as Mazi's bandits and sends them to assassinate Zhang while he is asleep.  However, only Ma's wife is killed.  In grief, Ma reveals his true identity as governor to Zhang.  During the funeral for Ma's wife, Zhang has his bandits kidnap Huang and the heads of Goose Town's two leading families for ransom.  They quickly discover they have captured Huang's [[look-alike]].  The town raises the ransom money but Zhang refuses to take it, instead returning it to the townsfolk.  As they do so, Flora (花姐 ''Huajie''), a young prostitute in Huang's custody, discovers their identity.  She is captured by Zhang's gang but becomes friendly with Two (老二 ''Lao-er'') and Three (老三 ''Lao-san'') and later stays on as a bandit member, helping them to guard Huang's look-alike.  Huang sends his own subordinates, also disguised as bandits, to retrieve the money handed back to the town.  A random woman approaches Ma, claiming that he seduced her while in Shanxi, and that he is the father of her son. As compensation, Ma gives them two jewels.  Huang tries to kill Zhang again by sending subordinates to his house, disguised as masked bandits. The plan fails and Huang's men are shot to death. As such, Huang is forced to supply the money for Zhang's Anti Bandit Expedition. When Huang's steward obtains a portrait of the real Governor Ma, and Huang confronts Zhang, Ma confesses that he is the real governor, and pretends that Zhang is his nephew. As the Expedition goes ahead, Huang employs a fake Zhang Mazi to kill Zhang, and also sends men to plant a landmine on the road. In the ensuing battle, Two is killed, but the fake Zhang Mazi is captured. To avoid death, he offers Zhang two jewels, and admits that he obtained them by robbing and killing a woman and her son. Ma recognizes the jewels, and is filled with grief, and tries to travel to Shanxi, but drives over the landmine and is killed.  Zhang vows revenge and returns to Goose Town for a showdown with Huang.  He scatters money to the townsfolk and Huang gathers it up the next day; then Zhang scatters firearms to the townsfolk and prevents Huang from gathering them.  Zhang and his bandits put on a show of attacking the citadel, then publicly beheads Huang's look-alike to convince the townsfolk that Huang is dead and the one in the citadel is the look-alike. The townsfolk are reassured and storm the citadel with their new weapons.  Zhang gives Huang a gun with one bullet left for his own suicide.  However, a moment later, Huang stands on top of his own citadel and fires the gun into the air to get Zhang's attention.  He throws a hat better than the one he originally sent to greet Zhang off the roof, as he promised.  He then walks back into the citadel, killing himself with his own landmine.  Three intends to marry Flora and the surviving bandits leave for Shanghai to lead a more peaceful life.  They take the train through the mountains, Zhang riding after them.

Life as We Know It (film)
  Holly Berenson ([[Katherine Heigl]]) is the owner of a small [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] bakery, and Eric Messer ([[Josh Duhamel]]), (often just known as "Messer") is a promising television technical sports director for the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. Their best friends Peter ([[Hayes MacArthur]]), an attorney, and Alison Novak ([[Christina Hendricks]]) set them up on a blind date that goes horribly wrong, and results in both hating each other. As the years go by, Peter and Alison get married, and have a baby girl named Sophie Christina, and select Holly and Messer as godparents of Sophie. They tolerate each other, but still tease and banter.  Shortly after Sophie's first birthday, Peter and Alison are killed in a car crash. Holly and Messer learn that in their friends' wills, they were named Sophie's joint guardians. Holly and Messer must put their differences aside and move into Sophie's home to care for her. Living together proves to be a struggle. One night, Holly leaves Sophie with Messer while she covers an important catering job - the same night that he is given the opportunity to direct a big basketball game. Messer takes Sophie to work, but she constantly distracts him with her crying. Messer makes a big mistake at the end of the game and thinks his chances of being promoted are gone. When they get home, Messer and Holly argue, but later they make up.  Holly meets Sam ([[Josh Lucas]]), Sophie's pediatrician, and finds herself attracted to him. They arrange a date, which is cut short when Messer calls to tell Sam that Sophie has a high fever. Sam and Holly go to the hospital, and Messer sees Holly kiss Sam.  As the two guardians continue to care for Sophie, they discover that raising a child is much more expensive than they had expected, and Holly can no longer afford to implement her plans to expand her business. Messer offers to invest in her company, and eventually Holly agrees. To cement the new relationship, they decide to go on a date. They end up having sex and begin to develop feelings for each other. Their [[Child Protective Services]] caseworker, who has previously advised them against getting involved, tells them they must make a firm commitment either to stay together, or break up. Anything in between would be bad for Sophie. Messer is offered a job in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and he seriously considers taking it up, as it has been his dream for several years, but doesn't discuss it with Holly. Holly is upset when she finds out and tells him to take the job, accusing him of looking for a way out of raising Sophie. Messer goes to Phoenix.  At [[Thanksgiving]] Messer returns to Atlanta, hoping to patch things up with Holly (who is hosting a big dinner for neighbors and friends), but finds her in a relationship with Sam. Messer and Holly argue, because Sam mentions Holly is planning to sell the house soon, since it is too expensive to keep up. Messer insists it was Peter and Alison's wish that Sophie be raised in their home, by them together. Holly consistently accuses Messer of deserting her and Sophie, while Messer points out how quickly she replaced him. Messer tells her he loves her, but leaves the dinner, planning to return to Phoenix. Once alone with Holly, Sam says that if he and his ex-wife had fought in the way that Messer and Holly did, they would still be together. He tells Holly it is obvious she needs to work out her feelings for Messer, and leaves.  The caseworker comes for the last appointment to determine whether Holly and Messer are fit parents for Sophie. Holly realizes that she can't take care of Sophie without Messer, and that she loves him. She and Sophie drive to the airport with the caseworker. Holly rushes to buy tickets for all three of them to gain access to the [[gate (airport)|departure gate]], but on arriving at the gate, finds that they have missed Messer's flight, which has departed. She returns to the house disappointed. To her surprise, she finds him sitting inside. He tells her he has realized that Peter and Alison chose them to be Sophie's guardians because, together, they are a family.  At Sophie's second birthday party, all the neighbors and friends in attendance. Holly has made an elaborate cupcake display for Sophie, as well as another cake with the number 1 on it. When Messer asks what the cake is for, she says, "It's for us, 'cause we made it a year." They kiss. The guests sing 'Happy Birthday' to Sophie.

Little Fockers
 Five years after the events of the previous film, Gaylord "Greg" Focker (Stiller) is preparing to celebrate his twins Samantha and Henry's fifth-birthday party. Things seem to go awry when Greg's father-in-law Jack Byrnes (De Niro) visits. Recently, Jack has been diagnosed with a heart condition and become embittered by his daughter Debbie's divorce from her husband Bob (their marriage was the social event in [[Meet the Parents|the first film]] and how Jack and Greg met), for cheating on her with a nurse. Jack's original plan was to declare Bob his successor as head of the Byrnes family, but he decides to pass the role to Greg, naming him "The Godfocker". Despite Greg reluctantly accepting the role, Jack resumes his spying on him and begins to suspect him of infidelity when he sees him with drug representative Andi Garcia (Alba), who openly flirts with him, and the presence of Sustengo erection pills in Greg's house prompts Jack to think Greg is no longer sexually attracted to his wife Pam (Polo). Furthermore, Jack starts to doubt Greg's ability to provide for his family when he appears reluctant to send his children to a private school.  During a medical conference promoting Sustengo, Greg meets Bob at a bar. Bob tells Greg of Jack's original intention to name him as successor, "The Bobfather", and his relief and happiness at leaving Jack's family makes Greg slightly uncomfortable. Meanwhile, Jack speaks to Pam about the possibility of divorcing Greg and renewing her relationship with her ex-fiancé, Kevin Rawley (Wilson). Eventually, following a row at a clinic, Greg escapes to his and Pam's unfinished new house, where Andi turns up. She tries to cheer him up with takeout and wine, but she drinks so much wine (also popping many erection [[Pill (pharmacy)|pills]]) that she gets excessively drunk and makes an eccentric, extremely aggressive [[sexual harassment|sexual pass]] on Greg. Jack, looking for Greg so he can apologize to him and bring him home, pulls up to the house and sees through the window what looks like Greg and Andi having sex, although Greg is actually trying to rebuff Andi's advances. Disgusted, Jack leaves, and tells Dina and Pam that he couldn't find Greg.  Greg's parents Bernie (Hoffman) and Roz (Streisand) rejoin the family at the twins' birthday party the next day. Enraged at Greg's apparent infidelity, Jack engages him in a physical fight, despite Greg claiming that Andi was drunk and he was rebuffing her. The fight culminates with Jack having a heart attack and collapsing, and Greg quickly taking charge of the situation and looking after Jack. As paramedics take him away, Jack quietly admits that he believes Greg after feeling his carotid artery, which remained stable while Greg was claiming his innocence. Impressed with Greg for his integrity and quick thinking, Jack approves Greg to be the Godfocker.  Four months later, on Christmas Day, Greg and Pam's parents come to spend Christmas with them in their new house. Greg's parents (who are [[Jewish]]) give Jack a [[kippah]] as his present, informing him that while they were nursing him back to health they traced his family roots and discovered that he is part Jewish (which doesn't impress Jack). Bernie informs Greg and Pam that he and Roz have sold their [[Miami]] Island home and are moving to [[Chicago]], only two houses down from their house. Jack and Dina decide they will move too, because they also want to be close to their grandchildren. The film ends with Greg and Pam trying to wean their parents off the idea.  During the credits, Jack is back in his home on Long Island. He has grown fond of the search engine [[Google]] (having used it to do research on Andi earlier in the film). With Mr. Jinx, the family's cat, Jack watches a video of Greg on [[YouTube]] in which Greg mocks him at the Sustengo conference. Jack then discovers a [[remix]]ed version of the video using puns of several of the words in the video, and is slightly amused.  
Little Big Soldier
 On 1 December 2009, a press conference was held for the film, along with Chan's announcement of a new teaser trailer posted on the film's official [[Sina.com|Sina]] website. ''Twitch'' also released a plot synopsis of the film:<ref name="synopsis"></ref>  {{cquote|It was the darkest of times in China, when ruthless warlords waged battles to satiate their endless aggression. Millions of lives perished, and those who survived had only two choices – kill or be killed.  The battalions of warring states [[Wei (state)|Liang]] and [[Wey (state)|Wey]] collided in a bloodbath that lasted from dawn until dusk. Only two men were left standing – a foot soldier from Liang and the rival General from Wey. The Soldier survived because he is an expert in playing dead, with a device strapped on his body which protruded like an arrowhead for added realism.  The Soldier captured the wounded General, hoping to use the enemy as his ticket to freedom – by handing the General to the Liang warlord, the Soldier could be honorably discharged and return home to his peaceful life. The young General, though taken captive, was condescending towards the Soldier. The two men were often at loggerheads during the long and winding journey.}}

Later, Mitchel and Gant meet and Gant assigns Mitchel to collect money in [[Streatham]], [[Clapham]] and [[Kennington]].

Gant, to put Mitchel in trouble, waylays the doctor who owns Mitchel's apartment and after Gant rapes him, he orders his henchmen, Fletcher ([[Matt King (comedian)|Matt King]]) and Beaumont (Nick Bartlett) to kill him.

Mitchel visits Charlotte and tells her that he loves her; the two sleep together. Mitchel sees Billy's van and attacks Billy, who says that Gant sent him to kill Mitchel; he warns Mitchel to look for "a big Bosnian fucker". Mitchel borrows one of Charlotte's husband's [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls Royce]]s and confronts Billy at a pub. He beats Billy, who says Gant will kill everyone whom Mitchel loves, and Mitchel steals the money Billy collected for Gant.   Mitchel meets his sister at a restaurant in order to persuade her to get out of the country so that she is out of Gant's reach. He gives her a train ticket and money, but she belittles his worry and ignores the warning. Mitchel and Jordan find Billy's dead body in the front garden of Charlotte's home, and the Bosnian, named Storbor, standing outside the gate.  Mitchel asks Jordan to help him kill Storbor and the two follow Storbor to a nightclub where they meet him and the drug addict from the party named Whiteboy ([[Jamie Campbell Bower]]).

 The Losers are an elite [[Black operation|black ops]] team of [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Special Forces]] operatives, led by Clay ([[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]]) and formed by Roque ([[Idris Elba]]), Pooch ([[Columbus Short]]), Jensen ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]), and Cougar ([[Óscar Jaenada]]), who are sent to [[Bolivia]] in a [[search and destroy]] mission on a compound run by a drug lord. While [[Laser designator|painting a target]] for an upcoming air strike, the Losers spot slave children in the compound and try to call off the attack, but their superior, codenamed "Max" ([[Jason Patric]]), ignores their pleas.  With no other option, the Losers enter the compound, successfully rescue the children and kill the drug lord in the process. As a helicopter arrives to pick them up, Max, convinced that they know too much, orders it to be destroyed, unaware that they decided to rescue the children first. The Losers watch as a missile destroys the helicopter and kills 25 innocents. Knowing that the attack was meant to kill them, they fake their deaths and become stranded in Bolivia, determined to get revenge on the mysterious Max.  Four months later, Clay is approached by Aisha ([[Zoe Saldana]]), a mysterious woman who offers him the chance to kill Max, against whom she wants revenge. Clay accepts and Aisha arranges for the Losers to return to the [[United States]], where they proceed to attack a convoy supposedly carrying Max, only to discover that they were tricked by Aisha into stealing a hard drive with Max's secrets.  Unable to access the files, Jensen infiltrates the company that made the drive and steals an algorithm that allows him to crack the code, discovering that the drive contains credits for a $400&nbsp;million transfer in Max's name, which he received for selling "Snukes"—eco-friendly bombs with the potency of a nuclear warhead, but no fall-out—to international terrorists. Tracing the money flow to the [[Los Angeles]] [[Port of Los Angeles|International Port Of Entry]], which the Losers deduce is Max's base, a plan is formed to attack it and kill Max.  While studying the drive, Jensen discovers that their mission in Bolivia was a cover so Max could eliminate the drug lord—who had discovered his plan—and that Aisha is the man's daughter, seeking revenge for his death. After her cover is blown, Aisha shoots Jensen and escapes. Believing that she might betray them, the Losers decide to speed up their attack on Max's base, only to be betrayed by Roque and captured by Max and his right-hand man and chief of security, Wade ([[Holt McCallany]]).  As the Losers are lined up to be executed, Aisha returns and ambushes Max's team. In the ensuing fight, Clay confirms that he killed Aisha's father. Roque attempts to steal Max's plane, loaded with his money, and tries to escape. As Roque's jet heads down the runway, Wade takes a motorcycle and goes after him to retrieve Max's money. Cougar shoots the motorcycle's engine, causing Wade to be hurled into the jet's engine and the flaming motorcycle to be hurled into the cockpit of the plane, which explodes, killing Roque.  As Jensen, Cougar and Aisha help Pooch, who has been shot in both legs by one of Max's security guards, Clay pursues Max to a crane, where Max says that he has activated a Snuke that will destroy Los Angeles, and Clay will have to choose between de-activating it or killing Max. Clay chooses the former and Max escapes, but Clay affirms that he now knows what Max looks like and will soon find him.  Max escapes on a bus and is robbed by two thugs. His fate after this is unknown.  Shortly thereafter, the Losers help Pooch reach the hospital where his pregnant wife is giving birth to their son and attend Jensen's 8-year-old niece's soccer game.  
Lost Boys: The Thirst
 In [[Washington, D.C.]], Edgar and Alan Frog interrupt a half-vampire Senator who is killing a Congressman to finish his transformation. In the ensuing chaos, Alan is forced to drink vampire blood, which will make him a half-vampire.  Five years later in San Cazador, California, Edgar is facing eviction from his trailer and tries to raise funds by selling his collection of old comic books to his friend Zoe, who works at a local comics shop. While there, a famous blogger named Johnny Trash enters; Zoe explains that Johnny is there for a [[rave]] that's going on in the town.  Back at his trailer, Edgar is approached by Gwen Lieber, a writer of romantic vampire novels, whose brother Peter was kidnapped during a rave in [[Ibiza|Ibiza, Spain]] and she suspects vampiric activity. She gives him a vial of a drug called "The Thirst" which is given to people at raves hosted by a person known as "DJ X"; he determines that it is vampire blood. Gwen offers him a large sum of money to rescue her brother, but he turns it down.  DJ X and his associates are transporting Peter—bound and drugged—in a small plane. DJ X and three others jump from the plane in flight, landing safely to meet Johnny Trash for a live interview. DJ X mauls Johnny afterward, since the blogger had served his purpose in promoting the rave online.  Edgar visits Alan, who is now half-vampire and satisfies his thirst for blood by feeding on animal blood acquired in his job as a taxidermist. Edgar tries to enlist Alan's aid in stopping DJ X from raising an army through his raves, but he refuses, having lost all hope that he can be saved and believing that the whole Alpha Vampire theory is just a "neverending pyramid scheme".  Remembering his youthful days with Alan and Sam Emerson, Edgar resolves to take the job alone but Gwen introduces him to Lars Van Goetz, a former reality TV star hoping to use the mission to make him famous again; Edgar reluctantly accepts his help.  After a visit to the grave of Sam Emerson (who Edgar was forced to kill when he turned into a vampire), in which Edgar returns to Sam the ''Batman'' #14 that Sam had boasted having when they met, Edgar finds that Alan has left him a book of vampire history to help in his mission. Edgar gives the book to Zoe to research. She is attacked by a vampire, but she and Edgar defeat it, and she explains what she has learned about a ritual sacrifice during a Blood Moon, such as the one that will occur the night of the rave.  Congressman Blake, now Edgar's weapons designer (for a fee) outfits Edgar and Zoe for battle. After fighting off an attack on Blake's house, they meet up with Gwen, Lars, and Claus, and set off for the island where the rave is taking place. Leaving Gwen behind for her safety, the remaining four go inside in search of Peter. Lars finds him, but thinking that the whole thing is staged, leaves Peter to rescue him at a more dramatic time. As they fight various vampires, Lars has his heart ripped out by one of them and Edgar is injured by Lily, but rejoins Gwen, Claus, and Zoe in returning to the building.  DJ X is distributing The Thirst to the crowd, and preparing to sacrifice Peter. Edgar takes on DJ X, and is narrowly saved by the timely arrival of Alan. The vampire hunters rally, and Edgar impales DJ X with a resin spike grenade (a weapon stolen from [[Area 51]] by Congressman Blake) before he and Alan finish him off with swords through the heart.  To their surprise, the death of DJ X doesn't cause the half-vampires to revert. They discover that Peter was the real alpha vampire (and Gwen is not his sister), whose power DJ X was attempting to extract. Gwen's rescue mission was also a ruse to bring Edgar to Peter, who wanted him to become his personal vampire hit-man, to keep other vampires under control. Peter kills Gwen instead of turning her like she wanted, and orders the other vampires to kill Edgar and the rest. Peter attempts to use his partial control over Alan against Edgar, but Edgar douses Peter with water which he simultaneously blesses into ''holy'' water, destroying Peter and returning everyone else to normal.  Later, as Alan enjoys getting his first suntan in years, Zoe and Edgar reflect on their adventure. Edgar wonders about her knowledge that vampires were real, which she dismisses as "a hunch". Edgar comments about something he's just read about female werewolves being able to transform at any time and the film ends with Zoe's face as she becomes a werewolf.

With police pursuing the obvious motive that she was taking revenge for her various humiliations at the hands of Christine, Isabelle is arrested and, despite giving all the signs of being in the grips of a nervous breakdown, confesses to, and then is charged with, her murder. Awaiting sentencing in prison, Isabelle withdraws her confession, claiming it was made under duress and while heavily medicated. She begins to pick apart the circumstantial evidence implicating her guilt; scratches on her arm thought to be knife wounds were from a gardening accident, witnesses testify to seeing her at a cinema at the time of the murder and a kitchen knife thought to be the murder weapon is actually located in Isabelle's shed. The last piece of evidence is a torn strip of a scarf found at the murder scene, an item originally given to Isabelle by Christine as a gift. When Isabelle is able to produce an identical scarf, completely intact, at her home, she is cleared of the charges and released from prison. Acting on a tip provided by Isabelle herself, police learn of Philippe's embezzlement, and a search of his property locates the remaining section of the scarf in his vehicle, planted there by Isabelle as part of an elaborate effort to frame him. He is arrested and charged. Isabelle, now free of both her nemeses, returns triumphantly to her company.

Lunopolis
 Footage on the news shows what seems like proof of a paranormal event.  Twelve days earlier, on December 9, 2012, a conspiracy-themed radio show takes a call from a man who claims to work at [[Area 51]].  After the caller describes a secret civilization on the moon, he is cut off.  George Larson, the host, dismisses it as a hoax until he receives a photo album that contains enough evidence that he hires a documentary crew headed by Matt and Sonny to investigate the claims.  Matt and Sonny realize a decades-old Polaroid photograph depicts a man in modern clothing; on the back, it has a series of numbers written on it.  They decode these as GPS coordinates that are less than an hour away from where they live in Louisiana.  There, they find a hatch that leads to an underground warehouse.  After searching the mostly empty structure, they find a mysterious device none of them can identify.  Intrigued, they grab it and flee what they believe are approaching people.  Documentation provides little explanation of the device but identifies it as a harness and allows them to turn it on; this turns out to be disastrous.  Sonny, who is wearing the harness, disappears for a second and suffers injuries that require a brief hospitalization.  Worried that they are over their heads, they take the harness to Dr. Orin Raymond, a local professor.  While examining it, Dr. Raymond finds a glowing, green crystal he identifies as  found only on the moon.  As they leave, a member of the Church of Lunology harasses them and hands them a flyer.  Interviewees describe the Church of Lunology, which claims to be the fastest growing religion.  Members believe that a civilization lives on the moon, and the US government has been covering it up.  While Matt and Sonny investigate a Church of Lunology building, one of their camera operators, Nate, takes exterior shots.  Separately, both groups are confronted by Church of Lunology members, who demand the return of their time machine.  The filmmakers regroup and flee, chased by the Lunology members.  Unable to outrun the Lunology members, the filmmakers stop their car and demand an explanation.  Instead, the Lunology members' car takes off into the sky.  Stunned and unsure of what happened, the filmmakers debate what to do next.  A note leads them to David James, a former member of the lunar colony who explains its history.  The lunar colony and Church of Lunology are separate; the colonists are from the future, and Lunology cultists are normal people.  Using the lunar rock, J. Ari Hilliard invents immortality and time travel, and, on December 21, 2012, he sends the first mission back to 350 BC, where they begin changing the timeline.  This created unintended changes, resulting in a desire to repeatedly tinker with the timeline.  Dissidents opposed this, fearing it could result in more unintended changes and weakened dimensional barriers between the changed timelines.  The scientists' rationalizations became Lunology.  Hilliard, himself disillusioned, left the lunar colony and tried to reveal the truth, to no avail.  Convinced that immortality was too great a power for any one person, he tried to murder himself before he could become immortal.  The lunar colony, wise to his plans, prevented his first attempt in 1947, when he was born.  His next attempt resulted in the [[Roswell UFO incident]], as he fled the lunar colony back to Earth with the crystal.  The crystal exists only in one place across all timelines, so the lunar colony must recover it before they can time travel any further.  When Lunologists track down James, the filmmakers flee.  Dr. Raymond and Larson both disappear.  When the filmmakers return to the spot where they found the harness, it seems to have changed.  James recommends they give the crystal to Hilliard himself.  The CEO of Lunology plays stupid, but they set up a meeting with Hilliard.  At the meeting, James reveals himself as the immortal, future version of Hilliard.  Hilliard says the crystal was a test; James comes to the realization that they failed the test and kills Hilliard, his alternative self, to prevent further time travel.  In a possible alternate timeline, people discover the documentary footage. Meanwhile, the anachronistic man from the Polaroid walks into the meeting room, with both timelines intertwining behind him, and picks up the crystal. He also picks up the camera and stares into it, with his eyes glowing green momentarily behind his sunglasses.

Three years later, a down-and-out Machete roams [[Texas]], scraping by on yard work. Michael Booth ([[Jeff Fahey]]), a local businessman and [[spin doctor]], explains to Machete that corrupt [[Texas Senate|Texas State Senator]] John McLaughlin ([[Robert De Niro]]) is sending hundreds of illegal immigrants out of the country. In order to stop this, Booth offers Machete $150,000 to kill McLaughlin. Machete accepts the murder contract after Booth threatens to kill him if he does not.  Machete trains a rifle on McLaughlin from a rooftop during a rally, but before he fires he sees one of Booth's henchmen aiming at him. The henchman shoots Machete in the shoulder, the latter then shoots McLaughlin in the leg. It is revealed that Booth orchestrated the attempted assassination as part of a [[false flag]] operation to gain public support for McLaughlin's secure border campaign. By setting up Machete as the gunman, the conspirators make it appear that an outlaw illegal Mexican immigrant has tried to assassinate the senator, who is known for his tough stance on illegal immigration.  An injured Machete escapes capture by Booth and is taken to a hospital to be treated for wounds, escaping once again from Booth's henchmen at the hospital. Agent Sartana Rivera ([[Jessica Alba]]), a persistent [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] agent, is sent by her superior to find and capture the injured Machete. Machete, with the help of Luz ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), aka Shé, the leader of an illegal immigrant aid movement known as the Network, recruits Padre ([[Cheech Marin]]), his "holy" brother. To take revenge on Booth, Machete kidnaps Booth's wife and his daughter, April ([[Lindsay Lohan]]), after "starring" in an amateur adult film with them. He also collects evidence from Booth's house linking McLaughlin and the Mexican drug lord in a major [[drug trafficking]] deal. After encountering Machete, Sartana begins to develop an interest in him. Elsewhere, Booth, who is revealed to be working for Torrez, hires a hitman, Osiris Amanpour ([[Tom Savini]]), to assist in the hunt for Machete.  Booth and Osiris kill Padre in his church by nailing him to a cross, but do not find his own wife and daughter. Unbeknownst to Booth, the church has cameras. Through the CCTV recordings, the news of McLaughlin's corruption and faked assassination is eventually aired on national television. Infuriated, McLaughlin kills Booth and heads back to join Torrez to kill Machete. In order to eliminate the people who double-crossed him, Machete gathers the Mexican Network and leads them to the base of the border vigilantes, led by Von Jackson ([[Don Johnson]]).  During this confrontation, the Mexican illegals triumph over the border vigilantes. Jackson tries to escape, but Luz shoots him in the back of the head. Machete fights Torrez and stabs him. April shows up wearing a nun's habit after escaping from the church and shoots McLaughlin after figuring out that he has killed her father.  McLaughlin, injured, manages to escape, but he is later killed by the last remnants of his own border vigilante group, who mistake him for a Mexican. Ultimately, Machete meets with Sartana, who gives him a green card. They kiss and ride off into the night. The closing credits announce further adventures for Machete.  
Madrasapattinam
  An elderly English woman Amy Wilkinson (Carole Trangmar-Palmer), almost at her deathbed in [[London]], wants to come down to [[Madras]] in search of a young man Ilam Parithi ([[Arya (actor)|Arya]]) whom she last saw on 15 August 1947 to return a ''[[Mangala_sutra | thali]]'' (traditional wedding threads) of his mother, which he gave her as a sign of stating that she belongs to India and nobody can separate them. However, after a turn of events, she had married another man from her hometown and thus felt that the ''thali'' was no longer her property.  Amy Wilkinson arrives in Madras with her granddaughter Catherine ([[Lisa Lazarus]]), equipped only with a picture of Parithi that was taken sixty years ago. Wilkinson interrogates various people about Parithi's whereabouts. In the process, she recalls the events when she had first visited Chennai, and the chain of events that took place:  A young Amy ([[Amy Jackson]]), the daughter of the  Madras Presidency Governor, visits Chennai (then called Madharasapattinam) along with her translator Nambi ([[Cochin Hanifa]]) and encounters Parithi, whom she calls "brave man". Parithi, a member of the dhobi (launderer) clan is also an experienced wrestler who trains under Ayyakanu ([[Nassar]]). He openly opposes the British officials who attempt to build a golf course in the dhobi clan's dwelling place. He challenges a cruel [[racist]] officer named Robert Ellis ([[Alexx O'Nell]]), who is also Amy's suitor, to a wrestling match to decide the fate of his clan's home. Parithi is successful, and Ellis vows revenge.  Following a series of secret meetings between Parithi and Amy, love blossoms between them, and Parithi affectionately calls her "Duraiyamma"(Female lord/Lordess), a polite term of addressing British women. However a major threat comes in the form of independence for India on 15 August 1947, which means that all White officials and their families, including Amy, would have to leave India. On the eve of independence, all of India is celebrating. However Amy and Parithi, determined to be together, run away and are hunted by an angry Ellis and his force. An Indian policeman helps the two of them by hiding them in a clock tower on top of the Madras Central Railway Station, but they are discovered by Ellis. After a fierce fight, Ellis is killed and Parithi is badly wounded. Amy helps Parithi to escape by casting him with a life-raft into the [[Cooum River|Coovum river]], before she is captured and taken back to London. She had never known if Parithi survived, or what his fate was.  Back in the present, Wilkinson is urgently called back to London to have a life-saving operation. But she is determined to find Parithi and, by chance, encounters a taxi driver who assumes that she would want to visit a charitable trust named Duraiyamma Foundation. The driver shows her around the foundation, which has organisations providing free housing, education and medical care (which were all promised to the dhobi children by the young Amy several years ago). She realizes that the Duraiyamma Foundation was established by Ilam Parithi, and named after her.  Then When she asks the driver what became of Parithi, he leads her to his tomb, and reveals that he died twelve years ago. She kneels before the tomb and claims the ''thali'' (nuptial threads) as her own. She declares "It's mine!" before quietly passing away on Parithi's tomb. Her granddaughter mourns for her, and the taxi driver is dumbfounded to learn that the old woman was "Duraiyamma" herself. The epilogue shows Parithi and Amy (as they were in their younger days) in the afterlife, depicted as a 1940s-style Madrasapattinam. As the credits roll, a series of [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] images are shown, illustrating the transformation of Madrasapattinam of the 1940s to modern-day Chennai.

When he finds that Hyo-jeong and So-mi have been kidnapped, he gives them the bag, and Ramrowan kills Bear to set him up as the fall guy.  Realizing that Tae-sik may serve better as a mule, the gang brothers force Tae-sik to perform a delivery to Oh Myung-gyu, who they have set up. The police arrest Tae-sik and discover Hyo-jeong's body, with her organs harvested, in the back of the car he used to make the delivery. Tae-sik escapes from the police station to search for So-mi, and during his escape, the police are bewildered at Tae-sik's display of power, combat techniques, and agility.

He demands to know what happened to his younger brother, and, in a rage, Tae-sik kills the gang members, including Ramrowan and Man-seok.  As Tae-sik prepares to commit suicide out of grief, a scared and dirty, but unscathed So-mi emerges from the darkness; she had been saved by Ramrowan, who took pity on her because she had been kind to him - the eyes in the container belonged to the gangsters' surgeon, who had been killed off-camera by Ramrowan.  The police allow Tae-sik and So-mi to ride together after they arrest him, and, while she sleeps, Tae-sik asks if they can be dropped off at a small convenience store.  Tae-sik buys a backpack along with other school supplies.  He tells her that she's going to be on her own now, as the police have to take him away.

Their relationship is strained, to say the least, as Alice finds herself in service to Nanny’s unrelenting demands. Alice is subjugated to bizarre psychological and physical abuses from Nanny, who quickly reveals herself as Alice's worse nightmare. The final conflict comes as a result of Alice's adoption of a white rabbit. Nanny Dearest forbids having a “rodent” as a pet (“They don't even make good coats!”) and sentences the poor bunny to death. Despite numerous creative attempts to put an end to the him, Nanny takes increasingly severe action when the "damn rabbit keeps coming back." With Nanny’s wickedness now revealed in full force, she instigates the ultimate solution, flushing the poor creature down the toilet. Engorged with her own mad power, Nanny flushes Alice down the “rabbit hole” as well. Alice lands in a surreal “Wonderland” (think [[Peter Max]] on acid) populated by perverse creatures who would make Lewis Carrol turn over in his grave.  Alice's white rabbit, now incarnated as a rapping, hip-hop “White Chocolate,” becomes the first of many encounters with eccentric characters who have found their way into [[Wonderland (fictional country)|Wonderland]], including a boozy [[Glinda the Good Witch]] (who has a very strange relationship with her munchkins), a hookah smoking Penispillar in his mushroom forest and a naughty [[Cheshire Cat]], smiling for all the wrong reasons. Then, after stumbling upon Trannie Dee and Trannie Dum’s trailer park where Alice is introduced to a little Wonderland magic, the [[Mad Hatter]] serves up Titmouse tea at a truly twisted Tea Party.

In a fit of jealousy, the King frames Alice with an illegal wire hanger, and the Queen invariably demands Alice’s beheadment. Barely escaping with her head, Alice returns to the “real world” where she recognizes her past sins of using wire hangers and not eating enough red meat. With her work done, Nanny declares “She's off, Chim Chimeree and all that,” to horrify another child... or so she thinks!

Phil and Don meet at the dog park to discuss Phil's assignment, an ad campaign to win over Petco. There, Marmaduke meets Mazie, who develops a crush on Marmaduke. He also meets Giuseppe, a Chinese Crested dog who is afraid of everything, and Raisin, a very smart but minute [[Dachshund]].  Later, Marmaduke meets a [[Rough Collie]] named Jezebel, whose boyfriend is Bosco, a violent [[Beauceron]] with two [[Miniature Pinscher]] minions named Thunder and Lightning. Bosco intimidates Marmaduke, who does not want to fight. Marmaduke and the mutts get together at night and crash Bosco's pedigrees-only party, only to be scared away. Marmaduke asks Mazie to help him get a girl, whom she presumes is herself but is Jezebel.  Marmaduke has Carlos pretend to be lost in the dog park, and the two stage a fight in front of all the dogs to boost Marmaduke's popularity. Marmaduke enters a dog surfing contest put together as a promotional stunt by Phil to sway Petco and beats Bosco, who is the reigning dog-surfing champion. They get into a fight, which appalls the Petco executives. As a result, Phil hires a dog trainer named Anton to help him control Marmaduke, albeit with little success.  Marmaduke takes Jezebel on Mazie's dream date, which the latter watches from afar. While the Winslow family are on Don's boat, Marmaduke throws a party; most residents of the dog park attend, save for Mazie, Giuseppe, and Raisin. Bosco crashes the party and discovers it was Carlos at the dog park. He exposes Marmaduke, who loses his friends. When the Winslows return and Phil discovers the house in a wreck, he locks Marmaduke outside. Marmaduke runs away and leaves Mazie a toy she had given him earlier. Mazie goes to Marmaduke's house, and Carlos tells her Marmaduke never returned. As she looks for him, Marmaduke meets Chupadogra, a wise, elderly [[English Mastiff]] who is feared for presumably eating his owner. In reality, he ran away to lead a pack, but they abandoned him. He has spent the time alone in the woods with nothing but a blanket and his old water bowl, which reads "Buster". Buster tells Marmaduke to return to his family while he still has one and distracts a [[dog catcher]]. Marmaduke leaves but gets lost.  In the morning, the Winslows discover Marmaduke missing and search for him. Mazie and the family find him simultaneously on the streets, but Mazie falls into a subterranean rainwater conduit after the street below her collapses. Marmaduke jumps in after her; Phil and the fire department attempt to retrieve him. The fireman saves Mazie but loses Marmaduke in the raging water. By this time, Phil has been fired for missing his last chance meeting with Petco. He follows the aqueduct and finds Marmaduke in the raging waters. Phil begs Marmaduke to let go of the branch he is holding onto and let the waters carry him to Phil. He reluctantly does and is saved. Several kids record it on video and put it on [[YouTube]]. When it proves popular, Phil is rehired and Petco stocks Bark Organic. Phil discusses moving back to Kansas, but the Winslow family wants to stay in California.  Marmaduke convinces the pedigrees to share the park, and they turn on Bosco, who leaves, after revealing his fear of bees (which Marmaduke also fears). Meanwhile, Phil and Don think of new commercials while considering whether dogs can talk to each other or dance. Marmaduke, Jezebel, Mazie, Giuseppe, Raisin, and Buster, among others, dance and sing "[[What I Like About You (song)|What I Like About You]]", which turns out to be the commercial. Marmaduke and Mazie date, Marmaduke and Jezebel are friends, and all is well. That night, Marmaduke farts in Phil and Debbie's bed as he winks at the camera.

In this process, he also meets Aparna ([[Saloni Aswani]]) who is the daughter of Ramineedu. However, much to Ramu's bad luck, he happens to be the son of the man who killed Ramineedu's brother and he ends up in their home itself.

Matariki (film)
 Just as the stars of the [[Pleiades]] constellation come together to mark the [[Matariki]] – the Māori New Year and a time of new beginnings – so too do the five intersecting stories of [[Michael Bennett (film director)|Michael Bennett]]’s first feature film merge into a fascinating portrait of a community.  It is New Year’s Eve and Gunge (Edwin Wright) finds that his debt to a ruthless drug dealer sets off a chain of events that rip through his South Auckland neighbourhood. After bravely intervening in a beating, star rugby player Tama (Mark Ruka) finds his own life in jeopardy. His wife, Megan ([[Sara Wiseman]]), comes into conflict with Tama’s [[Māori people|Māori]] family over decisions concerning his care. Tama’s brother Rick (Jarod Rawiri) is so rocked by the tragedy that he is forced to confront his own secrets and his allegiance to Maori values.  Meanwhile, teenaged Aleki (Jason Wu) struggles to find his identity in a new home. Transplanted from a small island in the South Pacific to the vibrant, multicultural community of South Auckland, Aleki feels caught between his father’s traditional values and the temptations of his new culture. Nearby, Lisa ([[Alix Bushnell]]), who is nine months pregnant and devoted to her drug addicted boyfriend (Michael Whalley), begins to suspect that he may not make the best father for her baby.  The problems and fears of this remarkably disparate group intertwine to form a compelling sphere of hope and transcendence. Renowned cinematographer [[Alun Bollinger]] (a favourite of director [[Peter Jackson]]) masterfully captures the gritty shadows of a crime in-progress, the harsh neon of a hospital room and the soft intimate lamplight of a lover’s bed. Building on the success of his notable short films "Cow" and "Kerosense Creek", Bennett focuses on the triumphs and crises of these unknowingly connected individuals to reveal the evolving mosaic of a culture and a city on the cusp of transformation.

Max Schmeling (film)
  A [[Fallschirmjäger (World War II)|German paratrooper]] is seen being injured and receiving treatment in [[Crete]] during the 1941 German [[Battle of Crete|invasion of the island]] during [[World War II]]. He is then detailed to escort a British prisoner of war who recognises him as the famous heavyweight boxer Max Schmeling and asks him to tell his story.  Schmeling's boxing matches in the 1930s are then portrayed along with his marriage to the Czech actress [[Anny Ondra]] ([[Susanne Wuest]]) who dislikes boxing, against a backdrop of the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] taking control in Germany. Schmeling has no sympathy for the Nazi ideology and is seen to be protective of his Jewish manager Joe Jacobs ([[Vladimir Weigl]]). In 1936, a [[Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling|fight]] in New York City with the formidable [[Joe Louis]] ([[Yoan Pablo Hernández]]) is arranged despite the opposition of the Nazi head of sport who fears he might lose, because [[Adolf Hitler]] wants it to go ahead. Schmeling trains hard and studies film of Louis in preparation for the fight which he wins following a knockout in the 12th round. He returns home a hero but when he takes on Louis again in 1938, he is knocked out after 124 seconds. He returns home and helps some victims of [[Kristallnacht]] and when war breaks out in 1939, he obeys an instruction to enlist in the paratroops rather than fleeing abroad.  The story returns to Crete where Schmeling allows the British prisoner to escape. Back in Germany in 1945, with the German Army on the brink of defeat, he returns to his wife. They abandon their country estate to the advancing Soviets and settle in Hamburg, [[West Germany]]. In 1947, Schmeling briefly returns to boxing after failing to find other work before retiring from the sport for good in 1948.

Megamind
 Ever since they arrived on Earth as infants, supervillain Megamind has fought superhero Metro Man for dominance of Metro City. In his latest plan, Megamind and his sidekick Minion kidnap reporter Roxanne Ritchi and hold her hostage in a copper-lined observatory. When Metro Man arrives to save her, he reveals he is weakened by copper, and Megamind obliterates him with a death ray. Megamind finally takes control of the city, but his celebration is short-lived as without Metro Man to challenge him, he finds his life has no meaning.  While wandering the recently-opened Metro Man Museum, Megamind sees Roxanne nearby, and uses his holographic disguise watch to take the form of Bernard, the museum's curator, whom he had "dehydrated" into a small cube. He talks to Roxanne and becomes attracted to her, and is inspired by one of her statements to create a new superhero for him to fight. Megamind returns to his lair and creates a serum containing Metro Man's DNA which he plans to inject into a proper candidate with his Defuser Gun. However, Roxanne's arrival at his lair with her dimwitted cameraman Hal Stewart causes Megamind to inadvertently inject Hal with the serum. Megamind disguises himself as Hal's "Space Dad" and convinces him to become the superhero "Titan". Titan spends several days training with his Space Dad before issuing a challenge to fight Megamind.  On the day before the fight, Megamind gets into an argument with Minion, and Titan tries and fails to woo Roxanne. Megamind, disguised as Bernard, takes Roxanne on a dinner date. Titan sees them, and as he had been infatuated with Roxanne, becomes upset and leaves. Shortly thereafter, Megamind's disguise fails, revealing his identity to Roxanne, who also storms off. The situation leaves him unable to find his invisible car, which is where he left the Defuser Gun he used to inject the serum into Hal.  Titan does not arrive at the scheduled fight, and Megamind finds that he has used his abilities for criminal purposes. As "Space Dad", Megamind tries to convince Titan to fight, but his disguise fails, and Titan realizes Megamind has used him and taken Roxanne from him. Titan engages in a super-powered fight with Megamind. Realizing Titan wants to ''kill'' him instead of arrest him, Megamind lures Titan into a copper-lined trap, but he is unaffected and continues to fight. Megamind escapes from the battle and seeks out Roxanne, hoping she can help. She offers to take him to Metro Man's secret headquarters, where they are both surprised to find Metro Man alive. Metro Man faked his death and weakness to copper, as he had become tired of being a superhero and wanted to retire to become a music star. He refuses to help, but offers Megamind the advice that a hero will always rise up to challenge evil.  Returning to the city, Megamind does not believe he can become the hero the city needs, and allows himself to be locked up in prison. Titan kidnaps Roxanne and demands Megamind show himself or he will kill her. Megamind has a change of heart and pleads with the prison warden, apologizing for his past actions. The warden reveals himself to be Minion in disguise, accepting Megamind's apology, and frees him so they can fight Hal.  As Hal is about to kill Roxanne, Megamind appears and frees her. The two escape, but Hal traps Megamind under rubble and threatens to kill him when Metro Man suddenly arrives, and Hal flees. Roxanne discovers that "Megamind" is really an injured Minion in disguise, while "Metro Man" is Megamind. Hal, in his flight, recognizes Megamind's distinctive mispronunciations, and realizes he was duped. Hal flies back and fights Megamind, during which Megamind finds his invisible car. He grabs the Defuser Gun and is able to extract the Metro Man serum from Titan, restoring him to normal. Now hailed as heroes, Megamind and Minion appear at the reopening of Metro Man's museum, now dedicated to Megamind instead, while Metro Man, in disguise within the crowd, silently congratulates his former rival.  In a [[mid-credits scene]] Minion is doing the laundry when a re-hydrated Bernard pops out of the washing machine.  
Mega Piranha
 The film focuses on the [[Orinoco River]] in [[Venezuela]], where a strain of [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] [[piranha]] have escaped into an isolated tributary of the river. Through human interference of the local environment, the megapiranha manage to escape from their isolated spot and swim downstream, killing all that crosses their path. The megapiranha gradually make their way towards [[Florida]]<ref>[http://www.theasylum.cc/product.php?id=169 "Mega Piranha"]. ''[[The Asylum]]''</ref> at the height of the tourist season.  After the outbreak, a team including Special Agent Fitch and Sarah Monroe, work to contain the megapiranhas within Venezuela. They begin to get into trouble with the authorities when they attempt to cross over the Venezuelan border. Not having proper clearance and documentation, Special Agent Fitch resorts to using the diplomacy of his fist and drives off. He is pursued by Colonel Antonio Diaz in a high-speed chase through the jungle. Throughout the chase, Fitch alternates driving a [[Toyota Camry]] and [[Hyundai Elantra]] while Diaz is seen at different points in a [[GMC Jimmy]], [[Chevrolet Suburban]], [[Suzuki XL7]], and [[Ford Explorer]]. Fitch escapes by stealing a helicopter and heads to the International Super Bunker (ISB). During the journey, the helicopter runs out of fuel and Sarah Monroe rigs the emergency oxygen tank to the fuel line to make it to the ISB safely.  The megapiranhas continue to move north, consuming two battleships and a nuclear submarine. They eventually reach south Florida, where they kill at least five Puerto Ricans on a beach and manage to blow up two hotels. Meanwhile, the only force that can stop them is located at the ISB. After the megapiranhas prove impervious to both torpedoes and depth charges—and even a nuclear torpedo fails to stop them—Special Agent Fitch and Professor Sarah Monroe conclude that the only way to stop the megapiranhas is to face them in their own terrain: underwater. An army of [[Scuba diving|SCUBA]] divers armed with guns would make the huge fish [[bleeding|bleed]], causing them to enter a feeding frenzy and kill each other. If this were to fail, then a massive nuclear strike would be used to destroy the megapiranha, as well as most of Florida.  In the middle of the operation, Colonel Diaz arrives in a helicopter, presumably using multiple fuel tanks to do this journey. The Colonel aims to get revenge on Agent Fitch and throws a rope into the water to trick him into climbing up into the enemy helicopter. Fitch, upon his arrival, shoots the pilot in the mouth with a flare gun, which causes the pilot's head to explode. Fitch then uses a homing beacon (which is actually a canister of CO<sub>2</sub>) to attract a megapiranha, jumping out of the helicopter shortly before it is consumed by the fishy behemoth.  Fitch is pursued by the megapiranha that ate the helicopter, eventually hiding in a reef where the megapiranha is unable to follow. When the piranha opens its mouth, Fitch shoots his gun at the helicopter still in the beast's jaws. The helicopter explodes, killing the fish. The other megapiranha converge on the bloodshed and Fitch is able to escape as the piranha enters a feeding frenzy and begin tearing each other to pieces, seemingly resulting in them wiping themselves out. Sarah and Fitch make out and all is well.

Meskada
  Two men, Shane Loakin ([[Jonathan Tucker]]) and Eddie Arlinger ([[Kellan Lutz]]), are desperate for money to support their families. While Shane stands guard, Eddie breaks into what the men believe to be an unoccupied home in the fictitious Midwestern town of Hilliard. Eddie panics when he finds a young boy home alone, and in the heat of the panic, strikes the boy as the boy goes towards the phone to call the police. The boy dies.  Noah Cordin (Stahl), a detective in Hilliard, is assigned to the case with a partner, Leslie Spencer (Nichols). Noah believes the crime had to have been committed by two people. He promises the murdered boy's mother, Allison Connor ([[Laura Benanti]]),<nowiki/> that he will find her son Toby's killers. Noah is married and has a son of his own, so he feels personally compelled to solve the crime.  During the investigation, Noah locates a piece of evidence that links the suspects to a nearby impoverished town, Caswell, which is also the home town to which he hasn't returned in several years. Hilliard and Caswell are both in Meskada County.  After Noah conducts a cattle-call–like interview of most of the men in Caswell, resulting in no viable leads, he returns to an annual town event as a cover for surreptitiously conducting further investigation.  One of the interviewees, Dennis Burrows ([[Norman Reedus]]), Shane's brother-in-law, knows nothing of Shane's involvement in the crime. Dennis lies to the police about his whereabouts at the time of the crime in order to cover up an extramarital affair that he's carrying on with the niece, Nat ([[Grace Gummer]]), of the owner of the local bar, Billy ([[James McCaffrey (actor)|James McCaffrey]]). The lie and his nervous behavior during the interview throw Dennis under Noah's suspicion. After the town celebration, Noah questions an intoxicated Shane trying to get him to inform on Dennis. Shane tries to assure Noah that he knows nothing about the crime, but Noah is not convinced.  Dennis is often out of work. He and Shane's sister Lyla ([[Rebecca Henderson]]) have a son Keith ([[Charlie Tahan]]) who needs an expensive ear operation, which is one of the reasons why Shane resorts to breaking into houses.  Caswell is applying to the Meskada County Commission to permit a [[pharmaceutical company]] to take over a factory that was closed five years before. If the request is approved, the new company will create hundreds of jobs for the impoverished town. But the young victim of the break-in, Toby Connor, is the son of a member of the Meskada County Commission, Allison Connor. Caswell residents fear that the police attention in their town will adversely affect the vote of the Commission, and it does. As a result, Noah is angrily treated as an enemy by the town for continuing to investigate the crime there. Noah is also receiving pressure in Hilliard. Allison, during a rowdy town hall meeting, publicly accuses him of trying to protect his hometown by stalling her son's murder investigation.  Meanwhile, Shane is becoming more and more fearful of being apprehended by the police. He confronts Eddie and tries to persuade him to leave town, but Eddie refuses, telling Shane that leaving now would call attention to them.  A break in the case finally comes when the police learn that Nat has been pawning some of the items stolen from the home where the murder occurred and that the items were given to her by Eddie. Noah and Leslie question Nat, and she unknowingly and inadvertently implicates Shane.  The police track down the man who helped Nat pawn the items, and after a foot chase, Leslie is beaten by two of the men they are chasing. Noah comes close to having to shoot one of the suspects who is carrying a gun in his waistband.   Shane and Eddie panic and try to leave town but are stopped and confronted by Dennis, Billy, and other men in the town who now know who committed the crime. Dennis, in a struggle with Shane, cuts Shane's throat with a broken beer bottle. The men tell Eddie to leave Caswell and never come back. Shane's dead body, ostensibly offered up as a sacrifice to the Maskada County Commission, is found the next morning on the steps of the county building. In Shane's clutched hand are petitions covered with signatures from Caswell residents lobbying for the pharmaceutical company's permit to be approved.  Although sheriffs believe that the person responsible for the crime is dead, Noah believes that his accomplice, the actual killer, is still at large. He and Leslie go to the town bar and trash it while demanding the identity of Shane's accomplice. The bar owner, Billy, and his patrons, even under duress, reveal nothing. Noah is furious at their willingness to protect a murderer, and he and Leslie leave the bar disgusted.  In the closing shot Noah stops to see Allison, who is packing a moving van. Even though Noah knows that the killer is still at large, in an act of compassion, he tells a questioning Allison that the dead man was the murderer, and that there was no other accomplice. Allison, who previously had turned on Noah and questioned his abilities, now thanks him and tells him to go home to his family.

Mirch

His girlfriend Ruchi ([[Shahana Goswami]]), a successful film editor, arranges for him to meet film producer Nitin ([[Sushant Singh]]). Nitin likes the script but is not very sure of its box office potential. Maanav then suggests a story from the Panchtantra: A woman is caught red-handed with her lover by her husband and yet, she manages to wriggle out of it Scot-free! Nitin loves the story but finds it too short for a feature film. Maanav then creates three more stories based on the same premise: in a way, the Panchantra story travels in different versions to the modern times through the film. The four stories are woven together by a common story. Mirch itself echoes this structure, with four stories mingling with the main narrative.  '''1st Story.'''  Kashi(Rajpal Yadav) is a craftsman in India in ancient time. He has a beautiful wife Maya (Raima Sen) who loves him with passion. He receives an invitation from the king to work in the palace. He tells Maya that it is a great opportunity because if the king likes his work, they can become rich. She is upset because she does not want to be alone, but Kashi convinces her. In the afternoon Kashi's friend teases him that his wife is too pretty for him to handle and she will definitely call in another man the moment Kashi leaves for the city. Kashi furiously dismisses it but gets suspicious. He hides near in his house to observe his wife. His friend comes home asking for Kashi. Maya says husband is not at home. The friend then asks for water, which Maya passes to him(without opening the door), he tries to make advances towards her but she throws water on his face and he runs away. Kashi is happy that is wife is extremely faithful to him. He sneaks under the bed to surprise her. Maya then enters the room with a hunky prince(Arunoday Singh). She suddenly realizes that her husband is hiding under the bed. She then fabricates a story of how she was told by the astrologer that her husband has bad luck on him and he shall die within a few days. To avoid this she must consummate with another man so that the bad luck is diverted towards the second man. The prince plays along saying that being a kshatriya he is born to protect others and he is "obligated to do his duty". Kashi now in dilemma, whether to stop them and bear the "bad luck" or helplessly have his wife make love to another man right on the bed he that he is hiding under.  '''2nd story'''  This story is set in medieval times in Rajput Kingdom. Raja Nirgun Singh(Prem Chopra), at the ripe old age of 70, has a young wife Lavni(Konkana Sen). Lavni is not satisfied with this marriage and discusses this with her maid Kesara(Ila Arun). Kesara tells her that it is not uncommon for queens to ask for "services" from young and reliable subjects. Lavni tells her that she likes Chandresh(Arunoday Singh), who is one of the King's subjects and is a close friend of the King. Kesara passes on the message to Chandresh, who refuses it saying he cannot do this because this would be cheating on the king (he cannot tell the king about the queen's advances either as this would mean a death sentence). Kesara tells him that he shall be rewarded very generously by the Queen. On hearing this, Chandresh says that he is agreeable but he has a few conditions and shall reveal them one by one. All these conditions require completion of seemingly impossible tasks which he puts forward just to deter the Queen. But Lavni completes these tasks(from plucking the tooth of the king to getting rid of the king's pet cat). He sees the Queen's desperation and places one last task, that whatever "happens" must happen in front of the King. The Queen says yes to this one as well. One night the king and queen are sitting in the garden. Chandresh walks in and the queen asks him to fetch fruit from the tree in the garden. Chandresh climbs the tree and comes down asking for apology. The king asks him for what he saw, Chandresh replied that he saw the king and queen in sexual embrace. The queen rejects that claim angrily, saying that this is something that has never ever happened, leave alone now (humiliating the king in the process). Chandresh says that, even then, his vision *can* still happen, if the tree is possessed by a spirit. Lavni dismisses that as a fairy tale, and instigates the king to verify this for himself. The old King, now with mixed feelings of embarrassment and anger, climbs the tree. Being old and frail, he climbs up with some difficulty and then gets stuck on top of the tree and can not easily come down. Meanwhile, Chandresh and Lavni down below get into a sexual embrace. The king sees them in the act from up on the tree but is stll unable to climb down the tree. When the king does eventually manage to come down, he sees the queen and Chandresh are fully dressed and sitting normally as if nothing had happened. The king is convinced that the sexual embrace he saw was just an unreal vision and orders the tree to be cut down, declaring it possessed.  '''3rd Story'''  Manjul(Shreyas Talpade) and Manjula(Raima Sen) are a seemingly perfect couple living in modern-day Mumbai. Manjul is a prankster by nature who likes to take challenges.

Mirrors 2
 College student Max Matheson ([[Nick Stahl]]) is involved in a car accident, that kills his [[fiancée]], Kayla ([[Jennifer Sipes]]). Due to the accident, he becomes emotionally disturbed and undergoes psychological treatment with Dr. Beaumont (Ann Mckenzie), making some progress in dealing with the guilt over the accident. To help Max move forward and also needs immediate help, his father, Jack Matheson ([[William Katt]]), reopens the Mayflower Department Store in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] and invites Max to replace the security guard, who recently quit under mysterious circumstances while apparently "[[Self-harm|cutting himself up]]" on duty.  Max accepts the job and his father introduces him to the store manager, Keller Landreaux (Lawrence Turner), the buyer, Jenna McCarty ([[Christy Carlson Romano]]), and the vice-president of operations, Ryan Parker (Jon Michael Davis). Before his first shift, Max sees a vision of a dead woman in a mirror, and then sees Jenna's reflection, ripping off her head. Meanwhile, Jenna is killed by her reflection, being thrown through glass doors and a shard of glass decapitating her. Max realizes that he foresees the deaths in the mirrors. That night, he tries to find the ghost, but instead sees Ryan's reflection being [[Disembowelment|eviscerated]]. He tries to contact Ryan, but gets no response. Later, Ryan is killed, in the same way as his reflection.  Max sees his father's face covered in cuts in a puddle then races to his father's house. Jack is almost killed by his reflection, after Max made it to his house and hints to whoever is manipulating the mirrors that he would do whatever she wants him to do if she spares his father. Max later returns to the Mayflower, but he is stopped by Detectives Huston and Piccirilli (Lance E. Nichols, Wayne Pére), explaining what happened in Ryan and Jenna's deaths. Max denies any involvement and, though they remain suspicious, they let Max get back to his work.  Max goes to the main mirror, to find out who the ghost is. Suddenly, Max's reflection shows a light, which Max follows in each of the mirrors. He finds a box and opens it to find an ID of a woman named Eleanor Reigns ([[Stephanie Honoré|Stephanie Honoré Sanchez]]), a new employee of the Mayflower who disappeared two months ago. The light shines outside and Max finds a missing person flier for Eleanor. Max reads it as he contacts Eleanor's older sister Elizabeth ([[Emmanuelle Vaugier]]) to learn details of her disappearance. Together, they discover that someone had deleted the surveillance files on the night of Eleanor's disappearance in the store's computer.  Max and Elizabeth visit Henry Schow (Evan Jones), the store's former security guard and the last person who accessed the files. Henry's mouth had been scarred by his reflection. Through Henry, they learn that Eleanor is dead and her spirit is seeking revenge on whoever was involved in her murder.  Two months prior, during the Mayflower's grand opening party, Jenna and Ryan spiked Eleanor's drink with drugs. Keller raped Eleanor while she was intoxicated and was directly responsible for her death. Henry found Keller burying Eleanor's body in the Mayflower's basement crawlspace and is ordered to delete the surveillance files to cover up the crime.  After her death, Eleanor, whose soul is trapped in the mirror world, began stalking them. She began to mutilate Henry by manipulating his reflection to eat shards of glass after he erased the files, and eventually killed Jenna and Ryan, before moving on to Keller. When Eleanor realized that Max could see her, she forced him to help her make contact with her sister by threatening his father's life. Max realizes that his [[near-death experience]] from the car accident has given him an ability to see the [[Afterlife|other side]].  Max and Elizabeth go to the Mayflower and search for Eleanor's body in the basement. They are chased by Keller, after he realizes that they know what happened. He nearly strangles Elizabeth, but Max saves her, thus recreating the near-death encounter Max had experienced and allowing Elizabeth to see Eleanor. After seeing Eleanor again, Max wrestles Keller, pushing him into the main mirror. Eleanor kills Keller, saving Max and Elizabeth, but leaving them in shock.  At the police station, Henry confesses to the detectives of his unintentional involvement in Eleanor's murder. The police interrogation room's [[one-way mirror]] starts to crack after Henry is alone, and he sees Eleanor again on its reflection. Henry's scream is heard after the screen cuts to black.

She is horrified to find out that he is engaged and tries to ward off his advances. Milo chases her up a portable ladder. When Sarah shoves him away, Milo falls backwards and is impaled on an umbrella.  Sarah does not report his death and is promoted to Milo's position. Another executive at Judge, Nan Wilder ([[Vivica A. Fox]]) confronts Sarah about Milo's death. Milo had texted Nan a picture of Sarah at his apartment. Knowing that Nan could report her to the police, Sarah decides to push her in front of an oncoming subway train. She soon receives a faxed picture showing her standing behind Nan on the subway platform. Believing that fax came from Pierre JeJeune ([[Patrick Fischler]]), Sarah electrocutes him by activating the office's sprinkler system while Pierre is Xeroxing his butt in a kinky sex game.  Promoted into Pierre's position, Judge sends in a consultant, Morty Wickham ([[David Anthony Higgins]]), to help Sarah get a handle on her new job. Morty was Pierre's protege, and when he embarrasses Sarah at a corporate event, she decides to kill him. She severs the gas line to Morty's oven, and when he tries to light a bong, his house explodes. The string of deaths at Judge are being investigated by Detective Sergeant Bill Malloy ([[Adam Goldberg]]) who is also boarding at Sarah and Claire's house. Sarah and Malloy have begun dating, but she worries that he might be closing in on her.  She decides that she needs a fall guy and settles for Joshua Nether ([[Eddie Jemison]]). She seduces Joshua and gains access to his personal information, which she uses to set up dummy accounts. Sarah embezzles money from Judge through the dummy accounts, setting everything up to look like Joshua is to blame. Malloy happens to see Sarah and Joshua leaving a restaurant after one of their dates and is heartbroken. When Malloy confronts Sarah about her betrayal, she thinks he is referring to the murders she has committed. She realizes he is referring to Joshua, and they reconcile.  After she poisons Joshua, Sarah is blackmailed by someone who claims that she knows about the embezzled money. Sarah quickly plots out who could be extorting her and various ways to kill them. She even poisons one co-worker's bottled water, just in case. It turns out that Charmaine is blackmailing Sarah. She was jealous of Sarah's promotion, and she was secretly behind most of the events that led Sarah to commit the series of murders. During their confrontation, Charmaine ends up chasing Sarah to the top of a bell tower, where Sarah causes Charmaine to fall to her death.  Thinking her troubles are behind her, Sarah gets engaged to Malloy. At work, she asks her assistant for a glass of water while she writes him a letter of recommendation. As she sips the water, her assistant explains that he had to get the water from her co-worker's office. Realizing that it is the water that Sarah had poisoned, she concludes that she got what she deserved.

Monga (film)
 Monga (now known as [[Wanhua District]]) is one of [[Taipei]]'s districts. Mosquito ([[Mark Chao]]) and his friends have no illusions about the unwritten laws that prevail in this part of town: if you want to survive here, you’ve got to have the friends that make you stronger than your enemies.  Mosquito ([[Mark Chao]]), Monk ([[Ethan Juan]]), Dragon ([[Rhydian Vaughan]]), Monkey ([[Emerson Tsai]]) and A-po (Huang Denghui) are all members of the "Gang of Princes". Mosquito is invited to join the gang after standing up to- and holding his own against- a rival gang member who stole his chicken drumstick his first day at school in Monga. Mosquito soon begins to enjoy with his brother gangsters the lifestyle and gin leadership over "Gang of Princes," the influence of which dominates the streets of Monga. They are unaware that there are other rivals who are deeply jealous of their success, and the five's responses to antagonism that follows reflect the their commitment to the code of brotherhood, but lack judgement, maturity, and the ever important calculation required to balance power in gang leadership.  Geta (Ma Ju-lung), one of Monga’s old triad leaders (as well as Dragon's father), sees it as his duty to teach these cheeky young upstarts the true laws of gangsterdom. To accomplish this, while punishing them for their previous actions, Geta orders the seclusion of the five, as they undergo intense training according to the tradition and legacy handed down by the city’s founders.  The strict laws of a brotherhood, in which they should fight not just for territorial reasons, but also to protect their honor, impress most deeply on Mosquito.  But even Geta has no inkling of the storm that is about to hit Monga – a storm that will destroy the town’s traditional values and the vestiges of its glory. A new gang, bristling with an arsenal of handguns, is about to change forever the little world in which Geta and the "Gang of Princes" have made themselves at home, as cracks of a former betrayal come to light, widen, and result in conflicting loyalties that confuse the ties between gangsterdom and sworn brotherhood.<ref>[http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2010/02_programm_2010/02_Filmdatenblatt_2010_20106058.php Film File: Monga] at Berlin International Film Festival website.</ref>

Moby Dick (2010 film)
 On November 20, 1969, 50 miles off Soviet waters, the USS ''Acushnet'' dives under the ice. A young Ahab listens to [[sonar]] for enemy submarines when suddenly he detects an unknown target. When the captain listens, he hears nothing, but Ahab insists in the presence of an emptiness. The target dives into a [[trench]], but the captain abandons his search in favor of photographing the target. The target attacks the submarine as Ahab hears a roar. The sub is brought to the icy surface, and the target identifies itself as a gigantic, white, whale-like creature. Ahab survives, but loses his left leg to the beast when it hauls the other half of the sub back underwater.  In the present day, Dr. Michelle Herman (O'Connor) and her assistant Pip (Derrick Scott) test a whale song generator when the USS ''[[Pequod (Moby-Dick)|Pequod]]'' surfaces behind them and [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[List of Moby-Dick characters#Crewmates|Starbuck]] (Grimes), the [[executive officer]], persuades them to come aboard. In the sub, Starbuck tells them about several attacks in which eyewitnesses all report seeing an enormous whale. Although Michelle explains that the whale song generator needs a recorded whale vocalization, Captain Ahab (Bostwick) comes to the deck and gives her the recording he took of Moby Dick back in 1969. Although Michelle disagrees on joining a Navy sub with the intent of killing an animal, she has no choice.  In San Diego, Captain Boomer (another survivor of the attack of '69) is told by his superiors of suspicious activity revolving around the ''Pequod''. He is assigned to investigate, and thanks to a survivor from a recent attack by the White Whale, he comes to the conclusion that Ahab is on the hunt for Moby Dick.  Meanwhile, the USS ''[[Essex (1799 whaleship)|Essex]]'' is searching for the ''Pequod'' off Hawaii. When they go to active sonar, it attracts the attention of the wandering Moby Dick. The ''Essex'' engages what appears to be the sub they were searching for, but realizes too late that their adversary is biological just before the sub is destroyed by a torpedo it shot. Later the ''Pequod'' comes to their location with no sign of the whale, but encounter the corpses of ''Essex'' crew. Rousing his crew with a speech, Ahab moves on to search for the beast.  A helicopter in search of the ''Pequod'' encounters it while the sub is following a 600-foot target. As the helicopter engages them, the sub fires a [[Nuclear weapon|nuke]] at the unknown target, but the confused helicopter crew tell them they shot a school of giant squid just before they are swallowed alive by Moby Dick.  The whale then attacks the S.S. ''Rachel'', a cruise liner, when the ''Pequod'' intervenes with Michelle's whale-song generator. This, however, causes the whale to attack them, subsequently destroying a fin on the ''Pequod''. The sub fires a harpoon made from the ''Acushnet'''s hull on top of Moby Dick's eye, which forces him to dive deeper, dragging the ''Pequod'' with it. As the water pressure begins to damage the hull, the line snaps and Starbuck forces the ship to surface.  Moby-Dick surfaces too, and the ''Pequod'', along with the help of Boomer in a helicopter, forces the whale into an atoll. The sub gets trapped in shallow water, and three boats are sent out to face the whale with guns and Ahab's harpoon. Moby-Dick destroys two of the boats and forces the survivors onto the island's shores. The whale attacks them again, resulting in the death of Queequeg (Michael Teh). Ahab takes the last boat and fires his harpoon at the whale's other eye. Moby Dick destroys the boat, killing Ahab. The remaining crew of the ''Pequod'', including Starbuck, and Pip, follow Ahab's orders and fire nukes at the island. Moby Dick dodges the nukes and crushes the ''Pequod'' just as the island explodes. The White Whale survives to wreak havoc another day; Michelle swims to the surface just as a rescue helicopter arrives.  
Mobile Suit Gundam 00 the Movie: A Wakening of the Trailblazer
  Two years after the second season, an unknown alien fragment landed on a research station and reactivates it, causing it to head towards Earth. In Celestial Being's Asteroid Base, Ian Vashti greets his wife, Linda, after her 2-year assignment and unloads two new GN Drives and a new incomplete Gundam, the GNT-0000 00 Qan[T].  In the 2 years that has passed since the defeat of the "[[Innovators (Mobile Suit Gundam 00)|Innovators]]" and A-Laws, [[Saji Crossroad]] arrived at an Earth Federation Hospital to be with [[Louise Halevy]], who is still under medical care due to physical changes by the Innovators. [[Marina Ismail]] and [[Shirin Bakhtiar]] inspect a colony construction facility but their shuttle was attacked by an assassin, piloting a GNX-609T GN-XIII. However [[Setsuna F. Seiei]] arrives in a customized Colony Flag and destroys them, with Lockon in the cockpit stopping the assassin from killing Marina and left with Setsuna.  Meanwhile, the Earth Sphere Federation has found the research station heading towards earth and sends out GN-XIV's, led by [[Andrei Smirnov (Gundam 00)|Andrei Smirnov]], to destroy it. [[Kati Mannequin]] arrived on board the Celestial Being station with [[Patrick Colasour]] and encounter Veda along with its surviving Innovades, now serving the Federation to maintain the mothership. They later meet the newest emerging Innovator, Captain Descartes Shaman. When the probe ship is still heading towards Earth despite being hit by GN missiles, Descartes heads out and pilots the GNMA-Y0002V Gadelaza, successfully destroying the ship, with debris falling to Earth. Soon after, Earth experiences strange events, with electronic vehicles and devices operating on their own. Later Amia Lee arrives at her home, only to be attacked by a man (Sky Eclipse) in a space suit.  [[Billy Katagiri]] meets with Mehna Carmine to analyze Amia whose body has been partially assimilated with a new metal. They hypothesize that the events occurring are related to the alien metal lifeform, now dubbed the Extraterrestrial Living-metal Shape-shifters (ELS). During this time, Setsuna and Louise's quantum brainwaves give them ominous feelings about upcoming events. Setsuna's concern magnifies when the Ptolemaios crew is unable to contact Allelujah and Marie.  In the Earth Federation Hospital, Saji witnesses a blackout in the building with Louise. They scream as a man in a spacesuit appears before them. He is about to touch Louise when Setsuna appears and shoots the man's visor, revealing him to be the same type of Innovator as [[Ribbons Almark]]. Setsuna throws a plastique on him, killing him. In Mongolia, a traveling [[Allelujah Haptism]] and [[Soma Peries|Marie Parfacy]] are attacked and chased by living technology infected by the ELS. [[Lockon Stratos]] arrives in the GN-002RE Gundam Dynames Repair and helps destroy them.  The same Jupiter research station that had been destroyed reappears and Celestial Being attacks. Setsuna heads out in the 00 Raiser Condenser Type, along with Lockon in his new Gundam, the Zabanya, and Allelujah, paired with Marie in the Gundam Harute, confront the ELS. Problems began to arise when Setsuna is unable to fight the ELS due to quantum brainwave interference. The 00 Raiser begins to undergo assimilation, however [[Tieria Erde]] arrives in the Raphael Gundam and rips out 00 Raiser's infected left arm, allowing Setsuna and the team to escape. Unknown to both the Federation and Ptolemaios crew, the ELS had begun launching its forces from Jupiter's Big Red Spot, sucking in Io and Ganymede.  The Federation forces later travel to Mars in order to discover the ELS's intentions, with Descartes heading out first in the Gadelaza. However most of its ships and Mobile suits were assimilated, and Descartes ends up being assimilated as well, killing him in the process. Celestial Being arrives too late to save the Federation soldiers and engages in battle against the ELS. Setsuna executes Trans-Am Burst in an attempt to communicate with the ELS, theorizing that this is the "dialogues to come" that [[Aeolia Schenberg]] was conditioning humanity for. Unfortunately, Setsuna falls victim to a mental attack from the ELS and is rendered comatose in the middle of battle. Tieria reveals Raphael Gundam's backpack, GN-008RE Seravee Gundam II, and rips 00 Raiser's cockpit from the frame, handing it to Lockon as Tieria tries to hold off the ELS with his quantum brainwaves. With the ELS surrounding him, Tieria self-destructs his Gundam to take out ELS with him. The Sol Brave Squadron, led by [[Graham Aker]], arrive and help Celestial Being escape. Tieria's conscious mind returns to Veda and Feldt Grace desperately awaits at Setsuna's side to awaken. After the battle, the Ptolemaios crew and the Earth Sphere Federation witness the appearance of a large moon-size ELS, determining that it will arrive at Earth in 92 days.  With most of the civilians being informed of the situation and heading towards shelters, Saji tells Louise that he's going to the Orbital Elevator to help fight the ELS as the last line of defense. On the day of the ELS's arrival, the Federation launch a counterattack against the ELS using the Celestial Being ship's main cannon. Kati, in charge of the operation, orders to fire its main cannon, which damages the ELS superstructure. During this time, Tieria requests that Ian Vashti install a miniature Veda terminal in the cockpit of 00 Qan[T] to handle the massive amounts of information that would result from linking with the ELS again.   During the battle, many of the Federation's Baikal-class ships were assimilated by the ELS, who subsequently created their own copies of the technology. Zabanya and Harute arrive to assist the ESF in battle. Despite the much needed backup, the ELS still overwhelms the ESF forces and assimilates many ships and Mobile Suits. Andrei Smirnov notices one of the ELS ships heading straight for Earth and uses Trans-Am in its overloading state, self-destructing his GNX and destroying the ELS ship at the cost of his life. Meanwhile, on board the Ptolemaios 2, a still-comatose Setsuna lies in a dream-like state. There, he has visions of the first Lockon, Christina Sierra, and Lichtendahl Tsery. Setsuna then sees the flower that Feldt gave him. He finally wakes up with Feldt at his side. He sorties in the GNT-0000 00 Qan[T] for battle, while Feldt returns to the bridge.  In battle, Patrick's GN-XIV is hit by an ELS and is slowly assimilated. He prepares to self-destruct before saying goodbyes to Kati, when Setsuna blasts Patrick's GNX, saving him from assimilation. With a large number of ELS appearing, the Harute is eventually assimilated and Allelujah and Marie are forced to eject. Setsuna attempts to communicate with the ELS via the Twin Drive’s quantum effect, but it is to no avail as the ELS constantly thwart Setsuna's attempts. Tieria, now a small hologram inside of the 00 Qan[T], tells Setsuna that Trans-Am is necessary for the dialogues. Graham Aker, now partially assimilated, decides to believe in a better future for humanity and sacrifices himself to create a large hole using Trans-Am, allowing Setsuna to enter the core of the ELS ship. After Setsuna establishes contact, he realizes the attack was a misunderstanding as assimilation was their only means to understand humanity. It also revealed that the ELS's original homeworld had been consumed by a red giant star and they began searching the universe for a new home. Along the way they reformed various planets and eventually found a new home, eventually setting out into the vast reaches of space to explore the universe. Through Setsuna's quantum brainwaves, the true intention of the ELS's arrival to Earth was understood, and the battle was halted. Setsuna becomes humanity's liaison and uses the 00 Qan[T] to quantize to the ELS homeworld. The ELS then uses Setsuna's vision of a flower to alter the superstructure of their mother ship, ending the battle.  In a flashback, a much younger Aeolia Schenberg is shown speaking with E. A. Ray (the human base for Ribbons Almark) of his plan, and comments that humanity must unite if they hope to have any chance of reaching the future. Fifty years later, the flower in space is now a deep space station for intergalactic travel, with the ELS now co-existing with humanity. A ship named after Sumeragi is being prepared for travel, being crewed by Innovators. As a news correspondent is talking on camera, a Tieria type Innovade can be seen floating by. In an undisclosed countryside, a blind and older Marina is playing the piano and senses someone entering. He reveals himself as Setsuna, now an ELS/Innovator hybrid, fulfilling his promise to see her again. Setsuna tells a crying Marina that he finally understands her message of peace, and they share an emotional embrace. Outside, an ELS winged 00 Qan[T] covered in flowers emits GN Particles in an angelic fashion.  
Moner Manush
 [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s elder brother [[Jyotirindranath Tagore]], a Western educated bright young man from the 19th century Bengal met the octogenarian Lalan Fakir and drew a portrait of the poet saint in the former houseboat afloat on the [[Padma river]]. Jyotirindranath, an urban intellectual, exchanges views with the man of native wisdom. Their exchange of ideas forms the cinematic narrative of this film. The narrative is a saga of the life and time of Lalan Fakir and his liberal sect who lived a life of high order in an otherwise superstitious 19th century Indian society. Lalan inherited the best of the liberal and enlightened tradition of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam to develop a philosophy of life which is extremely secular and tolerant. Thus became an easy prey for the fundamentalists from the Hindu and the Muslim institutions. They were the parallel stream flowing freely in the heart of rural Bengal when men like Tagore were germinating ideas of the Bengal Renaissance. The love and compassion of Lalan is relevant more than ever in today’s world of intolerance and hate.  
Modalasala
 The film is about two youngsters, both of whom are quite the ideal children. Imagine a girl who makes a guy wait hoping to get her parents to approve his proposal; or a guy who says, "I’ve met the girl's parents, I see them in her eyes". These are the things most typical families dream of, as they plan their kids’ futures.  The film has its funny moments and occasionally an overdose of sentimental scenes. The director has done a fairly decent job with the narrative and Yash impresses in his role as the lovelorn urban lad. His dancing skills deserve special mention — he’s easily one of the best in Sandalwood.  New girl Bhama makes a decent debut, though Deepu, who has dubbed for her, deserves equal applause. Rangayana Raghu and Tara excel, and the film shows Raghu in a different light, as opposed to his over-the-top comical roles.  
Mongolian Death Worm (film)
 An American corporation sets up operations in [[Mongolia]] to search for shale oil by pumping superheated water into the earth. The project encounters mysterious mechanical failures and delays while at the same time, the on-site manager, Patrick, is worried that the equipment failures and delays will attract too much attention from corporate bosses. The drilling operations have disturbed a nest of [[Mongolian death worm]]s that are known in the legends of the indigenous people—monstrously long and lethal creatures that tunnel underground, similar to the [[graboid]] creatures seen in ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]'', though slimier looking, with an enormous maw of teeth, poisonous venom, and the ability to generate an electromagnetic field that interferes with communications and other equipment. One of the oil field workers is attacked and killed. Other workers, frightened by the rumors, don't show up for work. With the drilling operation (and his side deal) threatened, Patrick starts to panic when Mr. Bixler, a corporate boss, shows up to find out what's going on.  At the same time, a group of volunteer medical workers, Doctors of Hope, is trying to stop an outbreak of disease in a Mongolian village also caused by the worms contaminating the water sources. The lead doctor, Alicia, encounters Daniel when she and a colleague, Phillip, need transportation for themselves and their medical supplies to the village where the rest of her team is working. Daniel is a target of the chief crime boss in the area, Kowlan, because of Daniel's treasure-hunting forays into their territory. We eventually learn that Daniel already knows about the legend of the worms and has found artifacts with engraved images of the creatures. He believes his finds will lead him to a treasure—Genghis Khan's tomb.  While transporting the two doctors to the village of Sepegal, Daniel's truck breaks down and they are taken captive by Kowlan's men. A friend of Daniel's, local police officer, Timur finds Daniel's abandoned vehicle by the road and starts searching for him. Back at Kowlan's camp, Daniel creates a distraction so that the two doctors can escape. During a gun battle, worms emerge from the ground and eat Kowlan and his men. Daniel fires into a fuel tank and blows up one of the worms. Alicia and Phillip return to get the medical supplies from Daniel's truck and continue on to Sepegal, where the epidemic is raging. There, another doctor, Steffi, tells Alicia that sick elderly people have been insisting that the epidemic is caused by the "death worms." Alicia and Phillip haven't actually seen any worms, but they heard Kowlan and Daniel talking about them.  At the plant, Patrick, desperate to still make his black market deal, reveals his duplicity when he pulls a gun on Bixler, who is on the phone to the corporation. Patrick ties him up in the office. Shortly thereafter, another corporate manager shows up and, while looking through the plant for Bixler, is promptly eaten. Patrick, still unaware of the worm threat, takes Bixler down to the lower level, where he binds him to a support column and gags him. Daniel reaches his truck and then goes to Sepegal to warn Alicia about the worms; he insists they need to move the temporary clinic and its patients somewhere else. One of the local people, a nurse, says they could find a phone and help at the oil drilling facility not far away. When they arrive at the plant, Daniel and Alicia are confronted by one of Patrick's people, Bana, who only participated in the theft scheme to help his people; he lets Daniel and Alicia inside when a worm appears behind them, ready to kill. Alicia theorizes that the worms are a type of organism that has been released from stasis because of the pumping of hot water deep into the earth. If the pumping stops, no new worms should be "hatched." In Sepegal, Phillip and the nurse, Thuan, are drawing water from the well when Thuan is sucked in by a worm and killed. Phillip and Steffi run back to the clinic as the worms begin to surround it.  At the plant, Daniel and Bana shut down the pumps, then Bana panics and runs away, leaving Daniel behind. As Bana emerges from the plant, Patrick and the other accomplice return from taking a crate of stolen loot to another hiding place. Bana yells at them to leave, that it's too late to go back inside, but as he runs to the truck, Patrick shoots him in the back. He then discovers Alicia in the plant office; she is on the phone to Officer Timur, explaining that Sepegal needs help. Timur rushes to Sepegal and kills several worms. He tells the staff that more help is on the way, then he waits in the clinic with the staff and patients.  Daniel goes down to the lower levels of the plant, where he finds what he has been seeking, Genghis Khan's treasure. Patrick shows up, gun drawn, while his associate has Alicia at knife point. Daniel has to put his gun down. He distracts Patrick by pointing out Bixler's remains and they get into a wrestling match. Daniel shoots Patrick in the shoulder. The ground shakes and worms begin to emerge from the walls. Patrick's henchman is eaten, and Daniel realizes that this is the queen worm's nest and that the entire place must be destroyed. Timur arrives at the plant to find Daniel and Alicia and discovers Bana's body outside. Daniel discovers the room full of crates holding the treasure from the tomb. He breaks open a crate and artifacts and gold pour out onto the floor. Alicia reminds him that it isn't worth dying for, and he agrees that they must destroy the plant completely. Patrick limps into view, bleeding badly. Timur appears with shotgun in hand. Behind him the queen creeps up and eats Patrick. Daniel and Alicia attempt to make the pressure build up in the generators and pipes. Just as they are about to escape from the building, more worms show up. Timur shoots them, but is eaten by the queen. Daniel and Alicia rush outside as the explosions go off. Daniel returns Alicia to Sepegal and her colleagues. He says he is going back to collect the treasure from the field around the plant, and drives away.  
Molasses (film)
 Masry is an Egyptian who left his country when only 10 years old. He returns to Egypt 20 years later following the death of his father. Masry desires to get back in touch with his roots and to revive his nostalgic memories of how Egypt used to be. However, he quickly becomes disenchanted upon experiencing first hand the chaos that Egypt has descended into. He learns the hard way that Egyptians citizens have very few rights and that they live a very tough life where foreigners are often treated with more respect than Egyptians themselves. Despite the fact that this production discusses very serious issues, the film is nonetheless a mix of comedy and light drama and serves as a poignant reminder of our current times.<ref>http://www.elcinema.com/en/work/wk1313173/</ref>

Moomins and the Comet Chase
 One day [[Moomintroll]] wakes to notice that grey dust is covering everything in the [[Moominvalley]]. He runs to ask the philosophical [[Characters in the Moomin series#Other characters|Muskrat]] if he knows what is happening, who advises him that things tend to look like this before an awful fate coming from the sky hits the Earth. With the help of his father, [[Moominpappa]], Moomintroll and his close friends [[Sniff (Moomin character)|Sniff]] and [[Snufkin]] build a raft and head out on a challenging journey to the observatory in the Lonely Mountains hoping to find out more from the wise professors there. The friends have to overcome several adversities in order to make it there. When they arrive, they find the professors deep in calculations. They reveal that a comet will reach the Earth in four days, four hours, four minutes and 44 seconds.  The group decides to get back home as fast as they can to share the news. On the journey home, they encounter more dangerous creatures and obstacles as well as some old and new friends, including [[Snork Maiden]] and her brother [[Characters in the Moomin series#Close friends|Snork]], who join them on their adventure. The sky continues to become redder and the air hotter. When they get to the seashore, they are shocked to see that the sea has completely dried up.

Monsters (2010 film)
 After a [[NASA]] deep-space probe (sent to verify the existence of extraterrestrial life in the solar system) crash lands in [[Mexico]], [[Extraterrestrial life in fiction|extraterrestrial]] life forms spread throughout the [[Mexico–United States border]] region, leading to the quarantine of the northern half of Mexico. US and Mexican troops battle to contain the creatures, and a huge wall stretching along the border ostensibly keeps the US protected.  American [[photojournalist]] Andrew Kaulder ([[Scoot McNairy]]) receives a call from his employer, who tasks Andrew with finding his daughter, Samantha Wynden ([[Whitney Able]]), and escorting her back to the US. Andrew locates Samantha in a Mexican hospital and the pair board a train, until learning the tracks ahead have been damaged. They discover that if they do not leave the country within a few days, sea and air travel will be blocked for six months. Andrew and Samantha decide to [[Hitchhiking|hitchhike]] their way to the coast.  Andrew buys Samantha an expensive ferry ticket for the next morning. After enjoying the local nightlife together, Andrew sleeps with a local woman who steals their passports. Unable to board the ferry, Samantha is forced to [[barter]] her engagement ring for passage through the quarantine zone.  They travel by riverboat until being transferred to a group of armed escorts who are to lead them overland to the Mexico–US border. The convoy is attacked by the creatures. Andrew and Samantha escape, but none of the guards survive. Continuing on, they discover the bodies of dead travellers and bond at the top of an ancient pyramid in sight of the US border wall. By the time they reach the border, the creatures have crossed into the United States. Andrew and Samantha travel through a severely damaged, evacuated town in [[Texas]], find an abandoned gas station with power and call the army for help.  While waiting for help to arrive, they make phone calls to their respective families. A lone creature silently approaches the station. Hiding, Samantha observes several tentacles exploring the inside of the store, seemingly soaking up a television's light. Samantha quickly unplugs the television and the creature loses interest. Another creature appears, and they communicate with one another and possibly mate via light impulses. The creatures leave as the military arrives. Samantha and Andrew kiss before they are rushed into different vehicles. The chronological ending takes place at the beginning of the film, filmed in green night vision sight, when the military rescue team is attacked by a single creature.  
Morgan M. Morgansen's Date with Destiny
 The [[silent film]], except for narration throughout by Gordon-Levitt, follows the first date between Morgan M. Morgansen (Gordon-Levitt) and a young woman named Destiny (Hulme). Backed up by a sour-turned-sentimental waiter - or the "foodpenguin" (Brewster) - and a band of cartoon feline musicians (among others), Morgan ultimately manages to woo Destiny. After meeting with Destiny at a restaurant and ordering a cooked rabbit, Morgan discovers Destiny's [[vegetarianism]], and decides to eat only the vegetables around the plate rather than eat the rabbit meat and appall his alarmed date. Appreciative of Morgan's sacrifice at dinner for the sake of her comfort, Destiny begins to kiss him in the street, overlooked by the approving foodpenguin. The two rush off to Morgan's abode and it is stated that Morgan, lying in bed that night, needed no longer feel alone.  
Morgan and Destiny's Eleventeenth Date: The Zeppelin Zoo
 Morgan (Gordon-Levitt) and Destiny (Hulme) pay a visit to an ornate zoo aboard an [[airship]], where they find the old foodpenguin, now costumed in a [[giant panda]] outfit, has attained a job selling zoo-related souvenirs. At the zoo, Morgan is suddenly faced with tough opposition: the advances of Destiny's ex-boyfriend, Lionel (Tatum). When Destiny's cat, the cartoonized Madame Ballafur, suddenly disappears aboard the airship, a scramble ensues for Destiny's affections, with Morgan and Lionel both seeking the "purrpet" in hopes of returning her to Destiny in triumphant victory. Neither Morgan nor Lionel, however, can find the cat until the foodpenguin directs Morgan's attention to Madame Ballafur, sleeping comfortably in the cage of a huge lion; but Morgan's further progress is obstructed by the reappearance of Lionel. The two men engage in a buffoonish fistfight which is only ended when the foodpenguin hurls a [[skewer|food skewer]] toward Lionel, upon which he trips and falls. Morgan, clearly the weaker of the two men, now sees his chance to flee from Lionel and enter the lion's cage in order to grab up Ballafur and carry her back to Destiny. Lionel, however, tries to thwart his opponent by whistling loudly and startling the lion. Picking up Ballafur, Morgan runs away from the enraged lion and escapes at the last moment by vaulting himself over and out of the cage. Lionel tromps away, defeated, and Morgan and Destiny walk off with Ballafur, both relieved.

Morning Glory (2010 film)
 Aspiring news producer Becky Fuller ([[Rachel McAdams]]) has dreamed since childhood of working for the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show, but her dedication to her career is off-putting to potential suitors. After being laid off from her job at the local ''Good Morning New Jersey'', her mother advises her to give up her dream before it becomes an embarrassment. However, Becky perseveres, sending many different résumés out. She finally receives a call from IBS, which is looking for a producer on its struggling national [[Breakfast television|morning show]], ''DayBreak''.  After a discouraging job interview with Jerry Barnes ([[Jeff Goldblum]]), who dismisses both her and ''DayBreak'' as also-rans, Becky bumps into one of her heroes, veteran television journalist Mike Pomeroy ([[Harrison Ford]]) in an elevator. She is brushed off rudely, but is told by the other passenger that this is just typical of Mike. Seemingly against his better judgement, Jerry hires Becky to be ''DayBreak'''s executive producer. On her first day, Becky realizes she has signed on to a show in turmoil, lacking in direction and money. After meeting the acerbic but long-suffering co-host Colleen Peck ([[Diane Keaton]]), who predicts Becky's demise, she fires the conceited co-host Paul McVee ([[Ty Burrell]]), much to the delight of her co-workers. Becky chooses an unwilling Mike as Colleen's new co-host. Mike is under contract to IBS, but has mostly managed to escape being utilized while still getting paid. Becky finds a clause in his contract by which he is obliged to accept an official job offer or lose his salary, so he is forced to comply.  Becky gets to know Adam Bennett ([[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]), another IBS producer who had worked with Mike previously. After initially teaming up to deal with Mike, they begin dating, and he is initially supportive of her dedication to her job. Pomeroy proves to be hard going, throwing his weight about, trying to sabotage his debut on the show by getting drunk, refusing to banter with Colleen on air, and ensuring he only does serious news stories by making use of a clause in his contract that allows him to refuse certain assignments, like cooking segments, that he considers beneath him. As ratings begin to drop, Becky is told that ''DayBreak'' might be canceled.  After a heated confrontation with Mike, Becky snaps and decides on a radical approach to save the show. She improves ratings by persuading Ernie ([[Matt Malloy]]), the DayBreak weatherman, to do the weather while doing stunts, such as riding a new [[Six Flags]] roller coaster. Colleen also expresses a keen interest in Becky's campaign to rejuvenate the show, and appears on a number of colorful segments that help the show's ratings. Jerry remains unconvinced that Becky can get the ratings up enough to stave off cancellation. Adam, not realizing what is on the line, teases Becky about how caught up she is in improving the ratings, but she sees it as a criticism that she has heard from previous men, and walks out. Mike tells her that he was once the same way, but ended up with no life outside of work.  During a staff meeting, Pomeroy shows interest in doing a story, surprising colleagues. Becky goes along but realizes that he is going to the governor's summer house instead of the destination she expected. Mike ends up confronting the governor on charges of [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], and breaks the story of his arrest on live television. This increases ''DayBreak'' ratings enough to secure another year for the show. Due to ''DayBreak'' rise in popularity, Becky receives a job interview from ''Today''. During the interview, ''DayBreak'' is on. Between segments, Colleen tells Mike about the interview, and that his refusal to adapt has driven Becky away. He goes to the kitchen where food segments are done. Becky watches in shock as Pomeroy tells the viewers how to make a good [[frittata]]. Becky runs back to the set and decides to remain at ''DayBreak''.

Moss (film)
 In a small town in South Korea, a corrupt detective named Cheon is asked by a church minister to arrest an unofficial street preacher, whose influence has been growing, and who has collected large donations. The donors are pressured into saying that they were defrauded, which leads to the preacher's imprisonment and subsequent torture by Cheon in order to extract a confession. To Cheon's surprise, the preacher demonstrates amazing endurance and will-power, leading Cheon to release him and to fund his preaching. Cheon uses their new-found friendship to bolster his own reputation and recruit henchmen. Around this time, a young girl named Lee is raped by three men, and Cheon earns her respect by beating them up.  Around 25 years later, Ryoo, the estranged son of the preacher, is anonymously informed of his father's death and travels to the town, which happens to be the new jurisdiction of his acquaintance Park, a prosecutor. Ryoo encounters an elderly Cheon, whom all the townsfolk seem to venerate and fear. With Cheon are three henchmen, Jeon, Ha, and Kim, and also Lee, who became Cheon's wife. After the funeral, Ryoo stays behind to investigate, as he suspects his father was murdered, and finds several clues such as suspicious real-estate transactions. At this point, Jeon attempts to murder Ryoo, but Ryoo fights back and kills him. Ha attempts to murder Ryoo, who resists by lighting Ha's house on fire. Lee sees this and rescues Ryoo, and minutes later Ha burns to death, having entered the burning house to rescue his valuables.  As it turns out, Cheon has been serially extorting townspeople for their land, which he re-sells, and he has murdered anyone who didn't cooperate. Owing to his political connections, the police never indict him. Additionally, a mass poisoning occurred at a prayer house during this period, leaving dozens dead, and the culprit was never caught. Park, having spoken with Ryoo, builds a case against Cheon over the opposition of his corrupt superiors, and the last henchman Kim agrees to testify. Sadly, Cheon eaves-drops on the conversation and has Kim murdered. Ryoo angrily confronts Cheon, who reveals that Ryoo's father, upon realizing the extent of Cheon's corruption, attempted to murder Cheon in his sleep. Lee, fortunately, agrees to testify and to hand over evidence. She explains that years ago she had opposed a tentative plan to dispose of Ryoo's father, and in retaliation, Cheon's three henchmen had raped her.  As the town is raided by police, Ryoo, Park, and Lee confront Cheon at his house. Cheon is outraged that Lee betrayed him, and what is more, they argue over who did the prayer-house massacre. Cheon claims that Ryoo's father did it, while Lee claims that Cheon did it. In the midst of the raid, Cheon's son attempts to burn the evidence, and accidentally kills himself. As the police try to arrest Cheon, he shoots himself in the head, which brings the case to a close, though Ryoo's father's death goes unexplained. A year later, Ryoo visits his father's grave, and discovers that Lee has become the leader of the town. He suddenly recalls the anonymous phone call, as well as the convenient placement of clues, and realizes, to his horror, that Lee was his father's murderer. Having been tortured by Cheon, and wishing for an escape, Lee poisoned Ryoo's father so that Ryoo would arrive and open an investigation, the one which finally brought about Cheon's defeat.

Mukhaputa
 The film is about the children suffering from [[HIV/AIDS]]. The film is set in a small town in South India, where a socially responsible educationally oriented traditional woman adopts a young baby girl, and realizes after several years that the child had HIV at birth. The story centered on the child, and a few of her underprivileged friends of the same age, depicts the challenges faced by the girl, her family and the society – it showcases pre-conceived notions that society infers on patients with HIV, and how children and their family are coping up with life. With very positive messages, the film reinforces the strength needed to "grow against all odds" – the message is applicable to all around the world that are struggling to grow in a biased society for no fault of theirs’  
Mr. Nice
 The film begins in 2010, with a 65-year-old [[Howard Marks]] going onto a stage in front of a packed [[theatre]] to great applause. Marks asks if there are any [[undercover|plain-clothes]] [[policemen]] sat in the audience, to which the reply is negative. Then, while lighting up a [[joint (cannabis)|joint]], Marks asks "who here is a dope ([[marijuana]]) smoker?", to even greater applause. The film then diverts into Marks' [[internal monologue]] as he recounts his life.  Born in the [[Wales|Welsh valleys]] in 1945, young [[Howard Marks]] ([[Rhys Ifans]]) – later nicknamed Mr Nice – excels academically to much higher than the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|national standard]] of the [[United Kingdom]]. This remarkable aptitude earns him a scholarship to [[Oxford University]] at nineteen years old, reading [[philosophy]] and [[physics]], but Marks' destiny changes forever one night when dutifully studying alone in his dorm. A beautiful, rebellious and hedonistic [[foreign exchange student]] from [[Latvia]], Ilze Kadegis ([[Elsa Pataky]]) - breaks into Marks' room, looking for a secret passageway within. Marks follows Kadegis through the secret passageway and into a forgotten storage space used by one of the school's top marijuana dealers, Graham Plinson ([[Jack Huston]]). Kadegis seduces Marks, and introduces him to cannabis for the first time. For the next few years, Marks becomes an enthusiastic customer of Plinson's, and continues his love affairs with both Kadegis and cannabis; the group enjoy a series of wilder and wilder nights, with their academic lives suffering as a result.  Circumstances change for the worse when Plinson introduces the group to [[LSD]]. When rich heir Joshua Macmillan, a friend of Marks', dies of an [[overdose]], and Marks impales his foot on a spike, Marks vows to never touch drugs again - or at least the [[hard drugs|harder variety of drugs]]. The trio of Marks, Kadegis and Plinson promise to each other to turn over a new leaf, and they pass their scholarships through some intense last-minute revision, and a little cheating. They then all move on to teacher training courses at the [[University of London]] in 1967, where Marks hastily marries Kadegis. Fractures begin appearing in the early stages of the marriage, with Marks becoming despondent, apathetic and suspecting Kadegis of having an affair. What is more, Marks gets into trouble at the London University for "having long hair and flashy suits".  When plans to bring a large cache of hashish into England via Germany go wrong with Plinson getting arrested, Marks steps in to help - figuring he has nothing left to lose anyway. Marks goes to Germany and drives the car with the stash inside across the borders himself, simply driving through customs. The customs officers are on the lookout for Plinson's crew, but do not know Marks, who  sails through without incident. Marks says the thrill of getting away with it was like "religious flash and an asexual orgasm". When selling the hashish back in London to an Arab oil sheik named Saleem Malik ([[Omid Djalili]]), Marks makes a fortune, and swiftly becomes addicted to this new but dangerous lifestyle as a big league marijuana trafficker - eventually running a large percentage of the world's cannabis.  It is a path that will lead Marks face-to-face with terrorists, government agents, and lose him his freedom to one of the toughest prisons in the United States in 1988, through to the present day as a media personality and cult hero.

Mothman (2010 film)
 In [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]], home to the legend of the [[Mothman]], a group of high school seniors camp out next to a river near an old mill where the Mothman is supposedly buried under the incinerators. While pranking their friend Jamie by trying to scare him with the Mothman's legend, the teenagers accidentally drown Jamie while they are pulling him into the water while swimming in the river. The teenagers decide to cover up the accident by claiming that Jamie hit his head while jumping into the river and fake evidence by hitting his head post-mortem with a rock.  Ten years later, one of the teenagers named Katherine Grant ([[Jewel Staite]]), now a reporter for the ''Washington Weekly'', returns to Point Pleasant after her boss sends her on a matter of the tenth [[Mothman Festival]].  Katherine meets with her former boyfriend Derek Carpenter ([[Connor Fox]]) and later with the rest of her friends who accidentally killed Jamie.  After Katherine and her friends meet in a bar, Jared ([[Michael Aills]]) heads back to his RV where he is murdered by the Mothman himself. The next day, Katherine and Derek head to Jared's where they can't find him and leave. Yet they miss his remains and guts on the other side of the RV. Katherine and Derek head to the Mothman Festival where they meet a blind old man named Frank Waverly ([[Jerry Leggio]]) who tells them of the Mothman's legend; warning them that he will strike again. Later that night at the bar, Richard ([[T.W. Leshner]]), almost commits suicide over Jamie's death, but changes his mind just as he is about to shoot himself. The Mothman enters through a mirror and kills Richard with broken glass.  The Mothman then goes after Sally ([[Jessica Erin Sylvia]]) who drives away in her car. Sally's car stops and she is brutally murdered by the Mothman.  The next day, Katherine, who is now starting to believe in the Mothman, comes to Frank for help.  Frank tells Katherine of how Point Pleasant is the only land in North America never to be occupied by Indians. This is because they feared that the land was home to an evil spirit.  When the white settlers took over the land, they killed the Indians and their chief [[Cornstalk]] escaped to where Point Pleasant is now. The whites found Cornstalk who offered a treaty with the whites.  But the whites tortured him and before dying, Cornstalk summoned the evil spirit so that he could take revenge on any murderers in the area. The whites cut Cornstalk in pieces and put them in a mirror-lined coffin. Hence, the spirit Mothman can only enter our world through reflective surfaces. Katherine leaves and heads back to her motel room where she is attacked by the Mothman who enters through the television screen. Derek arrives and wards off the Mothman.  Katherine and Derek go to Frank for help where Frank admits to blinding himself because he and one of his friends accidentally murdered the mayor's son while driving drunk in 1967.  Casey ([[Matty Ferraro]]) later discovers Jared's dead remains at his RV and is attacked by the Mothman. He manages to escape and calls Derek. Frank gives Katherine and her friends a bone-like object to perform a banishing ritual to stop the Mothman. Katherine, Derek, and Casey head to the old mill where they perform the banishing ritual near an incinerator. However, the banishing ritual actually appears to summon the Mothman, as it appears after the banishing ritual is performed and hunts down Katherine and Derek as he chases them through the mill. Just as the Mothman has Katherine and Derek cornered, Casey shoots him and the creature flies off. As Katherine and Derek attempt to escape, Casey shoots at the Mothman once more and is carried away by the creature as Katherine and Derek leave.  Katherine and Derek arrive at Frank's where he traps them in a tunnel where they are cornered by the Mothman. However, Katherine and Derek eventually escape and find Casey who is actually alive. The three head to the Mothman Festival that night where Frank is planning on the Mothman taking revenge on the entire town. Frank arrives at the festival where all of the attendants spot the Mothman in the sky as he attacks a woman on a Ferris wheel. Katherine and Derek arrive at the scene where Frank is finally killed by the Mothman, as well as the mayor who shoots at the Mothman. Casey rams the Mothman with his car and attempts to kill the creature. However, the Mothman kills Casey and prepares to kill Katherine. Katherine fires her gun at the Mothman which sets off an explosion that seems to kill the Mothman. However, the Mothman is still alive and again prepares to kill Katherine. Derek distracts the Mothman for a second until the creature carries him off and drops him. The Mothman then prepares to finally kill Katherine. Katherine stabs the Mothman in the chest with the bone-like object which causes the Mothman to burst into flames and black [[moth]]s.  The next day, Katherine visits Derek who is wounded and in a hospital. Katherine's eyes turn red and black moths fly from her. She is seemingly the Mothman and is preparing to kill Derek. As the scene closes, a black moth is seen which bursts into flames and turns into the Mothman's glowing red eyes.

Mumbai-Pune-Mumbai
 The story revolves around two characters, a boy ([[Swwapnil Joshi]]) from [[Pune]] and a girl ([[Mukta Barve]]) from [[Mumbai]], whose names are not revealed. Barve is shown to arrive in Pune to meet a prospective groom (whom she has already decided to decline), and inadvertently comes across Joshi to ask for directions to the prospective groom (who is referred to as ‘''"हृदयमर्दम" (Hridaymardyam)''’ after the name of his residential colony). She finds the place, but seeing the door locked, checks out the neighbouring houses to find his whereabouts, but is turned away by the neighbour. She calls up her relative in Mumbai via a public phone (her mobile having run out of battery) and decides to spend the day in Pune, waiting for ''Hridaymardyam'' to show up. She bumps into Joshi again, and asks him directions to the nearest coffee shop. Joshi offers her a ride instead, and she being new in town, agrees, if only to save the hassle of searching for an address again; and they end up having coffee together. In the coffee shop, the two debate about their respective hometowns and constantly try to boast about their own city. She is exasperated by his constant chatter, but they share a curious chemistry nevertheless.  Between bouts of incessant culture-bashing, they share their life-stories and little secrets (such as him disclosing about his virginity or she telling him about her boyfriend back in Mumbai). She says that since ‘Hridaymardyam’ has made her wait for him, now she shall meet him at her own leisure. Saying so she asks Joshi to accompany her to a famous local garden-temple, [[Sarasbaug Ganpati|Sarasbaug]] after which they proceed to the local and famous ‘[[Tulshi Baug]]’ market, and other local attractions thereafter. The duo are shown to begin understanding each other closely, sharing intimate details about their respective love-lives and cultural upbringing, as also their viewpoints on a variety of subjects. Through all of this, Joshi mysteriously never leaves her company, and neither does Barve, despite many scenarios where both could have gone their separate ways.  In one instance she tries to call ''Hridaymardyam'' from Joshi’s cellphone, but the number is shown to be engaged. Thinking nothing of it, and deciding to return without meeting him, she spends the remaining day with Joshi, until it is time to leave for Mumbai. Finally arriving at the station, Barve hands over a written note to Joshi, explaining her reason for not wanting to marry ''Hridaymardyam'', and asks Joshi to deliver it to him. They both bid their farewells, where they finally for the first time ask each other their names. As Barve identifies herself as just ‘Mumbai’, Joshi befittingly replies ‘Pune’. They take each other’s leave, but not before ‘Pune’ asks her to return his mobile handset which she had earlier kept in her handbag. When asked for his phone number, Joshi mystically replies "''असंही आपण पुन्हा भेटणार नाही ; त्यापेक्षा आजचा दिवस ठेव की आठवणीत ! (Asahi apan punha bhetnar nahi, tyapeksha aajcha divas thev ki aathvanit!)''" (We’re never going to meet ever again as it is, let’s just remember this day in our memories!); and refuses to give his number.  As he exits the station, ‘Mumbai’ at last receives a call from ''Hridaymardyam'', who asks her to meet her outside the station; her train due to leave in 15 minutes, she agrees and comes out to the parking lot to find ‘Pune’ unable to start his bike, but no sign of ''Hridaymardyam'' yet. When she explains why she is outside instead of on the platform waiting for her train, ‘Pune’ expresses surprise and teases her over her eagerness to meet ''Hridaymardyam'', and rightly declares that he is sure she has changed her mind about not wanting to marry him, making her blush.  However, ''Hridaymardyam'' does not show up, and when she asks 'Pune' for his phone to call him again, he tells her to look in the dialled list, the second entry below her number. She dials and gets a busy tone again, and decides to leave, having already left the note in Joshi’s possession. But in a split second of realization, she turns back and asks him how did he have her number in his dialled list if she never ever gave it to him? To which he replies "''ते फारसं महत्वाचं नाहीये ! तू हा विचार कर की त्याच नंबरवरून तोच नंबर कसा काय लागेल ?''" (Te faarsa mahatvacha nahiye. Tu haa vichar kar ki tyach number varun toch number kasaky laagel?)''" (That is not important. What you ''should'' think about is ‘how can a person one call a cell phone from that same cell phone’?); revealing that he himself is, in fact, ''Hridaymardyam'', the one she had originally come to meet and ended up unknowingly spending the entire day with.  As she digests this new information, he explains how she approached him in the morning and asked him directions to his own address, and how he decided to try out this new way to date a girl. He then proclaims his love for her, and asks her to marry him. She says she will think about it (her blushes clearly indicating it is a ‘yes’), and runs away to the platform to catch the moving train. The closing scene shows Joshi (aka ‘Pune’ aka ''Hridaymardyam'') rushing in behind her, and the credits roll.

My Girlfriend's Boyfriend (2010 film)
 Ethan ([[Christopher Gorham]]) is a struggling writer who rushes to his girlfriend’s house only to be told by her roommate that she has left for the airport. There and moments later, they are reunited and embrace. It is revealed to be an excerpt from Ethan’s latest written work. His agent ([[Carol Kane]]), upon finishing the novel, informs him that it is “unrealistic” and will not be published.  Disappointed and exhausted from his many attempts at being published, Ethan retreats to a local café and while recording his thoughts into his personal journal meets waitress Jesse ([[Alyssa Milano]]) and is instantly smitten with her outgoing personality, beauty and charm. He asks for her phone number so they can go on a date together and she cheerfully agrees.  Moments after Ethan leaves, a handsome patron named Troy ([[Michael Landes]]) enters the café and also asks Jesse on a date to which she also agrees.  As Ethan and Jesse begin to date, he learns that she was once married and that her marriage failed because she “was not the right girl” for her ex-husband.  Ethan begins writing a new novel at the time that he and Jesse begin dating.  Ethan, who manages the apartment building he lives in in order to live rent free, seems to be the exact opposite of the much more financially successful and suave Troy, an advertising executive.  Despite this, Ethan and Jesse’s relationship blossoms and deepens and he falls in love with her, as does Troy.  It is apparent through conversations with her brother ([[Tom Lenk]]) and uncle ([[Beau Bridges]]) that Jesse is struggling over how to tell Ethan her “secret”. She knows that Ethan desires a family and is enthralled by his interaction with his sister’s children. After Ethan proposes marriage to her Jesse becomes emotionally distraught over fear of revealing the truth and decides to end their relationship and leave town with Troy, who had asked her to move to another city with him to expand his business.  Heartbroken but determined to fulfill his promise to Jesse to finish his novel, Ethan submits his work and is overjoyed when he receives word from his agent that his novel will be published.  As he is on the phone with his agent he receives a missed call from Jesse who is checking in at the airport. He tries to return her call but she has turned off her cell phone in the meantime. Just as in the beginning of the film, Ethan rushes to her apartment to tell her how much he loves her but her brother informs him that she has left for the airport. Ethan then races off to the airport only to find that he has missed Jesse’s flight.  He returns home and is surprised to find Jesse waiting for him in his apartment. She tearfully expresses her wish to be honest with him, but he decides to share his news with her first.  He shows her his new novel, ''Troy Meets Girl''.  It is revealed at this point that the relationship between Jesse and Troy was fictional; Troy had been created by Ethan as a more wealthy and successful version of himself for his novel to create content. Jesse was not leaving with another man, but rather for a job in another city for a fresh start.  Jesse then reveals her secret to Ethan—she cannot have children. Ethan quickly responds that this does not matter to him and that they can adopt if need be. He again proposes marriage and this time Jesse accepts.  The film ends with Jesse and Ethan getting married and driving off in his car, which stalls and needs to be pushed by the wedding party.  
Mutant Girls Squad
 Rin ([[Yumi Sugimoto]]), a young  high school student, is an unassuming and awkward girl who is bullied at school. One day, while being bullied, she feels a sharp pain in her hand. Later, Rin learns that she is a descendant of the ancient Hiruko clan, whose members are mutants gifted with superpowers. No sooner does she learn of this, than her home is raided by anti-Hiruko soldiers. Rin's parents are killed and Rin barely escapes with her life. After killing an entire shopping district out of misunderstanding and grief-fueled rage, Rin meets Rei ([[Yuko Takayama]]), another mutant. Rei introduces Rin to a small rag-tag group of mutant rebels led by a [[transvestite]] [[samurai]] named Kisaragi ([[Tak Sakaguchi]]), who is bent on restoring the Hiruko clan's place in the world.  Under the instruction of Kisaragi and Rei, Rin begins training, wearing an iron mask until she can control her powers.  While in training, the tentacle-armed Yoshie ([[Suzuka Morita]]) tells Rin about Rei's past; only three years ago, Rei had been a freak show attraction at a circus, and the only person to show her compassion and acceptance was a human boy who gave her a gold [[cross necklace]].  When the townsfolk killed the boy for loving her, Rei's hatred for humans was born.  Rin later finds the necklace after Rei accidentally drops it after a training session.  When Rin achieves control over her powers much sooner than Kisaragi had expected, he orders her, along with Yoshie, to infiltrate an anti-Hiruko conference and attack a high ranking general named Koshimizu. Rin and Yoshie successfully take out Koshimizu, but find themselves unable to kill some innocent surviving humans. Rei, under Kisaragi's orders, kills the survivors.  Eventually, Rin realizes that, in spite of everything that has happened, she cannot turn against her human side. She manages to persuade Yoshie to join in her cause to protect innocent humans rather than kill or subjugate them. Meanwhile, other Hiruko schoolgirls are being brainwashed to carry out suicide bomb attacks at various locations to kill humans. Kisaragi kidnaps and drains the blood of the fervently anti-Hiruko prime minister, which grants him a large grotesque and super-powered body. Yoshie takes on the brainwashed mutant schoolgirls while Rin faces off against Rei. Rin manages to successfully convince Rei to stop her war on humans when she returns Rei's treasured gold cross necklace and triggers fond memories of the human boy who loved her. Rin, Rei and Yoshie team up to defeat Kisaragi and rescue the prime minister.

My Afternoons with Margueritte
 Germain is a 45-year-old illiterate handyman who has not had much luck in his life so far. He was bullied at school, both by the teacher and the other pupils because he was a slow reader. His mother never gave him love and affection, and kept reminding him that he was clumsy and an unwanted child, the result of a fling at the French national holiday. But he is loyal, with a good heart, and still parks his trailer close to her house where he maintains his lovely vegetable garden. He earns some extra money by taking his vegetables to the weekly farmers' market in the truck borrowed from the bar where he relaxes every day with his friends, joking and chatting. His girl friend Annette is a younger woman who drives the local bus, and is very much in love with this sweet, simple and loving man.  One afternoon Germain meets Margueritte, a delicate 95-year-old lady who sits on the same bench to feed the 19 pigeons that he has observed so often that he knows them by sight and has given them names. She is highly educated, a scientist who has traveled the world with the [[World Health Organization]] and now spends her life reading in the genteel retirement home in this small town. They connect over a text from ''[[The Plague]]'' by [[Albert Camus]], but because Germain is barely literate Margueritte starts to read the book aloud to him. Slowly he starts to appreciate the beauty of words and sentences and books because he is a good listener and he has a vivid imagination. The symbolism Camus uses in this [[philosophical novel]] leads Germain to expand his horizon, making him think as never before. The pair meet every day to continue their reading sessions. A friendship develops that is healing for both, enabling Germain to face the frustrations he silently carries with him. She continues to read to him, and eventually Margueritte gives him her old dictionary. In it he tries to find words that he's interested in, but because he can't spell he find the dictionary too frustrating and decides to return it when he has agreed to come over to Margueritte's retirement home for tea. She tells him that her eyesight is gradually fading due to [[macular degeneration]], and that she will soon no longer be able to walk unassisted. Germain decides to reverse roles and try to read to her, but first he must improve his reading skills. With Annette's support he learns to read a story aloud to Margueritte. Shortly thereafter, Germain’s mother dies. Despite his mother's bad attitude toward him all his life, he is still distraught when he finds her dead. At the notary's he discovers that his mother owned the house he had always thought she was renting, and a sizeable fortune she had worked hard to earn, intending to bequeath that to him but never telling him about that. Meanwhile, Annette announces her pregnancy to Germain, who has wondered about the wisdom of having children because he does not want them to grow up with a good-for-nothing father, but Annette tells him not to worry: he can give love. When Margueritte suddenly leaves her retirement home because her nephew and niece can no longer supplement the costs and is put into a downscale retirement home in [[Flanders]], [[Belgium]], she has left only her dictionary for Germain. Germain traces her down and brings her with him to his house. On the way home, Germain reads a poem he has written about what Margueritte has done for him:  :It's not a typical love affair :But "love" and "tenderness" :Both are there :Named after a daisy :She lived amidst words :Surrounded by adjectives :In green fields of verbs :Some force you to yield :But she with soft art :Passed through my hard shield :And into my heart :Not always are love stories :Just made of love :Sometimes :Love is not named :But it's love just the same... :This is no typical love affair :I met her on a bench in my local square :She made a little stir, tiny like a bird :With her gentle feathers :She was surrounded by words :Some as common as myself :She gave me books, two or three :Their pages have come alive for me :Don't die now, :You've still time, just wait :It's not the hour, my little flower :Give me some more of you :More of the life in you :Wait... :Not always are love stories :Just made of love :Sometimes love is not named :But it's love just the same.<ref>1900, C.

My Name Is Khan
  Rizwan Khan ([[Tanay Chheda]]) is a [[Muslim]] child who lived with his brother Zakir ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) and his mother ([[Zarina Wahab]]) in a middle-class family in the [[Borivali]] section of [[Mumbai]]. Rizwan has [[autism]], but he has certain gifts, particularly a special ability to repair things.  His difference leads to special tutoring from a reclusive scholar and extra attention from his mother, all which leads to a heightened level of jealousy from his brother, who eventually leaves his family for a life in the United States.  Despite this initial resentment, as an adult Zakir requests Rizwan ([[Shah Rukh Khan]]) to come and live with him in [[San Francisco]] after the death of their mother. It is at this time that Zakir's wife, Haseena diagnoses Rizwan as having [[Asperger's syndrome]]. Rizwan begins to work as a product seller in Zakir's company and in the process he meets a [[Hindu]] woman, Mandira ([[Kajol]]) and her young son, Sameer, from a previous marriage. Despite Zakir's hostility to the match, they marry and settle down in the town of Banville, where both Mandira and Sameer take Rizwan's last name as their own. They also live next door to the Garrick family, consisting of Mark, who is a reporter, his wife Sarah and son Reese.  The couples perfect existence is disrupted after the [[September 11 attacks]] on the twin towers in [[New York City]]. Mark goes to cover the war in Afghanistan and dies there. At the same time, the Khan family begins to experience [[Aftermath of September 11, 2001|post 9-11 prejudice]] in their community and Reese begins to turn against Sameer as well. One afternoon, an argument between them turns into a racially motivated schoolyard fight between Sameer and a number of older students. Reese tries to stop the fight but is held back and Sameer dies from his injuries. A shattered Mandira blames Rizwan for his death stating that Sameer "died only because his name was Khan." She then tells Rizwan that she no longer wants to be with him. When he asks her what he has to do in order for them to be together, she tells him sarcastically that he has to tell the people of the United States and the President that "my name is Khan and that he is not a terrorist".  Rizwan, being naive, thus sets out on a journey that takes him from one US state to another, in order to meet the president and get his wife's love back. During this quest, he travels to a small town in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and befriends Mama Jenny and her son Joel. Later, in [[Los Angeles]], he prays in a Mosque and overhears violent rhetoric from a Muslim docter Faisal Rahman. He reports this to the FBI but there is no response at that moment. Later, while waiting in a crowd to meet President [[George W. Bush]] and repeating again and again, "My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist," Rizwan is arrested and placed in a prison by police who misinterpret his statement.  While in the prison he is brutally interrogated as a terrorist suspect and meets the psychiatrist Radha who believes he is innocent. He is later released after a media campaign by some Indian student reporters, who prove his innocence by unearthing his attempts to inform the FBI about Faisal Rahman. After his release, he returns to hurricane-hit Wilhemina to help Mama Jenny and her son. His efforts attract media attention and numerous Muslims come to help as well. At the same time, Reese confesses to Mandira and reveals the identity of the boys who beat up Sam. She informs Detective Garcia who has been assisting her on the case, and the boys are arrested.  After the killers are brought to justice, she joins Rizwan in Georgia. At the moment she arrives to meet him, Rizwan is stabbed by one of Faisal Rahman's followers, who accuses him of being a traitor to Islam. He is then rushed to the hospital. With Mandira's help, Rizwan survives and meets President-elect [[Barack Obama]], who tells him: "Your name is Khan and you are not a terrorist."

My Soul to Take
 Family man Abel Plenkov ([[Raul Esparza]]), a sufferer of [[schizophrenia]], accidentally discovers that he is the Riverton Ripper, a local, masked serial killer. After killing his pregnant wife, Sarah (Alexandra Wilson), and then his psychiatrist, he is shot down and carted away in an ambulance, leaving his young daughter Leah and premature son orphaned. On the way to the hospital, a paramedic ([[Danai Gurira]]) suggests that Plenkov himself is innocent but that he houses multiple souls, with the Ripper's being one of them. Near death, Plenkov unexpectedly revives, slashing the paramedic in the throat, causing the ambulance to crash and burn and seemingly escapes.  Sixteen years later, the Riverton Seven—blind Jerome ([[Denzel Whitaker]]), loser Alex ([[John Magaro]]), imaginative Jay (Jeremy Chu), timid Bug ([[Max Thieriot]]), religious Penelope ([[:nl:Zena Grey|Zena Grey]]), beautiful Brittany ([[Paulina Olszynski]]), and jock Brandon ([[Nick Lashaway]])—gather for the annual ritual of "killing" a Ripper puppet to superstitiously prevent his return. Bug is elected but fails. Not long after, Jay is murdered by the reappeared Ripper. At home, Bug begins to redo a class project, exhibiting Jay's creativity.  At school, Brandon torments Bug and Alex on orders of Fang ([[Emily Meade]]), a tyrannical bully. Bug and Alex decide to spy on Fang to see if Brittany has a crush on him. During their surveillance, Fang cruelly alleges that Bug had previously been in institutions for killing people. Bug begins unwittingly imitating the rest of the Riverton Seven, including Fang. Penelope, having predicted the Ripper's return as well as their deaths, is the next one killed. Brandon and Brittany discover her body in the woods and are both stabbed to death also.  That night, Fang, who is revealed to be Bug's sister and going by her name of Leah, gives her brother a birthday present: a rocking horse created by Abel Plenkov. Angrily, she unveils the truth that had long been hidden: that they are his children and she is the daughter he had failed to kill; Bug had survived in his dead mother's womb albeit born prematurely. Everyone saw him as a miracle, which caused Fang to harbor lifelong resentment towards him; she had been traumatized by the event but he remained innocent of its memory. The two reconcile, but are informed of the murders.  Alex visits a distressed Bug and theorizes that the Ripper's evil soul jumped into one of the Riverton Seven, forcing them to kill off the others. Downstairs, Bug and Fang encounter the Ripper. Just as Bug is about to be killed, the Ripper hears a noise upstairs. Bug goes back to his room, discovering Jerome, mortally wounded, in his closet. After Jerome dies, Alex reappears and suggests that Bug inherited schizophrenia from his father, and had unknowingly killed everyone. Bug rejects this idea. The souls of the dead Seven are now part of him, and together they help him deduce that Alex is, in fact, the one with the Ripper's soul. "Alex" admits guilt and confesses his revenge. He proposes that they kill Fang and pin the murders on Jerome to appear as heroes. Bug refuses, stabbing Alex in the stomach. Freed from the Ripper's soul, Alex, now returned to his original self, dies.  Although Bug expects to be arrested, Fang tells the police everything, clearing his name. The town proclaims him a hero. Despite not feeling like one, he narrates that he would "fake it good" in order to honor Alex's memory.  
My Joy
 It is summer, and young driver Georgy takes his light truck on a trip to another town with a cargo of flour. He is stopped at a road police post by a pair of rude and corrupt policemen. While they are flirting with the woman they stopped earlier, Georgy manages to grab his papers and leave unnoticed. There he picks up a hitchhiker, an old man who recounts him a disturbing story: soon after [[World War II]], while returning home from the front, a corrupt military officer brazenly robbed him by threatening him with arrest if he did not comply. He later shot the officer in retaliation. Later when Georgy parks his truck and steps out and shortly returns, the old man has disappeared.  Later Georgy meets an underage prostitute. He takes pity on the girl and gives her some money and food, but she is offended by his charity, insults him and leaves.  Later still, Georgy is lost in the night and decides to camp in the field until dawn. Three locals approach and try to steal from the truck, only to be stopped by Georgy. They distract his attention with some neutral conversation, telling him how one of their friends is a [[Elective mutism|mute]] because someone killed his father in front of him when he was a child. Suddenly one hits Georgy on the head with a log and he loses consciousness.  The scene shifts to the times of World War II. Early in the war, two Soviet soldiers from a defeated unit cautiously feel their way through the occupied land in the deep German rear. They enter a lone house where a widowed teacher lives with his infant son. The teacher is kind to the soldiers and provides them with much-needed food and shelter. However, the soldiers regard his pacifism and indifference towards the German invaders as treasonous, so they kill him, rob the house, and continue on their way, leaving the child to his own devices.  The scene shifts back to the present. Some time has passed. It is winter, and Georgy lives in the same house that once was the teacher's. The blow has left him feeble-minded and mute. He walks around bearded, dilapidated, with a blank stare. The woman living in the house keeps him as a sex slave while she trades his flour on the local market. A policeman approaches and tells her that Georgy and his truck are being searched for, so she had better get rid of both. Georgy is beaten by the locals and detained by the police, only to be released the next night when another inmate challenges the lone guard to a fight, beats him unconscious, and unlocks the cells.  The woman sells Georgy's truck and leaves the place, abandoning him in the snowcapped village. Homeless, he wanders about being driven off by the locals, until he collapses from exhaustion. He is found and picked up by the old man whom he earlier gave a ride.  A military van comes to the village, carrying two servicemen tasked with delivering the body of a deceased soldier to his native place. Their daunting task is not made easier by the fact that one of them, an officer, suffers from [[delirium tremens]]. Unable to locate the relatives of the dead soldier, they decide to bribe some random people into signing the papers and leave the body to them. They approach the old man, who at first is suspicious but eventually agrees. However, shortly afterwards Georgy walks out of the house to find the old man dead. It is hinted that he may have been axed by the officer, who in his alcoholic delusion mistook him for someone else.  Georgy numbly grabs the old man's pistol and walks out to the road, where he is picked up by a very talkative truck driver, who rambles about the importance of not meddling in other people's affairs. Meanwhile, on the road the same two police officers from the beginning of the movie stop a police major and his wife. When they begin to write him up for a burnt-out headlight, the major attempts to bribe and intimidate them. When this fails and he turns to leave, a fistfight ensues, with the major handcuffed and brutally beaten. To produce two fake witnesses of his arrest, they stop another car, which is the truck with Georgy. They easily threaten the driver into signing the papers, but when they turn to Georgy, he stands silently. A fight breaks out, and one of the policemen pulls out an assault rifle. Georgy instantly shoots him dead, then everyone else. Still clutching the pistol, he staggers out into the dark.

Jeeva tries to make her become more independent. One day he goes up to Priya's father against her pleas and tells him of their love. Jeeva eventually secures a job as that is one of the requirements for him to marry Priya. Eventually Priya becomes acquainted with Jeeva's family and is accepted as the future bride.  When all seems to go well, a murder attempt on Pragasam disturbs everything. Pragasam had witnessed a girl being taken by a group of teenagers in his taxi. The girl is raped and killed. To get rid of the body of the girl and her boyfriend, they hack both the bodies into small pieces and dumps them in random dump-yards in the city. When the police accidentally recovers the head of the girl from a dump yard, it is reported on TV. Pragasam suspects that the head recovered might belong to a girl who was taken by guys who boarded his taxi. So he decides to knock on the doors of justice and confirms to the police that the girl in his taxi and the murdered girl are the same. Sensing trouble, the teenage gang plans to murder him as he has seen their faces. So they go to Pey Babu ([[Ramachandran Durairaj]]), the uncle of one of the teenagers, a local criminal who is adept at coming up with plans for murdering people. They conduct reconnaissance of Pragasam and their home. They also come to know about the upcoming marriage of Jeeva's sister when Pey Babu, under the guise of delivering a pamphlet, takes a good look at Jeeva's family. Pey Babu assumes that Jeeva's family has to venture outside their home for wedding arrangements. The gang follows Jeeva's family to a wedding card shop where the gang hears the owner of the shop asking Jeeva and his father to come back in a couple of days to collect the printed cards. Now that Pey Babu knows the exact location and time of where Pragasam is going to be, he comes up with a detailed plan for a murder. When Jeeva and Pragasam return to the shop after two days, the gang starts a commotion in the crowded street and in the ensuing confusion, one of the teenage gang members stabs Pragasam with a piece of a poisoned glass shrapnel.  During the murder, Jeeva notices and identifies one of the teenage gang members as he looked like the same person that Pragasam described during the previous investigation of the girl's murder. The death of Pragasam shatters Jeeva. The investigation of Pragasam's murder brings the police to Jeeva's home where they ask him whether he had seen any suspicious person in his neighborhood in the days before Pragasam's murder. Jeeva denies seeing any suspicious person although he later reveals to his friend, Ravi ([[Soori (actor)|Soori]]) that he indeed has seen Pey Babu delivering pamphlets to his home and during his father's murder. When Ravi inquires why he did not say anything to the police, Jeeva replies these teenagers do not deserve a police investigation and a court trial. The heinous crime they committed, hacking a girl into pieces, deserves much harsher punishment indicating that he is going to personally punish the gang not just because they killed Pragasam but because of the heinous and [[psychopathic]] nature of their crimes. He sets out on a mission to identify the culprits and goes running around the town baying for their blood.  Jeeva seeks the help of his friend Kutti Nadesan ([[Aruldoss]]), a Chennai gangster, who Jeeva got acquainted with in the past. Kutti Nadesan with his influence asks his gang to bring all the guys who plans for a murder in Chennai, so that Jeeva can identify him. It turns out there are only four people who can plan for a murder in Chennai including Pey Babu. Nadesan interrogates the first person in front of Jeeva. The next is Pey Babu, but Jeeva gets distracted, but turns back just in time to look at Pey Babu and identifies him as the person who delivered pamphlets to his home days before Pragasam's murder. Now a chase ensues and Jeeva successfully captures and subdues Pey Babu. Now, Jeeva coerces Pey Babu into taking him to where the teenage gang is. Both Pey Babu and Jeeva goes to the road in front of the college where the five teenagers study. But before he can get hold of them, the gangs gets alerted and start a commotion by throwing cool drink bottles in the crowd. In the ensuing melee, Pey Babu gets stabbed by one of the teenage gang members and Jeeva gets a clear look at the teenagers who stabbed Pey Babu. So Jeeva chases him and beats him senseless . But the teenager is killed by a train when he tries to escape the clutches of Jeeva. Jeeva subsequently goes to the dead teenager's funeral hoping that his friends will come there. The gang arrives, but sees Jeeva before he sees them .  They leave the funeral and to get drunk goes to one of the beaches, which coincidentally is the same place Nadesan returns after going to the sea. The teenage gang argues among themselves how their friend was killed by Jeeva and how they should avenge him. At the same time, Jeeva calls Nadesan on his cell phone to use his influence to investigate about the friends of the dead teenager. The gang, while arguing starts shouting, which distracts Nadesan and looking at them, Nadesan asks Jeeva about on what the teenage gang looks like. Sensing that Jeeva's description matches the teenage gang on the beach, Nadesan goes to inquire them while giving his phone to another one of his group to give Jeeva, the directions to the beach. During the inquiry, Nadesan confirms the killers and the gang on the beach are the same, but before he can do anything the teenage gang clubs one of Nadesan's group and runs into a nearby area with many dilapidated houses. Nadesan and two of his group grabs weapons and goes after them but they are killed easily as they are outnumbered by the four teenagers, who hide and attack and finish them off one by one. Jeeva arrives just a few minutes late to see that Nadesan and his group slaughtered.  Now it is up to Jeeva to face four teenagers armed with blades and avenge his father's death. What follows is an intense, gut wrenching fight for survival between the teenage gang and Jeeva. After a struggle, Jeeva triumphs over the four rapists and buries them alive on the beach.

Nagavalli (film)
    An ancient painting of Chandramukhi, alias Nagavalli ([[Anushka Shetty]]), floats away to a distant place, where it finally comes into the hands of a village painter. The painter takes it home to restore it. When his wife asks him to sell the painting, he becomes furious, saying that he wouldn't sell it off even at the cost of his life. The next day, the painter is shown to be dead under mysterious circumstances, possibly being a suicide. The painting is then sold off to a dance competition, which was distributed as a prize to Bharatanatyam dancer Gayathri ([[Kamalinee Mukherjee]]), her husband and her family. Gayathri lives in a palatial house in Tirupathi with her husband, father Shankar Rao ([[Sharat Babu]]), mother Parvathi (Prabha), sisters Geetha ([[Shraddha Das]]) and Gowri ([[Richa Gangopadhyay]]), maternal uncle Appa Rao ([[Dharmavarapu Subramanyam]]), his wife and maternal cousins Pooja ([[Poonam Kaur]]) and Hema ([[Suja]]) happily.  A few years later, Gayathri and her Husband are shown to be dead. However, at the Engagement day of Gowri, youngest of the three sisters of Gayathri, one of her friends had fainted by encountering a huge thirty-feet Snake/Serpent, and the bridegroom/fiancé had run away from the family house fearing of something. All strange incidents happen as the family called for a snake charmer to the house, but the snake charmer had died when he attempted to make the serpent appear. The members of the family are psychologically affected by the presence of Chandramukhi's painting and things have not been going well in the house.  They decided to contact Acharya Ramchandra Siddhanthi ([[Avinash]]), an astrologer cum sage. The father of the three daughters had told the people and the Acharya that Gayathri and her husband died suddenly after the Bharatanatyam competition. The Acharya takes the help of Dr. Vijay ([[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]]), a psychiatrist, to solve the problem. All directions point to the huge portrait of Chandramukhi and is observed that the portrait is the cause for this. So the father had warned everyone to not go to the outhouse or to the room where Chandramukhi's painting is. At first, both Acharya and Dr. Vijay suspects Geetha due to her strange behavior. One night, Dr. Vijay goes to the outhouse as he heard anklet sounds, and there was another smaller portrait of Chandramukhi in the outhouse and the Doctor wondered how this portrait of Chandramukhi had come here, and it was revealed that Gayathri is still alive but became mad after the truck accident in which her husband died while he was carrying the painting of Chandramukhi, and that she said that no one accepted to marry the second daughter Geetha because Gayathri was mad and so Geetha vowed that she wouldn't marry, and since they didn't want Gowri's situation to be like this, they lied saying Gayathri was dead. In a few occasions, someone attempted to murder the Acharya twice. Suspecting Gayathri, the Acharya asks the family members to bring Gayathri to the temple and that he will show everyone that Chandramukhi is in Gayathri's body, but as Gayathri stepped the temple, all animals were running out of the temple.  Suspecting each and every person in the family, Dr. Vijay starts to investigate everything so he goes to the library to read a book based on Raja Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara 's life and further information on Nagavalli too. The investigation also takes back to around 125 years when Raja Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara (Venkatesh) used to live and how his enmity with Chandramukhi has been going on for centuries. Dr.Vijay was shocked on seeing Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajashekara because of 2 reasons; 1) Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava looked just like Vijay and 2) It was he who had brought Chandramukhi to his kingdom and not Venkatapathy Rajashekara, who was Nagabhairava's elder brother and had been killed long ago by Nagabhairava, and was revealed that he had attempted to escape as one of his men had spread a dirty rumour about him, which caused the whole Dominion and the people to go and slaughter and assassinate him... but the book didn't tell if he got assassinated, or if he really committed suicide or if he is alive. Dr. Vijay finishes reading the book and whilst signing the ledger, he reads the name above him: Chandramukhi... and he understands that she had read the book before he had. To further investigate about Chandramukhi, Dr. Vijay goes to Chandramukhi's place in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu and an old man told the Doctor that Chandramukhi's family died back at around a hundred years and told him that he was the second person to enquire about Chandramukhi's family, and as the Doctor asked who that person was, the old man told him that a girl came and inquired about Chandramukhi, and he also says that she was fine whilst asking the questions, but when she returned from Chandramukhi's place, she was holding a portrait of Chandramukhi and ran away like a mad girl, so the Doctor goes to Chandramukhi's house and realizes and understands that the portrait in the outhouse was the portrait of Chandramukhi which had been taken, as he glanced at an empty wall with a rectangular marking outline.  Dr. Vijay also investigates about Gayathri's husband's death and the snake charmer's death, and he comes with information that the snake charmer's death and Gayathri's husband's death had nothing to do with Chandramukhi. Dr. Vijay reveals that Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara is still alive when he printed out an astrological profile of his and when the Acharya told Dr. Vijay that this person can still be alive. So Dr. Vijay goes to the Fort/Cage where the crumpled Raja is, and at the time, the Acharya performs a pooja to try to bring Chandramukhi out of Gayathri's body. The Doctor luckily escapes from the invincible Raja, and when the Acharya asks for Gayathri's name, she says her name as Chandramukhi Gayathri but is revealed that she is still mad, but not affected by Chandramukhi. Dr. Vijay comes back to cure Gayathri of her madness, and he succeeds, but the problem of Chandramukhi is not finished yet, and he knows who is affected by Nagavalli. Later the Doctor reveals to everyone that Gowri is affected by Chandramukhi as he makes her angry and change personality from Gowri to Chandramukhi in front of everyone, then she swoons after she returns to her normal position. Then later, he explains to everyone that Gowri had written both the names while she signed the ledger: Gowri in English when she was borrowing the book, Chandramukhi in Tamil when she was returning the book, and that it was also her who scared the bridegroom away on the Engagement day and sat downstairs like as if she did not know anything. In order to know more about Chandramukhi's lover Gunashekharan, she went to Chandramukhi's house as Gowri, and returned with Chandramukhi's photo, completely as Chandramukhi.  Afterwards, Gowri goes to the cage/fort where Nagabhairava Rajshekhara is, to kill him. Dr. Vijay, knowing Gowri would have definitely sought revenge goes to the cage/fort where the Raja almost gets burnt to death, but he survives when it starts to rain, then Dr. Vijay has a battle with him, and the Raja almosts decapitates Gowri/Chandramukhi, but before he does so, a bolt of lightning strikes the sword and it reduces the Raja to ashes, and it is the end of Raja Sri Sri Sri Nagabhairava Rajshekhara's story. Gowri is no more affected by Chandramukhi anymore and is going to marry the bridegroom she scared away, and Geetha is going to marry too and it all comes to a happy ending.

Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang
  On a farm during [[World War II]], while her husband is away at war, Isabel Green is driven to her wits end by her hectic life. Between trying to keep the family farm up and running and her job in the village shop, run by the slightly mad Mrs. Docherty, she also has three boisterous children to look after, Norman, Megsie, and Vincent. When her children's two wealthy cousins, Cyril and Celia, also then come to live with them, Isabel requires childcare help.  When the magical Nanny McPhee arrives, the children at first do not listen and carry on fighting, which she soon puts a stop to. Meanwhile, Isabel's brother-in-law, Phil, has gambled away his half of the farm, and is being chased by two hired female assassins working for casino owner Mrs. Biggles. He desperately attempts to make Isabel sell her half of the farm, using mean and spiteful schemes to leave her no choice. Isabel takes the children on a picnic during which an [[Air Raid Precautions#Wardens|ARP Warden]], Mr. Docherty, warns them about bombs and how he imagines a pilot might accidentally release his bomb. At the end of the picnic, Uncle Phil delivers a telegram saying Isabel's husband has been [[killed in action]]. Isabel and everyone else believes the telegram, but Norman says that he can "feel it in his bones" that his father is not dead. He tells this to Cyril, who at first says it is just because he is upset, but then agrees that Norman might be right, so the two boys ask Nanny McPhee to take them to the War Office in London, where Cyril and Celia's father works.  There, Nanny McPhee and the boys ask Cyril and Celia's father Lord Gray, who is very important in the War Office, what has happened to Mr. Green. At first Lord Gray sneers at Norman's disbelief at his father's death, but after Cyril blurts out that he knows his parents are getting a divorce, Lord Gray checks what has happened. While he is gone, Cyril tells Norman that he and Celia have been sent away because their parents will be splitting up, and Norman asks where Cyril and Celia will live. When Cyril replies "with Mum, I suppose, not that it makes much difference, she only ever really sees us when she wants to show us off", Norman tells Cyril that he and Celia are welcome to live on the farm with the Greens. Lord Gray returns and tells Norman that his father is not dead, but is [[missing in action]], and that there is no record of a telegram being sent to his mother. After the boys leave, Norman deduces that Uncle Phil forged the telegram.  While the boys were at the War Office, Megsie, Celia and Vincent were trying to stop Isabel from signing the papers and selling the farm. Just as Isabel is about to sign the papers, a German pilot accidentally drops a huge bomb; it shakes everything but does not explode and is left sticking out of the barley field. When Nanny McPhee returns with Norman and Cyril, Norman accuses Phil of forgery, which he admits to, and Isabel handcuffs him to the stove. The children go out to watch Mr. Docherty dismantle the bomb, but he falls from the ladder. Megsie takes over, and succeeds with the help of the other children and Nanny McPhee's jackdaw, Mr. Edelweiss. After Nanny McPhee helps to harvest the barley with a little magic, saving Phil from Mrs. Biggles hitwomen in the process, it is revealed that old Mrs. Docherty is in fact baby Agatha from the first film and that Nanny McPhee has been staying with her. As Nanny McPhee walks away from the now happy family, the children and Isabel chase after her, only to see Mr. Green, in army uniform with an injured arm, making his way to them. He runs to his family and they embrace.

John relays the details of the encounter to his brother who enlists the help of his fellow gang members to track down and assault Canta as punishment.  Once John begins secondary school, apart from not being in the top class, everything goes well. Informed by the headmaster that he will be moved up to the appropriate level by Christmas time by proving he is different to his brother, who assaulted two teachers and was expelled, he successfully progresses. However, he finds himself socially isolated and his teacher advises him to attend a summer camp for children with disabilities. There, he becomes friendly with a middle class boy called Julian. One day he accidentally breaks one of Julian's father's [[LP record]]s and is forbidden from seeing Julian again.  While walking home, a group of Young Car-D gang members threaten to mug him until they realize whose brother he is. They stop harassing him, ask him to join them and offer John vodka and cigarettes which he accepts, marking the start of his downward spiral.  When the school year recommences, John has changed his ways for the worse: drawing [[graffiti]] on desks, being impolite to teachers and smoking cigarettes in the toilets at break time. At one point he is caught up in a fight between two gangs and obtains a knife which has been kicked under the door of the toilet cubicle in which he is hiding.  In revenge for the rejection by Julian's family, John throws a pair of football boots full of fireworks through the dining room window while they are eating. He then visits a social club, where members of the Car-D gang eject two members of rival gang The Krew. Returning, they hurl a bicycle through the function room window, urging the Car-D to give chase up to the edge of their territory where they escape via a walkway. John gives chase, running into an ambush and is in turn chased by The Krew and pursued by their leader. Escaping by pushing his way into an Irish woman's home, John evades the rival gang. It emerges later that she is the mother of the boy who hurled the bicycle.  John becomes more deeply involved in gang feuds taking place between 1972 and 1974.

He robs a bus driver at knife point to raise the money, but fails to pay the sum in time.  On a walk with Claire, one of the girls from the gang, John spots his one-time tormentor Canta, now an isolated and slightly pathetic character. John confronts him about the bullying incident years earlier, and agrees to move past it, but Canta makes a snide remark as he turns away. Enraged, John first knocks him to the floor, then drops a stone slab on his head, causing permanent brain damage.  John becomes increasingly confrontational, throwing a glass bottle at a passing police officer, as he hangs out with the Young Car-D in a park, which results in them ostracizing him for attracting police attention.  His father is drunkenly abusive to his mother so John later beats him about the head with a frying pan. His mother orders John out of the house and he is forced to take refuge in the machine room in a block of high rise flats, living on deliveries of bread and  milk stolen from tenants. Returning to his refuge he finds the room locked and, after [[Intoxicative inhalant|sniffing glue]], wanders the streets, stripped to the waist. Seeing a statue of Jesus, who John jokingly urges to come down, he has a glue-fuelled vision that Christ accepts the offer but then challenges him on his poor life choices.  The next morning, his sober dad finds John and tells him to come home. His father asks him to put him out of his misery and end his life. John goes to his room, taking two knives which he tightly straps to both hands. He goes downstairs and finds his father urinating in a bottle. He asks John to wait until he is asleep, so John wanders the streets. When he encounters members of the rival gang, he attacks one, leaving him grievously injured. Pursued by the other gang members, John is himself badly beaten. Members of Young Car-D then spot John and fight off his attackers, only to have the enraged John turn on them. Injured, he returns home to the room where his father is asleep but is unable to go through with killing him. Falling asleep, he collapses on top of him.  He chooses to change his ways and returns to school, attending a remedial class, wanting no further involvement with the gang. The class goes on a field trip to a [[safari park]] and their minibus breaks down. Thinking the teachers have abandoned him with the brain-damaged Brown (Canta), John decides to leave the van. The film closes with John and Brown walking hand-in-hand into the distance through a pride of lions, who ignore them.  
Needle (2010 film)
  Ten years ago, a man on a phone call is killed gruesomely by someone after the person at the other end of the line accused him of stealing an important archaeological artifact. A woman and a child, presumed to be the murdered man's family comes rushing in to his aid.  Present time, at St. Mary's College, Ben Rutherford (Michael Dorman), a college student, inherits a strange looking mechanical box called ''Le Vaudou Mort'' from his father, who had died two years earlier. That night, he decides to show the box to his best friend Ryan (Nathaniel Buzolic), a girl, Mary (Tahyna Tozzi), who has romantic feelings for Ben, lesbian couple Kandi (Jessica Marais) and Isabel (Trilby Glover) and two other friends Nelson, a school paper photographer (Luke Carroll) and Jed (Khan Chittenden).   Before leaving, Nelson takes a group photo. Morning comes and Nelson wants to photograph the mechanical box to advertise it, thinking it must be worth a great fortune. Ben reluctantly agrees but to his dismay, the box has gone missing. Ben asks Mary if she "borrowed" it (because they were the last two to see the box), but Mary denies his allegations. Nelson and Ryan decide to ask their Archaeology professor, Professor Banyon (Jane Badler), about the box. She reveals that it was used as a theatre prop and nothing else, but will alert them if she has any information. That night, during a run through school, an unknown person is seen cutting out Ryan's face from the picture Nelson took and then inserting it into the ''Le Vaudou Mort'' indicating that it was actually stolen by someone.   Suddenly, the lights around the school start exploding, frightening Ryan, who runs out of the school into the woods. The unknown person then pulled out a wax figure from the ''Le Vaudou Mort'' resembling Ryan and started slashing the figure with heated up needles. Ryan, in reality started to bleed to death when gushes appeared on his body. When the police found his body the next day, Ben's brother Marcus (Travis Fimmel), (who he is not in good terms with because Ben blamed him for their father's death two years ago due to a car crash after their misunderstanding), was the crime scene photographer and immediately recognized Ryan. He went to tell Ben about it. The next night, Nelson, who was still affected by Ryan's death, went wall climbing. The unknown person then cut Nelson's face from the photo and inserted it in the ''Le Vaudou Mort''. Nelson's wax figure came out and the unknown person started to rip out the limbs. In reality, Nelson was killed when he was dismembered gruesomely. Ben found out about Nelson. Mary and Kandi decided to have a wake in Isabel's house for their friends. Before Ben went, he was called by Professor Banyon and was introduced to another Archaeology expert Dr. Halmanay (Igor Sas) and told him that the ''Le Vaudou Mort'' was in fact a revenge apparatus. On the wake, Kandi was having a breakdown so they decided to leave. Suddenly, Professor Banyon called Ben saying it was urgent and he needed to go. Marcus and Ben went to discover more about the ''Le Vaudou Mort''. Kandi decided to pick up some drinks and drop Mary home and Jed went to the game house. Alone at the house, Isabel went to swim when the unknown person decided to victimize her next, doing the exact thing as with the others. The killer then stabbed needles in the figure's eyes, killing Isabel in reality. Marcus and Ben went to Professor Banyon's office only to find her dead with her head beaten severely. Having finished their research, they found out that their father, Samuel Rutherford (James Hagan) stole the ''Le Vaudou Mort'' from his friend Robert Shaw (Michael Loney) ten years ago. The two brothers then concluded that whoever the person doing the killing was, wanted revenge on their father, thus passing the revenge in his sons and their friends. They headed back to Isabel's house to warn their friends only to find her body. Kandi, who was driving back home and seemingly was able to drop off Mary, came upon Jed. She decided to give him a ride too. Marcus and Ben went to their old neighborhood as they found out it was where Robert Shaw died. Ben decided to stay outside as Marcus went in with his photographer issued hand gun. He found the ''Le Vaudou Mort'' and was rendered unconscious by someone. Outside, Mary's mother called Ben's cell phone informing him that Mary has not yet reached home. After the conversation, Ben spotted Kandi's car and found Jed's body with a slit on his mouth ear to ear. Ben went inside to warn Marcus only to be knocked out by Kandi, who was in fact the killer.  Kandi, who was actually Robert Shaw's daughter, wanted revenge on Ben's family. It is revealed that the man earlier was Robert Shaw, being killed by Samuel Rutherford (Ben and Marcus' father). She explained that she wanted Ben to feel what she felt when her father died for nothing, thus killing his friends first to prolong the agony. Marcus was unconscious on the floor and Mary was held captive. Ben was held at gunpoint. Kandi then began to put Mary's picture in the ''La Vaudou Mort'' and she began to poke her wax figure. Ben was able to stop Kandi from continuing but Kandi dragged Ben outside the house and planned to slash his throat with a knife. Mary freed herself and Marcus. Mary then cut Kandi's face in the picture and began to do the wax figure. As Kandi was about to kill Ben, holes appeared in her chest implying that Mary has successfully gave Kandi a taste of her own medicine. Kandi died as flashbacks of her friends' deaths go through her head. Marcus and Mary went out to Ben's aid.  One month later, Marcus and Ben finally made up and hung around on Marcus' boat from which he inherited from his father. They decided to throw the ''Le Vaudou Mort'' into the ocean so that no one will be victimized by it again.

Never Let Me Go (2010 film)
 The film begins with on-screen captions explaining that a medical breakthrough in 1952 has permitted the human lifespan to be extended beyond 100 years. It is narrated by 28-year-old Kathy H as she reminisces about her childhood at a [[boarding school]] called Hailsham, as well as her adult life after leaving the school. The first act of the film depicts the young Kathy, along with her friends Tommy and Ruth, spending their childhood at Hailsham in 1978. The students are encouraged to create artwork, and their best work gets into ''The Gallery'' run by a mysterious woman known only as Madame. One day, a new teacher, Miss Lucy, quietly informs the students of their fate: they are destined to be [[organ donors]] and will die, or "complete", in their early adulthood. Shortly afterward she is fired by the headmistress, Miss Emily, for sharing this revelation with the children. As time passes, Kathy falls in love with Tommy, but Ruth and Tommy begin a relationship and stay together throughout the rest of their time at Hailsham.  In the second act, Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy, now teenagers, are rehoused in [[cottage]]s on a farm in 1985. They are permitted to leave the grounds on day trips, but are resigned to their eventual fate. At the farm, they meet former pupils of schools similar to theirs, and it is revealed that they are all [[Cloning|clones]]. They also hear rumours of the possibility of "deferral" – a temporary reprieve from organ donation for donors who are in love and can prove it. Tommy becomes convinced that ''The Gallery'' at Hailsham was intended to look into their [[soul]]s and that artwork sent to ''The Gallery'' will be able to confirm true love where it is present. The relationship between Tommy and Ruth becomes sexual, and jealousy causes Kathy and Ruth to break their friendship. The lonely Kathy leaves and becomes a "carer" – a clone who is given a temporary reprieve from donation as a reward for supporting and comforting donors as they are made to give up their organs. Tommy and Ruth's relationship ends.  In the third and final act, in 1994, Kathy is still working as a carer, and has watched many clones gradually die as their organs are harvested. Kathy, who has not seen Ruth or Tommy since the farm, discovers Ruth, frail after two donations. They find Tommy, who is also weakened by his donations, and drive to the sea. There, Ruth admits that she did not love Tommy, and only seduced him because she was afraid to be alone. She is consumed with guilt and has been searching for a way to help Tommy and Kathy. She believes that the rumours of "deferral" are true, and has found the address of the gallery owner, Madame, who she thinks may grant deferrals to couples in love. Ruth dies on the [[operating table]] shortly afterward.  Kathy and Tommy finally begin a relationship. Tommy explains to Kathy that he has been creating art in the hope that it will aid deferral. He and Kathy drive to visit Madame, who lives with the headmistress of Hailsham. The two teachers tell them that there is no such thing as deferral, and that Tommy's artworks will not help him. They explain that the purpose of ''The Gallery'' was not to look into their souls but to investigate whether the "all but human" clones even have souls at all; Hailsham was the last place to consider the ethical implications of the donor scheme. As they take in the news on their return journey, Tommy breaks down in an explosion of rage and frustration, and he and Kathy cling to each other in grief. The film ends with Tommy dying on the operating table. Kathy is left alone, waiting for her donations which will begin in a month. Contemplating the ruins of her childhood, she asks in [[voice-over]] whether her fate is really any different from the people who will receive her organs; after all, "we all complete".

New Kids Turbo
 Set in the small village of [[Maaskantje]] in [[North Brabant]], a group of friends: Gerrie, Richard, Rikkert, Robbie and Barrie lose their jobs. The group perceives themselves as being victims of the widely reported [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|credit crisis]], although in actuality their misfortune is the direct result of their idleness, lack of common sense, and poor punctuality. Gerrie, for instance, turns up to work late and drives the forks of his fork-lift truck into a pallet of boxed plasma screen televisions. Similarly Richard brings his old [[bulldog]] to work with him, who in turn gnaws at and breaks the shovels of Richard's supervisor, and Rikkert is sacked by his boss, a sarcastic and abusive garage owner.  Gerrie is kicked out by his mother, after she catches him trying to steal from her purse. At around the same time, Rikkert breaks up with Manuela, his girlfriend, and Barrie's house (which is also an illegal cannabis farm) catches fire. Subsequently all three take refuge in the home of Richard and Robbie. The group go shopping and rely on Richard to pay, however his bank card is declined following the refuelling of Rikkerts Opel Manta. The group travel together to the local employment and benefits office and demand more benefits from the official, who politely refuses. Richard climbs over the desk and thrusts the official against the wall, telling him to "Give us more money, 'kut'". The following morning, Richard reads a letter sent from the benefits office and informs the group that as a whole their benefits have ceased entirely. The result of which is that the group decides that they simply will no longer pay for anything and go on a spree of petty robbery, most notably from their local petrol filling station, as the group run from the forecourt each carrying two large capacity containers full of fuel, chased by the petrol station attendant, similarly the group flee the local supermarket "Lupus" each carrying large quantities of lager. Gerrie steals deep-fried croquette snacks from the local takeaway whilst Barrie acts as a diversion. Richard, Robbie and Rikkert phone a delivering Chinese takeaway, but explain they have no money to pay the delivery rider when he comes to deliver.  With their level of criminality rising, more and more letters and final demands come through Richard's letterbox, followed by a visit from a debt collector, firstly deceived by a local [[Down syndrome]] sufferer - who is duped into opening the front door by Richard and the group - who confuses the collector by uttering the words "Lorry driver", before slamming the door closed again. He is 'paid' with a slice of ham, which he is led to believe is a ten-Euro note. The collector rings the doorbell again and this time is met by Richard. He explains there are serious concerns, before Richard reiterates that they are paying for nothing anymore. The debt collector starts to explain that that is not going to work, before being promptly punched in the nose and falling to the ground. He returns shortly afterwards, flanked by the local Police chief who is additionally punched by Richard.  Their actions draw the attention of a popular Brabant-based journalist, who makes a report on group for TV Brabant. They are presented in a sympathetic light and are described as victims with no focus being placed upon the severity of their illegal actions. The report sparks a series of imitation riots in other towns and cities across The Netherlands.  In the full swing of the crisis, Gerrie takes Barrie by bus to go to an old friend of his, Peter Aerts, aka "The Lumberjack", who is now a  professional kickboxer to borrow a large sum of money. With this money he goes to a casino, where he places the entire loan on a single number at the [[Roulette]] table and wins. The entire group join him and although are unnaware of the origin of such a large amount of cash, are thrilled to have won against the odds. Gerrie however bets it all again, loses everything and promptly vanishes from the casino before the rest of the group discover what he has done. Then Rickert loses his [[Opel Manta]] as it gets picked up and towed away by the local authorities. Despite chasing it for a short distance with a small child's bicycle, the car is lost (except for a wheel that was secure to the kerbstone in an effort to prevent it from being removed.)  In response to the rising levels of [[civil unrest]] throughout the region, the Ministry of Defence in [[The Hague]] decides to wipe Maaskantje off the map in an attempt to stop the riots; however, the plan goes wrong when the neighboring town of Schijndel is accidentally bombed by mistake. The government explain the accident as a rogue Belgian missile experiencing technical problems and assures the population that the Netherlands and Belgium are not at war. When they see it, the boys know the situation is critical.  Walking back to Maaskantje they are apparently ambushed by multiple bursts of automatic weapon fire. Barrie is shot in the chest, but is apparently unharmed. The source of the gunfire is, however, Gerrie - who had met a farmer who had kept some weapons in his barn from [[World War II]]. He shows the group his cache of antique weaponry and invites them to take their pick. Whilst singing the Nazi anthem, he is accidentally shot in the head by Gerry, than Rikkert laughs and says: "more weapons per man."  Maaskantje is evacuated by the local residents, whilst the group make their way back into town, rendezvousing with their friends and colleagues. The five men team with Manuela, the owner of the local takeaway and the recently sacked local police chief. The Chinese restaurant delivery rider arrives and explains that he too wishes to help, before being one of the first casualties of the incoming troops. The troops are held back by bazooka, machine gun and rifle fire from the group and their friends.  [[File:Maaskantje - Cafetaria 't Pleintje.jpg|thumb|Cafetaria 't Pleintje in Den Dungen, often featured location in comedy sketches by the New Kids]] The takeaway owner is cornered by a sole officer and was saved by a single shot to the back of the officer's head by Gerrie. The cafetaria owner exclaims that he could not be more proud of his son. Gerrie is taken back, but accepts a hug from his long-lost father.  The situation comes to a head as Richard faces the leader of the incoming troops, flanked by Barrie, Gerrie, Rikkert, Robbie, Manuela, Gerrie's father and the local police chief. As a thrown smoke grenade clears, the commander holds Richard with a semi-automatic weapon to his head and is flanked himself by several dozen highly armes officers. He orders the group to lower their weapons, which they do, but is caught off-guard by a [[DAF Trucks|DAF]] curtainsider lorry careering through his troops. The lorry comes to a crashing halt off-screen and the curtain splits open, spilling the load of lager. The driver is revealed to be the Down syndrome sufferer.  The Local police chief re-arms himself and promptly shoots the commander in the head.  The group are subsequently arrested and charged with a laundry-list of offences. The punishment is passed at 250 hours [[Community Service]] each. Whilst the five are carrying out the community service, "The Lumberjack" returns and demands repayment. He is about to launch into an attack on the group when he is crushed by a falling set of speakers and turntable deck, accompanied by DJ [[Paul Elstak]].  The tagline of the film is 'Niemand komt aan Maaskantje!' (No one messes with Maaskantje!). In German this is 'Niemand fickt mit Maaskantje!'. (No-one fucks with Maaskantje!)

Gwen claims Krueger skipped town before he was arrested. Nancy does not believe her and attempts to track down the remaining kids from the school. She discovers that all of the other kids have been killed, most of them in their sleep.

Quentin takes Nancy to the hospital; there, he steals some [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] to help them stay awake. At the preschool, Quentin uncovers Krueger's hidden room and evidence that proves Krueger was in fact abusing all of the children; Krueger actually wants revenge on them for telling the truth.  Nancy decides the only way to end this is to pull Krueger out of their dreams and kill him in reality. Quentin tries to stay awake long enough to pull Nancy out of her dream when she has Krueger, but he falls asleep and is attacked. Krueger goes after Nancy, and explains that he intentionally left her for last so she would stay awake long enough that, when she finally fell asleep, she would no longer be able to wake up. Quentin uses the adrenaline to wake up Nancy, who pulls Krueger into reality. She uses a broken blade to cut Krueger's gloved hand off, and then slice his throat. She then torches the secret room, with Krueger's body inside, and she and Quentin leave. Nancy and her mother return home from the hospital; Krueger suddenly appears and kills Nancy's mother before pulling her body through a mirror while Nancy screams.

No Mercy (2010 film)
 Top [[forensic pathologist]] Kang Min-ho is about to retire so that he can spend time with his daughter who's just returned home after a long stint overseas. But when the dismembered corpse of a young woman, identified as Oh Eun-ah, is found at a local river, Kang agrees to do one last job. He performs a graphic autopsy on her.   The primary suspect is environmental activist Lee Sung-ho, who readily admits his guilt to rookie detective Min Seo-young, Kang's former student. Lee says that he committed the crime in order to oppose construction that would divide the river into six parts (hence the six body parts), but the police are baffled when the clues they uncover keep contradicting Lee's confession. Then Lee tells Kang that his daughter has been kidnapped. Lee lets Kang call his daughter, who hears her crying for help. Kang is forced to compromise his professional ethics and tamper with the evidence that must lead to Lee's release from custody within three days, or else Kang's daughter will be killed.  Exploring some backstory behind Lee, Min discovers that Kang was involved in another case, which was on three defendants who allegedly raped Lee's sister. Kang's tampers the evidence per money for his sick daughter, showing that the sex wasn't forced, and that the sister was promiscuous. She also learns that Oh Eun-ah was a witness. The three defendants were freed from charge, leaving Lee full of hatred towards Kang per lying at trial.   After Kang tampers with enough evidence (including completely dissecting the body of Oh Eun-ah and placing semen in it), Lee is released, and Kang follows him to his home. Min realizes the defendants are all dead and Kang will be next. After Kang viciously beats Lee about his daughter, Lee tells him her location.   When Kang, Lee, and Min arrive to the building Lee directed them to, they find his daughter dead in a pile of rose petals. Kang, devastated, tries to gather her body, but he finds that there isn't a body; only her head and limbs are in the petals. Kang collapses in shock: The dismembered body, supposedly of "Oh Eun-ah" found at the beginning of the film, which Kang also autopsied throughout the film and tampered with, was actually his daughter, while the real Oh Eun-ah was a different hostage. His daughter's cries for help that Kang heard over the phone were actually recorded by Lee prior to her death. She was dead way before the start. Kang cries in agony as flashbacks show the graphic autopsy, where he continues to dissect his daughter's corpse and tampers with it by adding semen, completely unaware at the time.  Lee taunts Kang and brags that he will live with the same pain Lee did. Min begs Kang not to kill Lee for his daughter's death, but the doctor takes out her gun and shoots him. Kang, unable to forgive himself, also shoots himself as the police arrive. The film ends with a voiceover from Lee about how easy it is to hate and how hard it is to forgive.

Arjun is married to Kajal ([[Sushmita Sen]]), the daughter of the commissioner of the police ([[Shakti Kapoor]]). Kajal has a split personality – she's a loving wife and mother, who for 10 minutes every day transforms into a terrifying troublemaker, intent on murdering her husband.  Yash and Raj try to avoid Zandulal, who does not realise that they are his neighbours. Raj falls in love with Sanjana ([[Kangana Ranaut]]), Kajal's younger sister. He pretends to be arrogant, wanting her to think that lots of girls are crazy for him. After he confesses, however, they plan on getting married. At the engagement, Zandulal encounters Yash and Raj, threatening to expose them unless they return the money they stole from his bank. Cornered, Raj and Yash agree to commit one last robbery. They rob a minister's house, minutes before Marcos arrives. The minister is tortured and killed, because Marcos cannot find the stolen diamonds.  During Sanjana's marriage with Raj, Arjun, with Kajal's father, arrest Yash, Raj and Zandulal for robbing the minister's house. They are sent to prison but Raj bribes a film director to help him escape. Marcos confronts Raj and Yash about the diamonds. He attempts to intimidate them by tying them to a train track on which a train is rushing full-speed, but this fails because the train rushes at him and his gang instead of Yash and Raj.  Because of the cancellation of Sanjana's marriage, Kajal's fits become worse. She uses guns and knives on Arjun to kill him. Kajal's father tries to get them to divorce but to no avail. Yash kidnaps Sanjana and, with Raj, wins approval from Kajal to help them against Marcos. They also kidnap one of Marcos' associates, Sofia. To intimidate Marcos further, they dress up for a festival and run away with the diamonds. The diamonds eventually get thrown into a fishtank, and the fish eat them all up.  After a hilarious climax, Sofia disappears, never to be seen again. Arjun is relocated to another town to start police-training from scratch. Marcos and his associates are all arrested and sentenced to 40 years in prison for their crimes. Yash and Raj start a fishing business to recover their lost diamonds.

Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai
 The  film opens with a suicide attempt by [[Deputy superintendent|Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP)]] Agnel Wilson ([[Randeep Hooda]]) on the pretext of the [[1993 Bombay bombings|Bombay Bombings in 1993]]. When questioned by his superior over his actions, he breaks down and claims that the recent tragic events are his own fault. Wilson recounts that 18 years ago, when he was posted as the ACP in the [[Mumbai]] crime branch, his inability to take the necessary action led to the rise of Shoaib Khan ([[Emraan Hashmi]]) a dreaded gangster, who played a central role in the bombings. Throughout the film, Wilson narrates the story of 1970s Bombay, when it was ruled by a kind hearted smuggler Sultan Mirza ([[Ajay Devgn]]), and how Mirza's eventual downfall led to Shoaib's rise to power.  After being hit by a flood in his hometown in [[Chennai|Madras]], a young Mirza arrives in Mumbai, where he lands a job as a coal shoveller. In spite of his meager earnings, the boy never fails to help the poor and needy, which soon gains their respect and admiration. Mirza is given the nickname of "Sultan."  As a grown man, Sultan Mirza becomes the kingpin of Mumbai's smuggling underworld. Through his influence, Mirza peacefully divides the city among four gangsters, thus thwarting police efforts to curb illegal activities. Despite being a criminal, Sultan Mirza is portrayed as a man of principle with a heart of gold and a godfather-like figure to the people. He even refrains from smuggling [[contraband]], as it is against his Muslim faith.  Mirza has a crush on [[Bollywood]] actress Rehana ([[Kangana Ranaut]]) and eventually the two begin dating. Sultan invests black money in her upcoming films. ACP Wilson moves to stop Rehana's films funded by Sultan. Later, Sultan and Rehana frame Wilson to make it look as if Wilson is accepting a bribe, which damages his credibility.  Meanwhile, Shoaib is even in childhood a very ambitious person with a dark and daring character. He is frequently involved in petty theft. His father, Hussain Khan ([[Asif Basra]]), who is a sub-inspector with the [[Mumbai Police|Bombay Police]], tries in vain to guide and control his son, his anger against Shoaib began years ago when Shoaib and his best friend Javed were stealing money and got caught red handed by a man, by teaching his son a lesson, Khan slaps him 5 times. Khan locks Shoaib in jail but Shoaib angers him as both Shoaib and Wilson make a deal saying that Shoaib wants to follow another path. Worried, the father turns to Sultan for help. Sultan agrees and helps the young man set up an electronics shop. But Shoaib is unsatisfied, as his only real ambition is to become rich and powerful, like Sultan Mirza who is his idol.  Shoaib's beautiful girlfriend, Mumtaz ([[Prachi Desai]]), works in a local jewellery shop, which Shoaib visits often, to the aggravation of the girl's boss. Shoaib gives her a beautiful necklace, which, unbeknownst to Mumtaz, Shoaib had stolen from a lady during a home robbery. Later, that lady comes to the shop with her husband to buy more jewellery. The lady soon recognises her own necklace being worn by Mumtaz; she then admits to the outraged customer that her boyfriend had given the item to her. The lady and her husband demand she take them to her boyfriend's shop, where they confront him. This enrages Shoaib, who beats up the husband and destroys his own shop.  Shoaib goes to Sultan and asks to be a part of his crime ring. Seeing his potential, Sultan agrees to take him under his wing. Shoaib learns the tricks of the trade and soon becomes Sultan's trusted aide. ACP Wilson hatches a plan to use Shoaib's reckless ambition for quick money and power as a way to cause the downfall of Sultan. Wilson even refrains from killing Sultan and Shoaib when he has the opportunity. Wilson's plan backfires, however. Finally, when Shoaib becomes invincible, Wilson blames himself for the subsequent catastrophe as he now cannot stop Shoaib's rise to power.  Sultan decides to hand over his power to Shoaib, and opts to enter state politics. He travels to [[Delhi]] to meet the [[Home Minister of India]]. Shoaib's unscrupulous ambitions lead him to carry out trades and acts which Sultan himself would strongly condemn and abhors. Shoaib starts manufacturing [[Moonshine|illicit liquor]], accepts [[contract killing]]s, invests in drug peddling and runs extortion rackets. When Sultan returns to Bombay, he learns of Shoaib's misdeeds and is outraged. He finds Shoaib at a party and slaps him in public for his unethical activities and states he can never really be like Sultan. This infuriates Shoaib and he plots revenge as he now knows that Sultan and he cannot possibly rule Mumbai together due to Mirza's strong principals and moral ethos. The next day, as Sultan campaigns for his new party, Shoaib appears and assassinates Sultan Mirza whilst he is addressing the people at the rally as a horrified Wilson looks on, thus ending the reign of the smuggler who was loved by his people.  In his narration, Wilson laments that he and the police are responsible for the bombings because of their lack of forethought, Wilson also says that Shoaib now rules Mumbai despite living abroad and the people are now forever at his mercy – as Mumbai's new underworld kingpin – he has since established a global smuggling empire. No government or force can reach him now.

Operation: Endgame
 The majority of the events in the film take place on 1.20.09, the date of the inauguration of [[Barack Obama]] as [[President of the United States]] and the first day of work for "The Fool", as the film's main character ([[Joe Anderson (actor)|Joe Anderson]]) is code-named. The Factory, a secret office of government agents, has hired him as a thief. After the beautiful High Priestess ([[Maggie Q]]) and the caustic Chariot ([[Rob Corddry]]) meet the Fool, they enter the secret underground offices of the Factory, and the audience learns that Neal ([[Michael Hitchcock]]), Carl ([[Tim Bagley]]), and their boss Susan ([[Beth Grant]]) have the entire office under surveillance.  The Factory is separated into two teams, Alpha and Omega. The two teams specialize in black ops and oppose each other in a bureaucratic system of checks and balances. Omega Team consists of the Fool, Chariot, High Priestess, Judgement ([[Ving Rhames]]) who repeats his name whenever he can, and the Emperor ([[Bob Odenkirk]]). Alpha Team consists of the Fool's old flame, Temperance ([[Odette Annable|Odette Yustman]]), the Empress ([[Ellen Barkin]]), Magician ([[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]]), Tower ([[Brandon T. Jackson]]), and Hierophant ([[Emilie de Ravin]]). The head of the Factory is the Devil ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]). The wildcard of the office is the Hermit ([[Zach Galifianakis]]), an extremely dangerous assassin with diabetes and occasional irritable bowel syndrome.  Not long after the Fool is introduced to everyone, Alpha and Omega find that the Devil has been murdered, and also that he has initiated Project Endgame, which has trapped both teams underground and triggered a bomb that threatens to destroy the Factory and kill everyone. The agents need to find a way out. They decide to work in pairs with their opposing mirror agents to escape.  As they explore the office, members of Alpha Team begin to kill their Omega Team counterparts in gruesome fashion, with Empress killing Emperor with a staple remover, Hierophant killing Judgement by hitting him in the head with a table leg with nails protruding out, and Tower stabbing High Priestess in the throat with a metal bookend.  Shortly after Tower is killed by Chariot who smashes his face repeatedly with a paper shredder, and then Chariot is almost killed by Magician. Back in the surveillance room, Carl, Neil, and Susan watch the carnage between the agents. But they all learn that the system has been corrupted, and Susan realizes that the clearance codes have been switched in conjunction with the inauguration.  While trying to find a way out, Fool is attacked by Hierophant but is saved by Temperance, who kills her by hitting her repeatedly in the back with the blade of a paper cutter. She reveals to him that Alpha Team was ordered to eliminate Omega Team that very day. The Fool, Chariot and Temperance face off against the remaining members of Alpha: The Empress, Magician and the mysterious Hermit. The Fool cracks a safe in the Devil's office and obtains a disc and a map to an exit. After more fighting and kills, such as Chariot setting Magician on fire, Hermit killing Chariot by throwing a pair of scissors into his eye and Temperance shooting Hermit in the crotch with her lipstick gun and then killing Empress by shoving a water cooler bottle down her throat causing her to drown, the Fool and Temperance are the only ones left standing. They both enter the exit elevator and escape. They kiss as the bomb goes off, destroying the Factory.  Meanwhile, Carl and Neil uncover an audio tape which the Devil recorded before his death. The Devil reveals that he has a disc with every dirty secret from the last eight years of the Bush administration. He also professes his love for Susan. The elevator emerges from a bathroom stall and it is revealed the Fool has killed Temperance, the paper cutter blade stuck in her head. He snaps the neck of a man in the bathroom who sees Temperance's body and takes his jacket, then he calls Susan, and tells her (in an English accent using the British pronunciation of ma'am as the American sound of "mom") that he has the disc, which contains "every single one of their fuck-ups." Susan reveals that she had hired the Fool specifically to enter the Factory and retrieve the files. She then shoots Carl and Neil. The film ends with the Fool confidently walking out of the building, stepping into a cab, and driving off and the screen turns black. In the credits, bits of a will, one recorded by Emperor and the other by Chariot, reveal that Emperor plans to leave his holiday home to his dog and give wine in his wine cellar to the widows of the men he killed, while Chariot promises that he will return as an evil ghost and will eat hearts for an eternity.<ref name="rogue"></ref>

After a battle, Bhuti decapitates Rajasena, but his severed head curses Bhuti. After meditating, Tien returns to his village to find it in ruins, and the surviving villagers kidnapped and enslaved by Bhuti. Bhuti uses his magic to summon an eclipse. When Pim reveals herself as Tien's companion, she is taken to Bhuti's palace, where she is killed. Tien witnesses this killing from a statue and fights his way through the guards before confronting Bhuti, who launches a spear at Tien's chest. As he falls to his knees, defeated, he remembers Bua's words, and finds himself again atop the statue. Overcoming Bhuti's illusion, lightning strikes and Bhuti's eclipse magic is dispelled. Bhuti attempts to escape but is confronted by Tien. Bhuti attempts again to throw a spear at Tien, who catches and throws it aside. On the royal ledge above the arena, Tien's upright finger tips hold Bhuti aloft by his chin. Suddenly an elephant's trunk butts the doors below the ledge, causing Bhuti to fall from Tien's grasp. Bhuti falls, over the elephant's tusks. The camera pans as we watch Bhuti dying on the ground, pierced by the elephant's broken tusk. As he breaths his last breath, the elephant, now resembling the one tusk [[Ganesha]], raises his head in a victorious trumpet. Beginning life anew, with good having triumphed over evil, the final scene opens as Tien, Pim and the remaining villagers, pray before the statue of Ong Bak.

Annie ([[Kavya Madhavan]]) works as a teacher in a local school and Paappi is in love with her, though Annie does not like him. It is because despite being very close friends, she was humiliated by Paappi himself, in one of their school days. Also Paappi quit schooling while at the 9th grade, leaving him an illiterate image, just like his father, in front of her. Paappi's mother Maria ([[KPAC Lalitha]]) and younger sister Mollykkutty (Manju Raghvan) also like Annie very much and wants her as Paappi's wife. But the foolishly casual lifestyle of the Nirappel men caps the ladies' wish into a mere distant dream.  In the meantime, a businessman named Manikkunju ([[Suresh Krishna (actor)|Suresh Krishna]]) comes to the village, which creates a lot of problems with the Nirappel men. Meanwhile, Annie, with support of Shashankan Muthalali ([[Ashokan (actor)|Ashokan]]), who is rather inept, yet envious about the apparent prosperity of the Nirappel family, and fellow school colleague Dasan maash (Rajeev) stands against Paappi in [[Panchayath]] election, to teach Paappi a lesson about social responsibility. Despite Paappi's best efforts, Annie wins the seat and becomes Panchayath President, leaving Paappi in a further shameful, yet a humble image in front of her.  Annie then gets a marriage proposal. Hearing this Paappi goes to Annie's house who see him jumping to catch a glimpse of the proceedings. The groom-to-be tells he expects a positive response from Annie and leaves. Later she gets a call from the groom-to-be 's mother who verbally abuses her, as her son was allegedly brutally assaulted by Paappi. Annie, furious about this, goes to Mathai's house and gives a piece of her mind. Influenced by Annie's words, Mathai starts to doubt Paappi. Paappi, outrageous about Annie's outburst, goes verbally rough to Annie during a school function and in a fit of rage shouts that he did trash her marriage proposal. In a fit of shame and rage, Mathai slaps Paappi and a crack is openly formed in their relation. Things get worse when the school run by Mathai's family is mysteriously burned down and Mathai completely disowns Paappi, thinking he is the culprit, also trying to commit patricide in the process. Shashankan, seeing this as a golden opportunity to rip apart the Nirappel family, steps in and joins side with Nirappel Mathai, apparently putting Paappi out of the good image. In a fit of revenge, Paappi tries to shut down Nirappel financial institution now in the hands of Mathai, through a word of mouth on bankruptcy. However, Mathai, who instantly sees the picture, turns the tables, by publicly lying that it was Paappi who is legally due to settle the financial deals. Unable to handle the sudden turn of events, Paappi and Kuttaappi escape from the scene. In the end, Shashankan occupies Paappi's place as Mathai's trustee, much to the shock of Paappi and Kuttaappi.  In the second half of the movie Paappi is trying to survive on his own, with Kuttaappi by his side, along with attempting to give his father Mathai a hard time. Maria and Mollykkutty still root for Paappi, much to Mathai's dismay. Paappi obtains a legal freeze on Mathai's financial deals, rendering Mathai in a financial lockdown. Finally, Mathai is forced to sell off Maria's ([[KPAC Lalitha]]) land. But Paappi, for the deep love for his mother, foils the plot by fakingly setting up the land to be of archeological value. This setup renders the land unable to be sold.  On a rainy day, Annie happens to meet Paappi outside the church. There Paappi tells Annie that he was not the one responsible for disrupting Annie's wedding proposal, and that it was nothing more than his state of agitation which led to the unpleasant events that followed. Then and there Annie begins to develop a love interest in Paappi, who has now come clean. In the meantime, Manikkunju approaches the financially depressed Mathai for an alliance on the pretext of a friendly reconciliation, but Mathai was shrewd enough to see through the plan and turns down the offer, much to Manikkunju's rising hatred towards Mathai.  The villagers are now worried that the city market once run efficiently by Paappi and Mathai together doesn't function the same anymore, and the villagers fear the market's doom if taken over by the hostile Manikkunju. Annie who had earlier taken a diary from Paappi regarding the plans he had for the [[Panchayath]] if he wins the election, uses a scheme of a [[agricultural cooperative|Farmers' Co-operative Society]] buying the market items from farmers and selling it giving the profit to the farmers. She shares this idea with Dasan maash who is also seemed to be excited about this.  The following night, a drunken duo Mathai and Shashankan, while walking on the roadside, are attacked by Manikkunju and another person with a sword. Mathai is injured while Shashankan escapes as the neighbours hear the commotion and come out. Everybody now believes that Paappi was behind the attempt. The police try to catch Paappi on the grounds of attempt to murder Mathai, as well as the act of kidnapping Annie. But the smart Paappi escapes from their clutches.

Paranormal Activity 2
   August 2006, a "burglary" occurs at the home of Kristi ([[Sprague Grayden]]) and Daniel Rey (Brian Boland). The entire house is trashed except for their infant son Hunter's bedroom. Daniel installs security cameras throughout the house after the vandalism, which capture many strange occurrences. Martine (Vivis Cortez), the Hispanic family housekeeper and nanny, goes into Hunter's room after hearing a loud bang and senses a demonic presence in his room. She takes him downstairs and attempts to cleanse the house of "[[unclean spirit|evil spirits]]", but when Daniel arrives home and catches her burning [[Salvia officinalis|sage]], Martine is fired.  Kristi believes that their home is haunted and tells Daniel. Daniel reviews the footage but dismisses her claims. Kristi talks to her sister Katie ([[Katie Featherston]]) about [[Paranormal Activity 3|being tormented by a demon when they were little girls]]. Daniel's daughter, Ali ([[Molly Ephraim]]), begins investigating the mysterious occurrences and discovers that humans can make deals with demons for wealth or power by forfeiting the soul of their first-born son. She also discovers that Hunter was the first male to be born on Kristi's side since the 1930s.   The violence quickly escalates; the family's [[German shepherd]], Abby, becomes aware of the demon's presence and is attacked. Daniel and Ali take Abby to the veterinarian, leaving Kristi alone with Hunter. When Kristi checks on the baby, the demon assaults her and drags her down to the basement, where she stays for an hour. Finally, the basement door opens and a possessed Kristi walks out. The following day, Ali is home with Kristi, who will not get out of bed. She finds the basement door covered in scratches and the word ''meus'' ([[Latin]] for "Mine"), etched into it.  Ali goes upstairs to check on Hunter and sees Kristi there, with a strange bite mark on her leg. When Ali tries to get Hunter, Kristi furiously orders her not to touch him. Now terrified, Ali begs Daniel to come home. After he arrives, she shows him the footage of Kristi's attack. He immediately calls Martine, who prepares a cross to exorcise the demon; and tells them that Kristi will have no memory of being possessed. Since the curse can only be transferred to a blood relative, Daniel tells Ali he is going to pass the demon onto Katie, so that Kristi and Hunter will be safe. Ali begs him not to because it is unfair to Katie, but Daniel sees no other way to save his wife and son.  That night, when Daniel tries to use the cross on Kristi, she attacks him, and all the house lights go out. Using the handheld camera's [[night vision]] he finds that Kristi and Hunter have disappeared. Furniture starts to topple over, and the chandeliers begin to shake. Daniel chases Kristi into the basement, where she attacks him. After he touches her with the cross she collapses and the house shakes violently. Daniel hears demonic growls and screams and finally, the shaking stops. Daniel puts Kristi to bed and burns a photo of a young Katie (the same photo [[Micah Sloat]] later finds in the attic of his and Katie's house in the [[Paranormal Activity|first film]]).  Three weeks later, Katie visits and explains that [[Paranormal Activity|strange things have started happening at her house]]. She then returns home to her boyfriend Micah. On October 9, the night after [[Paranormal Activity|Micah is killed]], a possessed Katie breaks into Daniel and Kristi's home and kills Daniel by snapping his neck while he watches TV. She then kills Kristi in Hunter's room, violently hurling her at the camera, and takes the baby. She leaves, cradling Hunter, and the screen fades to black as Hunter's crying turns into laughter.

 In 2010, during a stay in [[San Diego]], [[California]], Japanese student Haruka Yamano ([[Noriko Aoyama]]) is involved in a car accident that breaks both of her legs and cutting her trip short and she returns to her home in Tokyo, Japan. Shortly after her return, Shigeyuki (Kazuyoshi Tsumura), her father, leaves for a business trip abroad in [[Singapore]], leaving her with her 19-year-old, younger brother Koichi ([[Aoi Nakamura]]).  Haruka discovers one morning that her wheelchair has moved despite the wheels being locked. Koichi suspects it to be a paranormal force and places a mound of salt in Haruka's room, filming it without her knowledge. The next morning the salt is scattered and while reviewing the film they see the salt scatter with no visible means. Koichi begins to investigate further by filming Haruka sleep, though she disapproves and eventually insists he grow up and stop believing in supernatural nonsense until a drinking glass breaks during dinner.  Reluctantly, Haruka lets Koichi film her during the night again, this time recording the curtain beside her bed moving and the blanket being pulled from the bed. Koichi's friend Jun Nagoshi ([[Kōsuke Kujirai]]) visits the next day with his girlfriend Mai Yaguchi (Maaya Morinaga) and her friend Misuzu Kure (Ayako Yoshitani). Misuzu remarks feeling a strange presence at the Yamanos' house and Koichi asks if she can investigate the demon haunting Haruka. After examining Haruka's room, Misuzu claims she has never felt a presence like this before and suddenly plugs her ears, screaming and foaming at the mouth, and quickly leaves. Through the internet Koichi finds and contacts a Shinto priest to perform a purification ceremony. That night while doing homework Koichi is alerted to the presence of someone in the house, on the first floor. He goes to investigate and finds ceiling lamps flickering and very loud music blaring from the radio in the living room.  The Shinto priest arrives to their house to perform the purification ceremony. The priest tells them the presence has likely settled down and assures the two that they have nothing to fear. The following nights progresses with no incidents. After a couple of days, Shigeyuki returns home from his business trip. On night 12, Haruka's wheelchair moves towards the camera and cuts it off. Haruka and Koichi review the footage and realize that the presence has not gone. Koichi tries contacting the Shinto priest but is told the priest died of a heart attack after leaving them. The next night, the events worsen when Haruka is violently dragged out of bed by her hair by a force she believes to be under her bed. The two siblings consider leaving the house. Haruka tries to contact Shigeyuki but he is not answering his cellphone.  Haruka then recalls Katie, a woman involved in the same car accident that cut her trip short, and after searching her name on the Internet, believes that the demon that had possessed her is now targeting Haruka. She reveals to Koichi that she experienced similar strange phenomena while recuperating in the hospital in America. Haruka tells Koichi to escape without her if the demon attacks them both. In the night, he hears her screaming and finds her in the yard in her wheelchair. Haruka claims that the demon is tormenting her from behind and reveals a strange bite mark on her arm before losing consciousness. Koichi watches Haruka for the rest of the night and, in the morning, places a crucifix in her hand. After he leaves the room, Haruka drops the crucifix and it moves along the floor before combusting and several windows break spontaneously in the room. Meanwhile, Haruka remains asleep throughout the commotion. Koichi brings her breakfast upstairs and upon discovering the scorched crucifix and broken glass everywhere, breaks down in tears as Haruka sleeps on.  On night 15, Haruka wakes up at 1 AM, stumbles to Koichi's room, and stands by his bedside staring at him for two hours while he is asleep. Around 3 AM, she walks downstairs and wakes Koichi with a scream. Alarmed, Koichi runs to the living room where he discovers Shigeyuki's corpse in one of the closets. A possessed Haruka appears and knocks the camera from his hand and then violently throws Koichi at the camera in his room and slowly approaches. Koichi escapes and boards a taxi outside of his house. As the taxi drives away, Haruka suddenly appears in front of it and it strikes into her before slamming into a wall. The crash kills the driver while Koichi survives. The screen fades to black.  Later, Koichi goes to a funeral home to pay his respects to his sister who is believed to have died in the crash. When Koichi removes the sheet he is shocked to see that it is in fact not the body of his sister, but the taxi driver instead. Koichi is suddenly dragged into the darkness screaming and the camera cuts to black for about 15 seconds. When the camera begins running again, Haruka is seen staring at it with a demonic grin, the demon sound from the original Paranormal Activity is heard as the scene cuts out.  An epilogue text states that Koichi was found dead, Shigeyuki's body was discovered in the house later and Haruka's whereabouts remain unknown. Some versions don't have the text in the end.

His [[alter ego]] is a woman, Emma, who each morning does his chores and cooks him breakfast before he starts the day. One day while he is using the outside yard clothesline as Emma, a [[freight train]] [[caboose]] derails and crashes into John's backyard. When his neighbors come to the scene, "Emma" enters his house, putting John's other life into the spotlight, so he is forced to tell his neighbors that Emma is his wife, married in secrecy. Forced to fool the town into believing he and his alter ego are man and wife, John and Emma must maintain their secret while in public view.  The town mayor, Ray Crill ([[Keith Carradine]]), and his wife Fanny ([[Susan Sarandon]]) come to see John to try to host a political rally in his backyard in support of the incumbent candidate for the federal elections for senator. John is unwilling to do so, but Emma agrees. Fanny runs a women's shelter in the small town of 800, and convinces Emma to hold the rally in order to raise funds for her organization. She agrees, but the next day, John has a mental breakdown at work when he meets the Crills. John is afraid, under the mayor's stipulation, that the two be present for the ceremony, presenting obvious problems that would reveal his identity. He phones the railway company to have it removed immediately, in order to avoid the confrontation.  One night, a young mother, Maggie ([[Ellen Page]]) appears at John's house, looking for him. She has been receiving checks from John's mother, who died a year ago, to support her and her two-year-old son's living. She wants to move out of the town with her son Jake (Flynn Milligan) in order to seek new opportunities, but is unable to procure the funds to do so. She comes to John's house to ask for money, but he just goes upstairs and becomes Emma. Not knowing Emma, Maggie feels bad, and Emma drives her home, to her trailer. There, it is revealed that Jake is, in fact, Jake Skillpa, the son of John and Maggie. Emma suggests that Maggie move into Fanny's women shelter, but she refuses, citing that the women there are "unambitious."  John then visits Maggie at the shelter, agreeing to give her a ride to [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], as well as just over $1000, his savings at the bank. Emma offers Maggie a job at the bank, in an attempt to keep Maggie in Peacock. John asks Maggie to meet him at the local motel at 11pm that night to collect the money. Emma seduces a man at the bar that night, and leads him to the motel room that John had arranged. She beats the man unconscious, lays him on the bed, and sets the motel on fire as Maggie comes to meet John. Emma, long gone, gets to feign the "death" of her "husband."  When the rally takes place, Emma shuts herself in her home, ignoring the attendees. She gives the money to Maggie, telling her to leave because it is not safe here in Peacock, as well as trying to prevent the abuse that she herself had endured. The film ends with Maggie holding Jake over her shoulder as they walk down the porch steps, with Jake waving a childhood toy of John's that Emma had given him and Emma barring herself in her home.  
Peepli Live
 Natha Das ManikPuri ([[Omkar Das Manikpuri]]), better known as Natha, is a poor farmer from the village of Peepli in "Mukhya Pradesh", who struggles to farm enough money for his family made up of his elder brother, Budhia Das Manikpuri ([[Raghubir Yadav]]), his wife, Dhaniya (Shalini Vatsa) and his ailing mother, Amma (Farookh Zafar), who spends most of her time lying down and screaming at Natha and Dhaniya. Natha and Budhia often pretend to go out farming when actually they save up whatever money they have to buy alcohol. This has left the whole family famished and now the banks are demanding repayment of loans or else the family will be stripped off their land and house. In the meantime, the Mukhya Pradesh Government have called a by-election due to continuous criticism of their blind eye towards the desperate poverty that surrounds India's largest state. The opposition [[Apna Dal]] Party believe they have a chance to form the government in this election as the people have lost faith in the long-serving Sammaan Party and its Chief Minister, Ram Babu Yadav (Jugal Kishore) who, along with Federal Agriculture Minister, Saleem Kidwai ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]), believes in the industrialisation of rural areas.  To save his land and to save his family from becoming homeless, Natha, encouraged by his brother, decides to commit suicide after he attends a session with the rural headmen for help and they suggest him that committing suicide is a good way to get money waived, after which his family will receive heavy compensation for his death. While Natha and his brother are discussing the same at a local tea stall, this news gets reported by Rakesh, a local reporter from Peepli. This report then gets picked up and highlighted by the national English news channels and reaches the Chief Minister. The media starts surrounding Peepli sensing the possibility of a sensational suicide story. One ITVN journalist particularly keen on filming the event of Natha's death is Daytime Presenter, Nandita Malik ([[Malaika Shenoy]]). She joins the local reporter Rakesh Kapoor ([[Nawazuddin Siddiqui]]) and takes desperate measures to interview Natha and his family on the subject of Natha's suicide. However things get more tricky when rival Hindi news channel, "Bharat Live" finds out about Natha and Peepli. The news channel clashes with ITVN and each try to film Natha's death in their own manner. The Sammaan Party also soon discover Natha's plans and try to buy off Natha with sops to prevent him from committing suicide. Opposition parties like the Apna Dal and the [[Communist Party of India|CPI]] also get involved and plan to use Natha as a path to power in the elections. Peepli soon becomes the centre of attention across Mukhya Pradesh.  Nandita's frantic attempts to interview Natha get worse when Rakesh does not find Natha or anyone else in Peepli to interview. She seems unimpressed with Rakesh's compassionate stand towards Natha and believes that as reporters their duty lies in reporting and following the news and nothing else. On the other hand, "Bharat Live" continues to be successful in their attempts to interview. Yet as time goes on, Natha does not die. Meanwhile, the Sammaan Party realise that if Natha commits suicide, they will lose the elections. The rural headmen secretly kidnap Natha and hold to ransom for money from the opposition. Yet their plans are foiled when Rakesh discovers Deepak and his men holding Natha hostage at a Peepli barn. A rush occurs when people from Apna Dal, the CPI, ITVN, Bharat Live and Peepli villagers all rush to find Natha. In the confusion, a spillage accident from a [[Petromax]] lamp sets fire to the barn, which explodes and Rakesh is killed. The Government officials mistake Rakesh for Natha and refuse to pay Natha's family the compensation money due to the death being an accident. Meanwhile, Natha is in fact alive and flees to [[Gurgaon]] and is seen working as a daily labourer in the construction industry.  His family loses their land to the bank.

Percy is a 16-year-old boy who appears to his peers to be [[dyslexia|dyslexic]] and has a unique ability to stay underwater for a long time. While on a school [[field trip]] to the local [[museum]], Percy is attacked by [[Alecto]], a [[Erinyes|Fury]] disguised as his substitute English teacher, Mrs. Dodds who demands the lightning bolt. Percy's best friend, [[List of Camp Half-Blood characters#Grover Underwood|Grover Underwood]], and his Latin teacher, Mr. Brunner&mdash; both of whom appear disabled&mdash; help Percy and scare off Alecto. Upon learning of Alecto's reason for the attack, Mr. Brunner gives Percy a [[pen]], claiming that it is a powerful weapon, and tells Grover to take Percy and his mother, Sally, to Camp Half-Blood, leaving behind Sally's abusive husband, Gabe Ugliano. However, upon arriving at the camp, the three are attacked by the [[Minotaur]], who appears to kill Sally, who is unable to enter the camp. Grover tells Percy to use the pen that he received from Brunner, and Percy discovers it is a [[sword]]. He uses his sword to fight the Minotaur, without initial success. Percy kills the Minotaur with his own horn, then faints from shock.  Three days later, Percy wakes up in the camp. He learns he is the son of Poseidon, Grover is a disguised [[Satyr]] and his junior protector and Mr. Brunner is the Centaur, [[Chiron]], also initially disguised. Chiron suggests that Percy go to Mount Olympus to convince Zeus of his innocence. Percy begins training to use his demigod powers, which include water manipulation and using water to heal. He also meets other demigods, including [[List of Camp Half-Blood characters#Annabeth Chase|Annabeth Chase]], daughter of [[Athena]]; and Camp Leader, [[List of Camp Half-Blood characters#Luke Castellan|Luke Castellan]], son of [[Hermes]]. Percy is visited by a fiery apparition of his uncle [[Hades]], who reveals that Sally is with him in the [[Underworld]] and that he will return her safely if Percy hands over the lightning bolt. Defying Chiron's orders, Percy decides to go to the Underworld believing if he can convince Hades of his innocence, Hades will release his mother, joined by Grover and Annabeth. They visit Luke, who gives them a map showing the location of three green [[pearl]]s belonging to Hades' wife, [[Persephone]], which they can use to escape the Underworld by stepping on them. They are also given a pair of winged [[sneakers]] which Luke stole from his father, and a [[shield]], which Luke describes as his favorite.  The trio heads out, and starts by searching for the first pearl at an old [[garden center]], before they suddenly encounter [[Medusa]], who tries to kill them until she is [[decapitated]] by Percy; they take her head with them for later use, along with locating the pearl on a [[bracelet]] she has been wearing on her wrist. They locate the second pearl in the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon in Nashville]]; Percy uses the winged shoes to take it from a statue of Athena. However, they are then confronted by the [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], which Grover turns to stone using Medusa's head. The last pearl is located at the Lotus [[Casino]] in [[Las Vegas]], where the three eat [[lotus flowers]], which make them forget their reason for being there. They stay in the casino for five days until Poseidon abruptly speaks in Percy's mind, helping Percy return to his senses. Percy frees Grover and Annabeth from the effects of the flowers, and they flee, discovering that the casino is run by the [[Lotus-Eaters]], and they have been keeping people captive since ancient times, which explains the casino's motto, "You will never want to leave." With all three pearls, Percy, Grover, and Annabeth head into the Underworld, the portal to which is located behind the [[Hollywood Sign]].  In the Underworld, they meet Hades and Persephone. Though Percy tells Hades that he does not have the lightning bolt, Hades finds it hidden inside Luke's shield, revealing that Luke is the lightning thief. Persephone suddenly knocks Hades [[unconsciousness|unconscious]] by [[taser|tasing]] him with the lightning bolt to get her revenge on him for imprisoning her for all eternity and hands the bolt to Percy. However, because they only have three pearls, Grover remains with Persephone to allow Percy's mother to leave. Percy, Annabeth, and Sally teleport to the Empire State Building, but are attacked by Luke, who reveals that the reason for him stealing the bolt is that he wants to destroy Mount Olympus to secure the demigods' place as the new rulers of Western Civilization. After a fight across Manhattan, Percy defeats and apparently kills Luke and returns the lightning bolt to Zeus, who forgives Percy and allows Poseidon to briefly speak with his son. The film ends with Percy and Annabeth reuniting with Grover, furloughed from the Underworld and sporting a new pair of small horns that designate his promotion to Percy's senior protector. Percy and Annabeth are reunited, and they nearly kiss but Annabeth tricks Percy and they continue to train.  In the [[post-credits scene]], Ugliano is kicked out of the [[apartment]] by Sally. He decides to get a [[beer]] on his way out, but finds a note from Percy saying that he should not open the [[refrigerator]] under any circumstance. He breaks the lock anyway and is turned to stone and killed by Medusa's head inside, on a serving plate. One of her snakes blurs the screen, revealing the movie's end. The sound of Ugliano turning to stone is heard while the screen is black.

When the [[radio news]] makes an announcement about John, he angrily shushes Warwick, revealing himself.

Suddenly, John keels over; the wine has been drugged, and Warwick is not the person he seems to be.  When John bounces back, he finds himself tied to a chair, and the party is in full swing—but all the guests Warwick is interacting with are figments of Warwick's imagination.

[[Los Angeles Police Department|L.A.P.D.]] [[Detective]] Morton ([[Nathaniel Parker]]) arrives at Warwick's door – Warwick is actually a police lieutenant, who is working on John's robbery.

Meanwhile, John becomes suspicious of girlfriend Simone and discovers she made alternative travel arrangements out of Los Angeles that don't include him. Warwick and Detective Morton join another detective who are watching Simone's apartment. John locates Simone in a parking garage, taking her switch car and the money, leaving her to be captured by the detectives. Warwick stops John from leaving and blackmails him for the money, leaving him about $20,000 to get past the Mexican border, for which John says thank you.

Julie, Danni, Laura and Zane start crossing the rope, but the piranhas latch onto Danni's hair, causing her to lose her grip on the rope and fall into the water, where she is quickly devoured. The others make it across safely, but the rope comes loose. Using Derrick's corpse as a distraction, Jake ties the line to himself and goes to save Kelly. He ties Kelly to him and lights a flare after releasing the gas from a pair of stored propane tanks. Novak starts the boat and speeds away just as the piranhas surround Kelly and Jake. They are dragged to safety as the [[propane]] tanks explode, destroying the boat and killing most of the piranhas.  Mr. Goodman calls Julie on the radio, and Julie tells him that they seem to have killed the majority of the piranhas. A horrified Goodman tells her that the reproductive glands on the piranha they obtained were not mature, which means that the fish they have killed were only the babies. As Novak wonders aloud where the parents are, the human sized-piranha queen leaps out of the water and eats him.  
Pixels (2010 film)
 On a Brooklyn sidewalk, a man walks over to a trash can, leaves a [[Television set|1980s-era television]] by it, and walks away. After a few seconds, the TV suddenly powers on and an [[8-bit]] picture of a bomb appears. When its fuse runs out, the TV screen shatters, releasing a cloud of [[pixel|pixels]] (illustrated as [[voxel|voxels]] because of the three-dimensionality of the scene). The pixels fly over to [[Manhattan]], where it releases various characters from 1980s arcade video games.  [[Space Invaders]] start to shoot downwards; on contact, the projectiles cause a delivery truck and two taxis to degenerate into pixels.   A cloud of pixels then flies down a subway station, eventually forming into [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], which eats subway trains and stations as it travels the tunnels. Its progress is shown on the subway status display, similar to the cleared-away dots on the original game screen.   Giant [[Tetris]] tiles then match up with floors of skyscrapers.

She tries to assuage her guilt through volunteer jobs (which leave her weeping) and donations to homeless individuals (which sometimes backfire).  
Poetry (film)
 The movie opens on a river scene with children playing on the bank. The body of a girl in a school uniform floats by.  Yang Mi-ja ([[Yoon Jeong-hee]]), a 66-year-old grandmother, consults a doctor at a hospital who is concerned about her forgetfulness, referring her to a specialist. As she leaves the hospital she sees a woman crazy with grief because her 16-year-old daughter has drowned.  Though Mi-ja lives on government welfare, she has a small job taking care of a well-to-do elderly man who has had a stroke. At home, she cares for her ill-mannered 16-year-old grandson, Jong-wook ([[Lee David]]), whose divorced mother lives in [[Busan]]. When Mi-ja asks Wook about the girl from his class who drowned, Wook insists that he doesn't know her.  When Mi-ja notices a poster advertising a poetry class at a local community center, she decides to enroll. The course assignment is to write one poem by the end of the month-long course. At the suggestion of her teacher, she begins writing notes about the things she sees, especially flowers.  Wook frequently leaves home at odd hours to socialize with five other boys from school. One night, he invites all of them over without notifying Mi-ja, who nevertheless tries to be a gracious host, offering them a snack before they disappear into Wook's bedroom. Later, one of the boys' fathers insists that Mi-ja join him and the other boys' fathers for a meeting. She is told that the group of boys have repeatedly [[rape]]d a girl, Agnes, over the past six months, before she jumped off a bridge into a river and drowned. Her diary was discovered, though only four members of the school's faculty are aware of the situation. The fathers fear retribution for their boys, and the school fears a scandal that will tarnish its reputation. In order to avert a full police investigation, the parents of the boys offer to pay a settlement of 30 million [[South Korean won|won]] to the widowed mother, a poor farmer. Mi-ja, who cannot afford her 5 million won portion of the payment, is pressured to ask her daughter (Wook's mother) for the money. Though Mi-ja occasionally speaks to her daughter on the phone, she does not mention the situation. When Mi-ja is diagnosed with early stage [[Alzheimer's disease]], she again neglects to tell anyone. She attempts to confront Wook about his actions, but he simply ignores her.  Mi-ja begins attending a local weekly poetry reading. A brash man frequently reads beautiful poetry at these readings, but follows them with crude sexual jokes that offend Mi-ja. Another amateur poet explains to Mi-ja that the man is a policeman with a good heart, and was recently reassigned from Seoul after exposing corruption within its police force.  Mi-ja temporarily quits her job caring for the elderly stroke victim after he makes a desperate sexual advance toward her. She later returns after a journey to the bridge where Agnes jumped, and her hat flies off into the water. She walks down to the riverbank and sits, writing poetry until it begins raining. Dripping wet, she returns to elderly man, agreeing to have sex with him. When she does, she appears emotionless.  In another meeting with the fathers, Mi-ja is elected to travel to the countryside to convince Agnes' mother to accept the settlement. Initially not finding her at home, Mi-ja eventually comes across her working in the field. Mi-ja begins raving about how beautiful the weather, flowers, trees, and fruit are, forgetting about the task at hand. The two have a pleasant exchange before Mi-ja turns and begins to walk away. Finally, she remembers that she was meant to confront the woman about the settlement, but is too embarrassed and continues to leave.  A few days later, Mi-ja returns to the fathers to admit that she still cannot pay her portion of the settlement. Though annoyed that she still hasn't contributed her sum, the fathers are overjoyed that Agnes' mother has agreed to settle, despite Mi-ja's failure to confront her.  Mi-ja asks the elderly man for the money she needs, refusing to tell him what it is for. Wondering if this is Mi-ja's attempt at extortion, he pays her. Once the settlement has been paid to Agnes' mother, Mi-ja phones her daughter to come home, and insists that Wook shower and cut his nails. That night, the crude policeman from the weekly poetry readings appears with his partner to take Wook away. Mi-ja does not protest.  The film concludes with Mi-ja's poetry teacher discovering a bouquet of flowers on the class podium with her poem, "Agnes's Song", but Mi-ja herself is not present. Her daughter returns to an empty home, and calls Mi-ja's phone, but receives no answer. The teacher begins to read Mi-ja's poem to the class. Mi-ja speaks in [[voiceover]], though the voice of Agnes herself takes over midway through, following Agnes from the science lab, where she was raped, to the bus, to the bridge where she is to jump. Agnes turns to the camera, half-smiling, leaving Mi-ja's fate on an ambiguous note.

 Samuel Pierret, a [[nurse's aide]] accompanies his pregnant wife Nadia ([[Elena Anaya]])  to her [[medical ultrasonography|sonogram]] appointment where she is told that she must stay on her back for six weeks to avoid life-threatening complications. Meanwhile, Hugo Sartet, a safecracker and hired thief, is running from two hitmen. During the chase, he is hit by a motorcycle and rushed to the hospital where Samuel works. Shortly after, Samuel sees a man leave Hugo's bedside and arrives just in time to reinsert Hugo's respirator which had been unplugged. This prompts the police to set up a protection detail under the command of Captain Catherine Fabre. While discussing the assassination attempt, another captain, Patrick Werner, arranges to have jurisdiction of the case transferred to him, saying that he has been after Sartet for years.  When Samuel returns home that day, he and Nadia are attacked and she is abducted.  Samuel gets a phone call saying that he must help Hugo Sartet escape from the hospital if he wants to see his wife again. At the hospital, the cop guarding Hugo's bed refuses to leave but Samuel is able to subdue him with a [[defibrillator]]. Samuel then wakes up Hugo with a shot of adrenaline and guides him outside while holding the cop's gun. When Nadia's captors call again, they are revealed to be Hugo's brother Luc working with a man named Marconi. The brothers arrange to set up the hostage trade at a nearby railway station but when Samuel and Hugo get there, Hugo notices the two men who were trying to kill him earlier. Knowing that they are [[dirty cops]], Hugo persuades Samuel to turn around and flee to his apartment. While Hugo is showering, Samuel decides that he does not trust them to deliver his wife safely a second time and calls the police. Captain Fabre says that she is closest to the address Samuel gave and calls for backup. However, a group of police led by Captain Werner arrives first.  When Fabre bursts in moments later, Werner reacts to this unforeseen circumstance by shooting Fabre, revealing himself to be part of the conspiracy. Werner leaves and tells his men to finish off the others but Hugo gains the upper hand and coerces a confession out of a cop named Vogel. Vogel says that Werner enlisted Hugo with the help of Marconi to crack the safe as part of a plan to extort money from Francis Meyer, a millionaire who was recently murdered. Vogel also says that Werner forced Meyer to change his will, shot him in the head and kept a video of it as an insurance policy which is stored on a USB drive in his office. When the other police arrive, Samuel and Hugo must escape since they have been framed as cop killers. They flee to the warehouse where Nadia was being held but discover that Marconi has sold them out. Hugo's brother is dead and Nadia has been taken by the dirty cops until they can eliminate all witnesses. Hugo tracks down Marconi and kills him. He and Samuel then come up with a plan that will enable them to break into the police station.  Coordinated by Hugo's underground contacts, a series of robberies breaks out, forcing the police station into a frenzy. Samuel and Hugo arrive at the police station where Nadia is being held by a dirty cop named Moreau. Using the chaos to disguise themselves as police, Hugo goes to Werner's office and Samuel begins searching for his wife. Not at the police station, Werner discovers Marconi's body and tells Moreau to kill Nadia by pushing her out of the bathroom window, making it look like a suicide. Samuel arrives to find Nadia fighting for her life, and together, they are able to overpower Moreau and begin making their escape.  Hugo attempts to break into Werner's safe but runs out of time to crack it before Werner enters his office and immediately opens his safe to ensure the USB drive is safely there. Taking the upper hand, Hugo receives the drive by holding Werner at gunpoint. Before Hugo knocks the wind out of him, Werner taunts Hugo about how his brother died. Nadia begins to hemorrhage, finally showing symptoms that the doctor warned her about. As Samuel tries to stop the bleeding, he is recognized as a wanted man and taken away in handcuffs. He is passed by Hugo, still blending into the crowd, who slips a phone into Samuel's pocket with the USB drive attached. When he is a safe distance away, Hugo calls the phone, prompting Officer Susini to seize the USB drive as evidence against Samuel. Susini and other cops are already watching the tape when Werner arrives and he is too late to cover it up. Still in custody, Samuel is allowed to go the hospital to visit his wife, who has given birth to a healthy baby.  ''Here the film ends but an extended version exists.''  Eight years later, the Pierret family is celebrating Christmas and Samuel hears a news report about Patrick Werner who is halfway through his prison sentence. The report mentions that Werner was released for one day, only to be found dead, hanging by a noose. Samuel stares, knowing that Hugo Sartet was responsible.

While Mitra is a devoted and loving son to Lokanatham, his step daughter Valli ([[Surekha Vani]]) hates him for marrying their mother and severs ties with them. Lokanatham wants to see Mitra as his heir because Mitra is a thinking man whereas Chinna is hot-blooded with a bad life style. Chinna loathes Mitra because he receives lesser attention than Mitra from his father and is constantly discouraged by his father from entering politics. Mitra's sister's sister-in-law is his love interest. Chinna gets upset on learning that Mitra is the new youth president of the party.

Pranchiyettan & the Saint
   Chirammal Enashu Francis, a.k.a. Pranchiyettan ([[Mammootty]]), is a successful businessman based in [[Thrissur]]. He is a devotee of [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] and often has imaginary conversations with the saint. His ancestors were rice traders, but he has grown beyond the small rice shop to expand his business into jewellery, real estate, finance, shopping complexes and lot more. Even though he is successful and wealthy, he is not well-educated. (He has not cleared the [[SSLC]] exams),He is unhappy with his name and also wants to become a celebrity. He is called ''Ari'' ("rice") Pranchi by everybody, citing his ancestors' business as a colloquial taunt. He wants to change his image from ''Ari'' Pranchi to something great and is ready to spend a fortune for it. The film deals with how Pranchi tries to get a good name and what changes that brings to his life.  The story starts with Francis talking to Saint Francis of Assisi about his own life. It starts with a short flashback about a quarrel between Francis and Jose ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]) over their lady love Omana ([[Kushboo Sundar|Kushboo]]) when they were in school. Francis had a romance going with Omana but he had to give her up because of Jose's tricks. Now Jose and Omana are apparently happily married and are leading doctors in the city.  The story progresses with several anecdotes about Francis' attempts to get a good name for himself. These attempts are always told to him by his friend Vasu Menon ([[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]]), who always takes him to problems. He fights a local club election for the place of the club's President but is defeated by Jose. He then arranges a felicitation for the Oscar award-winner Gafoor Chekutty (a spoof of [[Resul Pookutty]]), but has to be satisfied with only a back row seat as he had to give up his seat on the dais for a [[Padma Shri|Padmashree]] recipient. Inspired by the recognition and respect given to a Padmashree recipient, he decides to somehow grab such an award as that may help in changing his name from ''Ari'' Pranchi to ''Padmashree'' Pranchi. He bribes a politician named Ajay Nambiar ([[Balachandran Chullikkadu]]) with 15&nbsp;million to get the award, but the corrupt politician dupes him.  Dejected, he withdraws into his house when a young woman named Padmashree ([[Priyamani]]) comes from Mumbai to invite him for an inauguration ceremony. Following an initial altercation with her due to his misunderstanding of her intention, both become good friends and eventually, Francis falls in love with her. He also helps to prevent her ''tharavadu'' (ancestral home) from being sold off. However, he is unable to express his love for her and she returns to Mumbai.  During an interaction with his friend Antony (Sivaji Guruvayoor), who is the principal of the local school, he narrates his woe to Francis. He fears that he might not be able to retire with the satisfaction of having presided over a school that got a pass rate of 100% in the SSLC exams. Moved, Francis resolves to help him. He quickly learns that the problem lies with a sole student named Pauly K. J.(Ganapathy), who always fails in the exams. Pauly's dad ([[Sreejith Ravi]]) says they are not financially sound and hence cannot help him enough with his studies. So, he brings the boy to his home and arranges for a special tutor, Pandit Deenadayal ([[Jagathy Sreekumar]]), to teach him. Deenadayal discovers that the boy is smart and immensely intelligent, but something is holding him back. He tries to teach Pauly to the best of his ability but, the boy's wit proves too much for him.  Pauly fails the exam again. Furious, Francis throws him out of his house. Upon learning that Pauly's parents were just his foster parents, he and Pauly go to see Pauly's biological father, Joppan ([[Biju Menon]]), who is in prison serving a life sentence. Francis comes to know that Joppan, under the influence of alcohol and drugs, hacked his wife (Pauly's mother) and Pauly's teacher to death in front of Pauly. Francis concludes that this incident psychologically scarred the boy, which caused his academic performance to tank. The jail warden (Chaali Pala) discloses to Francis that Joppan is suffering from terminal liver cancer, and he deliberately hides it from the boy so as to not cause him further distress.  Francis then goes to the church in his car. While Pauly sleeps in the car, he talks to Saint Francis. He asks for the Saint's permission for him to adopt Pauly. Fearing failure, he asks the Saint to permit him only if he will succeed. The Saint then shows Francis 3 visuals. The first shows his lost love Omana and Jose cheating on each other. In the second, Ajay Nambiar, the man who cheated him by offering the Padmashree for a bribe is arrested by the police. In the third, Padmashree openly admits her love for Francis to her friend in Mumbai, and further discloses that she is going to propose to him. The Saint then tells him that what one sees as a success is not always a success and what one has lost can always come back to him in the future. Happy, Francis asks the Saint to bless Pauly. But when he returns with the boy, they find the place empty. An incredulous Pauly dismisses Francis' encounter with the Saint as make believe, but when Francis avers that he asked for and got the Saint's permission to adopt Pauly, he says that he too has seen the saint in human form, as Francis. The film concludes with father and son vowing to clear the SSLC exams together the coming year.<ref></ref>

Predators (film)
  Royce awakens to find himself [[Parachute|parachuting]] into an unfamiliar jungle. He meets several others who arrived in the same manner: Mexican [[drug cartel]] enforcer Cuchillo, [[Spetsnaz]] soldier Nikolai, [[Israel Defense Forces]] [[sniper]] Isabelle, [[Revolutionary United Front]] officer Mombasa, [[San Quentin]] [[death row]] inmate Stans, [[Yakuza]] enforcer Hanzo and general practice doctor Edwin.  Upon landing, they discover that all are armed and lethal killers, with the apparent exception of Edwin, though none know where they are or how they got there. The group follows Royce, who Isabelle suspects is a former [[black operations]] soldier turned [[mercenary]]. Arriving at higher ground, they find themselves staring at an alien sky and realize that they are not on [[Earth]]. In the jungle they find a plant with a [[Neurotoxin|neurotoxic]] poison that Edwin collects on a [[scalpel]], empty cages, deadfall traps, and a deceased [[Special Forces (United States Army)|US Special Forces]] soldier.   The party is attacked by a pack of quadruped alien beasts. Royce deduces they are on a planet used as a [[Game preservation|game preserve]], where humans are hunted as [[Game (food)|game]]. Cuchillo is killed, and his body is then used as bait to lure the survivors into a trap, which they avoid. The group follows the quadrupeds' tracks to a camp and finds a captive [[Predator (alien)|Predator]]. Their hunters, three larger "Super Predators" known as the Tracker, Berserker and Falconer, attack the group. Mombasa is killed and the rest of the group escapes. Royce confronts Isabelle, believing she knows something about the alien creatures based on her shock of recognition when they encountered the captive Predator. She reveals that she has heard of the Predators before, from a report by [[List of Predator characters#Dutch|the only survivor]] (Major Alan "Dutch" Schaefer) of a Special Forces team who encountered one [[Predator (film)| in 1987 in Guatemala]].  The group next meets Noland, a solitary American soldier, who has survived on the planet for "seven seasons" by hiding and scavenging from the Predators and their victims. At his hideout, he explains that the Predators hunt in threes and sharpen their killing skills by abducting warriors and dangerous beasts from other worlds and bringing them to the planet to hunt. Noland also reveals that there is a [[Feud|blood feud]] between the larger Predators and the smaller ones. Royce devises a plan hoping that if they can free the smaller Predator being held prisoner in the encampment, it may take them home using the larger Predators' spaceship.  When the group fall asleep, Noland traps them in a room and attempts to use smoke to suffocate them. Having gone mad, he plans to kill them for their equipment and supplies. Royce uses an explosive to break out of the room, attracting the Predators to the hideout. Noland tries to escape and is killed by the Tracker Predator. In the ensuing chase, Nikolai uses two claymores to kill the Tracker, sacrificing himself. As the remaining group flees, they are intercepted by the Berserker Predator. Stans distracts it by attacking it with his [[Shiv (weapon)|shiv]], buying time for the others to escape, and is killed when Berserker rips out his spine and skull. As they continue to flee, Hanzo stays behind to duel the Falconer Predator with a [[katana]], killing it before dying from his wounds.  Royce, Isabelle and Edwin continue to head for the Super Predators' camp hoping to enact Royce's plan, until Edwin is injured by a trap. When Isabelle refuses to abandon him, Royce leaves them both behind and they are caught by the Berserker. Royce frees the smaller captive Predator in exchange to return to Earth. The Predator dons his armor and hacks into the computer of the Super Predators' ship using his wrist computer, and sets a course for Earth. Royce runs to the ship as the Berserker arrives, and the two Predators confront each other. The Berserker kills its foe and uses his wrist computer to self destruct the ship as it takes off, ostensibly killing Royce. Meanwhile, Edwin paralyzes Isabelle using the neurotoxic poison he had earlier captured and reveals that on Earth he was a [[murderer]], and feels that he fits in on this planet among the monsters. Royce appears, never having boarded the ship, and stabs Edwin with his own scalpel, paralyzing him.  Royce [[Booby trap|booby-traps]] Edwin with [[grenade]]s, using him as bait to injure the remaining Predator. While Isabelle covers him with her sniper rifle, he proceeds to fight the Berserker with an axe and eventually [[Decapitation|decapitates]] it. As Royce and Isabelle rest, they observe parachutes opening in the distant sky. Royce, surmising that more Predators will soon arrive to hunt the new prey, tells Isabelle they must find another way to get off the planet, and they make their way back towards the jungle.

Alamut falls to the Persians, but Princess Tamina denies that the town has any weapon forges. Tus asks her to marry him to unite the two nations, and she only accepts after seeing the dagger in Dastan's possession. During the celebration, Dastan is fooled into presenting a poisoned gown seemingly given to him by Tus to King Sharaman, which fatally burns the king. Garsiv accuses Dastan of being the murderer, and the prince is forced to escape, carrying Tamina along. Tus is appointed king and sets a bounty on Dastan's head.  While in hiding, Tamina attempts to kill Dastan, and in the struggle the prince discovers the dagger enables its wielder to travel back in time.

Dastan realizes that Nizam plans to place the dagger in the sandglass holding the Sands of Time, causing Nizam to go back in time and prevent himself from saving Sharaman from a lion as children, so that Nizam will grow to be king of Persia instead. Tamina says that in doing so, the sandglass would be broken and destroy the world. Sheik Amar captures the two again, but Dastan saves Amar's men from an Hashanshin attack using the dagger. The Sheik is convinced to carry them to a sanctuary near Hindu Kush, where the dagger can be sealed by returning it to the stone it once came from.

Garsiv is killed, while Tamina is knocked unconscious by a Hashanshin and the dagger is stolen.  Dastan's group travels back to Alamut to retrieve the dagger from Nizam and tell Tus the truth. Amar's right-hand man Seso dies retrieving the dagger for Dastan, and the prince demonstrates the weapon's powers to Tus to convince him. Afterwards Nizam walks in, kills Tus, and takes the dagger back. Tamina saves Dastan from being killed and the two head for the secret underground tunnels that lead to the sandglass. When they reach Nizam, he stabs the sandglass and throws them both off a cliff. Tamina sacrifices herself, letting go of Dastan and falling to her death, allowing him to fight Nizam.  When Dastan removes the dagger from the sandglass, time rewinds to the moment he found the dagger. Dastan finds Tus and Garsiv and exposes Nizam's betrayal.

Her husband, furious at what is going on, puts her in the care of Chabannes, to be taken back to the country in the morning. That night, Guise puts a dagger to Chabannes' throat and demands to see Marie. Once admitted, he declares his love and warns her against Anjou but, hearing blows on the locked door, then escapes. Montpensier breaks in and, furious to find Chabannes in her bedroom, kicks him out and departs. Guise then slips back in and has a night of love with Marie.  Marie rides home alone, while the even more disillusioned Chabannes takes a room in an inn. But it is the evening of 24 August 1572 and, as Catholic mobs led by Guise start massacring all Protestants, he dies protecting a pregnant woman. Montpensier rides to see Marie, telling her that Chabannes is dead, that Anjou is going away to Poland and that Guise is getting married at Blois the next day. She rides immediately to Blois and tells Guise that she is ready to leave Montpensier for him, but he says he must keep his engagement. She remembers the last words to her of Chabannes: “As you have lost the trust of your husband and the heart of your lover, at least you have my true friendship.” Dressed in black, through a snow-covered landscape, she rides to his tomb.[[File:Blois Chateau1.jpg|thumb|Château de Blois]]

Pure Country 2: The Gift
 Bobbie ([[Katrina Elam]]) has a naturally beautiful voice and leaves her small town for Nashville, hoping to become a singing superstar. Before she leaves, her Aunt Ella (Jackie Welch) tells her she will succeed beyond her wildest dreams if only she never lies, is always fair, and never breaks a promise. As she prepares to board the bus, Aunt Ella gives her a locket (containing a picture of her mother) and a one-hundred dollar bill, "so you can always come home."  In Nashville, Bobbie lands a job at a sushi restaurant owned by a man named Morita. Morita believes that anyone who is aspiring to be in the music business will not work hard in his restaurant, so when he asks Bobbie if she is a singer (all his employees are shaking their heads 'no' behind him), she responds "No."  Angels in heaven wince and say "that's one," meaning she's broken the first of the three rules that govern her gift.   But it turns out that the other employees are also musicians and have a band called "The Rising Sons." She joins their group, Morita becomes their manager, and they are given an audition by a promoter who is a longtime customer at the sushi restaurant. The promoter convinces Bobbie that The Rising Sons are not talented enough to take her to the top.  Though she repeatedly says, "it's not fair," she eventually gives in and agrees to let them go.  The angels in heaven say "that's two," meaning she's broken the second of the rules.  Bobbie grew up not knowing her father and has always wondered about him.  When her single climbs the charts and she is interviewed on a television show, the host surprises her by bringing her long-lost father on the show with her.  Later, he confesses to Bobbie that he's led a hard life and she'd be better off without him.  At that point, she promises to always stand by him, no matter what.  As Bobbie prepares for a live show where she will open for [[George Strait]], her drunken father comes into her dressing room (escorted by security).  After exchanging harsh words, Bobbie tells him she hates him, wishes she'd never met him, and tells him to get out. When he refuses and becomes violent Strait intervenes and has a physical altercation with him.  She has, sadly, broken the third rule - never break a promise.  As she heads out on stage, a strong wind blows and takes her voice - her gift - away with it.  When Bobbie opens her mouth to sing, only a hoarse noise issues forth.  She runs from the stage.  Bobbie visits expert after expert to try to get her voice back.  She is told, more than once, that because of the way her larynx is formed, she should never have been able to sing.  Her ability to sing at all was a miracle.  The experts all agree that she will never sing again.  Bobbie goes back home to Aunt Ella, and says she's lost her voice.  (Aunt Ella already knew - each time Bobbie broke one of the three rules, Aunt Ella knew.)  Bobbie cries because singing is all she's ever done, ever wanted to do.  Aunt Ella tells her that when she makes up for the wrongs she did, she'll be able to sing again.  She tells Bobbie that her heart is empty, but when it is full, Bobbie will sing from her heart.  It won't sound the same as when she sang from the gift, but she will sing.   Shortly after, Aunt Ella passes away. Then, Bobbie sets out to right the wrongs she did.  She returns to Nashville, and seeks and receives forgiveness from Morita and the Rising Sons.  She arranges a charity performance to support a horse-therapy group. (Her father and boyfriend are in the audience.)  She is called to the stage and says, "I hope you'll forgive the sound of my voice, but I'm singing from my heart.  So please just listen to my heart."  Meanwhile, in Heaven, the gift is dancing and twirling around the angels, who have never seen that happen before.  Then, a new angel (Aunt Ella) tells them that Bobbie has redeemed herself and the gift should be returned to her.  Halfway through the song, the angels send the gift hurtling back to her.  Bobbie's voice returns to its former glory.

Le quattro volte
 The film comprises four phases, or 'turns', following [[Pythagoras]].<ref name=Phillips(2011)></ref>  The turning of the phases occurs in [[Calabria]] where Pythagoras had his sect in [[Crotone]]. Pythagoras claimed he had lived four lives and this with his notion of [[metempsychosis]] is the structure of the film showing one phase and then turning into another phase.  A famous anecdote is that Pythagoras heard the cry of his dead friend in the bark of a dog.<ref>Diogenes Laërtius, viii. 36</ref>  * The first turn is the human realm and is about an old [[goatherd]] who is quite sick and who takes medicine made from the dust from the church floor in water at night. This phase includes a long 8-minute shot of the procession of the villagers culminating in the dog and truck episode so the goats occupy the village.  * The second turn is the animal realm and is a study of a young goat, from its birth onwards.   * The third turn is the plant realm and is a study of a fir tree. Eventually the tree is chopped down to be displayed in the town square and an evocation of cultural memory. *  The fourth turn shows the [[mineral]] realm as the tree is made into charcoal for the townspeople's fires.  This phase, as charcoal is not a mineral in any modern definitions, points to a remembering of bio-cultural processes.  The fire and smoke point to [[carbon]] at the heart of the homes in the village delivered by the truck evoking human [[reason]] as the final understanding of the interaction of these turns and the true place of the human in the scheme of things.

While he and Phil sit at a table, an orbiting satellite shoots a pink laser directly into Nick's head. He rushes his son to the ER, convinced that he has an [[inguinal hernia]]. The skeptical doctor is stunned to find that Nick is right. Nick has subsequent visions that tell him that he should relocate to [[Los Angeles]], where he lands a job at a record label.  Philip gets visited by two members of FAP (Friends of the American People). They press him for information about Nick's visions. The female FAP agent returns and sleeps with Philip. After their liaison, she pretends to be underage, hoping to coerce him into revealing what Nick is seeing from VALIS. Philip refuses to divulge anything about Nick.  Meanwhile, Nick has a dream where a woman ([[Alanis Morissette]]) is singing. During the dream, someone comments that there is something about her singing that seems subversive. Eventually, the woman turns up at Nick's record label, looking for a clerical job. She introduces herself as Sylvia, and Nick just assumes that she is a singer. Sylvia gradually reveals that she also receives visions from VALIS. She explains that there are several thousand people who receive transmissions from the orbiting satellite, and they are very loosely organized as a secret society.  The Russian government blows up the orbiting VALIS satellite, and Sylvia explains that it will take another 100 years for a replacement satellite to arrive.

When they debut the song at a club, Nick explains to Philip how the subliminal messages are encoded in the recording.  FAP arrest Nick and Philip. They waste little time in executing Nick, as well as Sylvia. The film ends with Philip in prison, writing about Nick's VALIS experience.

Though considered a terrorist by the local police, Veeraiyya is respected by the villagers. He kidnaps Raagini hoping to avenge the death of his sister Vennila ([[Priyamani]]). He brings her to the edge of a cliff to shoot her to death. She refuses to die at his hands and jumps off the cliff into the water far below, hoping to kill herself, but fails to do so. This causes Veera to hold off the murder, being unable to kill someone who has no fear of death.  Dev and his team enter the forests with the aid of Gnanaprakasam ([[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]]), a local forest guard. Despite searching deep in the forests, Dev is unable to hunt down Veera.

When she refuses, she is subjected to physical and sexual assault. Veera returns home to find Vennila distraught and traumatised. The next day, she commits suicide by drowning in a nearby well.  Unhappy with the way his brother is leading a war causing distress to his gang, Sakkarai offers a truce to Dev. Dev initially seems to agree but, when Sakkarai comes out in the open, Dev shoots him to death – revealing that he considers the destruction of Veera as more important than saving his wife.  Veera and Singarasu are enraged and attack Dev's camp; they wipe it out completely. A final confrontation between Veera and Dev takes place on a rickety bridge – where Veera triumphs over Dev – when he decides not to let Dev die. He tells Dev he is letting him live because of his wife. Dev manages to extricate himself out and finds Raagini bound and tied up – with Veera leaving her.  Dev is not entirely happy and, while returning to their hometown of Mettukudi, he accuses Raagini of infidelity and informs her that it was Veera who told him so. Furious, Raagini leaves Dev to meet Veera through Singarasu. She manages to meet him and asks him why he had accused her. Veera tells her he said that he had protected Raagini safely for the fourteen days and nothing else. He quickly realises that Dev lied, hoping Raagini would lead him to his hideout.  Dev appears with a police team and confront the duo. Raagini tries to save Veera, but he pushes her out of the line of fire, and is shot multiple times. Veera falls to his death with a smile while Ragini tries to save him with all her might.

His close associate Veera Bhadra ([[Rajendra Gupta]]) is his trustwothy ally for his political work, to the extent that Narasimha Reddy gives him freedom to contest Jilla Parishad polls with his men. Veera Bhadra champions the causes of the poor and oppressed and they look up to him like their leader. Nagamuni Reddy ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]), who is the local MLA of the district and close to Narasimha Reddy, becomes jealous of the budding trust between Veera Bhadra and Narasimha Reddy, and starts [[poison]]ing Narasimha Reddy against Veera Bhadra. Narasimha summons Veera Bhadra and asks him not to contest the polls with his contestants, but rather support Nagamuni Reddy's. Veera Bhadra lashes out at Narasimha Reddy for being unfair to the underprivileged communities and storms out. Nagamuni Reddy calls for Manda ([[Ashish Vidyarthi]]), a close follower of Veerabhadra, and manipulates him into killing Veerabhadra, giving him the assurance that if he does it, people will suspect the policies of Veera Bhadra as his own follower killed him and he will be the next in line as the leader of the poor people, else take his life. Manda reluctantly agrees to it. Veerabhadra and his wife ([[Zarina Wahab]]) travel in a bus with 40 people to a wedding. Manda and Nagamani's men stop the bus, kill Veerabhadra's guards, and tell him to step out of the bus or else he will be killed along with the other innocents on the bus. Veera Bhadra comes out, looking at Manda, and dares him to kill. Nagamani's henchman Durga shoots at Veerabhadra, making it look like Manda shot at him; prompting Manda about the deal he made with Nagamani, he tells him to kill him in front of everyone. Manda takes a boulder and crushes Veerabhadra's skull and kills him.  This results in an agitation led by Shankar, who wants to avenge his father's murder by killing all the men of Nagamani and Narasimha Reddy.

Pratap Ravi ([[Vivek Oberoi]]), who is in college in the city, gets the news of his father's murder and rushes to the village. Nagamani Reddy orders the local police inspector to kill Shankar in a fake encounter. When Pratap Ravi goes to the police station to ask about his brother, the inspector shows him Shankar's dead body and mocks him. Infuriated with his brother's murder, Pratap Ravi and Veerabhadra's men kill all the police officers and the inspector.  Pratap Ravi hides in the jungle with his father's associates and vows to kill Narsimha Reddy, Nagamuni Reddy and Manda one by one, instilling fear of death in each one of them. He starts by busting in the house of Narasimha Reddy, killing his guards and finally killing him with a scythe in front of his wife as she looks on in horror. Next is Manda; as he roams in the market, Pratap's men follow him, and before he can defend himself, they chop his hand off. Manda begs for his life but Pratap stabs him in front of everyone. They plan to kill Nagamuni Reddy, but they are cautious as there is heavy police security in his house. As Nagamani Reddy is sitting on his lawn conversing with a police officer, he is shot at by Pratap, who is dressed as the cop, and his men, dressed as cops as well, kill most of the policemen.  As Bukka Reddy and his brother Puru Reddy see their father's dead body, Bukka becomes enraged to the extent that he slaps the policewoman Ashwini Sinha ([[Ashwini Kalsekar]]) who has come to take the body for postmortem. The story progresses as famed filmstar-turned-politician Shivaji Rao ([[Shatrughan Sinha]]) targets Anantapur for contesting elections. The day he enters Anantapur for the rally, Bukka Reddy's men throw bombs, which makes Shivaji Rao get back inside the car and go back. This insults him greatly and he asks his secretary for the one who can stop Bukka Reddy. Immediately, his secretary mentions Pratap Ravi's name; Shivaji Rao sends for him and puts down a proposal of joining his party and ticket for contesting elections. On the other hand, Bukka Reddy makes his brother Puru Reddy contest for elections and tries to sabotage the voting process by stealing the ballots. Pratap starts his rampage by eliminating, one by one, every rival of his party. Eventually, he comes across a man named Babu Qadri who seeks Pratap's help in avenging his sister's death. Bukka Reddy had raped his 16-year-old sister, because of which she immolated herself, and Bukka had then broken Babu Qadri's leg. Pratap assures him his vengeance but asks him to forget everything for some time.  As Bukka Reddy's men fail in rigging the election process, Pratap Ravi wins by a majority. Immediately, Bukka Reddy is arrested. Puru Reddy seeks the help of opposition leader Sethji's help in influencing the release of Bukka Reddy on bail. As soon as Pratap Ravi learns of this news, he looks out for the location where Bukka is hiding. Bukka, inflamed with the desire to avenge his father's death, hides out in an apartment with his men, and plots to kill Pratap Ravi. Pratap comes to know about his hideout devises a plan to execute him. He immediately gathers his men and calls Babu Qadri, who had sought Pratap's help in avenging his sister, to lead the execution of Bukka Reddy. He calls for the servant of Bukka Reddy and bribes him with 500,000 to aid in the execution. Babu Qadri and Pratap's men rush into the apartment, killing all Bukka's men; Babu shoots at Bukka but he escapes the bullets and runs to the balcony through the back door, where Babu shoots him from behind, and hacks him repeatedly with his axe, venting his anger. Pratap Ravi, being at the peak of his power with Shivaji Rao's full support, invites all the gangsters of the state to his place for lunch; after lunch he orders everyone to stop their illegal activities or face the music, emphasising the power that he has in the state now.  ===Part II=== The first few minutes  a recap of part I, such as the events of how Pratap Ravi (Vivek Oberoi) takes revenge for the murder of his father and brother as well as how he comes to power. When no one in Andhra has the courage to stand up against Ravi, a man comes into light to seek revenge on Prathap. Yeturi Suryanarayana Reddy a.k.a. Surya ([[Suriya]]) is seen waiting in the woods near the main road, waiting for Pratap Ravi and hurls a bomb at his convoy. Unfortunately for Surya, Pratap Ravi escapes the bomb blast. Pratap Ravi's henchmen attempt to kill Surya but he manages to escape.  Surya informs his wife that he missed the chance of killing Pratap Ravi. Meanwhile, the media asks Pratap Ravi if this attempt is a Surya's revenge for the TV bomb placed in Surya's home by Pratap himself. Pratap Ravi denies the charge. Shivaji Rao asks Pratap to stop this vengeance but Prathap insists on killing Surya. Pratap orders his action team to kill anyone who opposes him. DCP Mohan Prasad ([[Sudeep]]) starts to investigate the case.He finds Bhavani ([[Priyamani]]), wife of Surya, and demands Surya to surrender or else he would harm his wife and baby son Arya. Surya thinks that he has missed a great chance and another chance will not come so easily and decides to surrender for protection plots to kill Prathap Ravi. DCP Mohan Prasad produces Surya in court to face trial. Prathap Ravi sends a henchmen to kill Surya in court itself, but Surya manages to fight him and kills the henchman in front of judge. Surya is sent to prison.  Pratap Ravi decides to kill Surya inside the jail, he plans carefully and decides someone from outside their camp should do this, so that the police does not suspect them. In prison Surya befriends Muddu Krishna by telling him his story. The flashback shows that after Pratap Ravi's attempt to kill Narasimha Reddy (Kitty), Surya's brother wants to take revenge. Surya, on the other hand, doesn't want to take revenge straight away, and tells him to be patient and to leave the matter as it is, as he doesn't want to put his mother and sister in any danger. Within a few months Surya's entire family is killed in the TV bomb blast. After hearing the story, Muddu Krishna decides help Surya in killing Ravi. The henchmen in prison try to kill Surya but Surya fights them back. After this failure Pratap Ravi is warned by Shivaji Rao. As a result, Pratap Ravi decides that he wants to stop this revenge and he meets Surya in jail. Ravi tells Surya to stop this bloodshed, to which Surya promptly replies "I'll surely stop&nbsp;– after killing you". Prathap thinks he can't do anything because he is in jail, which makes him defenceless.  Enter Krishnaswamy, the opposition Party leader, who decides to meet Surya. He says that to kill Pratap Ravi, Surya has to become a bigger name in Anantapur than Pratap Ravi. Krishnaswamy requests Surya to ask his wife to stand in election. Surya convinces Bhavani to stand for election. This makes Ravi to fear for his life and also for his ministerial post, consequently his henchmen want to eliminate Bhavani but Nandini (Radhika Apte) pleads with Pratap Ravi not to kill Bhavani, causing Ravi to abort the plan. However, one of Ravi's closest gang member, Umapati, is already on his way to kill Bhavani. Muddu Krishna kills Umapati and saves Bhavani. Krishnaswamy comes to prison to thank Surya, and Surya thanks him in return.  A scared Pratap organises a meeting involving the leaders of all the districts in Andhra Pradesh. Knowing this, Surya plots to kill Pratap Ravi. He realises that in the meeting, all the leaders will participate with their bodyguards. He orders Muddu Krishna to dress like a bodyguard since no one would be able to identify whose bodyguard belongs to whoever. Using this ambiguity Surya's henchmen can kill Pratap Ravi. After the meeting comes to end, Pratap Ravi plans to leave. As he was leaving, he sees a familiar face and is struck. He sees Surya, standing in front of him with his handgun. Surya fires at Pratap Ravi until he dies in a pool of blood. Surya's friends put teargas and create panic, and under the cover of smoke, Surya escapes from the scene and returns to the prison. Nandini cries by hugging her dead husband Pratap Ravi.  Muddu Krishna takes the blame for killing Pratap Ravi for Surya. DCP Mohan Prasad comes to meet Surya in jail and justifies why Pratap Ravi became a factionist. It was the circumstances that made Pratap Ravi a factionist. He adds to Surya that the same circumstances will change him into a Ravi. Surya finally says "Thank you, but I won't change into another Ravi". The movie ends with the birth of Pratap Ravi's child.

Rare Exports: A Christmas Tale
  A British research team from Subzero is taking drill core samples on top of [[Korvatunturi]] (Ear Fell) in the Finnish province of [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]. The fell is believed to be the home of [[Joulupukki]], a figure in Finnish folklore that helped shape modern day versions of Santa Claus.  It becomes clear to team leader Riley that the entire [[fell]] is an ancient burial mound built by the [[Saami people|Saami]] over centuries to conceal and imprison something. Two local boys, Juuso and Pietari, watch the team at work and eavesdrop on their discussions. They run to Juuso's nearby snowmobile quarreling about Santa Claus's existence, as the team begins to excavate the fell using explosives. Pietari returns home to read some books about Santa Claus, which suggest that he was a horned being who whips misbehaving children and boils them in a cauldron.  The day before Christmas Eve, Pietari's father Rauno, a local reindeer slaughterer, digs a trap pit in the yard to protect the remaining reindeer in case of wolves. He wakes Pietari up by throwing a snowball at his window and tells him to prepare for rounding up reindeer herds with the other herders at the electric reindeer pen. This year, there were only two skinny reindeer runts, so Rauno and the herders go to a glacier by Korvantunturi. When they reach there they find the remains of hundreds of reindeer that were gnawed to the bone. It looks like the explosions that have been going on at the fell for months have driven the wolves in the area mad. Rauno, examines the carcasses worriedly. Farther away Pietari too examines the traces and is convinced that it's not the work of wolves, while Juuso warns him not to tell his father that they plied open the fence to Korvantunturi.  Rauno's reindeer slaughterhouse has been on the brink of bankruptcy for a long time. The attack of the wolves seems to be the final straw. But Rauno has one more chance. He heads to Korvatunturi to demand retribution from the Subzero company, whose personnel were killed for provoking a mysterious new threat by their rude behaviour. On the top of the fell all Rauno and his group find is a pit 400 meters deep and no trace of the Subzero personnel. It looks as if something was lifted from the depths of hell. Having lost all hope Rauno returns to his farm.  On the morning of Christmas Eve the trap has worked, but there is no wolf trapped in it. Even though Pietari was grounded for playing a trick with his father for using reindeer traps in the fireplace, he has been full of fear of the approaching Christmas, like an animal sensing a more powerful beast in its territory. He sneaks out of his father's house to a police truck, with his disappointed father in hot pursuit. They reach a village, where Rauno hears from other villagers that potato sacks, heaters, and Piiparinen's wife's hair-dryer, have gone missing. Pietari enters Piiparinen's house, and finds that Piiparinen's son Juuso is also gone, with a straw effigy in his place.  Piiparinen brings a sack, which contains a skinny old man, and leaves his inactive body on a table in Rauno's reindeer slaughterhouse. While he, Rauno, and Aimo discuss their plans, Pietari calls his friends on the telephone, and finds that they have all gone missing. Piiparinen teases the old man with a piece of gingerbread, and the old man bites off his ear. Piiparinen comes out and asks the other two men to come and see the old man. Pietari asks his father to spank him for his bad deeds, such as plying open the fence to Korvantunturi, as he fears that the children's bad deeds might have caused Santa to take them away. They are interrupted when Piiparinen tells Rauno to come and see the old man again, as the old man is strong enough to break a metal bar. When Pietari enters, the old man notices him, as the other men try to defend Pietari from being harmed.  They dress the old man in Piiparinen's Santa costume, and message the Americans that they "have found Santa Claus". They take the old man in a cage to an airbase, where they meet Riley. Riley warns that the old man in a cage is not Santa Claus, but one of Santa's elves, and that they must not behave rudely. When one of them mutters a curse word, the other elves (who look like naked old men) destroy the electric lights, and kill Riley and his pilot. The men and Pietari run to Hangar 24, where they find a horned being in an enormous block of ice being melted by the missing heaters. Underneath the block of ice are several sacks containing the crying stolen children, including Juuso. They are attacked by the elves, who attempt to break into the hangar.  As Rauno, Piiparinen, and Aimo disconnect the heaters and use them to block the elves from the doorway, Pietari devises a plan. Piiparinen comes out of the hangar, and distracts the elves by throwing gingerbread at them, so that he can reach the helicopter. The other two men make a net, which Pietari climbs on as it picks up the sacks of children to lure the elves to the reindeer pen. The other two men place explosives all over Santa Claus' ice block, and cut off his horns, before fleeing the hangar in a truck. Pietari climbs down the net of children and an antenna to open the reindeer pen, as the horde of elves runs toward him. Rauno and Aimo detonate the explosives, killing Santa Claus and causing the elves to stop at the reindeer pen before they can hurt Pietari.  After the children are returned to their homes, Rauno decides to start a new business with the Subzero company, in which the captured elves are trained to become mall Santas and exported to various locations around the world.

Red (2010 film)
 Frank Moses, retired [[Black operation|black-ops]] CIA agent, lives alone in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. Lonely, Frank often chats on the phone with Sarah Ross, a worker at the [[General Services Administration]]'s pension office in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. He creates opportunities to talk to her by tearing up his pension checks and calling her to say they had never arrived.  One night, a "[[wetwork]]" (assassination) squad raids Frank's house and attempts to kill him, but he easily wipes them out. Knowing they have tapped his phone, he believes Sarah will be targeted. In Kansas City, as Sarah refuses to go with him, he forcibly ties her up and gags her with duct tape. Meanwhile, CIA agent William Cooper is assigned by his boss, Cynthia Wilkes, to hunt down and kill Frank.  To find out who is targeting him, Frank tracks down his old associates for help. He goes to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and visits his CIA [[Mentorship|mentor]], Joe Matheson, who now lives in a [[nursing home care|nursing home]]. Joe tells Frank that the same hit squad murdered a [[reporter]] for ''[[The New York Times]]''. Locked in a motel by Frank, Sarah escapes. Another agent, posing as a police officer, tries to [[kidnap]] her, but Frank returns in time. Cooper attacks them, but Frank tricks the police into arresting Cooper and escapes with Sarah. The two head to New York City and find clues left behind by the deceased reporter, which leads them to a hit list.  They then find Marvin Boggs, another former black-ops agent and a paranoid conspiracy theorist. Marvin tells them the people on the list, including Frank and Marvin, are connected to a secret 1981 mission in [[Guatemala]]. Another person on the list, Gabriel Singer, is still alive. The trio tracks down Singer, who tells them that the mission involved extracting a person from a village. Singer is then assassinated by a helicopter-borne machine-gunner, and the team escapes as Cooper closes in.  Frank goes to ex-Russian secret agent Ivan Simanov, who helps him infiltrate [[George Bush Center for Intelligence|CIA headquarters]]. In the CIA archive, Henry, the records keeper, who has much respect for Frank, simply hands him the Guatemala file. Frank confronts Cooper in his office and the two have a vicious fight. Though victorious, Frank is shot during his escape. Having escaped an attempt on his life, Joe arrives and helps extract the team. They hide out in the home of former wetwork agent Victoria (Mirren), who treats Frank's wound and joins the team.  The file gives them clue to the next lead, Alexander Dunning, an [[Arms trafficking|illegal arms dealer]], currently being protected by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Frank, Marvin and Joe enter Dunning's mansion, with Joe posing as a buyer from [[Djibouti]], and Frank and Marvin disguised as bodyguards, while Victoria and Sarah keep watch outside. They interrogate Dunning, who reveals the target for extraction was the now–[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Robert Stanton ([[Julian McMahon]]), a Lieutenant in the [[United States Army]] at the time whose Senator father was able to organise his extraction from the field via Dunning. Stanton ordered the hit on the people who were involved in the operation to hide the fact that he was responsible for [[war crime|massacring a village of civilians]], clearing house for his upcoming plans to run for [[President of the United States|President]].  Cooper and a team of FBI agents surround Dunning's mansion. Cooper tries to negotiate Frank's surrender, and Frank tells him about the Vice President's treachery. The [[terminally ill]] Joe pretends to be Frank, walks outside, and is killed by sniper from the Vice President's personal hit squad. The confusion, as well as Victoria's cover fire, buys the team enough time to leave the mansion, but Sarah is captured. They escape with the help of Ivan, who is Victoria's old flame. Frank calls Cooper from his family's phone and warns him against harming Sarah, as he threatens to kill Cooper's family, although it is hinted the threat wasn't genuine and Frank was only intent on scaring Cooper.  The team, along with Ivan, kidnaps Stanton at a campaign fundraiser disguised as waiters, party guests, cooks, and [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. Frank calls Cooper, offering to trade Stanton for Sarah. At the meeting point, Dunning arrives. After a short dialogue, Dunning injures Stanton, revealing himself and Cynthia Wilkes to be the masterminds behind the assassinations and the destruction of the village and that Stanton was only a scapegoat who was never involved with the crimes. Disgusted with Wilkes' corruption, Cooper pretends to arrest Frank, but shoots and kills Wilkes. Marvin and Victoria kill Dunning's bodyguards, and Frank kills Dunning by crushing his windpipe. Cooper lets Frank's team go. As they leave the scene, Frank and Sarah are eager to start a new life together, but Ivan reminds Frank of his favor.  A few months later, Frank and Marvin are in [[Moldova]] with a stolen nuclear device. They flee from [[Moldovan Ground Forces|Moldovan Army]] troops with Marvin wearing a dress and in a wooden wheelbarrow being pushed by Frank.

Shortly afterwards, the police learn that Jimmy Conway ([[Tom E. Lewis]]), a convicted murderer who was arrested by Old Bill for killing his wife, has escaped from prison. Knowing that Jimmy will return to town to seek revenge, Old Bill orders his officers and a group of civilians to arm themselves and shoot Jimmy on sight.  Old Bill's men prove to be no match for Jimmy, who remorselessly kills officers and armed civilians.  The convict encounters Shane but lets him live. When Shane finds Old Bill, he confronts Bill over the fact that Jimmy spared his life and learns that Bill has refused to call for backup from a nearby town. Shane draws his gun on Bill, but again finds himself unable to fire it and is subsequently knocked out and handcuffed to a table.  Shane escapes and uses a satellite phone at Gleason's farm to contact the nearby police for backup. During the call Shane discovers Gleason ([[Cliff Ellen]]) on the verge of hanging himself; when Shane talks to him, the farmer reveals that Jimmy Conway is innocent of the murder of his wife. The murder was the work of Old Bill and his men, who set fire to Jimmy's house after raping and killing his wife, revenge for Jimmy's interference in a proposed railroad extension that would have gone through Red Hill. Gleason informs Shane that he has a written document of what really happened, before committing suicide. Now knowing the real reason why Jimmy returned to Red Hill, Shane returns home to get his gun, which Alice found while he was on duty.  Near the outskirts of town, Old Bill sets stacks of hay on fire to attract Jimmy's attention. Jimmy arrives and kills Bill's last remaining deputies, but is stopped from finishing Bill off when two of Bill's friends arrive and hold him at gunpoint.

The police backup arrives and confront Jimmy as he prepares to get his revenge on Old Bill. Despite Shane's efforts to get him to drop his gun, Jimmy kills Old Bill and is promptly shot by the police.

Red Balloon (2010 film)
  A young teenage girl named Julie is babysitting a younger child named Dorothy whilst the parents are out by themselves. Dorothy interrupts Julie's phone conversation with her friend, telling her she needs more money and so is babysitting. After hearing the child yell, she comes up to her bedroom and reassures her she has just had a nightmare. In the child's room, a pile of dolls and teddy bears are clearly noticed, including a large patchwork rabbit. Throughout the night, the teenager flicks through random TV channels and paints her nails, obviously bored with her job. A news report is informing viewers of a criminal breaking out of a mental institute, but she ignores the show and nearly falls asleep. She wakes to apparently see a red balloon and too Dorothy next to the sofa, looking terrifying, but realises she has just woken up. Another scream is heard from Dorothy's room, who is now standing up in her bed, pointing at the rabbit from the pile of toys. Julie impatiently tucks her back into bed and tells her she has nothing to be scared of, it is just a doll. Once in the landing, she phones a woman, supposedly Dorothy's mother, to ask whether the girl has had any trouble sleeping before and to question her on why she is so anxious of her toy rabbit. The mother has no idea what she is talking about because Dorothy has never had a large toy rabbit of which Julie has just described. A horrified Julie gasps and struggles to speak, her eyes flickering upstairs as the rabbit in the bedroom shuffles the other smaller toys off. The eyes snap open and it is shown that the "toy" is in fact a human intruder.  Julie runs down the stairs and out of the house into the pouring rain, sobbing hysterically. She calls the police and is even more distraught when Dorothy seems to be smothered by a figure from the bedroom window. Julie tiptoes back into the house, a powercut turning everything pitch black. She tries to conceal her heavy breathing until she is more calm. Glancing into the landing, she sees a red balloon floating in the air. Dorothy is sitting on the floor and with her hands over her eyes, appearing to be playing an innocent 'hide and seek' game. She is unfazed by the situation and clearly is unaware to Julie's panic. Julie gently kneels in front of her and quietly whispers that mummy and daddy are outside. In the background, a looming figure saunters towards the two. Dorothy points and says "Alister", going back to the news report, stating that Alister Radford was the dangerous inmate who had broken out of the institution. We also see the family home's gate, spelling out "Radford" on the sign attached to it. Speechless, Julie realises that the child knows the intruder (he is possibly her father or brother) that he is also right behind her. He attacks and she screams for a while, obviously fighting him off but he is much stronger and powerful. From the eyes of Julie laying on the floor, the intruder takes the hand of a naive Dorothy and leads her away. It is assumed that Julie has been violently killed.

Lei Bin and Turquoise follow her but are stopped by Ah-sheng, who surprises them by producing a pair of Cen-Ci swords.  Lei Bin recognizes them as Renfeng's weapons. The two assassins are defeated and Ah-sheng takes Drizzle to the surgeon, who treats Drizzle's wounds and tells Renfeng that everything is pre-destined. Flashbacks reveal that Ah-sheng's true identify is Renfeng, who did not die from Drizzle's sword because he has [[situs inversus]]. He has also changed his appearance so that he can avenge his father's death. Drizzle finds out the truth and asks Renfeng if he has ever loved her. An emotional Renfeng tells her that is impossible because of what she and Dark Stone have done to his family, but he cannot bring himself to kill her and tells her to leave.  The Wheel King, having obtained the remains, attempts to use the power to restore his bodily "defect"; he was castrated as a boy and uses the cover of being a low ranking [[eunuch]] to hide his criminal activities. Turquoise discovers this as she seduces him, and mocks him in anger and disappointment. The Wheel King is infuriated and buries her alive under a bridge. He sees the fireworks signal released by Drizzle, who has decided to engage him in a final battle. The Wheel King comes to a graveyard and finds Renfeng dead. Drizzle then battles him and wounds him fatally, using what Wisdom had taught her. Renfeng revives the next morning, since he was just given a tortoise powder by Drizzle in order to appear lifeless so he could witness Drizzle avenge his family with her life. He approaches her body to touch her and finds her still alive. Renfeng is overcome with joy and carries her in his arms. Drizzle whispers to him "After we get home, draw up the divorce papers." Renfeng laughs and tells her they have a long life ahead, together.

Sonia goes to the hospital where her dying father is a patient, but she is unable to bring herself to face him. Michael visits his father in jail, but the conversation is cut short by the Mr. Weeks’ abusive threats at his son. When Bob tries to get them to discuss their day in group therapy, they refuse, and Michael storms off. Later, while discussing the pointlessness of Bob's therapy, Sonia is told that her father has died. As the trio try to deal with their emotional pain, a storm rolls in, and each of them is shocked and knocked unconscious.  When they wake up in the morning, they find that it is the same day, with all the same events repeating. Kyle, Sonia, and Michael stumble through the day and repeat their actions in a daze. When they discuss the situation, Michael is intrigued by the consequence-free possibilities open to them, but Kyle convinces them to act on a news report that he recalls. They go to a dam but are too late to stop a jumper. Michael suggests that they take advantage of the situation, and they commit petty crimes that result in a stay at jail. Eventually, as the day repeats endlessly, they embark on a drug bender and crime spree, robbing Mr Singh’s store and culminating in the violent kidnapping of Tiko, a drug dealer who has been selling to Charlotte and her friend Michelle.  On another loop, Kyle slices the Tiko’s throat. At the dam, Michael carelessly risks his life walking on top of the railing and dares Sonia to do the same. When she slips, Michael merely laughs and refuses to try to help Kyle save her. Sonia falls to her death, then wakes up with a gasp on the next repeat. Sonia claims to remember nothing of her death, and the trio become emboldened by their apparent immortality.  On one repeat, Kyle and Sonia save the jumper at the dam, then discover that Michael has raped Michelle. When Kyle and Sonia confront Michael, Michael accuses them of hypocrisy and says that all their bad actions are excusable because everything gets reset. Michael's behavior becomes more violent and antisocial as the days repeat. Shaken by Michael's behavior, Kyle ambushes him in the morning and ties him to a chair. Kyle and Sonia fall in love and work toward redemption, but Michael laughs at Kyle; he claims that Sonia's story of childhood sexual abuse is just an act, repeating the phrases she used to instigate sex with him, which match the words she used on Kyle in the current loop.  However, Kyle and Sonia do form a deeper relationship during the loops, and manage to make peace with their families. Unexpectedly, this causes the time loop to abruptly end, but they do not realize it until the (truly) next day in the middle of a violent rampage by Michael that ends with the senseless murders of two people. Freaked out, Michael takes Charlotte hostage, but he commits suicide after Kyle attempts to reason with him. Michael is surprised to wake up again, stuck in his own time loop, unsure if he can ever arrange peace with his own family to break the loop.  
Repo Men
 In 2025, advancements in medical technology have perfected bio-mechanical organs. A corporation known as The Union sells these expensive "artiforgs" on credit, and when customers are unable or unwilling to pay for their artiforgs The Union sends "repo men" to locate and forcibly repossess the organ- invariably resulting in the death of the owner.   Remy and his partner Jake Freivald are considered the best of the Union's repo men. However, Remy's wife Carol disapproves of his work, believing that it is a bad influence for their son Peter. At a family barbecue, Remy allows Jake to discreetly perform a repossession nearby, but is caught by Carol who leaves with Peter in anger. While patrolling with Jake, the duo discovers a "nest", a refuge for Union customers who have defaulted on payments for their artiforgs and are attempting to escape the country. Remy and Jake raid the nest by themselves, impressing their boss, Frank. He offers them the opportunity to become full-time raid captains. Remy declines and attempts to ask Frank to transfer to sales, but Jake cuts him off. Jake tells Remy that what they do is important, but Remy's mind is made up. Jake suggests that Remy's last job be a musician that Remy is a fan of. After helping the musician finish one last song, he uses a defibrillator in order to stop the artificial heart, but the device malfunctions, and Remy is severely injured, requiring replacement of his heart with an artiforg.  Carol divorces Remy for taking another job, so he moves in with Jake.  As he tries to go back to work, he realizes he's developed sympathy for the customers, unable to lie when he tries sales, but also unable to kill when repossessing their artiforgs. He's soon unable to make the payments on his heart and is in debt.  Jake discovers that Remy has not been repossessing and takes him to a "nest" with enough artiforgs to clear his debt; however, Remy cannot do the job. Furious, Jake demands he stay there until he gets over his inhibition. A stunned debtor wakes up and knocks Remy out.  Waking up, Remy encounters Beth, a singer he would see while drinking in a bar with Jake. He takes her to a motel room and discovers she has numerous artiforgs. Breaking into the office, Remy attempts to clear Beth's and his own accounts, but he is interrupted by Jake, who lets him leave. On the run, Beth and Remy leave for the abandoned outskirts of the city. Beth tells Remy of how she contracted various diseases and was involved in a car crash, and was forced to resort to buying artiforgs on the black market after running up severe debts. They begin a relationship, and Remy decides to document his life as a repo man with an old typewriter Beth found. As he works on a manuscript, he is interrupted by a repo man. Remy sets a trap and the collector drops through a hole in the floor. Beth falls through the same hole, damaging her prosthetic knee. Before the collector can shoot Beth, Remy manages to kill him.  Remy sneaks into his former workplace to obtain scanning jammers he had confiscated during his raid on the nest. He attempts to force Frank to clear his account, only to discover that accounts can now only be cleared at the Union's central office due to his earlier attempt. Remy and Beth attempt to flee the country at the airport, but security is alerted by bleeding from Beth's knee. A fight with airport security ensues. Jake arrives, but is on the wrong side of a security panel and watches their escape. They go to a [[black market]] doctor to replace Beth's knee.  After the procedure, they are stopped by Jake who tries to convince to Remy to rejoin him as a repo man. Remy refuses, and Jake reveals he rigged the defibrillator unit that caused his heart to fail, so Remy would continue to work with him. They fight, and Jake knocks Remy unconscious. Beth awakens Remy, saying she stunned Jake as an organ repossession raid is underway. They flee and Remy decides to delete the accounts of all implant clients. Remy meets Carol and Peter on a train one last time, passing on his manuscript to Peter.  Remy and Beth break into Union headquarters and are forced to fight their way through the facility to the Union's database. Using Beth's prosthetic eye, they enter and seal themselves inside as Jake and Frank arrive. The server's only interface is an organ scanner, requiring Remy and Beth to cut themselves open to use the scanner internally on each of their artiforgs, clearing their accounts. Frank and Jake enter the server room using an artiforg from one of the slain repo men, finding Beth near death and Remy attempting to scan her heart. Jake is ordered to kill Remy, but he instead kills Frank and helps revive Beth. Jake tosses two grenades into the artiforg drawer of the server, with the explosion destroying the mainframe, wiping the records of everyone who has an account with the Union.  Later, Remy is seen on a tropical beach, enjoying his freedom with Beth and Jake. His text has been published as a book, ''The Repossession Mambo''. While Remy talks to Jake, he notices that Jake suddenly disappears, leaving Remy's book on his chair; then Remy sees the beach flicker with static before returning to normal. It is revealed that Remy is in a coma, having sustained severe brain damage when Jake knocked him unconscious. Jake has paid off Remy's debt for his heart and also paid to link his brain to a neural network, allowing him to live out his life peacefully in a computer generated dream world. Beth is unconscious, and Jake says he will take care of her; he then says a sorrowful goodbye to Remy. The film ends with Frank delivering a sales pitch for the neural network.  
Resident Evil: Afterlife
 One year after the events of [[Resident Evil: Extinction|Extinction]], Alice ([[Milla Jovovich]]) and her clones lead the assault to attack Umbrella HQ, located in [[Tokyo]], slaying the entire branch except for Albert Wesker ([[Shawn Roberts]]), who escapes in a [[Tiltrotor|tiltrotor plane]] and detonates a bomb that leaves a massive [[sinkhole]]. The real Alice boarded beforehand and attempts to execute Wesker, only for him to inject her with an anti-virus to remove her superhuman abilities. Wesker is revealed to have used the T-Virus to gain his own superhuman abilities and prepares to kill Alice, before the autopilot crashes the plane into the mountains and only Alice survives.  Six months later, Alice travels to [[Alaska]] in an [[Yak-52|airplane]], tracking broadcasts from a safe haven called ''Arcadia''; however, she only finds abandoned planes, and is attacked by feral [[Claire Redfield]] ([[Ali Larter]]). Alice destroys a spider-like device on Claire's chest, giving her amnesia and pacifying her. They travel to the ruins of [[Los Angeles]], where they find survivors living in [[Twin Towers Correctional Facility|a prison]] which is surrounded by thousands of undead. They meet Luther West, ([[Boris Kodjoe]]) who leads the surviving band from the prison, Wendell ([[Fulvio Cecere]]), Crystal Waters ([[Kacey Clarke]]), Bennett ([[Kim Coates]]), Kim Yong ([[Norman Yeung]]), and Angel Ortiz ([[Sergio Peris-Mencheta]]). With their help, Alice finally lands on the prison's roof and learns ''Arcadia'' isn't a fixed place, but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. However, though the ship hasn't moved, no one from it has responded to the group's rescue flares. Luther takes Alice to the last inmate, [[Chris Redfield|Chris]] ([[Wentworth Miller]]), who insists he's falsely imprisoned, and will reveal an escape route in exchange for freedom. Alice goes to the showers to wash up, but catches Wendell attempting to [[Voyeurism|peep]]. Holding him at gunpoint, they are attacked by a group of infected people that dug into the prison. They take Wendell, but she manages to kill them.  Desperate, they free Chris, who reveals that Claire is his sister, and the prison has an armored car they can use to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins breaking down the gate. Alice, Chris and Crystal go to the basement armory to get more guns; however, zombies kill Crystal en route. Luther and Claire reinforce the gate. Angel informs Bennett and Yong the car is missing its engine, and it would take a week to fix. Bennett shoots Angel and heads for ''Arcadia'' in Alice's airplane. The Axeman breaks down the gate, allowing the zombies into the prison. The group decides to use the zombie-dug tunnels to escape into the sewers. Kim Yong is slashed in half by the Axeman, while Alice is knocked out. Claire successfully defends Alice, manages to defeat the Axeman and disorienting it, after which Alice kills it by firing at its head. Unfortunately, Luther is dragged back into the tunnels by a zombie.  Alice and the Redfields board the ''Arcadia'', discovering it functional but abandoned. Claire then remembers ''Arcadia'' is an Umbrella trap to get test subjects; they release the survivors, among them K-Mart ([[Spencer Locke]]). Alice follows a trail of blood deeper into the ship, where she finds Wesker. The T-Virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, something he believes [[Cannibalism|fresh human DNA]] can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects. Alice's DNA is superior to his, since she retained control despite her bonding with the virus at a cellular level. Wesker believes eating her will help him regain control of his body over the effects of the T-Virus.  The Redfields fight Wesker while Alice battles Bennett, now working for Wesker. Wesker easily overpowers Chris and Claire, but Alice is able to defeat both Bennett and Wesker with help from K-Mart. They lock Bennett in the room with Wesker's corpse. Bennett is devoured by Wesker when he revives. Wesker then escapes in an aircraft, activating a bomb on the ''Arcadia''; the plane explodes instead as Alice placed the bomb there beforehand. Unbeknownst to them, Wesker [[parachuting|parachutes]] away from the explosion, while Luther emerges from the sewers, battered but alive. Alice resolves to turn ''Arcadia'' into a real haven and broadcasts a new message for any other survivors. As Alice, Claire and Chris watch over from ''Arcadia'', it is approached by a military [[Squadron (army)|squadron]] of Umbrella aircraft.  During a [[mid-credits scene]] in one of the aircraft, Jill Valentine ([[Sienna Guillory]]), who went missing after [[Resident Evil: Apocalypse|the Raccoon City destruction incident]], is dictating the attack wearing the same mind control device used on Claire.

The coming-of-age tale centers on a young man named Augustine "Gus" Orviston ([[Zach Gilford]]) and his quest for an elusive [[Rainbow Trout]], which is a metaphor for his internal search for self-knowledge. [[Amber Heard]] plays his love interest, a tomboy fly-fisher named Eddy.   The film begins with Gus, a discontented city dweller, fresh out of high school. Gus and his quiet little brother are audience to his parents; avid fisherman whom cannot seem to find an agreement over their separate loves of bait and fly fishing. After briefly glimpsing Eddy at a fishing exhibition and her passionate argument to save Oregon rivers, restless Gus has had enough of conforming to a life he doesn't feel he is fit for. Following an explosive argument with his parents, Gus moves to a small cabin in the country alongside a river. His objective: fishing every day and all day. As he begins to sink into his new routine, Gus is puzzled to find he is still discontent with what he has always believed is his "ideal" life.  This boils over when Gus takes a day trip in his canoe and finds a man deemed missing by the papers a few weeks earlier who has died while fly fishing. Gus pulls him back to shore where they are retrieved by law enforcement. Besides being cold and exhausted, Gus is physically fine but emotionally he is in a turmoil. Truly facing death for the first time, Gus is overwhelmed by the meaningless life he feels he is living. He goes to the city and uncharacteristically gets drunk and meets a strange but friendly philosopher named Titus. The two talk and Titus helps Gus understand his discontent while becoming fast friends. Things begin to look up for Gus as he teaches the neighborhood children to fish and sells handmade lures to support himself. Gus finally sees Eddy again while taking a hike. He witnesses her skinny dipping and fishing.  To preserve her modesty, drops his things and moves to separate location and begins whistling so she knows he is coming. After an awkward interaction, Eddy finds Gus's things that he dropped when he initially saw her and leaves when Gus isn't looking. A disappointed Gus still stores the fishing pole and fish that Eddy left behind in the hopes that she will return. Soon after, when a chance encounter with a beginner fly-fisherman turns into an impromptu newspaper interview with a well-known local journalist, Gus finds a way to promote his bait shop and get in contact with Eddy by releasing his location and letting "the young woman who left her fishing pole and trout with him" know that it's available at any time. Amidst giving fishing advice, selling bait, and of course continuing to fish himself, Gus finds himself almost happy, but still wishing to be with Eddy who has yet to return. After coming back to his cabin one day though, Gus is surprised to find Eddy inside, waiting for her fishing pole and fish. The two talk and spend the weekend getting to know each other, ending in a kiss. Eddy continues to see Gus as the two grow closer.  Eddy catches a large [[Chinook Salmon]] to Gus's surprise and to his even greater surprise, hands him the fishing pole and upon letting him know she'll see him after heading back to her house in the nearby city of [[Portland, Oregon]], leaves him to reflect while following the Chinook upriver, attempting to pull the fish in. After a full day and the majority of the night, the Chinook finally tires, leaving Gus able to bring it to bay. Instead, Gus cuts the line and lets the fish go, realizing that Eddy had him do this to help him understand that the true meaning of his life could never be something as simple as fishing but instead to do what he loves with the people he loves. Finding Eddy waiting for him, the two consummate their relationship. Eddy leads Gus to the final piece of his puzzle of finding meaning in his life when she takes him to a small beach on the river by his cabin where he is both surprised and joyfully overwhelmed to find his family waiting for him.

Robin Hood (2010 film)
  In the year 1199, [[Robin Hood|Robin Longstride]] ([[Russell Crowe]]) serves as a common [[archery|archer]] in the army of [[Richard I of England|King Richard the Lionheart]] ([[Danny Huston]]). A veteran of [[Third Crusade|Richard's crusade]], he now takes part in the siege of [[Château de Châlus-Chabrol|Chalus Castle]]. Disillusioned and war-weary, he gives a frank but unflattering appraisal of the King's conduct when the King asks his opinion, and Robin and his comrades—archers [[Alan-a-Dale|Allan A'Dayle]] ([[Alan Doyle]]) and [[Will Scarlett]] ([[Scott Grimes]]) and soldier [[Little John]] ([[Kevin Durand]])—find themselves in the [[stocks]].  When the King is slain during an attack on the castle, Robin and his men decide to free themselves and desert. They come across an ambush of the English royal guard by Godfrey ([[Mark Strong]]), an English knight who has conspired with [[Philip II of France|King Philip of France]] to assassinate King Richard. After chasing Godfrey away, Robin decides to take advantage of the situation by having his men impersonate the dead English knights to return to England. Before they depart to sail across the Channel, Robin promises one of the dying knights, Sir Robert Locksley ([[Douglas Hodge]]), to return his sword to his father in [[Nottingham]].  Awaking to find his party in the Thames estuary, Robin must continue to assume the identity of Locksley to inform the royal family of King Richard's death. He witnesses the coronation of [[John, King of England|King John]] ([[Oscar Isaac]]), who orders the collection of harsh new taxes and dispatches Godfrey to the [[Northern England|North]] to do so—unaware that Godfrey will instead use French troops to stir up unrest and to prepare for King Philip to invade England.  Robin and his companions head to Nottingham, where Locksley's elderly and blind father, Sir Walter ([[Max von Sydow]]), asks him to continue impersonating his son to prevent the Crown from seizing the Locksley family lands. Locksley's widow, [[Maid Marian|Lady Marian]] ([[Cate Blanchett]]), is initially cold toward Robin, but warms to him when he and his men merrily recover [[tithe]]d grain for the townsfolk to plant.  Godfrey's actions incite the northern barons, who march to meet King John. Speaking now for Sir Walter, Robin proposes that King John agree to a [[Charter of the Forest|charter of rights]] to ensure the rights of every Englishman and to unite his country. Having realized Godfrey's deception, and knowing he must meet the French invasion with an army, the King agrees. Meanwhile, French marauders plunder Nottingham. Robin and the northern barons arrive to stop Godfrey's men, but not before Godfrey has slain the blind Sir Walter.  As the main French expeditionary force begins its invasion of England on a beach below the [[cliffs of Dover]], Robin leads the now united English army against them. In the midst of the battle, Robin duels with Godfrey, who attempts to kill Marion and flees until Robin finally kills him with an arrow from afar. King Philip realizes that his plan to divide England has failed and calls off his invasion. When King John sees the French surrendering to Robin instead of to himself, he senses a threat to his power. In London, King John reneges on his promise to sign the charter and declares Robin an [[outlaw]] to be hunted throughout the kingdom. The [[Sheriff of Nottingham]] ([[Matthew Macfadyen]]) announces the decree, and Robin and his men flee to [[Sherwood Forest]] with the orphans of Nottingham. Marion narrates their new life in the greenwood, noting that they live in equality as they right the many wrongs in the kingdom of King John. And "the legend begins".

The details of how they met in a nightclub are left vague. Once in the room, Natasha is at first quite reluctant, insisting she's straight, but the clearly more experienced Alba handles deftly around Natasha's hesitance. Flattered and tempted by Alba, Natasha responds to her sexual advances, but continues to maintain that she is straight and has never had sex with a woman. Alba counters by claiming that she is a lesbian and has never had sex with a man.  Alba and Natasha first get undressed and into bed, but Natasha is still very nervous. Alba suggests that they first lay side by side and only casually touch each other's faces. They do so until Alba becomes so relaxed that she falls asleep. Natasha quietly gets out of bed, gets dressed and leaves the room, wondering what would have happened if she stayed and consummated her curiosity and attraction to Alba. In her rush to leave, Natasha leaves her cell phone behind, and the ring-tone wakes up Alba. Natasha soon returns and asks Alba for her cell phone, but is reluctant to enter the room again. When a passing night-shift waiter named Max passes by, Alba grabs Natasha and takes her back into the room. While talking about the location of Natasha's hotel and looking at an old map of Rome from the 1st century, Alba continues to flirt with Natasha with her naked body. Natasha soon succumbs to her attraction and curiosity towards Alba, leading her to quickly get undressed once again and into bed where she and Alba have sex for the first time.  Over the next 10 hours, Alba and Natasha grow closer to each other as Natasha becomes more relaxed and comfortable around Alba with their lovemaking. Alba and Natasha share stories, periodically stopping to illustrate their points with pictures on the Internet, talk about the artwork in the hotel room, and explore each other's nude bodies through sex. Alba first tells a story about how her mother abandoned her when she was a little girl and she ended up as the kept woman of a wealthy Arab in Saudi Arabia, while Natasha later shares a story of her abusive father and her twin sister's career as an art historian.  Eventually, the two women tell each other the truth. Natasha reveals that her real name is Dasha who comes from a wealthy family living near Moscow and that she is actually a professional tennis player on vacation, and is to be married the following week in Russia to a man. Natasha's twin sister, Sasha, a model and career actress, phones her at least twice during the film to ask of her whereabouts and wedding plans. Alba then reveals that she is actually a mechanical engineer/inventor in Rome on business and she lives with a woman in [[San Sebastian, Spain]]. Alba shows Natasha a video of herself and her life partner, named Edurne, who have two small children, a little boy and girl, and who are of Basque origin. Alba also says that the little boy died recently in a drowning accident.  Natasha and Alba have breakfast together at dawn, which is served by the cheerful room service waiter, Max. They discuss abandoning their partners and living together in Rome, but both seem to realize that this is not possible. While Alba tells Natasha that she feels she is falling in love with her, Natasha gets more defensive and insists that her attraction to Alba only stems from attraction and curiosity towards the same sex, but not through love. After having sex a final time and then hanging the white bed sheet up a flagpole on the balcony of the room as a gag, the two one-time lovers eventually decide to part ways, returning to their previous lives in Russia and Spain. They both agree to let the passionate night they shared remain a secret between them. In the final shot, after leaving the hotel and walking away from each other, Natasha calls out to Alba and runs towards her to show off her sprint running skills... leaving their parting ambiguous to if they will ever meet again.

A sheriff, Chad ([[Stephen Spinella]]), points out that many moments in cinema happen for "no reason", that life is full of this "no reason", and that "this film" ([[Indexical|presumably a dual reference to both the "film" to be watched by the assembled group and ''Rubber'' itself]]) is an homage to "no reason".

As the tire begins to roll towards her stalled car, a truck comes by and runs the tire over. This breaks the connection, allowing the woman's car to start again and she continues on her way. The tire explodes a pied crow, then finds the man that had been driving the truck which ran him over and blows up his head.  Arriving in a nearby desert town, the tire comes across the woman in the car. She is staying in a motel and, after watching her shower through an open door, the tire goes into the room next to hers. After the motel maid finds the tire showering and throws it out of the room, the tire reenters the room and blows up her head. Chad, the sheriff from the opening of the movie, shows up to investigate the murders. Chad is both inside and outside the [[diegesis]], sometimes participating in the narrative action and sometimes commenting on it.  The accountant tries to end the movie early by feeding the audience a poisoned turkey, but one of them, a man in a wheelchair, does not partake and survives. The accountant then informs Chad. Chad witnesses the tire kill the motel owner (who has mistreated it) and leads the cops on a "tire hunt". Meanwhile, the accountant tries to poison the man in the wheelchair with more food, but ends up eating it himself and dying.  As the tire is running from the police, it comes across a group of people burning a large pile of tires. The film then jumps to three days later showing the results of a killing spree. The cops find the tire watching an auto racing program in a house, having killed the occupants. Chad rigs a mannequin (resembling the woman the tire is interested in) with dynamite, intending for the tire to blow the mannequin's head up, thereby detonating the dynamite and destroying itself. However, when the tire destroys the mannequin's head, the dynamite does not explode. Enraged, Chad shoots and kills the tire with a shotgun, after which he gives the tire to the man in the wheelchair. A tricycle emerges from the house and kills the man in the wheelchair. The tricycle begins rolling down the road; other tires begin rolling behind it and they eventually roll to Hollywood, where the film concludes.

Salt (2010 film)
 Evelyn Salt ([[Angelina Jolie]]) is being tortured in a prison in [[North Korea]] on suspicion of being an American spy. Her boyfriend, [[Arachnology|arachnologist]] Mike Krause ([[August Diehl]]), generates so much publicity about Salt's imprisonment that the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] is forced to arrange a prisoner exchange, despite the agency's policy against it.  Salt's CIA colleague Ted Winter ([[Liev Schreiber]]) greets Salt at the border.  As they drive away, Mike proposes marriage, despite Salt's admission to Mike that she is in fact a CIA operative.  Two years later, on Salt and Mike's wedding anniversary, a Russian defector named Oleg Vasilyevich Orlov ([[Daniel Olbrychski]]) walks into Salt's office. Salt interrogates him, with Winter and CIA counterintelligence officer Darryl Peabody ([[Chiwetel Ejiofor]]) observing.  Orlov claims that, on "Day X", highly trained Russian sleeper agents known as "KAs" will destroy the U.S.  Orlov tells them that Agent "KA-12" will assassinate [[Russia]]n president Boris Matveyev ([[Aleksander Krupa|Olek Krupa]]) at the funeral of the [[Vice President of the United States|American Vice President]]. Orlov reveals that KA-12 is named Evelyn Salt, and lie detectors confirm his entire story. Peabody orders Salt be detained, while Orlov kills two agents and escapes. In the confusion, Salt is able to escape from the building, running barefoot through the street. While the CIA is searching for her, Salt discovers that her husband was kidnapped.  A while later at the funeral, Salt appears to succeed in killing President Matveyev, and then surrenders herself. Matveyev is declared dead. Salt escapes again and heads to a barge where Orlov is hiding with other sleeper agents. In a series of [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], Salt recalls growing up in the [[Soviet Union]] and being trained with other children. On the barge, Orlov welcomes her back and has Mike killed in front of her.  When Salt shows no reaction, Orlov is convinced she is loyal and begins briefing her on her next mission. She is to rendezvous with another KA who will help her assassinate the American president. She kills Orlov and the other agents before leaving. She then meets with KA Shnaider ([[Corey Stoll]]), who uses his cover as a [[NATO]] liaison to get Salt into the [[White House]]. Once inside, Shnaider launches a suicide attack to force agents to move the President ([[Hunt Block]]) to an underground bunker, accompanied by Winter. Salt follows them and manages to enter the bunker before it is sealed.  The U.S. President learns that Russia has mobilized its nuclear arsenal in response to their president's death. He orders American nuclear weapons readied in response. CIA Agent Winter suddenly kills everyone except the President and introduces himself as Nikolai Tarkovsky, another member of the KA.  Winter incapacitates the President and begins aiming nuclear missiles at [[Mecca]] and [[Tehran]] to incite a billion Muslims against the United States. Salt tries to persuade Winter to let her inside the sealed room, but then he sees a television report saying President Matveyev is alive and well; Salt had used spider venom to cause a simulated death of Matveyev. Winter refuses her entry and reveals that Mike's kidnapping and murder and her blown cover were all his idea.  Winter plans to place full blame for the nuclear attacks on Salt. Salt breaks into the room before he can launch the missiles. The two wrestle for control of the [[nuclear football]], with Salt aborting the missile strikes before being captured.  As Salt is being led out in chains, Winter grabs a pair of scissors, ready to attack her or to defend himself if necessary. She unexpectedly hooks her chain around Winter's neck and jumps over the stair railing, strangling him to death.  On the helicopter ride to be interrogated, Peabody questions her.  Salt explains that she killed Winter because he orchestrated the death of her husband, and promises to hunt down the remaining KA agents if freed. Peabody is convinced after receiving a text that Salt's fingerprints were found on the barge where the sleeper agents were killed, supporting her story. Salt is allowed to escape, jumping out of the helicopter into the river below and escaping into the woods.  In an alternate ending, Salt arrives in disguise at the place in the former Soviet Union where she was trained as a child; she is then seen by the water as she watches Orlov drown, and the place blows up.

Zhao Dun, the [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] of Jin, and his son, General Zhao Shuo, have a feud with General Tu'an Gu. Tu'an Gu secretly murders the Duke of Jin and pushes the blame to the Zhao family, using that as an excuse to massacre the Zhao family. The sole survivor is Zhao Shuo's baby son, Zhao Wu, whose mother is the Duke's elder sister, Lady Zhuang. Lady Zhuang pleads with Tu'an Gu's subordinate, [[Han Jue]], to spare her child. She then instructs Cheng Ying, a physician, to bring the child to Gongsun Chujiu, a friend of the Zhao family, before committing suicide. When Tu'an Gu learns that the orphan had escaped, he slashes his sword at Han Jue's face in anger and disfigures him. Tu'an Gu then issues an order to seal the gates and to gather all newborn babies in the city. The plan was to identify the Zhao orphan since Tu'an Gu was counting on the person hiding the baby to not hand over the baby to him, hence singling out the one baby left in the city to be the Zhao infant.  Cheng Ying brings the baby Zhao Wu home, but his wife gives the child to the searching soldiers. Cheng Ying then asks Gongsun Chujiu to bring his wife and his real son (disguised as Zhao Wu) out of the city, while he stays behind to try and retrieve Zhao Wu from Tu'an Gu. Tu'an Gu finds Cheng Ying suspicious, but Cheng lies that the Zhao orphan has been taken out of the city by Gongsun Chujiu. Tu'an Gu then leads his soldiers to Gongsun Chujiu's house and finds Cheng Ying's wife and son. Mistaking Cheng Ying's son for the Zhao orphan, Tu'an Gu kills the infant, Gongsun Chujiu and Cheng's wife.  Cheng Ying is devastated by the loss of his family and he swears vengeance on Tu'an Gu. He pretends to pledge allegiance to Tu'an Gu and brings Zhao Wu along with him and raises the child in Tu'an's house. Tu'an Gu mistakenly believes that Zhao Wu is Cheng Ying's son and adopts Zhao Wu as his godson. Zhao Wu gradually grows up under Tu'an Gu's tutelage and develops a close bond with Tu'an. Cheng Ying also forges a close friendship with the disfigured Han Jue and they secretly plot to help Zhao Wu avenge his family.  One day, Cheng Ying breaks the truth to Zhao Wu, telling him that Tu'an Gu, who has been a fatherly figure to him for the past 15 years, is actually the murderer of his family. Zhao Wu is unable to accept the truth initially but his attitude changes as he hears from Han Jue about how Cheng Ying sacrificed his own son to save him. Zhao Wu and Cheng Ying finally confront Tu'an Gu, but Tu'an is aware of Zhao's true identity, because, over the years, he has noticed that the boy resembles Zhao Shuo. Zhao Wu engages Tu'an Gu in a sword fight but is no match for the latter. At the critical moment, Cheng Ying sacrifices himself to give Zhao Wu an opportunity to stab and kill Tu'an Gu. The film ends with a dying Cheng Ying having a vision of his reunion with his family.

Saw 3D
  Two men, Brad and Ryan, awaken in a Metropolitan Storefront, bound at the wrists to opposite sides of a worktable with a circular saw in front of each of them. Their mutual lover, Dina, is suspended above a third saw, and a [[Billy the Puppet (Saw)|puppet]] informs the men that Dina has been manipulating both of them, driving them into criminal activity to fulfill her material desires. The puppet says they can either kill each other or let Dina die. They initially fight each other, during which Brad is cut by the saw, but ultimately choose to allow Dina to die instead.  After witnessing [[Mark Hoffman]]'s survival, Jill Tuck meets Matt Gibson, an internal affairs detective from the precinct where he works, and incriminates him in exchange for protection and immunity from prosecution. Gibson, who has distrusted Hoffman for years, agrees to her terms. Meanwhile, Hoffman abducts a skinhead gang – Dan, Evan, Jake, and Kara – and places them in a junkyard trap that kills them all, leaving the reverse bear trap at the scene to incriminate Jill, who is later put into protective custody. After a meeting of Jigsaw survivors, including Lawrence Gordon, who cauterized his leg on a steam pipe after escaping the bathroom, Hoffman abducts Bobby Dagen, a [[self-help]] guru who achieved fame and fortune by falsifying a story of his own survival. He sends Gibson some videos with cryptic clues to the game's location, offering to end the games if Jill is given to him.  Dagen awakens in a cage in an abandoned asylum and is told that his wife Joyce will die if he doesn't save her within one hour. Joyce is chained at the neck to a steel platform that gradually pulls her down as she watches Dagen's progress. After he escapes the cage, which dangles over a floor of spikes, he begins searching for Joyce. Along the way, he finds Nina, his publicist; Suzanne, his lawyer; and Cale, his best friend and co-conspirator, all in separate traps representing the [[three wise monkeys]] and they are killed despite Dagen's efforts to save them. After removing his upper wisdom teeth to obtain the combination for a security door, Dagen finds Joyce and is forced to reenact the trap he claimed to have survived: he must drive hooks through his pectoral muscles and hoist himself up to the ceiling to deactivate her trap. He fails nonetheless, and is forced to watch as a [[brazen bull]] capsule closes around Joyce and incinerates her to death.  Gibson eventually discovers the game's location and sends a [[SWAT]] team, who are sealed in another room and killed by toxic gas. Simultaneously, he and two officers infiltrate Hoffman's command center in the junkyard, where they find Dan's corpse sitting in front of several monitors connected to the police headquarter's security cameras. He sees Hoffman brought into the morgue in a body bag and tries to warn Palmer, but an automatic [[turret gun]] rises up and kills him along with his men. Hoffman kills Dr. Heffner, Palmer, and everyone else in his path to Jill, who briefly escapes before she is caught and knocked unconscious. He straps her to a chair and locks a reverse bear trap to her head; she awakens as the timer starts and is killed when the trap activates, tearing her jaws apart.  After destroying his workshop, Hoffman is attacked and subdued by three pig-masked figures, one of whom is Lawrence Gordon. Flashbacks show that John Kramer found him unconscious by the steam pipe and nursed him back to health, and Gordon has assisted him ever since. This was known only by Jill, who delivered a package to him at the hospital, which contained a videotape in which Kramer asked him to watch over Jill and take action if anything happened to her. To this end, Gordon has Hoffman brought to the [[Saw (2004 film)|bathroom]] from the first film and shackled by the ankle to a pipe. When Gordon appears, he throws the [[hacksaw]] he used to sever his own foot out the door, turns off the lights, and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.

 In 1942, 10-year-old Sarah Starzynski ([[Mélusine Mayance]]) hides her younger brother from French police by locking him in a secret closet and telling him to stay there until she returns. She takes the key with her when she and her parents are transported to the [[Vélodrome d'Hiver]], where they are held in inhuman conditions by the Paris Police and French Secret Service.  The deportees are transferred to the French-run [[Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp]]. The adults are deported to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], leaving the children in the camp. When Sarah tries to escape with her friend Rachel, a sympathetic Paris police guard spots them.  When Sarah begs him to let them go so she can save her brother, he hesitates then lifts the barbed wire to let them out.  Sarah and Rachel fall asleep in a dog house at a farm where they are discovered by the farmers, Jules and Genevieve Dufaure. Despite knowing what they are and the associated danger, the Dufaures decide to help the girls. Rachel is dying, and when they call attention to themselves by calling in a doctor, a skeptical German officer asks them if they know anything about a second Jewish child.  The officer begins a search for the second child, only to be interrupted when the French physician carries out the dead body of Rachel.  Days later, the Dufaures take Sarah back to her family's apartment building in Paris. Sarah runs up to her apartment, knocking on the door furiously. A boy, 12 years old, answers. She rushes into her old room and unlocks the cupboard. Horrified by what she finds, she starts screaming hysterically.  After the war, Sarah continues to live as a family member with the Dufaures and their two grandsons.  When she turns 18, she moves to the United States, hoping to put everything that happened behind her.  She stops corresponding with the Dufaures when she gets married and has a son, William. When her son is nine, Sarah – still despondent and blaming herself for her brother's death - drives her car into the path of an oncoming truck. It's explained to her son that her death was an accident.  In the present, the French husband of journalist Julia ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]) inherits the apartment of his grandparents (his elderly father was the boy who opened the door to Sarah in August 1942). Having previously done an article on the [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]], Julia finds her interest piqued when she learns that the apartment came into her husband's family at about the time of the Roundup and she begins to investigate what happened 60 years earlier. Her father-in-law tells Julia what he knows so she will quit prying.  Julia begins an obsessive quest to find any trace of Sarah, eventually learning of her life in [[Brooklyn]] and finally locating William in Italy. She meets with him and asks him for information about his mother, but learns to her surprise that William does not know his mother's history or even that she was a Jew, believing only that she had been a French farm girl. Listening in amazement, William rejects the story and dismisses Julia. Later, everything is confirmed to William by his dying father, Richard, including Sarah's suicide. He gives William Sarah's journals and notes, telling him Sarah immediately had William baptized right after his birth, fearing that "being Jewish" was a threat to him and explaining that "...we're all a product of our history." The key to the cupboard is among the items handed to him by his father.  Julia, having given up hope of having another child after years of unsuccessful attempts to conceive, discovers she's pregnant. Her husband, though in the midst of an affair, selfishly loves their life with their 12-year-old daughter, Zoe, as it is and does not want to have another child at this point in life. Julia ultimately decides against an abortion, has a baby girl, divorces her husband and eventually moves with her daughters to New York City.  Two years later, William, having contacted Julia, meets her for a late lunch in a restaurant favored by Sarah and gives her additional information about his mother that the Dafaures had. Julia is amazed and happy for him, and has brought her young daughter along to the meeting. William breaks into tears when Julia tells him her daughter's name is Sarah. Julia comforts him as they both look at little Sarah.

 After wrapping up their latest mystery, Velma gets a call from her mother asking that she check on her younger sister Madelyn, who attends a college for magicians. The gang head off to the Whirlen Merlin Magic Academy, located in an old Irish castle, though getting there proves challenging due to the new GPS Fred got for the Mystery Machine giving bad directions. Once they reach the castle they meet the owner, Whirlen Merlin, along with his brother Marlon, who acts as cook and butler, and Crystal, Whirlen's former stage assistant. Fred is promptly [[wikt:smitten|smitten]], much to Daphne's irritation. The gang learns that a giant [[griffin]] has been scaring away the students and staff. After dinner, Velma, Daphne, and Fred are talking in the hall, when Daphne comments on his attraction to Crystal. Fred explains that she is so graceful, then he and Velma make fun of Daphne's klutziness.  Later that evening, Madelyn, who has had a crush on Shaggy for years, takes him on a romantic walk to in the gardens and show him an ancient sun-dial. Madelyn explains that the gryphon was meant to protect the school, but then the gryphon chases them from the garden. A student takes a picture of the gryphon, which appears on the morning newspaper. The rest of the students leave, so the gang starts taking classes themselves. Meanwhile, Calvin Curdles, a powerful vegetable/variety meats ice-cream guru, continually offers to buy Whirlen's castle from him. The gang promises to investigate to see if Curdles is behind the Gryphon, so he tells the academy's groundskeeper Amos to call if he hears anything new.  Velma finds Daphne practicing ballet so she can be more graceful and capture Fred's attention. The two then stumble on a secret passageway leading to the attic of the school, where they discover (through an old scrapbook) that Alma Rumblebuns, the school's head maid, used to date Calvin Curdles. Meanwhile, Shaggy and Scooby discover the special effects room of the castle, where they are discovered by Ms. Rumblebuns and knock over some chemicals, creating a fog. The room is revealed as Marlon's private laboratory, where he creates holograms and puppets for Whirlen's shows. Madelyn then finds a book about the ancient staff of O'Flannery, the original owner of the castle, which is said to control the gryphon. Even though Amos warns them that the Island where the staff rests is haunted by a [[Banshee]], the gang go to get the staff. They travel to O'Flannery's crypt and recover the staff, but are chased away by the Banshee and narrowly escape.  Afterwards, Shaggy and Madelyn sit down and talk, and Shaggy discovers that he likes Madelyn just as much. But afterwards, the gryphon quickly appears and chases them again. As the gang runs to the castle, Shaggy and Madelyn bump into Amos and misplace the staff with Amos' pitchfork. When Madelyn runs outside to recover the staff, she is kidnapped by the gryphon and taken to its Roost, an ancient, derelict, dilapidated tower. Meanwhile, the gang finds out that Amos has been secretly working for Calvin Curdles to try to get Whirlen to sell the castle. Amos calls Curdles to the castle while the gang goes to rescue Madelyn, and Calvin tries to convince Whirlen to sign over the castle. Whirlen almost does but the gang suggests that they wait before the deal is signed, still believing that Curdles is behind the entire thing.  They get into the tower with the staff, but they are separated in the process when the gryphon attacks. Shaggy and Scooby are left alone while the others get help, and Shaggy discovers the staff is a key to the roost where they rescue Madelyn. But their reunion is quickly cut short again when the gryphon attacks but they are able to escape. Shaggy also throws the staff at the gryphon during the process, causing it to go out of control. Everybody else rushes outside including Curdles. The gryphon crashes to the ground, where they discover that it is actually a giant puppet, controlled from a blimp hidden by a fog machine run by Whirlen's brother Marlon. He had discovered that Lord O'Flannery had mechanical devices imitating a gryphon's beak and talons hidden in the Gryphon's Roost, hoping it would make everyone think a real gryphon lived there. Marlon fixed them, and used the devices to scare trespassers away. He was also behind the banshee, which was only a hologram.  Tired of doing all the real work but getting none of the credit, Marlon decided to use his puppets and illusions to become a famous magician himself, but he needed money to start and the only way was to get Whirlen to sell the castle. So Marlon had his gryphon puppet scare everyone away. He apologizes for trying to make Whirlen fail, knowing how much the school meant to him, not wanting to take away his dream. Whirlen forgives Marlon, and all is well. Velma reveals that Amos found Marlon rebuilding the Gryphon and  told Curdles about it. Curdles reveals he wanted to buy the castle to win back Alma's heart after having left her years before to make something of himself instead of remaining 'a mere sherbet jockey.' He instead got distracted by the money from his vegetable and meat ice cream cones. He decided to buy her the castle that she had loved for years in hopes that she might love him again.  Alma accepts him back and they become a couple again. The Merlin brothers decide to make Madelyn their apprentice and soon after Calvin Curdles sponsors the reopening of the Merlin Brothers' Academy of Magic, where Madelyn performs with Daphne acting as her assistant. In one of the tricks she appears in the seat next to Fred and gently teases him, causing Fred to see her in an all new light. Scooby 'tames' a lion; which is actually the real Scooby controlling a puppet Scooby, which tames the lion.  In the post-credit scene the Mystery Machine's GPS tell the audience that the movie is over and to leave.  
Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster
 School has just ended for the summer, and Velma (Hayley Kiyoko), Shaggy (Nick Palatas), and Scooby-Doo ([[Frank Welker]]) meet up with Fred (Robbie Amell) and Daphne (Kate Melton) so they can go to meet Daphne's uncle, Thornton "Thorny" Blake V, who has given them summer jobs at his country club in Erie Point.  That night at the club's opening party, a huge frog-like monster suddenly appears and wreaks havoc. The gang decides to solve the mystery. They decide to investigate the only person who has ever taken a picture of the lake monster, Mr. Uggins, the lighthouse keeper. He then tells them the story of the lake monster: how when people were first settling Erie Point, an old woman named Wanda Grubwort (who was also a [[witch]]) warned them not to come onto her land. They paid no attention to her, so she used her magic staff - which used moonstones as the source of her power - to turn a frog into a horrible monster that attacked the villagers. Wanda was later tried for witchery and burnt at the stake.  The next day, Velma shows the others security footage of the lake monster meeting a mysteriously masked figure on the beach. They begin to zoom in on the figure to see its face, but Velma accidentally spills her green tea on the computer and destroys the footage.  The next morning, they find Velma unconscious on the beach. Shaggy begins to tell her that he was very worried, but stops when he notices warts on her hand. Velma looks surprised, but guiltily assures them that it's nothing. After they fill her in on the latest monster attack, Daphne says that she saw purple paint on the figure's cloak, and suggests they check out a boat that they saw on the way to Erie Point.  Shaggy asks Velma out on a date. Things go well until he lights a match to light some candles. Velma flings herself back in terror, though she is unsure why. Shaggy calls out the waiter, who turns out to be Scooby, who is angry at Shaggy for ignoring him and tries to ruin the date. Scooby bites Shaggy, causing Shaggy to knock over the table and drop the moonstone on the ground that he was going to give to Velma as a surprise. Fred and Daphne go to see the boat.  The gang drives to the home of the woman who is Wanda's descendant. They see the witch's figure through the windows, which is a very warty Velma. However, she claims to not be Velma and attacks the gang, knocking them out for a moment. The gang wakes up later and find Mrs. Grubwort, who says that her evil ancestor has possessed Velma.  The gang realizes that they missed all the little signs - the warts, Velma's fear of fire, her love of moonstones, and how she spilled the tea on the video of the witch because it was going to show her face - that should have proved Velma was up to something. The woman says that Wanda probably would have gone to the underwater caves. They arrive in the cave and Shaggy bursts out of hiding and commands Velma to stop. Wanda creates three new frog monsters and sends them after the gang, and while Scooby, Fred and Daphne run for their lives, Shaggy stays back and tries to help Velma fight the witch.  Meanwhile, Fred and Daphne reach a dead end. The lake monsters then burst through the wall. At the same time, Shaggy tries to save Velma by singing her favorite song. Velma joins in, and manages to break free of the witch's control. The ghost of Wanda tries to grab her staff, but Scooby Doo arrives just in time and smashes it into a rock, destroying Wanda and turning the monsters back into frogs. Fred and Daphne reconcile with each other and run back to Shaggy, who is confessing how much he really likes Velma. Velma and Shaggy kiss, but afterwards both agree that they did not feel a single spark, and it's better if they are just friends and they all agree as they do a group hug.

Eddy recognizes the pin Jimmy is wearing, which Santa gave him, which proves he knows where he is. Jimmy tells them where to find the real Santa at the Hucklebuckle Toy Store. Will and Quinn know where that is and take them there. Eli tells Jimmy to keep the pin and dubs him an official Santa's helper for his perseverance, before Jimmy heads home.  When Kate and James tell them he's in the hospital, they work together to rescue him and give him back the crystal. But the crystal is too weak to revive Santa. Paws tells Eli to put his crystal next to Santa to help, sacrificing himself as he'll turn back into a stuffed animal. Santa wakes up to find Paws as a stuffed animal. Gus drives the reindeer sled to the toy store, so that they could rush back to the North Pole to save him with the magic icicle. With Christmas around the corner, the icicle doesn't have enough power to spare. Santa sheds a tear over the loss of his best friend, which caused the magic to flow and turn Paws back into a full-grown dog named Santa Paws ([[Mitchel Musso]]) and Christmas is back on. Since Ms. Stout left the children alone and Will and Quinn are missing, Eli had called Mrs. Gibson from Child Services who fires Ms. Stout for her abusive treatments towards the girls and takes over the orphanage.  Kate and James bring Will and Quinn back to the orphanage and decide to adopt them, with them all finally getting the family they always wanted. Later that night, Mrs. Gibson, Janie, and the other girls welcome Gus who brought them Santa's bag full of money he collected while posing as a store Santa. Back at the North Pole, everyone is helping to get ready for Christmas, including Haggis, Rasta and T-Money, who caught a ride with Eli and Eddy back to the North Pole and become official dog elves. Due to the toy store's success as well as donating toys to children in need as Santa had earlier suggested, they turned a profit of one cent, which his grandfather had done every previous year. This allows them to receive the deed to the store, which they decide to keep and continue the tradition through the Hucklebuckle legacy. As Mr. Stewart leaves the store he looks up and speaks to Mr. Hucklebuckle's spirit, bidding him a merry Christmas and that his wish has been fulfilled.

Secretariat (film)
 In 1969, [[Denver]] housewife and mother Penny Chenery ([[Diane Lane]]) agrees to take over her ailing father, Christopher Chenery's Meadow Stables in [[Doswell, Virginia]], despite her lack of horse-racing knowledge.  With the help of veteran trainer Lucien Laurin (Malkovich), Chenery navigates the male-dominated business, ultimately fostering the first Triple Crown winner [[Citation (horse)|in 25 years]] and one of the greatest racehorses of all time.  Penny learns of her mother's death and returns to her childhood home.  She reunites with Mrs. Ham, her father's secretary, and comforts her confused and elderly father. At her mother's funeral, Penny meets [[Arthur B. Hancock, Jr.|Arthur "Bull" Hancock]] and his son, Seth Hancock, of [[Claiborne Farm]] in Kentucky. The Hancocks offer any help she may need during her efforts to bring Meadow Stables back to profitability. Penny's brother Hollis informs her of a dishonest sale that was about to be made by the trainer until their mother stopped him. Penny fires the trainer and asks Bull Hancock to help her find a new trainer. He recommends Lucien Laurin, an aging [[French Canadian]], who initially turns down Penny's offer.  Penny's father had made a deal with leading owner [[Ogden Phipps]] that if Phipps breeds his best stallion ([[Bold Ruler]]) to Chenery's two best mares ([[Somethingroyal]] and Hasty Matelda), the two owners would flip a coin to see who receives which foal. Bold Ruler, the stallion, was fast but couldn't last over distances. Hasty Matelda is the obvious choice for her young age, but Somethingroyal's bloodline is made up of many horses with good stamina. Penny hopes to choose Somethingroyal's foal for the interesting mix of speed and stamina. Phipps wins Hasty Matelda's foal, and Penny wins Somethingroyal's foal, [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]].  When Secretariat enters his first race at [[Aqueduct Racetrack|Aqueduct]] race track in [[Queens]], [[New York City]], everyone has high expectations. The jockey, Paul Feliciano, is very young with little experience, which worries Penny, but Lucien reassures her. During the race, Secretariat is repeatedly hit by other horses and comes in fourth. Penny and Lucien fight, and Lucien blames Paul for the loss. Penny realizes the only way Secretariat will ever win is if he has an experienced jockey. Penny's flight back home is canceled on the day of the race, and she misses her daughter Kate's solo in a play. Her son holds up the pay phone so Penny can hear Kate sing.  Penny gets experienced jockey [[Ron Turcotte]] to ride Secretariat to many victories. Secretariat is named horse of the year after a successful two-year-old season. Penny's father suffers a stroke and dies, leaving Penny and her brother Hollis to inherit the estate. Although she needs six million dollars to pay [[estate tax]]es, Penny refuses to sell Secretariat.  Instead she syndicates the horse, selling 32 shares worth more than six million dollars, as long as he can win a three-year-old distance race. She tries to sell a share to Ogden Phipps, who instead offers to buy the horse for seven million dollars. Penny refuses to sell him. When Phipps demands to know why, she tells him Secretariat's value will triple when he wins the Triple Crown – a feat no horse has accomplished in twenty-five years. During this time, [[Frank "Pancho" Martin]], trainer of rival horse [[Sham (horse)|Sham]], tries to provoke a match race with Secretariat.  Secretariat is taken to the [[Wood Memorial]] three weeks before the first of the Triple Crown races to take on [[Sham (horse)|Sham]] and attempt to earn Penny her syndication money. Turcotte notices that the horse's breathing is heavy, he refuses to eat, and he is reluctant to allow the bit into his mouth. After Secretariat loses the race, an [[abscess]] in his mouth is discovered that may have caused the poor performance.  Secretariat recovers and wins both the [[Kentucky Derby]] and the [[Preakness Stakes|Preakness]] in record time.  Sham comes in second place in both races and Pancho Martin tells Sham's jockey, Laffit Pincay, to stay with Secretariat through the [[Belmont Stakes|Belmont]] in an attempt to tire him early and win.  However, Secretariat runs [[1973 Belmont Stakes|an unbelievable race]], finishing 31 [[Horse length|lengths]] (over ) ahead of the next horse to secure the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]].  An exhausted Sham ends up in last place, having failed to keep up with Secretariat's record-breaking pace.  Penny and her family receive the Triple Crown trophy at the end of the race.

A woman walks with a monk in a forest and talks to him about her concern for her son after a disturbing dream.  A young woman named Poon is swimming laps at a pool when a mysterious figure appears to her. After showering, Poon again sees mysterious figures, who turn out to be her friends and her boyfriend Nat playing a trick on her. They convince her to go to a club with them even though she doesn't want to.  After they leave the club, Poon convinces Nat to visit his mother. Nat doesn't want to, but they go visit anyway. His mother is the woman who was speaking to the monk about her son, and it is obvious that she does not approve of Poon. Nat's mother asks him to visit the temples, to which he begrudgingly agrees.<ref></ref>  After Nat and Poon pay their respects at the first temple, Nat meets a novice monk in the forest. He soon realizes that the monk is Sujitto, an old friend of his. Sujitto joins Nat and Poon on their journey. The three continue on their road trip to another temple, where Nat and Sujitto experience very disturbing visions. They continue on their journey; on the way to the fifth temple the car's windshield is broken by three troublemakers on motorbikes. Nat chases them but they get away. Nat and Poon drop the monk off at a temple, then take the car back to the mechanic in town for repairs.  At a small bar, Nat and Poon have a disagreement. She goes outside to smoke a cigarette, where a ghostly figure is watching her from the balcony above her. Poon returns to the bar and continues the argument with Nat. There's a blackout, and Poon falls. Nat carries her upstairs to the bedroom. Nat and Poon start to get intimate, while the figure of a ghostly child watches them.  The next morning they go to a cafe, but Poon vomits on the street. Nat asks if she's pregnant, but she dodges the question. They go to pick up Sujitto, who has agreed to attend a funeral for a family. Nat and Poon transport Sujitto and two other monks to the funeral, which takes them into the night. Nat thinks he sees the young man who damaged his windshield and pursues him into an old fishery, where he falls into the water and is overrun by eels. He disappears into the water. Poon finds Nat in the temple at the funeral, bleeding from the head. Nat realizes that the funeral was for the boy he was chasing.  They leave the temple with Poon driving. Poon hits a calf in the road, and sees the mother standing on the side of the road watching. Poon gets very upset, and they attempt to take the calf to get help. The man they've found to help slaughters the calf instead, saying it was too late and that he wanted to keep the animal from suffering.  They continue on to the next temple, where Poon is trying to make spiritual amends for killing the cow. She is attacked by a deformed, decomposed child-sized demon-like figure, who shows her disturbing images of a young boy with burns on half his face being abused by his mother. She wakes up and asks Sujitto what is happening; he tells her that Karma is mysterious and beyond reason. She and Nat get into a physical confrontation and Poon slaps Nat, who leaves her and Sujitto behind.  Nat decides to track down Poon and Sujitto, and they continue on to the next temple when they hit something else in the road. Poon wanders off and is attacked again. This time it is revealed that she is reliving the abuse and death of the young, burned boy she saw in her vision back at the previous temple. Poon believes that she is seeing images of her past life.She reveals to Nat that she's pregnant and was considering an abortion, which she thinks is the same thing that her "mother' did to her in her previous life.  The trio make it to the final temple, where Nat and Poon say goodbye to Sujitto, but Poon realizes that she is in the location of her vision, the place where the boy killed his father by knocking him off a roof, and his mother dragged him by a chain into the woods. She and Nat find the shack where the boy was left to die after his mother's suicide. Nat's mother arrives, and reveals that Nat is not her only son. Sujitto is also there, and he is revealed to be Nat's twin. Nat's mother left him at a monastery when he was an infant in order to try to cheat Karma. Sujitto realizes that he can not escape Karma, and Poon realizes that he's standing on a well. The well collapses, and Sujitto falls into the well, an expression of perfect peace on his face. Nat, Poon, and Nat's mother leave the temple. Nat gives his mother a present he'd been holding for a long time, and they continue the drive home.

Secrets in the Walls
 Molly, Lizzie (two sisters), and their mom, Rachel, move from downtown Detroit to [[Ferndale, Michigan]], into a very old house. After many strange things begin to happen, Rachel does some research on the house's history and finds out that the house was owned in the 1950s by a 17-year-old [[Germans|German]] girl, Greta, and her abusive husband, and that while she lived there, she went missing and was never seen again. Upon searching the house, Rachel and her brother discover the girl's [[skeleton]] boarded up inside the wall of Lizzie's bedroom with scratch marks on the wood inside, suggesting she was locked in there while still alive. They assume that by releasing her remains, she can move on in peace to the spirit realm. However, after being locked up for so long and deprived of her life, Greta isn't so compliant.  Lizzie is the same age as Greta was when she died, so Greta uses her powers to trade places with Lizzie by means of a necklace that belonged to her when she was alive. Molly sees right through Greta, knowing that she isn't Lizzie, but no one else believes her. Meanwhile, Rachel's friend, who is skilled at dealing with spirits, has come to try to get rid of Greta's presence, not knowing that her spirit and Lizzie's have switched places. She almost banishes Lizzie's spirit to the afterlife when Molly enters, disturbing the ritual, and explains to Rachel and her friend what is really going on. Rachel plays along the next day, acting as if she doesn't know Lizzie's body is inhabited by Greta, and lures her back to the house. While on the large staircase, she confronts Greta, asking if she knows why she named her daughter Lizzie, something the real Lizzie would know in an instant. Greta has no idea, and the two begin to fight. Rachel has Lizzie/Greta pinned, hanging over the banister of the stairs, and starts calling Lizzie to fight Greta off and take back her body. With a surge of strength, Greta tries to fight Rachel off one last time. Lizzie is finally able to get back in her body and she says "Mom?", but then she falls off the edge of the stairs. When she hits the ground, she is severely damaged. After several minutes, Lizzie regains consciousness with the words, "You named me Elizabeth because she was strong" referring to Elizabeth in [[Pride and Prejudice]], Rachel's favorite book.   Rachel moves out with Molly and Lizzie, only to discover the person who sold them the house already leading new potential buyers inside. Rachel feels morally obligated to warn the potential customers of the house's past and her experience in it, but they write her off as crazy. She seems content to have tried, and drives off with her two daughters and her brother. The very last scene shows the buyers walking in as Rachel's family drives away, and Greta's ghost glaring after them out of an upstairs window, suggesting that she is not ready to give up the life she never had quite yet.

Sella Turcica (film)
  While serving in the Middle East, Sergeant Bradley Roback and his squad vanished while on patrol, their equipment and vehicles being found abandoned, with no signs of a struggle. Days after their disappearance, Brad and ten of the other twelve missing soldiers turned up unconscious outside of their base. When the men woke up in the [[Landstuhl Regional Medical Center|LRMC]] in Germany, they were found to be suffering from unexplainable physical impairments. Brad lost the ability to walk, taste and see in color, and is plagued by frequent and severe headaches that are exacerbated by high-pitched noise.  Brad is sent home to his family, where his condition causes some tension, something not helped by his sister Ashley's insensitive boyfriend, Gavyn. As hours pass, Brad's body and mind deteriorate. He has periods of unresponsiveness, suffers from seizures, a wound on his right foot worsens, he becomes more gaunt, his eyes and tongue swell, his fingernails and teeth yellow, and he begins expelling a black fluid from his ears, mouth and anus. In the morning after his return, Brad is found by his mother, Karmen, ingesting a large amount of salt in the kitchen, having apparently entered the room under his own power. As his mother gets his wheelchair from the parlor, Brad returns to his bed, and becomes semi-catatonic, refusing to move and denying that he needs to go to a hospital when his brother Bruce suggests it.  When Gavyn stops by, his blunt comments about Brad's condition and his relationship with Ashley sparks a fight between him and Bruce. After Bruce goes outside to cool off, and gets into an argument with his mother in the yard, Brad (who has just killed and ate the family dog, Fulci) wheels into the kitchen, stands up, and attacks Gavyn. Gavyn's screams alert Bruce and Karmen, who find him dead from severe head trauma, and Brad convulsing on the floor. As Bruce tries to revive Brad, Ashley (who had just arrived home from dance practice) leads their mother out of the room. As soon as Ashley and Karmen leave, Brad springs to life, rips Bruce's lower jaw off, and clumsily stumbles after his mother and sister, emitting animalistic noises.  Brad finds Ashley and Karmen, and kills the former by punching through a door and impaling her through the neck on the splintered wood, subsequently ripping her head off. As Brad struggles to get to her, Karmen bludgeons him with a metal wall ornament, prompting a slug-like creature to burst out of his [[sella turcica]] (seemingly confirming Brad's earlier, sarcastic theory that he and his squad were abducted and experimented on by aliens). Karmen beats Brad and the entity to death, and the film ends with home movies of the Robacks, and Karmen's husband returning home to discover his wife has hanged herself in the garage.

The Sentimental Engine Slayer
 ''The Sentimental Engine Slayer'' tells the compelling, confounding tale of the overdue coming of age of a twenty-something misfit named Barlam. Barlam's awkward transition from boy to man is as much the story of struggling to find one's essence in a world of stereotypes as it is an indictment of the distorted reality of family life in the disengaged 21st century. A bottom-rung grocery bagger whose neo-incestuous relationship with his addict sister, Natalia, causes him no small amount of grief and disillusionment, Barlam seeks solace in the convoluted wisdom of what few male peers are available, namely his androgynous, alcoholic boss, Oscar, and the sister's simple-minded boyfriend, Zack. Seeking an explanation as to the strange circumstances of his apparent lack of family structure, as well as the respect from others fundamentally absent in his mundane model-building existence, Barlam is soon led astray amid a seedy underworld of prostitutes, hustlers and addicts. The labyrinthine plot soon begs questioning as to where reality ends and fantasy begins, Barlam shifting effortlessly between hapless punching bag, assertive surrogate father figure, and rage-prone psychopath.<ref>[http://rodriguezlopezproductions.com/TSES/ The Sentimental Engine Slayer]</ref>

A Serbian Film
 Financially struggling Miloš, a former porn star known for his talent, lives with his wife, Marija, and six-year-old son, Petar. His brother, Marko, a corrupt police officer, is attracted to Marija and is jealous of Miloš's sexual prowess. Marija is curious about her husband's past and is concerned about the family's income. Lejla, a former co-star, offers Miloš a starring role in an art film directed by Vukmir, an independent pornographer, who wishes to cast Miloš for his powerful erection. Having already caught Petar watching one of his films and unaware of the details of Vukmir's film, Miloš is hesitant to participate and continue his career, but accepts to secure his family's financial future. While meeting Vukmir, Miloš passes a bald man and his entourage, regarding them warily.  Filming begins at an orphanage, where Vukmir feeds Miloš instructions through an earpiece given by Vukmir's driver, Raša, while a film crew follows him. Miloš sees a young woman being physically abused and scolded by her mother, having disgraced her deceased war hero husband's memory by becoming a prostitute. In a dark room, screens show Jeca, a girl of indeterminate age, seductively eating an ice pop, while Miloš is [[Fellatio|fellated]] by a nurse. Then, Miloš is instructed to receive fellatio from the mother, while Jeca watches. Miloš refuses, but is forced to continue. Marko later informs him that Vukmir is a former psychologist and has worked in children's television and state security.  Miloš meets with Vukmir, announcing that he is retiring and dropping out of the film, but Vukmir explains to a hesitant Miloš his artistic style of pornography, showing a film of a woman giving birth to a newborn baby, a baby which is then immediately raped by Raša, much to the joy of the mother. The disgusted and horrified Miloš storms out and drives away as Vukmir boasts to him that this is "a new genre" and that he terms it as "newborn porn". At a road junction, being in a disturbed state of mind, he is approached and seduced by an attractive woman who, unbeknownst to him, is Vukmir's doctor.  A bloodied Miloš wakes up in his bed the next morning with no memory of what has happened. He returns to the now abandoned set and finds a number of tapes. Viewing them, Miloš discovers that he was drugged to induce an aggressive, sexually aroused, and suggestible state. At Vukmir's manipulative direction, Miloš beat and decapitated Jeca's mother while raping her and was later raped by one of the guards. He then watches footage of Lejla voicing concern for Miloš to Vukmir, stating that she is quitting and taking Miloš with her. A bloodied Lejla is then shown restrained, with a blood puddle and several teeth in the floor right in front of her. A masked man appears and she is forced to fellate him, suffocating her to death. The footage continues as Miloš is led to Jeca's home, where an elderly woman praises him for killing Jeca's mother, laments about Jeca's father dying before he "made her a woman", and offers Jeca as a "virgin commune". Miloš refuses, threatens to cut off his penis with a knife, and escapes through a window. After wandering the streets for a while, he ends up huddling in an alleyway, where he watches as a teenage girl passes by while being tailed by a pair of thugs. He begins masturbating and is assaulted by the thugs before they are killed by Raša, who along with Vukmir takes Miloš to a warehouse.  At the warehouse, Vukmir's doctor administers more drugs to Miloš, who in an angry outburst sticks a syringe into her neck, rendering her unconscious from the overdose. He is then taken into a big room, where he is conducted to have intercourse with two hidden bodies placed under sheets and with bags on their heads. Miloš furiously begins penetrating them while keeping them restrained, and as he swaps from one onto the other, the masked man from Lejla's film enters and begins raping the first. Vukmir then reveals the masked man to be Marko, his victim to be Marija, and finally, that Miloš is raping Petar. At this moment, the agonizing female doctor enters the room, with her crotch entirely covered in blood and a bloody pipe on her hand, attracting everyone's attention before collapsing dead. Snapping, an enraged Miloš lunges at Vukmir and repeatedly smashes his head against the floor, initiating a brawl during which Marija bites off a piece of Marko's neck, then bludgeons him to death with a sculpture. Miloš wrestles with the guards and seizes one of their guns, shooting both of them and injuring the one-eyed Raša, whom he kills by ramming his erect penis into his empty eye socket. During all of this, a dying Vukmir praises Miloš's actions as truly worthy of cinema.  Miloš, having recalled his actions up to that point, including locking his wife and son in their basement before passing out earlier, smashes Marko's head with the sculpture in a fit of impotence and despair, before returning home to find both of them in shock, with Petar totally unresponsive. After coping with the matter for hours, Miloš and his wife ultimately agree, in silence, that they and their son should die together, so the three gather in bed and embrace before Miloš fires a fatal shot through himself, Petar and Marija. Sometime later, a new film crew, including the bald man from the beginning of the film, is shown recording in the bedroom. One of the security guards begins to unzip his pants and the director, the unnamed bald man, advises him to "start with the little one".

Hearts are broken and healed, friendships are formed and lost. Childish ways are thrown out in exchange for seeds of maturity in what may be the beginning of a bumpy ride towards the chaos of adulthood."

With Charita he runs away, chased by the owner who sold the giraffe but had not delivered it yet to the buyer. They are arrested and locked up by the police. Charita returns the wallet to Jimmy, withholding money for cleaning the car windows. They are friends now. Jimmy is released when his mother comes to collect him. The mother of their maid knows about the giraffe, and explains to Jimmy that it is one of the "seven of Daran", magical animals which each watch over one continent. This convinces Jimmy that he has to do what the giraffe instructed him to do. He leaves a note for his mother that he is going on a mission, and frees Charita from the police cell. Together they go to the war zone to be, to prevent the war, as Jimmy was told to do by the giraffe.  A [[child soldier]] from the Bombatta tribe shoots Jimmy in his leg, but despite that and the fact that the child soldier and the girl are from the opposing tribes, the three become friends. They are caught by the owner of the giraffe, and taken by car to help finding the giraffe, or similar ones. Jimmy's mother, who found out where Jimmy was going, comes by helicopter to search for him. She sees Jimmy in the car, after which the pilot attacks the car, and the three children are freed. Jimmy learns from his mother that she has caused the hostility between the tribes because she wants to make a [[golf course]], which one tribe wants to earn money, but the other opposes because it is on [[Sacred#Sacred ground|ground that is sacred for them]].  Jimmy's mother does not allow Jimmy to go and try to prevent the war, but he sneaks with the other two children into the helicopter, and Jimmy flies away; he has learned flying from a [[flight simulator]] game on his computer. They arrive in the war zone, where later the mother also arrives. Jimmy is hit by a bullet, but saved by the fact that the bullet hits the pendant. His mother agrees to abandon the plan for the golf course, and the tribes reconcile.  
Sex and the City 2
 [[Carrie Bradshaw|Carrie]], [[Samantha Jones (Sex and the City)|Samantha]], [[Charlotte York Goldenblatt|Charlotte]], and [[Miranda Hobbes|Miranda]] meet up. In [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] Carrie is depicted arriving in [[New York City]] in 1986, then met Charlotte in 1987, Miranda in 1989. She also meets Samantha, when she was a bartender at the music club [[CBGB]].  In the present, three of the four women are married but Samantha, who at 52, is desperately trying to keep her [[libido]] alive with the help of "[[Suzanne Somers]] [[Bioidentical hormone replacement therapy|and her team of doctors]]" to keep her [[menopause]] at bay.  The four of them attend Anthony and Stanford's wedding, where Carrie serves as "best man." Miranda quits her job after the [[misogynistic]] new managing partner disrespects her once too often. Charlotte's two children are a handful (mostly her two-year-old daughter Rose's extreme and constant crying) and she's worried that Harry is attracted to their [[busty|buxom]] Irish nanny, Erin. Carrie's marriage to [[Mr. Big (Sex and the City)|Mr. Big]] has settled down, though they differ on how to spend their spare time. For their anniversary, Carrie gives Mr. Big a vintage [[Rolex]] watch engraved with a romantic message, while he, much to her dismay, shows her a new TV in their bedroom as his gift, which Big says they can use to watch old movies together, something they did at the hotel at Anthony and Stanford's wedding and seemed to enjoy. Carrie, however, is disappointed, as she had hoped for jewelry as a gift.  Meanwhile, Samantha has been approached by an [[Arab]] [[sheikh]] to devise a [[Public Relations|PR]] campaign for his business. He offers to fly her and her friends on an all-expenses-paid luxury vacation to [[Abu Dhabi]]. The girls happily accept, although Carrie is worried about the separation from Big and Charlotte is worried about leaving her husband alone with the nanny. Only Miranda, unfettered by a job for the first time in her life, is enthusiastic. Upon entering Abu Dhabi, Samantha's hormone-enhancing drugs are confiscated under [[UAE]] law. This renders her devoid of estrogen; her famous libido goes dead. Charlotte tries to call Harry every few minutes; Miranda revels in the luxury surrounding her, while Carrie befriends her manservant, Gaurau, who is an underpaid temporary worker from [[India]].  Carrie runs into her former lover, [[Sex and the City characters#Aidan Shaw|Aidan]]. He proposes dinner à deux at his hotel and she decides to meet Aidan for dinner. The dinner is very enjoyable, with the two discussing old times. Aidan remarks on the ways Carrie is "not like other women". In a moment of remembered passion, they kiss. Carrie runs away in panic and returns to the hotel. Back at the hotel, Miranda and Charlotte have drinks together and discuss the difficulties of motherhood. Carrie arrives, tells her friends about the [[kiss]], and asks them whether she should tell Big, as they have no secrets between them. Miranda reflects on the events of the previous film, when her husband, [[Steve Brady|Steve]], told her about his affair. Samantha counsels Carrie to wait before deciding anything. Carrie opts to call Big to tell him. Big is silent upon hearing the news, and after saying a few words, hangs up.  The four women find their style and [[Western culture|Western attitudes]] contrast with [[Muslim]] customs. While on a date with a handsome Dane, Samantha is arrested for [[public indecency]] after fondling him at a restaurant and making out with him on the beach. With the Sheikh's intervention, Samantha is released, but is left with a permanent [[police]] record. Worse, the Sheikh decides to cancel the PR meeting and ceases paying for the remainder of the women's luxurious stay. They are told they have 1 hour to either pay $22,000 a night for the rest of their stay or leave. They quickly pack their bags and leave, but must return to the [[souq]] to find Carrie's [[passport]]. When Samantha's flamboyance nearly incites a riot, the girls are rescued by a group of Emirati women who share their sense of style under their [[abaya|black robes]].  When Carrie returns home, she finds the bedroom television removed and Big gone. She passes an anxious day, at the end of which he returns. Big tells her that although he was "pretty torn up", he realizes that what she needs is something to remind her at all times that she is married. He hands her a jewelry box, which reveals an engagement ring set with a black diamond. When Carrie asks him why a black diamond, he says, "Because you're not like anyone else", echoing Aidan's earlier comment.  Big and Carrie combine their interests; Charlotte's nanny, Erin, turns out to be a [[lesbian]] and is no threat to her marriage; Miranda finds a new job at a more laid back and diverse [[law firm]] where she is appreciated, and Samantha stays the same, even meeting up with the Danish architect she met in Abu Dhabi for sex on the beach, this time a beach in [[The Hamptons]].  
Shaapit
  The film opens with Aman ([[Aditya Narayan]])  seemingly lifeless, narrating how he and his sweetheart Kaya are doomed to perish together. He remembers happier times, when he met and courted and finally proposed to Kaya. No sooner than he had proposed, they had met with a sudden car accident. They are miraculously unhurt saved with few minor injuries. But when Kaya's parents realise Aman had proposed to her, they become sad and grave, and Kaya's  mother earnestly persuades her father to tell them the truth.  Kaya's mother reveals the curse upon their family. Kaya's  father is a descendant of an ancient royal family. Some 300 years ago, the brother of the late king RANA Ranjit Singh had attempted to molest a beautiful girl in the palace. The girl escaped and jumped to her death. It turned out that the girl was the daughter of the royal guru, "Acharya Sachidanand", and that the girl was about to be wed. The ''acharya'', a wise and powerful spiritual master, was enraged beyond belief. He pronounced a terrible curse upon Ranjit Singh: no daughter in Ranjit Singh's line shall ever enjoy marriage; if they ever attempt to marry or become engaged, they will immediately meet with death.  Aman and Kaya are devastated.They reach out to professor Pashupati, an expert in the occult. The professor explains that generational curses (such as the one upon Kaya are typically connected with an evil spirit. This spirit is the keeper of the curse, and it executes the curse (by taking the lives of the victims). Aman recollects that the evil spirit had caused their car accident. Aman suggested to  destroy the spirit. The bemused professor laughs this off and urges Aman to forget Kaya and move on. Aman and his friend Shubh are disappointed.  Aman is persistent. He looks up some of the professors work and retrieves (in a dangerous chase with an evil spirit) a "cursed" book from the library. Convinced that Aman is determined and capable, the professor agrees to help them.Their first stop is an abandoned cinema. The professor explains that it is haunted by several spirits, and some of the noble spirits may be able to help them locate the evil curse-keeper. Aman and Kaya enter the theatre. They are surrounded by spirits, and one of them splatters a few drops of blood on Kaya's wrists. The professor interprets: the drops are the co-ordinates of the ancient kingdom of Magha, present day Mahipalpur.  They arrive at Mahipalpur and settle into the decrepit government guest house. The evil spirit is relentless. It attacks Kaya and tries to bury her alive. They save her just in time, but she goes into hypoxic shock. The professor describes a water-immersion method to send Shubh back in time. Shubh is again attacked by the spirit, but this time he returns with an amulet. The amulet reveals the clue that leads them to Rani Mohini, the evil spirit, the keeper of the curse.  Aided by the curator of the 300-year-old Magha jail, the professor performs a seance to invoke the spirit of Ranjit Singh. This spirit reveals the sinister history of the royal family. Rani Mohini was never satisfied with her station as the second wife of Raja Gajsingh. She was also a sorceress. She plotted to assassinate the King and his two sons, Rana Ranjeet Singh and Kuljeet. Her assassins killed Raja Gajsingh, but were ultimately defeated and killed by the royal guard. Ranjit Singh ascended the throne, and, upon learning of Rani Mohini's dark powers, promptly arranged to execute her. Rani Mohini, however, created a black charm (locked in an amulet) to keep her soul on earth. Upon her execution, her soul became the keeper of the curse (by ''Acharya'' Sachidanand) and would torment Ranjit Singh's family forever.  Kaya's conditions worsens. She is wheeled into surgery. The professor and Aman and Shubh hurry into the River Palace to confront the evil spirit of Rani Mohini. They connect the clues from the amulet and from Ranjit Singh, and deduce that the spirit of Mohini can be despatched to the nether world when her mortal remains (ashes) are dissolved. Aman & Shubh start searching the ashes with professor's help. They then stumble upon a portrait statue wherein they find 8 earthen pots instead of seven. Shubh & Aman conclude that the ashes are hidden over there. They retrieve the pot but Mohini's spirit kills the professor brutally and chases them to destroy their efforts. After a difficult and lengthy battle with the spirit, Aman floods the River Palace. He nearly drowns (and cuts back to the initial frame), but Shubh saves him just in time. The film ends with Aman narrating how the power of love can overcome any obstacle. At the end of the movie, they got married and blessed with a baby girl.

The Servant (2010 film)
   Throughout the movie, the scene switches between the 'present' Bang providing the narration, and the flashback events of his past.   While a servant, Bangja shares his rooms with Mr. Ma, a notorious womanizer and self-stylized Lothario. Bangja escorts his master (Mong-ryong) to an evening out at the local pleasure house, where they are witness to a performance by the madam's daughter Chunhyang. While trying to arrange a meeting between Chunhyang and his rather clumsy and socially awkward master, Bangja defends Mong-ryong from a larger, disgruntled patron and inadvertently impresses both Chunhyang and her maidservant Hyangdan.   Mr. Ma begins to coach the simple, honest Bangja in the ways of seducing women, which Bang uses to secure a picnic outing for Mong-ryong with Chunhyang through Hyangdan. During the excursion, Bangja so astounds the ladies by cooking meat to perfection, recovering Chunhyang's slipper from the waterfall pool, and carrying her on his back after she injured her ankle, that a love triangle rapidly begins to form between the two women and Bangja, much to the consternation of Mong-ryong, though he boasts that he is slowly luring Chunhyang to him by playing hard to get.   While his master continues to study, Bangja attempts to court Chunhyang. Mr. Ma continues to provide instruction to Bangja, assuaging his concerns when he thinks his master may have slept with her, and pushing him to seize upon spending the night with her before his master can. Though Bangja's seduction is clumsy and his approach very tentative, Chunhyang begins to fall for him and makes love to him on several occasions. Due to his low social-standing, however, she seeks to marry Mong-ryong and enlists Bangja's help in order to make this plan a reality.   When Mong-ryong is called away to Seoul to finish studying and take his exam he asks Bangja to recover a written promise he gave Chunhyang about marrying her. She catches Bangja as he tries to steal the paper, and switches it for a confession letter she wrote and got him to sign the night the two of them first had sex. Mong-ryong reads the letter and dismisses Bangja from his service for having deceived him.   Three years pass, and Bangja and Chunhyang grow closer and continue to love each other while Bangja becomes the servant of Chunhyang's house and runs errands for a local strong man. However, Chunhyang begins to take after her mother and grows increasingly manipulative despite her burgeoning love for Bangja.   In Seoul, Mong-ryong takes his exams and becomes a Royal Inspector. After insulting the court eunuchs however, he is accorded a lowly position in his home town, subservient to the new governor.   Mong-ryong finds Hyangdan has become the madam of her own house and runs a successful business. She sleeps with Mong-ryong and asks him if she is not more desirable and pleasing than Chunhyang, but expresses remorse that Bangja chose Chunhyang over her.   Mong-ryong discusses women with his magistrate and later returns to Chunhyang's house. Mong-ryong goes for a walk with Chunhyang, and though it is not revealed what the two discussed, Chunhyang returns with a pleased expression and an expectation of seeing Mong-ryong again.   The magistrate visits Chunhyang's house and after a confrontation with his own clerks and then Bangja, is greeted by a beautiful, but uncooperative Chunhyang who refuses to sit and pour his drinks because she is not a [[gisaeng]]. Enraged by her arrogance, the governor beats Bangja when he attempts to interfere, and has Chunhyang imprisoned. Bangja goes to Mong-ryong and implores his old master to help save her life.   Later, during a celebration, the magistrate is seen in a back room attempting to sexually excite Chunhyang because Mong-ryong had told him that she would only bow to his wishes and fulfill his desires if he were violent with her. Bangja causes a commotion to get the magistrate to release her, but is saved from being beaten by the guards when Mong-ryong arrives with a large contingent of guards. Mong-ryong arrests the magistrate and has Chunhyang whipped for her insolence until Bangja interferes, claiming that she has a husband whom she was remaining faithful to. Chunhyang stabs herself with a small blade, saying to Mong-ryong (whose face was hidden) that she wanted news of her death taken to Master Lee Mong-ryong.   Bangja is visited in his cell, first by Mr. Ma, who warns him to never beg a woman to stay, then by Chunhyang, who reveals that she and Mong-ryong planned the whole event after he returned from his exams. For the first time, Bangja confesses his love to Chunhyang. She then tells Mong-ryong that she will not leave without Bangja, and so the three of them depart the city together. When the trio stop at the waterfall where they had their first excursion years before, Mong-ryong pushes Chunhyang down the falls and she is seen face-down in the water. Bangja dives in to save her and runs away, carrying her on his back as he did when she injured her ankle.   The 'present' Bangja tells the writer that he ran from Mong-ryong and his agents for a long time after those events. The last thing he does to bring the story to close is bring the writer to the back of his warehouse to see Chunhyang who survived the fall, but was left with [[brain damage]] and has 'become a child'.   The writer declares that Bangja is an amazing man and will make him the hero of a wonderful story about a servant's love, but Bangja insists that the story be told with her fabricated fidelity being the truth, and Chunhyang living happily ever after with a Lee Mong-ryong who loved her and returned for her. When asked why, he says it was because it was something she never got to have, and he is happy with being the hero in his heart.   Bangja requests one scene be written to demonstrate the love between the two characters, which he demonstrates by carrying Chunhyang around the room on his back and singing a variation of the song ''Sarangga'' from the [[pansori]] [[Chunhyangga]] while she smiles lovingly and snowflakes slowly fall on them from the open roof.   The last scenes are of people in the village where they lived, the times when she entertained guests at her house with her singing, and of her shoe in the ice below the waterfall where he saved her.

He later befriends Anthony when he saves him during an attack on Japanese officers by the Chinese Resistance at a night club.  Paul realizes that it was Anthony's wife, Anna ([[Gong Li]]) who actually organized the attack and is the leader of the resistance. He then decides to help her pass on messages. After finally meeting up with Conner's contact in the Japanese Consulate, Paul finds out that Conner had an affair with a Japanese girl named Sumiko ([[Rinko Kikuchi]]) and after searching her place, Paul uncovers numerous photos, which Conner took, in a darkroom nearby. Some of the photos include Captain Tanaka, other Japanese officers and the [[Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga|aircraft carrier ''Kaga'']].  Unconvinced that Sumiko betrayed Conner, he determines to find the girl and get the answers he seeks. After a few more encounters with Anna, Anthony, Captain Tanaka, and investigating at an opium house, Paul realizes that Sumiko was Captain Tanaka's lover and was seduced by Conner to spy for him. Paul's cover is blown when Conner's contact is arrested, and Paul gets interrogated by Captain Tanaka regarding the whereabouts of Sumiko, whose location he does not know. After being released, Anna takes Paul to a safe house where she has been hiding Sumiko, who is on the verge of death due to withdrawal from opium and possibly other illnesses.  Outside, Anthony Lan-Ting arrives with Captain Tanaka who he gave away the location of the safe house. It was the only way for him to save Anna from arrest. Inside the safe house, Tanaka informs Paul that the Japanese fleet started [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacking Pearl Harbor]] one hour earlier and that the [[History of Shanghai#World War II and the Japanese Occupation|invasion of Shanghai]] is also underway. Tanaka admits to killing Conner, but only out of jealousy as he found out about Conner and Sumiko. A visibly distraught Tanaka asks for Paul's help in administering drugs to ease Sumiko's death. After Sumiko dies, everyone gets ready to leave, but Tanaka wants to question Anna which infuriates Anthony. He then guns down Tanaka's bodyguards and seriously wounds Tanaka himself. Before he can kill Tanaka, Anthony is fatally wounded by a dying bodyguard.  Leaving behind a wounded Tanaka, Paul drives the Lan-Tings away through the burning streets of Shanghai and with his last words, Anthony asks Paul to take Anna out of Shanghai, which he successfully does. Before getting on the ship, Paul and Anna encounter Tanaka once again, but Tanaka decides not to acknowledge them, perhaps because Paul helped him at Sumiko's deathbed and spared his life after being shot. It is revealed later that both Paul and Anna, at some point, returned to Shanghai.<ref name="firstshowing20071127"></ref>

Shake, Rattle and Roll XII
  ===Mamanyiika===  ====Overview==== SRR 12's first episode "Mamanyiika" plays on the words "mama" and "manyika" which literally means "mother doll". The story of a possessed doll is being starred by Shaina Magdayao, child star Elijah Alejo and Ricky Davao. Directed by Zoren Legaspi, it also features Jackie Lou Blanco, Malou Crisologo, Rita Avila, Jed Madela, and Mahal as the voice of the doll. Carmina Villarroel has a cameo role on the episode.  ====Plot==== Some years ago, Abel (Ricky Davao) was incapacitated by a passing car while his wife Gail (Jackie Lou Blanco) was killed in a hit-and-run accident, after a serious fight, leaving Abel widowed with his two children, Ara (Shaina Magdayao) and Abigail (Elijah Alejo).  After visiting her mother's grave, Abigail picked up a seemingly-disposed-of doll in a nearby barrow. Ara, being suspicious of the doll, demanded her sister throw it away. This soon culminated in a sisterly fight, on which one instance, the doll sprang to life and comforted Abigail. It was revealed that Gail's spirit possessed the doll.  Traumatized after being assaulted by the doll, Ara destroyed her little sister's toy, despite of Abigail watching the scene horribly. Abel, deciding this was the final straw for Ara, ordered the doll to be disposed of in the creek. Soon, the doll assassinated two garbage men and returned to the Federicos house, seeking vengeance against Abigail, who was given a new set of dolls by her father.  A subplot shows that the doll used to belong to Dorothy Cruz, an infertile woman who succumbed to insanity after learning her medical condition. Her husband Manuel (Jed Madela) refuses to give any comments to the doll. It was not Gail's spirit who was in the doll, but Dorothy's after all.   One night, the mother doll launched its final execution against the family, resulting with Ara gaining the upper hand. Taunted by the doll imitating her mother's voice, she [Ara] shot the doll squarely after it attempted to murder Abigail. The doll sank under the pool, but recovered and was adopted by a street child.  Thus, a new chapter for the doll's terror began.  ===Isla (Engkanto)===  ====Overview==== Sometimes referred to as "Isla", Topel Lee takes the helm of SRR XII's second episode, which is the tale of three girls, one of them the apple of the eye of a terrible engkanto, who then captures the girl. This stars Andi Eigenmann for her SRR debut role. Rayver Cruz, John Lapus, Kristel Moreno, Solo Kiggins, and Regine Angeles accompany Andi on the episode with Niña Jose having a special participation.  ====Plot==== A lost girl (Nina Jose) was separated from her friends while on a vacation. Lost in the woods, she was incapacitated by an unknown entity, which transforms her into an unimaginable creature.  In the present, Andrea (Andi Eigenmann) was accompanied by her friends Ces (Kristel Moreno) and Belle (Regine Angeles) on a vacation in a seemingly-remote island. Upon setting foot on the island, rumors circulated the trio that a man named Ray (Rayver Cruz) had lost his girlfriend during a holiday in the very same place. Dismissing the hearsay, the trio spent the night with a bonfire. Ces, who has a knowledge of the occult, performs a ritual to help the brokenhearted Andrea find the man for her.  Tensions rose as disappearances of Andrea startled the group, with their friend reappearing in the morning with muddy feet. Scenes showed that Andrea was led by fairies into a cave and was offered delicious food by an elemental or "engkanto" as well as asking her to stay and offering her to give her everything she wants if she decides to do so. Counseled by a "witch doctor", Malay (John Lapus), Andrea was the next target of the "engkanto" of the island, whom Malay said was the king of the isle. Afterwards, they met Ray himself. The girls seemed to be cold with the guy, as he was cold to them either.  No sooner than the disappearances worsen, a group of fairies dubbed as the "Lambana" attacked the group's cottage, assassinating Belle and Ces in the havoc. The engkanto, having a chance to permanently abduct Andrea, held the girl hostage, with Ray and Malay in hot pursuit. In the end, Malay was killed, but Ray managed to overpower the engkanto, saving Andrea's life.  In a post-plot scene, Andrea woke aboard a boat with Ray; however, she notices that the boat was not moving away from the island.

On her first day, she met the patriarch Carlo (Sid Lucero), the children - Ryan (Nash Aguas) and Sarah (Anna Vicente) -, the family's butlers Aludia (Odette Khan) and Simeon (Jess Evardone), and the secretary Anna (Gaby dela Merced). After a series of successful tutorial sessions, it gradually became clear to Dianne the nature of the family: being [[photophobia|photophobic]], having a desire for human entrails, and, worst of all, the unusual activity in and out of the parlor.  Dennis (Mart Escudero), Dianne's brother, dismissed his sister's stories; meanwhile, Ryan was accused of divulging the truth to Dianne, creating a tension between Carlo and the tutor. However, Dianne could not brought herself to quit, not only because of being friends with Ryan, but also this was her only work for a living.  As a plot, the family lured Dennis, who was waiting for her sister outside. Unknown to him, he was used as a bait to force Diane to continue her work, but at the same time, sacrificing her life as prey to the human-dog creatures. Carlo then revealed that they were once part of an ancient tribe, whose homes were ravaged by fire. Desperate, he Carlo, being widowed, and his family set up the funeral parlor to cover up their true nature and to earn for a living.

An attractive woman, Molly McCleish, arrives at the passenger terminal to board a flight to [[New York City]]. She garners unwanted flirting from several male TSA officers, while Kirk is the only one to treat Molly courteously. On the airplane, Molly realizes that she accidentally left her cellphone at airport security. Using her friend's phone, Molly calls her phone and arranges a time for Kirk to return it to her the following evening.  The next night, Devon and Kirk arrive at the [[Andy Warhol Museum]] and return Molly's phone, but after accidentally spilling a drink on the museum director they are told to leave. Molly, the event's planner, feeling sorry for what happened offers Kirk tickets to a  hockey game. Kirk brings Stainer to the game, where they meet Molly and her best friend Patty. Kirk assumes Molly meant to set him up with Patty, until Patty explicitly tells Kirk that Molly is interested in him. Later, Molly directly asks Kirk out and he agrees. Stainer predicts their relationship will fail, as he deems Molly a "10" in a scale of attractiveness, and Kirk only a "5", and the gap is too large to overcome. Separately, Patty believes Molly has only chosen Kirk because he is "safe", after being hurt by her last boyfriend. While on their date, Kirk confides in Molly that he dreams of becoming a pilot, while Molly shares her story of how she was once a lawyer before realizing her love for event planning.  Molly accompanies Kirk to a family lunch, where she charms the men in the home and creates jealousy in Marnie who is quickly ignored by the men when Molly arrives. This causes Marnie to take a sudden interest in Kirk again. After returning to Molly's apartment, Kirk [[Ejaculation|ejaculates]] prematurely in his pants while the two are [[Foreplay|making out]], just as Molly's parents arrive for a surprise visit. Desperate to conceal the stain on his pants, Kirk seems discourteous by avoiding to stand up and shake hands, and quickly leaves Molly's apartment. Believing he fled to avoid meeting her parents, Molly begins ignoring Kirk's calls.  At Jack's urging, Kirk admits the true reasons for his leaving, and their relationship resumes. While celebrating the birthday of Molly's sister, Kirk is troubled when Molly is intentionally vague about Kirk's line of work to her parents. Additionally, Molly's ex, Cam, arrives at her parent's request, and deliberately alludes to Molly having a physical "defect".  After the party, both of them go back to Molly's apartment where Kirk discovers Molly's "defect" is slightly [[webbed toes]], which Kirk considers so minor that he decides that she is indeed too perfect for him. Upset with Kirk over his insecurities and wishing that there was something wrong with her to justify them being together, Molly confesses that Cam had the same problem and ultimately cheated on her. Molly admits she asked Kirk out because she considered him safe, which causes Kirk to break up with her and leave. Afterward, Kirk agrees to resume his relationship with Marnie, and makes plans to attend a family vacation together.  Stainer and Patty realize they caused the break-up by telling Kirk and Molly they were too opposite physically to be together, and agree to work together to fix the mistake. Patty brings Molly to the airport, while Stainer has Jack sabotage the plane so that Kirk cannot leave. Kirk rejects Marnie and meets Molly at the terminal gate, where she confesses her true feelings about Kirk and his insecurities, as well as her desire to be with him regardless. Kirk and Molly then make up and resume their relationship.  
Shelter (2010 film)
 After the death of her husband, Dr. Cara Harding's ([[Julianne Moore]]) faith in God has been shaken, but not her belief in science as a [[ psychologist]]. In an attempt to get her more open to accepting unexplainable [[psychiatric]] theories, her father ([[Jeffrey DeMunn]]) introduces her to Adam ([[Jonathan Rhys Meyers]]), a patient suspected to have [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]], who unnaturally takes on some impossible physical characteristics of his other personalities.   At first Cara’s father only tells her of one of Adam’s personalities, David Bernberg. When first meeting Adam, he questions Cara about her religious beliefs. Cara quickly discovers that David, a personality needing a wheelchair, was a real person who became a paraplegic and was murdered long ago. For more information Cara decides to visit David’s mother. She tells Mrs. Bernburg of her patient Adam, and informs her that he was created a personality within himself mimicking her son. David's mother is a highly religious woman, and agrees to meet with Adam in Dr. Harding's attempt to cure him. Adam, as David, reveals to Mrs. Bernberg private details that only her son would know. She tells Adam that he is evil and leaves in distress.  Adam over time becomes more aggressive to those around him including Cara and starts to reveal more of his personalities to her; Wes, a singer in a metal band and Satanist who was suspected of committing suicide, being one of them. As Cara tries to help Adam she decides to visit his home to reveal why he may have created these personalities as a form of escapism. Upon entering his home, a filthy degenerated place full of devil-worshiping insignia, Cara discovers a grotesque decomposing body in the bathtub. After calling it into the police Cara goes to collect her daughter Sammy from school. She finds Adam there with her daughter, in the personality of a family friend and questioning Sammy about her faith in God, while the latter tells him that she does not believe anymore because her dad was murdered.  Adam is arrested by the police and questioned about the dead body in his house. Later, as David, Adam sings a song in Cara’s presence and on being questioned about it he reveals that he wrote it. Cara travels to see Mrs. Bernburg who confirms that David did indeed compose that piece of music, and would sing it when he was sad or scared. She directs Cara to a woman known as ‘Granny’ deep in the witch mountains for further answers. After a brief meeting with a witch doctor called Granny, the elderly woman rejects her and sends her away. Cara sneaks back when she hears screams. While spying on Granny and her companions, she witnesses Granny cutting open an old man. She delays the procedure as his screams get more intense and sucks his soul out, blowing it into a container with a strange symbol on it. She continues cutting him open, takes out a cancerous lump from his body and sews him back up before blowing the contained soul back into him. The old man awakes and appears fine. The witch doctor then turns and asks Cara if she still only believes in science. Cara begins to figure things out and realizes that Adam asks about the faith of people when he meets them. She listens to two voice messages on her phone, one from her brother who is looking after her daughter and has some information to help the investigation with Adam. Her brother informs her that an there is an old man who may have answers for her relating to the case. Cara rushes to see the man, to talk about what has been happening with her patient.   The man relates a story from his childhood, while showing Cara an old silent-film home video that his father had recorded. Long ago there was a priest who came to his town to teach about God. The priest taught that witchcraft and pagan rituals were not needed, but that it was through faith that people could be healed. The town was stricken with an influenza outbreak, but they believed in the priest and depended on their religious beliefs to help them. The town discovered that the priest was actually scamming the town and faithless, inoculated his two daughters, and allowed his people to die. The townspeople murder his daughters while the witch doctor Granny sucked out his soul and blew it into the air before stuffing his orifices with mud so that his soul could not return to his body. She whispers a curse on him, that his body will be a shelter to the faithless. Cara receives a call from the police that they have released 'Adam' to her father as they discovered that the body in his bathtub was the real Adam who had owned the home. As Cara questions if the police figured out the real identity of her patient, she looks up at the projector screen to see 'Adam' in the midst of the influenza epidemic, realizing that he is the faithless priest from decades ago.  She calls her dad frantically as she realizes that 'Adam' is going to kill him. Amid the phone call she listens helplessly as the murder happens with nothing she can do to stop his death. She calls her brother to tell him what she has found out where he tells her that her daughter is getting sick, just as her family friend and father had been, and has a strange symbol burnt on her back. Cara urges her brother to take her daughter to Granny, as she believes this illness is not of temporal nature but spiritual and supernatural. 'Adam' shows up and attacks, incapacitating her brother. Cara tells her daughter to put the phone on speaker and demands that 'Adam' allow her to speak to David. As he transforms back into David he collapses on the floor, as David needs a wheelchair, giving her brother and daughter a chance to escape meeting up with Cara and Granny.   After joining the pair of them Cara checks her daughter's back only to see that the symbol appearing thereon is the same one that the container the witch doctor had used to store souls. Granny says she cannot help, as the girl has already given up on God and abandoned him, but that Sammy will be sheltered and together with the other faithless. 'Adam' pursues and knocks out Cara's brother, as she runs for safety with her daughter. After overpowering Cara, 'Adam' takes Sammy sucking out her soul. His personality changes into her daughter, revealing that all along 'Adam' has not had [[Dissociative identity disorder|DID]], but has been the shelter for multiple spirits of people who had given up on God. 'Adam' as Sammy gives Cara the opportunity to cradle him, which in so doing gives her the chance to strangle him taking away most of his energy before impaling him through his neck on a sharp root sticking up out of the ground. As the priest 'Adam' dies, all the souls leave his body. Sammy’s lifeless body receives her soul back and Cara runs to reunite with her daughter. As the two comfort each other Sammy begins to hum the tune that David wrote, implying that David's soul has found its way into her daughter's body as well.

Sherlock Holmes (2010 film)
 On [[Second Great Fire of London|December 29 1940]], during the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]], an elderly [[Dr. John Watson]] tells his nurse the tale of an unrecorded case he shared with his friend [[Sherlock Holmes]]. On May 19 1882, a royal treasury ship is destroyed by a monstrous giant octopus on the coast of [[Newhaven, East Sussex|Newhaven]]. Holmes and Watson investigate the shipwreck and do not believe the first-hand accounts of the sole survivor of the attack, but nonetheless investigate. [[Inspector Lestrade]] states that he has recently had contact with Holmes's estranged brother Thorpe, a former partner of Lestrade's who was paralyzed during a bank robbery seven years prior.  In [[Whitechapel]], a young man is killed by a [[dinosaur]]. Watson is skeptical until he and Holmes discover the creature on their morning constitution. Finding escape, several more clues lead Holmes to deduce that the monsters are artificial, built by a criminal genius to acquire resources. On the case, the dinosaur steals a water pump operating a fountain and rolls of copper wire, presumably so Spring-Heeled Jack can create another monster. The octopus that destroyed the ship earlier is linked to the dinosaur because they are both similarly "exceptionally improbable". Lestrade accompanies Holmes and Watson during their investigation. On one of their leads, Lestrade ends up missing. Holmes's reasoning leads himself and Watson to an old castle in Helmsmouth he and his brother visited as children. They come across another monster, a masked mechanical man: Spring-Heeled Jack.  Spring-Heeled Jack is revealed to be Holmes' brother, Thorpe, who also assumed the identity of a patient of Watson's. Inesidora Ivory, his accomplice, is with him. Thorpe explains that he built a mechanical suit to cure his paralysis, and he deduced that the crippling bullet ricocheted off a doorframe, fired by Lestrade. He plans to destroy London, assassinate [[Queen Victoria]] and force Lestrade to claim responsibility. Ivory is revealed to be one of Thorpe's creations and his lover, and she carries that will detonate when she reaches Buckingham Palace, while Thorpe pilots his most complex invention yet, a fire-breathing dragon in which he pilots and holds Lestrade hostage. Watson is sent to stop Ivory from killing the Queen, while Holmes pilots another one of Thorpe's flying inventions in an attempt to stop his brother.  Thorpe's dragon sets fire to [[Palace of Westminster|Parliament]] and [[Westminster Abbey]]. Ivory is deactivated by Watson moments before the explosion can take place and the dragon is sent crashing in the garden outside the Palace. Thorpe, crippled again, crawls from the wreckage and tries to shoot Watson, before he himself is shot by Sherlock Holmes. Holmes proves Lestrade was not responsible for Thorpe's crippling. Lestrade takes credit for saving the Queen and Holmes and Watson vow never to speak of the events again. In present time, Watson expires peacefully and his nurse visits his grave. Nearby, Ivory is visiting the grave of Thorpe Holmes.

Shepherds of Helmand
 In 2008, 17 volunteers from the Oregon National Guard volunteered to deploy to [[Afghanistan]] to train troops of the Afghan National Army in support of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. They became an [[Embedded Training Team]], or ETT, and were stationed at [[Camp Phoenix]] in [[Kabul]]. The kandak of Afghan troops was a [[light infantry]] unit roughly 200 men strong, and they were equipped with primarily [[AK-47]] rifles, [[PK machine gun]]s, and [[Ford Ranger]] trucks for transportation. The Americans trained the Afghans to be a counter narcotics task force, and they went to [[Helmand Province]] to halt illegal [[opium]] production and sale which provided the [[Taliban]] with money. The US government instead gave the Afghan farmers [[corn]] to farm. The tall cornfields, however, turned into ideal ambush locations for Taliban fighters. Unfortunately, the "counter narcotics" unit began smoking the confiscated [[marijuana]] and the US troops were powerless to stop them. After much combat alongside soldiers from the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1992)|Royal Irish Regiment]] and the [[Royal Danish Army]], the ETT team began leaving the Helmand area to return to Kabul. On the way, an [[Improvised Explosive Device|IED]] destroyed an [[MRAP]] and killed CPT Bruno de Solenni from [[Crescent City, California]]. The soldiers return home to [[Oregon]], and all try to adjust to civilian life each in their own way. Their accomplishments in Afghanistan were notable, and Captain Paul Dyer mentions how in the first engagement with the Taliban, many of the Afghan soldiers fled or did not fight back, but by the time the Americans were ready to leave, the Afghans had come full-circle, and managed to defend the city of [[Lashkar Gah]] against the Taliban with minimal U.S. help. The ETT that these volunteers made up, is one of the most decorated units in [[Army National Guard|National Guard]] history.

Shor in the City
 The film revolves around five central characters in the city of [[Mumbai]].

Abhay ([[Sendhil Ramamurthy]]) is a [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|NRI]] who returns to [[India]] to start his own small business and meets Shalmili ([[Preeti Desai]]). Sawan ([[Sundeep Kishan]]) is a young cricketer hoping to break into the under-22 Mumbai cricket team. The story focuses on their trials and tribulations as they battle life in the city of Mumbai during the chaotic period of the festival of [[Ganesh Chaturthi]].  The film tries to deal with concepts of chance, the constant struggle between hope and despair and self-actualization. The opening of the movie starts with the song "Karma is a bitch" which fits in with the central theme of the story where the characters of the film keep trying to come to terms with their own actions. Abhay has a dark past which is not revealed in the film but it can be speculated that he came to India to stay away from it. Tilak initially holds himself responsible for the injury of the child due to bomb explosion that happens in the movie which brings him closer to his wife and viewing life from a different perspective. The goons who traumatized Abhay eventually end up being shot by their own bullets on the day of Ganesha Visarjan. Tilak gets a new life and finds his treasure at home. Sawan gives up the money he finds at the bank robbery and instead focuses on improving his game for cricket selections and gets support from Sejal(Sawan's partner)too. Ramesh is seen applying for jobs and Mandook protesting at a rally. Towards the end of the movie all characters move on different paths.  
Shirome (film)
  Director Kōji Shiraishi wants to film an episode for a [[Japan]]ese television program, featuring members of the [[Japanese idol|"Idol"]]-genre singing and dancing ensemble, Momoiro Clover Z (referred to in the film by their previous name, simply Momoiro Clover). The program is one wherein minor [[celebrity]] guests are employed to investigate [[haunted house]]s and similarly mysterious locales, in an attempt to determine the truth about such places, and their associated [[paranormal]] phenomena.  The members of Momoiro Clover are asked to visit an abandoned school, where a [[shrine]] to the minor [[deity]] (or [[demon]]?) known as "''Shirome''" is located.  This shrine takes the form of a painting that is thought to be of a [[butterfly]], but which may actually represent the being's face.  According to local legends, if ''Shirome'' is asked to grant a [[wish]], he will do so, but only if the person asking is completely sincere in both their request, and their belief in the existence and power of the ''Shirome'' entity.  If any wish is asked of this being in a frivolous manner, or in a spirit of unbelief, ''Shirome'' will destroy that person, either through causing them to have a fatal accident, inducing them to commit [[suicide]], or driving them hopelessly [[insanity|insane]].  The girls visit the shrine, and request of ''Shirome'' that they be granted a chance to appear on a nationwide Japanese television broadcast.  As soon as this wish is pronounced, a series of chaotic disturbances ensue, and a hulking, large, white-eyed being is briefly seen standing (or floating) next to the girls.  Subsequently, their entertainment career becomes characterized by a high degree of popularity and commercial success, but a disturbing video clip taken from immediately after one of their high-profile concerts suggests that their success may have been obtained in an ill-advised manner, and that the young ladies face the possibility of very fearsome, dire consequences in the future, perhaps including the loss of their [[soul]]s.  
Shodo Girls
 Shikokuchuo is a town that specializes in making calligraphy paper. However, the town had been devastated by the [[Japanese Recession]], and many shops in the town's shopping arcade were forced to close. Over at Tsumishima High School's calligraphy club, a membership crisis ensues after many of its members left the club in quick succession. Satoko refuses to be worried, and continues to focus on her work for the upcoming national calligraphy competition.  One day, a new relief teacher, Ikezawa, is assigned to the calligraphy club as its adviser. After Satoko and Kana mistake him as a thief, they throw calligraphy ink on him, thus leaving a bad first impression. After hearing that the club only has seven members left, Ikezawa puts up a [[performance calligraphy]] show to attract new members. This enraged Satoko, who strongly believes in the traditional method of calligraphy. However, another member, Kiyomi was deeply impressed by the performance and started practicing it, putting her at odds with Satoko, who later chases her away from the club.  Satoko later has a change of heart when she realizes how much calligraphy meant to Kiyomi. She also agreed to put up a performance to commemorate the closure of the shop that Kiyomi's father runs. Ultimately, the performance was a failure, but the club members were surprised at the number of people who came to watch their performance. Just before Kiyomi moved to [[Hiroshima]], she requested Satoko to continue practicing performance calligraphy. At around the same time, Tomoya's grandfather's paper-making workshop burnt down after Tomoya's grandfather started burning the high-quality calligraphy paper he made that no shop wanted to purchase.  Satoko gets a revelation that all is not lost after she finds an unburnt calligraphy paper amidst all the rubble. The calligraphy club then got to work convincing the town's residents to support their idea of starting a performance calligraphy competition and to drum up publicity for the event. The members wanted the competition to revive their dying town. They started practicing very hard, but were frustrated due to the lack of progress. Initially reluctant, Ikezawa finally stepped in to coach them after much persuasion.  Even after practicing for a long time, Ikezawa thinks that their work is still missing something. To overcome this problem, the club members decide to persuade Mio, a former talented club member, back into the club. They eventually succeed and their work gets a big boost. Meanwhile, many schools from around the region have volunteered to participate in the competition. Even the national media have reported about the upcoming competition. To make the competition more meaningful, the members decide only to use the town's famed calligraphy paper, even though those they had were too fragile. Upon seeing their determination, Satoko's father, who was initially opposed to the competition, commissioned Tomoya's grandfather to make a suitably strong calligraphy paper as a sign of his support.  On the day of the competition, the team faces strong teams from other high schools. During their performance, they are off to a good start. However, several mishaps occur and their work is ruined. Despite this setback, the team did not give up and completed their work. After the performance, Ikezawa left the town. In the background, a poster was advertising the next edition of the competition. Ikezawa later opened a letter containing a group photograph of the team and the words "Thank you" written behind. Meanwhile, the members of the calligraphy club vowed not to lose again at the next edition of the competition after receiving a challenge letter from another school.

Shit Year
   
Shutter Island (film)
 In 1954, [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] Edward "Teddy" Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the [[Mental Disorder (Insanity) Defense|criminally insane]] on Shutter Island in [[Boston Harbor]]. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: "The law of 4; who is 67?" They arrive just before a storm hits, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days.  Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational. Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor Lester Sheehan left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. They are given access to the hospital, but they are told that Ward C is off limits and that the lighthouse has already been searched. While being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word "RUN" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have [[migraine]] headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the [[Dachau liberation reprisals]]. He has disturbing dreams of his wife Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by a local arsonist named Andrew Laeddis. In one instance, she tells him that Solando is still on the island somewhere—as is Laeddis, who everyone claims was never there, to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case.  During their investigation, Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce, a patient in solitary confinement. Noyce warns him that the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]]. Noyce warns Daniels that everyone else on the island is playing an elaborate game specifically designed for Daniels—including his partner Aule.  Daniels regroups with Aule and is determined to investigate the lighthouse. They become separated while climbing the cliffs toward it, and Daniels later sees what he believes to be Aule's body on the rocks below. By the time he climbs down, however, the body is actually moss growing on rocks.  He then finds a cave where he discovers a woman in hiding who claims to be the real Rachel Solando. She states that she is a former psychiatrist at the hospital who discovered the experiments with [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic medication]] and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop [[mind control]] techniques. Before she could report her findings to the authorities, however, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe as a patient. Daniels returns to the hospital but finds no evidence of Aule ever being there.  Daniels is convinced that Aule was taken to the lighthouse; he breaks into it only to discover Cawley calmly waiting there for him. Cawley explains that Daniels is actually Andrew Laeddis, their "most dangerous patient" incarcerated in Ward C for murdering his [[Bipolar disorder|manic depressive]] wife Dolores Chanal after she drowned their children. Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are [[anagram]]s of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal; furthermore, the little girl from Laeddis' recurring dreams is his daughter Rachel.  According to Cawley, the events of the past several days have been designed to break Laeddis' [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]]-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of Daniels. The hospital staff was part of the test, including Dr. Sheehan posing as Aule and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando. The migraines that Laeddis suffered were withdrawal symptoms from his medication, as were the hallucinations of the "real Rachel Solando." Overwhelmed, Laeddis faints.  Laeddis awakens in the hospital under the watch of Cawley and Sheehan. When questioned, he tells the truth in a coherent manner, which satisfies the doctors as a sign of progression. Nevertheless, Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before but Laeddis had quickly regressed and further warns that this will be his last chance to redeem himself.  Some time later, Laeddis relaxes on the hospital grounds with Dr. Sheehan, but he calls him "Chuck" and says that they need to leave the island, implying that Laeddis has regressed into his delusion again. Sheehan shakes his head at Cawley, who is observing them, and Cawley directs orderlies' attention towards Laeddis. Laeddis asks Dr. Sheehan whether it is worse to live as a monster or die as a good man, hinting that Laeddis might have been truly cured but wishes to be lobotomized so he can forget what he did. He is then led away by the orderlies to be lobotomized. The film ends with a shot of the lighthouse.

Shrek Forever After
 [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] has grown steadily tired of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to wish for when he felt like a "real [[ogre]]" again. When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger.  Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to "thank" him.  Shrek signs the contract and appears in an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate reality]] where the events starting from [[Shrek|Fiona's rescue]] are irrelevant. Now feared by villagers, he takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds "WANTED" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by [[Witchcraft|witches]] and taken to Rumpel, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down.  Upon inquiry, Rumpel reveals that he took away the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or met [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]], and consequently Rumpel was able to trick King Harold and Queen Lillian into signing their kingdom over to him, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by "true love's kiss".  They soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel. The ogres are led by a still-cursed Fiona who, after escaping from the tower where she was held captive, keeps the retired and overweight [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss]] as a pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. She is also bitterly cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love and throws herself into planning Rumpel's capture. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to like Shrek, but stops short of kissing him. Puss encourages him to continue pursuing Fiona.  During the ambush, the ogres are captured by the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin|Pied Piper]], though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything; however, because in this altered timeline Fiona does not truly love him, the kiss does not work. When he hears that Rumpel is offering a [[wish]] to the one who brings him Shrek, Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres. Afterwards Rumpel reveals a captured Fiona whom he is going to feed to Dragon along with Shrek. Donkey leads the Ogre army to storm the castle, battle the witches, and capture Rumpel, Shrek and Fiona are able to trap Dragon as well.  As the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses Shrek just before he disappears, restoring Shrek to his world just before he lashed out at the party. Shrek embraces his friends and family with a newfound appreciation for everything he has.  
The Shrine (film)
 The film starts with a man tied to a table.  Another man then kills him with a sledgehammer to the face.  A [[journalist]], Carmen, is having problems with her relationship with her boyfriend, Marcus who is a [[photographer]]. Carmen never seems to stop thinking about work and tends to ignore him.  Carmen asks Dale, her boss, to allow her to investigate the disappearances of several tourists in the fictional [[Poland|Polish]] village of Alvania, including the man killed at the beginning of the film, who was named Eric. She also mentions that the luggage of all the missing tourists ends up being found all around rural parts of [[central Europe]]. Dale isn't interested in another missing persons case, saying that people go missing all the time, and he does not give her permission to go. Instead, he would rather have her investigate why a farmer's bees go missing.  Carmen and her intern Sara visit Eric's mother, Laura. Laura tells them that she has tried to get the help of both the Polish and the American Police. However, they are unwilling or too busy to help her. Carmen asks Laura if Eric's luggage has been returned to her. Laura says that it has and Carmen borrows Eric's journal.  Later in her home while reading Eric's journal, she has a dream of Eric with bloody eyes who tells her "Leave me alone". Carmen, wanting to mend her relationship with Marcus as well as her job, urges him to come with her and Sara to Alvania. Upon reaching Alvania, they find the village people to be secretive, unfriendly and unwelcoming, just as described in the last entry in Eric's journal. Although English is taught in the villages' school, some of the villagers don't know how(or are willing) to speak it.  They see a man named Henryk butchering a pig, then find a girl named Lidia picking flowers and approach her. They show her a picture of Eric and ask if she has seen him. The girl reacts at the sight of Eric in the picture but is hesitant to answer. Before she even can, Henryk calls to her and sends her off. Carmen, Sara and Marcus explore the village. They notice that the villagers treat their religious leaders like royalty. They then spot a strange dense area of fog which seems to be concentrated only in one portion of the forest, also mentioned in Eric's notes. When they attempt to investigate the fog they are threatened by Henryk and the villagers and told to leave.  Leaving the village initially, Carmen tells Marcus that they should go back and investigate the fog. Marcus initially disagrees and insists that they leave. Carmen manages to convince Marcus to return by admitting that her editor knows nothing about the trip and that her career will be over if she returns with no story. They leave their car and walk into the forest, where they eventually find the area with the fog. Carmen, Sara and Marcus find it strange that the fog seems to never move and is quite dense, therefore preventing Marcus from taking pictures of anything inside it.  Sara enters the fog and disappears into it. Carmen and Marcus wait for Sara to return but after a while, they lose their patience. Marcus insists that they leave but they can't leave Sara behind. Carmen enters the fog to find her. Moments after Carmen enters the fog, Sara somehow gets out and is found by Marcus. Sara appears scared and unfocused. Carmen seems to have gotten lost in the fog and comes across a statue of a demon holding a heart. Carmen takes a picture of it, and moves to the side of the statue in order to take another picture. Looking up from the camera she sees that the statue has turned its head to face Carmen. The statue's eyes bleed and the 'heart' in its hand starts to beat. This frightens Carmen. As she backs away from the statue, she finds herself out of the fog and is found by Marcus and Sara. Sara and Carmen talk about seeing the statue, both a bit disoriented, also having heard strange whispering voices.  As they make their way back to their car, they come across Lidia, who claims to know the whereabouts of Eric and takes them to a hidden sacrificial shrine, where they discover the bodies of people (including Eric) that the village people have executed. Each body has a metal mask deeply embedded in its face, making it look as though the villagers are cultists and are practicing some kind of ritual [[black magic]] on the tourists who come to Alvania. Marcus, Sara and Carmen notice that Lidia is gone and find the door of the shrine barred.  Luckily, Marcus is able to open it, but they are suddenly surrounded by the villagers and flee, hiding in a nearby barn. They are found and struggle to escape, but one of the villagers knocks Carmen out. Henryk shoots Sara's leg with a crossbow. The villagers knock her out with chloroform but not before she sees the face of one of the villagers turn into a demon. Marcus runs into the forest and is chased by Henryk, who catches up with him. Marcus fights Henryk but the latter gains the upper hand and knocks him out with chloroform.  As they wake up, they see Henryk talking to Lidia. Lidia walks off and the villagers bring them back to the entrance of the sacrificial shrine where the head of the village's church, Arkadiusz, decides to sacrifice both Sara and Carmen. The two are taken inside the shrine while Marcus is led away by two villagers and is forced at gunpoint to dig a grave. After one of them leaves, Marcus uses the shovel to disarm the remaining villager with the gun and knock him unconscious. He takes the gun and runs off to rescue Sara and Carmen.  At the shrine, cultists strip Carmen and Sara and dress them in ceremonial gowns. The cultists place Sara on the same ceremonial table where Eric was killed while Carmen is placed in a prison cell. The cultists secure Sara's arms, legs and head. They then deeply lacerate her arms and sever her Achilles' tendons. While this is being done to her, she sees the faces of the cultists and Arkadiusz turn into demons. The same mask earlier found on the corpses is placed over Sara's head. It has two spikes inside of it which are meant to pierce Sara's eyes. Arkadiusz takes a sledgehammer and uses it to embed the mask into Sara's face, killing her.  One of the cultists looks at Carmen and she sees that the cultist's face has become that of a demon. They bring her out to be sacrificed but Marcus rescues her. He locks the cultists in the shrine and he and Carmen make their escape.  They enter a villager's house to steal the keys to a truck. Marcus sees a woman, Emilia, and her son, Dariusz, in the kitchen. The woman calls for her husband, Aleks, but is unable to do anything since Marcus still has the gun. Marcus asks them for the keys to the truck but they can't understand English. When they see Carmen, Emilia expresses fear and panic. Marcus takes the family to their living room and ties up the couple.  While Marcus tries to get them to give him the keys, Carmen starts to experience voices. She sees the objects in the room shake. She sees Dariusz turn into a demon. She sees Emilia and Aleks turn demonic, untie themselves and crawl on the floor. Marcus turns to Carmen and he too has become a demon. But in truth all of them are still human, Emilia and Aleks are still tied up and none of them are even looking at her.  Carmen hides in another room where she continues to see and hear things. Dariusz, who understands and speaks English, leads Marcus back to the kitchen and gives him the truck keys. Not wanting to risk Dariusz going out and calling for help, Marcus also ties him up. The boy begs for Marcus to let them go and warns him that Carmen is evil since she has seen the statue. Carmen is then possessed by a demon while she is alone in the room and lets out a very loud shriek. The cultists, who have gotten free and are looking for her, hear the shriek and are alerted to Carmen's location.  Marcus hears Carmen calling out to him. As he enters the room she went inside, through a door from the kitchen, another door leading back to the living room closes. Marcus hears Aleks and Emilia scream in fear and pain, followed by footsteps going to the kitchen. He then hears Dariusz screaming. As he looks out from the door, he sees the boy being dragged away. The door then closes and Dariusz's screaming stops. The door leading to the living room slowly opens. He goes to the living room and finds the entire family brutally killed. The possessed Carmen then jumps on him and pins him on the floor. Just as she is about to kill him, she is confronted by the cultists. She kills several of them, but Arkadiusz fights back with prayers and holy water. He calls for the mask but the cultist holding the mask is stunned with fear, giving the possessed Carmen the opportunity to impale Arkadiusz. She turns her attention back to Marcus.  Before Arkadiusz dies, he passes on his duties to Henryk. Henryk chants prayers while splashing Carmen with holy water, and stabs her. The prayers weaken her, allowing Henryk to slowly set her on the floor. Two more cultists help. They impale Carmen's hands and pin her to the floor. Henryk calls for the mask and this time, the cultist holding the mask complies. They position the mask over Carmen's face while Henryk readies the sledgehammer. However Carmen still struggles and the mask can't be properly placed over her eyes.  Marcus now realizes what is going on and understands why it was necessary to kill Sara and Carmen. They had seen the statue, which is why the villagers had to kill them, but he himself hasn't. The cultists weren't sacrificing anyone; they were trying to prevent demonic possession from taking place. Knowing this, Marcus assists Henryk and the others by holding Carmen's head still. With the mask now in place, Henryk readies the sledgehammer to embed the mask. Carmen returns to normal and asks Marcus for help but he knows it is just a trick. Henryk sends the sledgehammer down and embeds the mask on Carmen, killing her.  Marcus then looks at Henryk and the remaining men, wondering what will happen to him since he knows too much. One of the villagers asks Henryk what they will do with Marcus. In the end, Marcus is set free by the villagers. Henryk offers to have one of the village's men take him to where he needs to go. Marcus looks over to the forest where the fog is seen. Not knowing what is really inside the fog, he asks Henryk about it. He is told that the fog and the statue are a curse left long ago on the village that cannot be undone. The devilish statue is shown once more and the screen goes black.  
Shukno Lanka
 Chinu Nandi ([[Mithun Chakraborty]]) was a talented part-time actor and full-time employee of a coal-mine. Once he loses his job, he takes up acting as his full-time job. However, not starting in the profession early proves to be his demerit. He finds himself as a 250 bucks per day actor, who gets paid only if he gets a chance to play some part on the day. He is cast mainly as elderly house-servants and similar small characters in thoroughly commercial movies. Even so, he tries to give his best in such roles, which makes the stars of such movies (mainly Tublai, played by [[Kunal Mitra|late Kunal Mitra]]) insecure, and they start to avoid giving him roles.  Meanwhile, Joy Sundar Sen ([[Sabyasachi Chakrabarty]]), a world-renowned director who recently won an award for his movie at the Berlin Film Festival, starts working on his new project: a movie based on Satyajit Ray's ''[[Parash Pathar|Porosh Pathor]]'', where an average post office clerk gets his hands on a priceless artifact, the [[Philosopher's Stone]], and starts a journey to understand the wonders of life. In order to portray the protagonist of this movie (Chandrakant), Sen selects Chinu Nandi, much to the dismay of the superstars of the industry.  Through the course of filming this movie, we see a lot of these two characters, their sincerity, their devotion to their fields, their love for art, and their talent. When it comes to family, however, Nandi is very happy being a poor man with his wife ([[Angana Bose]]), whom he loves very dearly, and cherishes his hobby of cuisine. Sen, on the contrary, is indifferent to his wife ([[Debashree Roy]]), who constantly tries to make him feel her presence through her love for him.  The movie, after a couple of obstacles, finally gets released, and everything falls into place. Sen and his wife revive their love for each other, and Nandi wins the respect of his wife and the whole neighbourhood.

Singam
 Durai Singam ([[Suriya]]) is the honest police sub-inspector of Nallur, a small village in [[Thoothukudi district]] in [[Pandya Nadu|southern Tamil Nadu]], assisted by his bumbling colleague Erimalai ([[Vivek (actor)|Vivek]]).

Durai Singam, unaware of Mayil Vaaganam's hand behind his transfer, joins [[Thiruvanmiyur]] police station. His coworker Sub-Inspector Ravi ([[Bose Venkat]]) hates Mayil Vaaganam for his crimes but is unable to take any action because of Mayil Vaaganam's political powers. The Assistant Commissioner of Police Rajendran ([[Nizhalgal Ravi]]), who is Durai Singam's senior is on Mayil's payroll and takes care in concealing and eliminating the evidence of Mayil Vaaganam's crimes from the eyes of the law. The Police Commissioner ([[Ajay Rathnam]]) also does not help Durai Singam as there is no evidence against Mayil Vaaganam, and Rajendran warns Durai Singam to stay away from Mayil Vaaganam's case. Unable to take on Mayil Vaaganam in his stronghold, Durai Singam wants to return to his village, but is stopped by Kavya, who encourages him to fight against evil and not run like a coward.  Being mentally tortured by Mayil Vaaganam, Durai Singam arrests Mayil Vaaganam's brother Vaikundam ([[Adithya (actor)|Adithya Menon]]) in a fake case of illegally smuggling alcohol. He thwarts off Rajendran in full view of the public when Rajendran, bounded by his duties to Mayil Vaaganam, tries to protect the henchman. Meanwhile, Mayil Vaaganam kidnaps Kavya's younger sister for ransom. Durai Singam rescues her with unexpected help from the Home Minister Ramanathan ([[Vijayakumar (actor)|Vijayakumar]]).

Simha (film)
 Srimannarayana ([[Nandamuri Balakrishna]]) is a lecturer in a University in Hyderabad and lives with his grandmother ([[K. R. Vijaya]]). He does not tolerate injustice anywhere and mercilessly beats up people who dare to break the law, a personality which makes him feared and respected among others. A female lecturer Mahima ([[Namitha Kapoor|Namitha]]) is attracted to him, though he doesn't reciprocate her feelings. While beating up a goon who threatened to acid attack|throw acid on a girl after she spurned his advances, he accidentally punches a [[coma]]tose man on the head, waking him from his 28-year coma. This man's name is Veerakesavudu ([[Saikumar (Malayalam actor)|Sai Kumar]]).  One day, a new student Janaki ([[Sneha Ullal]]) joins the college where Srimannarayana is teaching. She initially thinks that he is a rowdy after an earlier encounter with him in a share auto and seeing how everyone in the college fears him, but once she finds out about his true personality, she develops a [[infatuation|crush]] on him. One day, after Srimannarayana rescues her from a group of thugs, she reveals her past. Her father, businessman Jagadish Prasad ([[Rahman (actor)|Rahman]]), has a business rivalry with Gopi ([[Adithya (actor)|Adithya Menon]]), a gangster, who happens to be Veerakesavudu's son. After Veerakesavudu woke up from his coma, he ordered Jagadish to give Janaki's hand in marriage to Gopi so that their mutual rivalry is finished, to which he agreed, fearing the wrath of Veerakesavudu. But Gopi killed Janaki's brother during the wedding after he insulted him, prompting Jagadish to send Janaki to Hyderabad to continue her studies. The thugs who tried to kidnap her were Gopi's henchmen. On hearing this, Srimannarayana vows to protect Janaki and accommodates her next to his house. He soon reciprocates her feelings for him, prompting Maheswari to drop her love for him.  Unfortunately for Janaki, Gopi finds out that she is with Srimannarayana and kidnaps her, only for Srimannarayana to rescue her after a dramatic car chase. When they reach home, they are confronted by Gopi's henchmen. Jagadish too arrives there at the same time that Srimannarayana is fighting the henchmen and in a bid to help, accidentally stabs Srimannarayana's grandmother. Srimannarayana is enraged and attempts to kill him, but his grandmother stops him. Jagadish immediately leaves with Janaki. Later, Srimannarayana confronts his grandmother and asks her why she didn't let him kill Jagadish. In reply, she reveals about their past.  30 years ago, in the town of [[Bobbili]], Veerakesavudu and his family ran a ruthless self-government, tormenting the townsfolk and supported by the police. The only person who dared to fight them back was a doctor named Narasimha (Nandamuri Balakrishna), who belonged to the Bobbili royal family and was the father of Srimannarayana. He took the law into his own hands and killed many of Veerakesavudu's henchmen, including his brothers, when he caught them tormenting others. While not killing others, he ran a 24x7 hospital which provided treatment free of cost. His wife Gayatri ([[Nayantara]]) was an ideal wife who was always affectionate towards Narasimha and supported all his methods. Jagadish, who was Gayatri's brother and who wanted to start a business with Veerakesavudu's help, warned her about the dangerous behaviour of Narasimha, but she brushed the warnings aside, having full faith in her husband and his methods. Veerakesavudu and his father ([[Kota Srinivasa Rao]]) eventually decided to eliminate Narasimha and his family once and for all by attempting to poison them during a temple function. When the temple priest warned Narasimha about the threat to his life, Narasimha rushed to Veerakesavudu's house and killed all his men as well as his father. However, Veerakesavudu was ultimately successful in killing Narasimha and Gayatri. But just before he died, Narasimha hit Veerakesavudu on the head, sending him into a coma which he only woke up from after 28 years. Narasimha's mother, who happens to be Srimannarayana's grandmother, took the young and newly orphaned Srimannarayana away with her to Hyderabad so that he could be brought up away from the violence in Bobbili.  On hearing about his family's past, Srimannarayana immediately decides to take revenge on Veerakesavudu and heads for Bobbili to finish his father's mission. He single-handedly fights Veerakesavudu, Gopi and their henchmen and finally kills them all, fulfilling the wishes of the Bobbili townsfolk who wanted the Veerakesavudu family's reign of terror and horror to be ended for good.  
Simple Simon (2010 film)
 Simon is an 18-year-old man with [[Asperger syndrome|Asperger Syndrome]]. Incapable of living independently, he is cared for by his endlessly loving and patient brother, Sam, and Sam's girlfriend, Frida. He lives by an unchanging daily routine and finds any change in his life very stressful. He spends his day working as a groundskeeper in a special program for mentally disabled people, tending athletic fields and roadsides. He imposes routine on his two housemates with a wall chart that allocates chores and schedules leisure. When the world becomes too stressful, Simon seals himself in a large pot and imagines himself floating in space, where everything is perfectly quiet and predictable. These habits cause a lot of tension with his two housemates. One night, Simon interrupts Sam and Frida while they are having sex in order to ask for toilet paper. For Frida, this is the last straw, and the next day she dumps Sam and moves out.  Simon returns home from work to find the house empty and dinner unprepared. When Sam returns home, he decides to order pizza for dinner, but this further distresses Simon as they usually eat tacos on Friday evenings. When Sam announces that Frida is definitely gone for good and that they must adapt, Simon suffers a [[Tantrum|meltdown]]. Sam, upset at Frida's departure, tries to rationalize away his pain by criticizing Frida's habits, such as being bad at sex and eating caviar sandwiches. Simon interprets these remarks literally and visits Frida's house, asking her to return and change ''her'' habits, since Simon is incapable of changing his. Frida angrily drives him off, telling him he ought to find another girl to take her place.  Simon, as is his nature, takes Frida's remark seriously, and sets off to find Sam a new girlfriend who will better fit in with their lifestyle. Unaware of how love and courtship work, he compiles a list of Sam's tastes and habits and proceeds to look for women who match the profile. He stops random women in the streets and asks 13 certain questions (such as "do you prefer dogs to cats?" and "do you make noises when having sex?"), and when he finds a woman who answers all 13 questions correctly, he takes their details and photographs them. He presents to Sam an album of suitable matches he has found and asks him to choose his new girlfriend from them. Sam rejects the list, telling Simon it would be boring for him to have a girlfriend who matches his habits exactly, and suggests that a girl who differs from him would be more attractive, in the same way that the opposing poles of a magnet attract.

First of all, Laura finds a radio playing a haunting melody which she turns off. Shortly after, she hears a sound in the upper floor of the house. Her father goes up to see what is going on while Laura remains downstairs. Suddenly, Laura hears what appears to be combat and is immediately worried. Moments later, she finds her father restrained and murdered in a room downstairs. She starts to cry and hugs his body, getting his blood on her in the process.  Laura then attempts to flee but someone has locked the doors and she cannot open the windows either. Armed with a reap hook and a lamp, she stumbles through the house in order to find a way outside. As she re-enters the living room where she and her father were sleeping before, she notices that her father's dead body has been moved into the chair which he slept in the previous night and that someone has placed a puppet on him.  Suddenly, another melody plays. This time, the music originates from the upper floor. It is only now that Laura goes upstairs where she finds a blood tray and (again) another radio and turns it off. As she hears footsteps, she hides under a table and turns her lamp off. An unknown person armed with a knife and a lamp enters the room, but Laura remains unnoticed so the person leaves. Hereafter, Laura manages to find the key to the front door and runs downstairs. She hears that someone is following her, but is able to unlock the door and to run outside.  After manically running through the grove in front of the house, she stops on the road leading to the house. In the background, her pursuer approaches holding a lamp. However, in this moment Laura is almost run over by Nestor (the owner) who is riding his pickup truck and who was on his way to the house in the middle of the night. The pursuer's lamp is shut down immediately. Although Laura's clothes are covered in blood and the fact that she tells Nestor about the attack, the latter does not seem convinced and insists on searching the house.  As both enter the house, Laura admits that her father was attacked upstairs to which Nestor accuses her for having disobeyed his orders not to go upstairs. They mount to the second floor where, all of a sudden, Nestor disappears through a door and Laura's lamp is shut down. She gets a hold of an old [[Polaroid camera]] and manages to light the room up for a split-second due to the camera's flash each time she takes a photo. In one of the photos, Laura sees a little girl in a white dress, in the last one, a young man runs towards her and tries to stab her.  Laura jumps up and flees to the next room to avoid getting stabbed. The room is well-lit and no one seems to follow her. In that room, she discovers plenty of photos on a wall and in a baby buggy. They mainly show Nestor and a woman in underwear.  After this, Laura goes back downstairs where she finds Nestor. He is also restrained in the same manner her father was and lying on the ground seriously injured. She bends over and they kiss each other. Then, they have a brief conversation: Nestor tells Laura that he loves her and confesses he only called her father for help in order to see her.  Laura mentions that she found his pictures and asks him: "Do you miss her? Do you want to tell her something? She is here now". In a mirror, the little girl in the white dress is visible again for a mere second and appears to be in the room. During the conversation, Laura becomes more and more aggressive and finally shouts at Nestor. Eventually, she says, "You two killed my baby. You're going to die in the manner that my father did." As it comes to an end, Laura drags Nestor to the living room and sits him in the chair once she's removed her father's corpse from it. After putting the mysterious puppet on him, she kills him using her reap hook. The ending credits begin to play showing photos of the past with Laura, Nestor and her father. The film continues showing Laura burning the pictures and walking through the forest and suddenly meeting up with a small child named Sophie. Sophie is the daughter that she had with Nestor, and they walk together through the forest hand in hand promising to start a new life together. The camera zooms in at Laura and then zooms out showing that Laura is only holding Sophie's doll, implying that Laura has lost all touch with reality and disappears into the distance.  
Silent Souls
 Aist is a middle-aged bachelor who leads a lonely life in the northern town of [[Neya (town)|Neya]]. Like many of his neighbours, he identifies himself as a [[Merya]]n and strives to keep alive the ancient traditions of his people. One day his boss, Miron, informs Aist of the death of his wife Tanya. Later, the pair spend quite some time washing her body and putting coloured threads in her pubic hair. (In their culture, the same ritual is performed on brides-to-be). The two men take her body to [[Gorbatov (town)|Gorbatov]] (the smallest town in Russia), in order to perform cremation rites on the banks of the [[Oka River]]. In the car, they carry with them two [[Bunting (bird)|Bunting]] birds. On their way back to Neya, they get lost and are approached by two prostitutes, with whom they have sex. Later on, while crossing "the great Meryan river" (The [[Volga]]), on the [[Kineshma Bridge]], the Buntings fly around the car, causing it to crash into the river. Both men drown.  
The Silence (2010 film)
  Summer 1986: Pia, an 11-year-old schoolgirl, is raped and murdered in a wheat field near a small provincial German town by one man while another man watches silently from the passenger seat of his red car. The murderer packs Pia's body into the trunk of the car and leaves her bicycle behind.  In 2009, exactly 23 years later, 13-year-old Sinikka Weghamm goes missing from the local fair. Her bicycle is discovered in the same spot where Pia's bike had been found.  Senior detective Krischan Mittich, who investigated the original murder, has just retired. The new murder investigation is undertaken by David Jahn, a detective who is still emotionally overwhelmed by the death of his wife five months earlier. Mittich takes an interest in the new case, but he is blocked from participating by the new senior detective, Matthias Grimmer, who insists on doing things his way, even when he is wrong.  A flashback shows the initial meeting of Pia's murderer, Danish national Peer Sommer, and his companion, a student named Timo. The men form a bond as Sommer shares his collection of [[pornographic]] films, including one that shows the abuse of an adolescent girl, with Timo.  Timo leaves after Pia's murder, to Sommer's dismay.  Mittich, the retired detective, visits Pia's mother and rails against the false hope that detective Grimmer holds out for Sinikka's parents, who grow increasingly upset at the lack of progress in the investigation.  Timo, who has married, taken his wife's last name, and had two children of his own, is now an architect. Upon hearing of the new murder, he leaves home and makes his way back to Sommer. Sommer is glad to see his old friend and says that he'd tried unsuccessfully to find Timo after he'd left 23 years earlier. Sommer gives Timo a DVD copy of the old film with the girl.  Timo leaves Sommer again. He watches the DVD in his hotel room and cries with shame and guilt. He goes to see Pia's mother. His questions about Pia make the mother suspicious, and she tells ex-detective Mittich about him. Timo goes to the police station, presumably to confess, and Jahn notices him in the parking lot about to exit his car, but Timo has second thoughts and leaves.  Based on Timo's suspicious questions to Pia's mother, Jahn and Mittich visit Timo's house. He is not home, but the detectives question his wife and then find child pornography on his computer.  Jahn meanwhile has gotten the idea of matching the list of red cars in the vicinity of Pia's murder with the list of red cars in the vicinity of an earlier murder. After initially rejecting the idea, Grimmer adopts the idea and sends his subordinates, including pregnant Jana Gläser, but not including Jahn, out to interview the owners of the cars. Jahn sets out with Gläser anyway, but he leaves her when he gets word that a suspicious man (Timo) has visited Pia's mother. Gläser interviews Sommer alone. Sommer consults his diary to provide an alibi for his whereabouts at the time of Sinikka's murder; he hides a knife on his person in case she acts too suspicious, but she tentatively accepts the alibi, though she puts a question mark next to Sommer's name.  Timo commits suicide by driving a car into the lake where Sinikka is later found, and afterwards, Grimmer believes that Timo was the sole murderer of both girls, but Jahn is not convinced. Following this, Sinikka's body is found by a swimmer, and her parents are informed. Jahn realizes that Pia's headphones had been tossed from the passenger side of the car after her murder, and that means that someone else was driving the car. He hypothesizes that Sinikka's murder had been a signal from the other man, a lonely pedophile, that he wanted to reunite with his old friend. But Grimmer does not want to hear any new theories, and, after a tussle, he suspends Jahn.  Sommer, who had told detective Gläser that he no longer has a car, is seen returning home in a car lent to him by a neighbor—the same car that was used in Sinikka's abduction. He learns of Timo's death, and the film ends with him contemplating the loss of his friend.

 Detective Sean Riley ([[Johnny Strong]]) is emotionally destroyed after the death of his son and the abandonment of his wife. After the death of his partner, Det. Dave Besson ([[Kim Coates]]), Riley's superior, Captain Trahan ([[Tom Berenger]]) assigns Riley to investigate a series of murders involving victims burned several times over. One of the victims is the younger brother of infamous gangster Weddo ([[Method Man]]), which sparks a gang war in the Big Easy.  Riley's childhood friend Colin ([[Sean Patrick Flanery]]) resurfaces one night. He tells Riley that since they served in the military together, he has gotten various freelance jobs with a private security company called Spartan. The next day, Riley is partnered with Detective Will Ganz ([[Kevin Phillips (actor)|Kevin Phillips]]), a stable family man, to continue his investigation. They stumble into a group of mercenaries in the act of burning another victim, and a shootout ensues.   It is revealed that a man named Raymond Crowe ([[Costas Mandylor]]) hired the mercenaries. As the investigation continues, Riley discovers that Colin is in possession of incriminating evidence against Spartan: a video of the same mercenaries from the shootout executing innocents while on assignment. Riley and Ganz find Colin at a decrepit part of the city, but too late. The mercenaries, now revealed to be Spartans, attack. A badly wounded Colin takes his own life, blowing up the house he is in so that Riley and Ganz can escape.  Trahan tells Riley that the city wants to blame Riley for the disastrous results of the investigation. Riley decides to take matters into his own hands, stockpiling weapons in his home. Trahan comes over to try to talk him out of it, but is ambushed and killed by Dekker ([[Bas Rutten]]), a leader of the mercenaries. Dekker tries to kill Riley, but Riley manages to kill him. He discovers that Crowe has kidnapped Ganz.  Riley breaks into Crowe's stronghold and kills the remaining mercenaries. Crowe manages to escape, leading to a street chase. Crowe reveals his intentions and manages to shoot Riley, but Riley shoots him down on the street. Riley is about to kill Crowe, and Ganz shouts at him to do it, but Riley decides not kill him; instead, Weddo and his gang drive up and take Crowe with them, presumably to kill him themselves. Later, Riley visits Ganz's child's birthday party. Afterward, he visits the cemetery where his son is buried.  
The Sinking of the Laconia
 [[File:RMS Laconia Crest.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Badge of the 1921 Cunard liner ''[[RMS Laconia (1921)|Laconia]]]]  In September 1942, six hundred miles from the west coast of Africa, the German [[U-boat]]  sinks the British [[troopship]] ''Laconia'', which is en route from [[Cape Town]] to the United Kingdom.  On realising that there are Italian POWs and civilians amongst the shipwrecked, who face certain death without rescue, U-boat Commander [[Werner Hartenstein]] (Duken) makes a decision that goes against the orders of German high command. The U-boat surfaces and Hartenstein instructs his men to save as many survivors as they can. Hartenstein also attempts to dive with all survivors on board and, although this puts the submarine into a [[crash dive]], control is regained and it resurfaces. He also has a [[Red Cross]] flag displayed and a message sent to the Allies to organise rescue of the survivors. The Italian prisoners are taken off U-156 by another U-boat and an Italian submarine.  The British requested the Americans to look for ''Laconia'' survivors, but did not inform them of the submarine's rescue effort. Soon after the American bomber attack, U-156 resumes her hunting duties, leaving behind the lifeboats with the British survivors to be picked up by a [[Vichy France|Vichy]] naval surface ship sent by [[Karl Dönitz|Admiral Dönitz]]. While admiring Hartenstein's actions, Dönitz also reluctantly composes the [[Laconia Order]] to other U-boat commanders not to rescue survivors in future. The French ship arrives; one lifeboat leaves the others to make for the coast of west Africa, which it eventually reaches. One British merchant officer is injured in the American attack and remains with U-156 until it reaches port, where he is taken prisoner. Dönitz awards Hartenstein the ''[[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross|Ritterkreuz]]'' and reposts him to a desk job at naval command. Preferring to remain with his men, Hartenstein refuses it and a final on screen message reports U-156's later sinking with no survivors.  
Sintel
 The main character, Sintel, is attacked while traveling through a wintry mountainside. After defeating her attacker and taking his spear, she finds refuge in a shaman's hut. He asks her why she is traveling, and she confesses that she is looking for a dragon, leading into a flashback. Sintel was a homeless loner, looking for food when she discovered an injured baby dragon. She nursed him back to health and named him Scales, and the two quickly formed an emotional bond. One day, while Scales was flying, he was captured by an adult dragon. Determined to get him back, she began the long and dangerous journey that led her to the shaman's hut.  Sintel is ready to give up when the shaman tells her that they are in dragon lands, showing her the glyph on her attacker's spear as proof. She finds the tree pictured on the spear, and near it a cave with an adult dragon and his baby. The baby runs away upon seeing Sintel, and the adult dragon attacks. After a brief battle the adult dragon pins Sintel to the ground, but freezes when he recognizes her scent. Sintel takes advantage of this momentary pause and stabs the dragon in the heart. As she is about to land the killing blow, she notices the scar on his wing is exactly the same as her old friend's. Sintel discovers in a moment of horror that she has just killed Scales.  Scales bleeds out rapidly, and Sintel stares in shock at her reflection in a pool of blood. It is revealed that she is significantly older than she has appeared throughout the film. She has much gray hair, worn and wrinkled skin, and several scars on her body. The long search for Scales had lasted many years, and she had never realized that Scales would have grown up. Her single-minded quest to get back her friend, and to take revenge on the large dragon who took Scales away, contributed to her mistaking Scales for the small dragon. The cave begins to collapse as Scales gives his last breath, and Sintel runs for the entrance.  After mourning over the friend she killed, Sintel leaves, heartbroken. Scales' baby, having nowhere else to go, follows her.

Ritchie is struggling trying to figure out his future, what he wants to do with his life and if he wants to go to college. When a [[tragedy]] occurs in Ritchie's life he is forced to make these decisions earlier than he expected.  
Sint
  On 5 December 1492, a gang led by former bishop Niklas is killed by villagers who refuse to put up with the gang's looting and killing any longer. In years in which the gang's death date coincides with a full moon, they return as murderous ghosts.  The public is unaware of this and annually celebrates the [[Sinterklaas]] tradition on 5 December, with adults not believing that Sinterklaas exists but making little children believe that he is benevolent. The [[Zwarte Piet]]en are not blackened by soot from chimneys but as a result of the fire in which they were killed. Niklas' [[crosier]] (bishops’ staff) has sharp edges and is a weapon. On 5 December Sinterklaas and the Zwarte Pieten do not stand out, as many people are dressed like them for the celebration.  The last time the ghostly gang returned was in 1968. Hundreds of people were killed, including the whole family of a little boy, Goert, who is now a police detective. The authorities downplay the incidents, and they, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, keep the possible involvement of Niklas a secret.  Since there is a full moon on 5 December 2010, Goert is very concerned and recommends forbidding all Sinterklaas activities and increasing surveillance, but he is not taken seriously and sent on leave. As Goert predicts, the gang returns and kills hundreds of people. While the gang is immune to bullets, they are finally chased away by fire.

Skyline (2010 film)
 Jarrod and his girlfriend Elaine have flown to Los Angeles for Jarrod's best friend Terry's birthday party. They celebrate with Terry's wife, Candice, and his assistant, Denise. During a private argument about whether or not they should move, Elaine reveals she is pregnant.  The next morning, blue lights descend from the sky, hypnotizing anyone who looks at them. The light affects them physically, causing them to become zombie-like, immobilized and collected by the light machines. Ray is taken, but Jarrod is saved when Terry tackles him. He and Terry go to the apartment roof to investigate the lights but are attacked by one of hundreds of flying alien drones. As they attempt to open the rooftop door, Elaine quickly opens it from the other side, accidentally looks directly into the aliens' light and is hypnotized, but Jarrod and Terry are able to save her and close the door.  Back in the apartment, Jarrod believes the open water would be a safer place, since there are no machines over the sea. They encounter a bickering couple, Colin and Jen, also preparing to flee the building. As Terry's car exits the garage it is flattened by a massive four-legged alien, killing Denise. Terry escapes but is abducted as he flees. The others retreat into the garage, where they encounter another alien lifeform in the shape of a large multi-tentacled squid that takes Colin. It corners the rest of the group before the building's concierge, Oliver, slams into it with an SUV and finds Colin alive. When they try to free him, the squid creature comes back to life, sucking out Colin's brain and regaining its energy. As they run back into the building, Jen is abducted.  The next day, the United States Air Force launches an attack against the alien spaceships and flying alien drones using stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicles and conventional drone aircraft armed with air-to-air missiles (a "jet engine" powered [[MQ-9 Reaper]]). Only one stealth plane (an [[X-47B]]) pierces the carnage and fires a nuclear missile, hitting the mothership, before it is destroyed. The detonation blows the ship apart, but it slowly begins to repair itself. After Jarrod tells Elaine that the alien light made him feel powerful, he is adamant that safety must be found outside. Oliver wants to stay inside and tries restraining him. Jarrod physically starts changing as he lifts Oliver off the floor and vows that he will protect his family.  Helicopters arrive with soldiers as Jarrod and Elaine go to the roof hoping to catch a ride to safety. Oliver and Candice stay in the penthouse, but are found. Candice is hypnotized and abducted; Oliver attempts to kill a tanker alien by turning on a gas stove and igniting a lighter, causing the room to explode. The soldiers are thrown off the roof by the aliens and a squid alien attacks Jarrod and Elaine. They kill it, but Jarrod is badly hurt. Surrounded by the aliens, they accept their fate, look into the blue light, and are sucked into the mother ship.  Inside the alien spacecraft, Elaine wakes on a pile of human corpses. Tubes are sucking human brains into machines; probes go through the pile looking for what they can find. Elaine sees Jarrod in the pile but has to watch helplessly as his brain is removed. She is probed, but left alone since she is pregnant. Elaine is transported to another chamber where other pregnant women have been sent. Meanwhile, Jarrod's brain, glowing red instead of the usual aliens' blue, is inserted into a new alien body.  Animating the alien body, Jarrod seems to retain control, and comes to the aid of Elaine and their unborn child. Elaine recognizes him when he caresses her belly and her head. He then turns around to confront advancing aliens, and in between the credits, a series of still images depict "Jarrod" protecting Elaine and their child from the other aliens.

Skinning (film)
 The film opens with actual news footage of protests in front of the American embassy in Belgrade following the [[Kosovo is Serbia protest 2008|Kosovo is Serbia protest rally]] that was held in response to the [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|17 February 2008 unilateral declaration of independence]] by ethnic Albanians inhabiting Serbia's southern province of [[Kosovo]]. This news footage is intercut with shots of the movie's main protagonist, skinhead Novica, protesting by leading chants and lighting flares in front of the embassy while he's also providing narration.  The story than backs up as Novica ([[Nikola Rakočević]]), a timid and geeky [[high school]] student with frumpy clothing and disheveled thick hair, is introduced. He lives in Belgrade where his life revolves around attending advanced math classes for gifted kids and taking part in math competitions. Due to his awkwardness around people, his social life is nothing to speak of - his only friends are his stoner cousin Mirko (Miloš Tanasković) as well as an even nerdier math colleague Stanislav (Vladimir Tešović).  At a math competition as the students are working away solving problems, Novica is pressured into cheating by Relja, a confident skinhead full of bravado who is also gifted at math, but doesn't quite possess Novica's math problem-solving skills. Relja is seated relatively close to Novica at the competition and is stuck on a question that he can't solve. Obviously flattered by the attention from a kid placed much higher on the high school social scale, Novica passes Relja the solution written on a piece of paper. The competition supervisor notices something untoward occurred and tells Novica to report the person he'd helped without penalty to himself. Wanting to cover for Relja, Novica purposely wrongly points out nerdy Stanislav as the recipient of his help, leading to the supervisor throwing both Novica and Stanislav out thus breaking her promise to spare Novica.  Outside, Relja is happy and impressed with Novica's behaviour under pressure, handing him a copy of Hitler's ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' as well as extending an invite to a lecture by professor Hadži-Tankosić ([[Predrag Ejdus]]) at the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]]. Novica brings his cousin Mirko along who, dissatisfied with the right-wing, anti-Semitic overtones in professor's lecture, leaves early on. Novica, on the other hand, remains and is very much receptive to what he's hearing.  The next day Relja takes Novica to a football match since his skinheads are active as fans of FK Radnik - corrupt lower-league club financed by the local gangster nicknamed Pufta ([[Srđan Miletić]]). Though seemingly faithful supporters of the club, they don't care much for football, mostly using the matches as the public platform to raise the group's profile and further their right-wing political agenda through racist chanting, violence, and [[hooliganism]]. Additionally, skinheads have an extremely antagonistic relationship with the club's financier Pufta, regularly getting into fights with "Pufta's [[chav|diesel boys]]" - small group of fans on his payroll. Since he doesn't own the club, Pufta's motivation for getting involved with football is taking advantage of his vaguely defined "financier role" in order to siphon off the funds from player transfers abroad. As he conducts his business in ruthless manner, his biggest rivals are similarly run FK Kosančić, the club that also has a financier - a mafia widow. At this particular match FK Radnik is playing [[FK Novi Pazar]] and there's no shortage of hateful chants and violence as Novica and Relja, among others, get taken to the police station where they're questioned by corrupt inspector Milutin ([[Nikola Kojo]]) and young idealistic policewoman Lidija ([[Nataša Šolak]]) who recently joined the force. She immediately notices that Novica doesn't really fit the usual skinhead profile and encourages him to get out, even giving him her personal contact in case he ever needs help.  Couple of days later, Relja formally introduces Novica to the various individuals that make up his skinhead, white supremacist group, including his sexy girlfriend Mina ([[Bojana Novaković]]) and computer geek Svarog, all of whom hang out in an underground [[swastika]]-adorned cave where they mostly guzzle beer and listen to hard core bands such as [[Direktori]]. As it turns out, Novica already knows Mina from the neighbourhood (they once got jumped by a group of diesel boys, barely managing to escape) and already harbours some emotions towards her. Mina seduces Novica, symbolising his seduction into the world of [[white power skinhead|racist skinheads]].  Hanging out one night, under the influence of alcohol, the group is walking along the river quay when they run into one of the diesel boys who's all by himself. In addition to belonging to their hated rival group, he's also Roma, which makes him even more of a target in their eyes. Relja however orders them not to bother, but Novica who is for the confrontation with the others backing him with words, charges and beats the guy with fists. Relja and the others pull Novica from killing the gipsy but he surprises all by taking construction block piece and kills the gipsy. Shocked by the gruesome crime Novica just committed, other skinheads panic a bit before regrouping and deciding to dump the body into the river and sink with it with rocks.

Meanwhile, a greedy developer who has set his sights on Slime City hires a team of mercenaries to wipe out the creatures.  
Sleeping with Charlie Kaufman
 In an interview with Xtranormal, J Roland Kelly describes the film as "...basically this absurd, funny conversation between a guy and his girlfriend. He tells her he fantasizes about her twin sister, but she doesn’t have a twin sister, so it’s just another way of fantasizing about her… and is she offended. [It draws on] some [[French New Wave|La Nouvelle Vague]] & [[Mumblecore]] elements from the kind of films I was watching at the time."<ref name="bts"/>

 Walter Weed is an unassuming desk jockey at the [[FBI]] when the Bureau uncovers a plot to assassinate him. Mysterious Hal Leuco has hired several assassins to take out Weed on April 19 at exactly 3:00am. These include Ariella Martinez, a [[femme fatale]] who kills her victims with exotic poisons; Finbar McTeague who is also known as "The Surgeon", who brutally tortures his victims; the Southern Tremor family consisting of father Fritz and children; Lester, Kaitlyn, Baby Boy, and finally Lazlo Soot, from [[Smokin' Aces|the first film]], who is a master-of-disguise assassin.  An FBI unit, led by Special Agent Zane Baker secures Weed in a Chicago lounge called the "Little Jazz After Hours Club." The bar, run by Special Agent Malcolm Little has a bunker deep below it and several lines of defense stand between the assassins and Weed, locked down inside it with Baker and Agents Nicholas and Redstone. On the surface, Agent Dominic Dumare, Little, Abrego, Salerno, and an entire unit of FBI agents act as patrons or staff at the bar. The assassins enter the city in separate manners, all ready to meet the 3am deadline. McTeague and Martinez meet in the bar while the Tremors kill the agents on the roof across from the bar and prepare to storm the bar. Soot kills Agent Dumare in his hotel room and disguises himself as him, allowing him access to the bunker.  Eight minutes before the deadline, McTeague and Martinez working together create a hostage situation where McTeague holds Martinez hostage, creating a [[Mexican standoff]] between the assassins and the FBI agents. The standoff escalates when the Tremors fire a clown with a bomb strapped to him through the bar doors. A shootout ensues; however, the agents and the assassins are unable to kill each other. Martinez breaks cover and kills some of the agents including Salerno, before being shot and wounded. McTeague takes her to a closet where he cradles her as she dies. At this point, the Tremors break into the bar, firing heavy machine guns and killing all of the agents save for Little who escapes. McTeague, angry at Martinez's death fights Baby Boy, attaching an explosive to him before being gunned down by Lester and Fritz; the explosive that explodes within the body then kills Baby Boy.  Meanwhile, Soot has escaped the firefight and still disguised as Dumare, convinces Abrego to let him into the secure area. He then double-crosses Abrego and kills him. Before he dies, Abrego manages to pull off Soot's mask, ruining his disguise. The Tremors breach the elevator and kill the last remaining agents outside the bunker. Soot takes an agent hostage and threatens to kill him unless Baker opens the bunker door, but Baker refuses. At the same time, the Tremors fire a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] at the door, which Soot narrowly escapes.  Kaitlyn, who has penetrated the tunnels next to the bunker, blows a hole in it and starts firing on the agents inside, trying to kill Weed. Nicholas is killed protecting him just before Baker shoots and kills Kaitlyn. With only two minutes to go, Weed suddenly tries to open the bunker door and reveals he has C4 hidden under his wheelchair and is rigged to a [[dead man switch]]. Redstone tries to shoot Weed but is wounded by Baker who attempts to talk Weed down. Weed says that he must die to kill the assassins, who have committed heinous acts against America and that by blowing himself up, Weed will be hailed as a patriotic hero for killing the assassins when he dies.  Realising Weed will not back down, Baker drags the wounded Redstone to the "spider trap", a hole in the bunker's floor, which can be used to safeguard people from the bunker collapsing. Weed detonates the C4, destroying both the bunker and the bar. Baker is unable to get Redstone into the spider trap and can only save himself. Fritz is critically wounded by the bomb and begs for help from Lester, who coldly kills him for abusing him for years.  Not long after, Baker emerges from the spider trap and comes out of the ruins of the bar to find emergency services securing the area, with only Little and Baker surviving out of the FBI agents. Baker is approached by Special Agent Anthony Vejar who asks him if he saw Weed die, telling him that Vejar's unit believes that Weed was also Hal Leuco who works for a CIA elite [[black ops]] unit. With a combined career in both the FBI and CIA, Weed/Leuco was able to access information about the assassins and used them for covert missions over the years, allegedly for patriotic interest.  Posing as Leuco, he hired the assassins to kill Weed so he could gather them all in one place and have them kill each other or be killed by the FBI. Baker realises that Weed/Leuco is still alive after Vejar mentions that Hal Leuco is short for ''Haliaeetus leucocephalus'', bald eagle's scientific name, which was part of a playing card set Weed played with in the bunker. Weed/Leuco is shown to be alive and gets into a car. As he drives off, however, he is shot and killed by Baker who then walks away. Lester Tremor and Lazlo Soot are also shown to have escaped the blast and walk away from the scene.  
A Small Act
 Chris Mburu is a [[United Nations]] human rights advocate. As a child in Kenya, he was a good student, but would not have been able to enter [[secondary school]], as only [[Primary School]] is free of cost in Kenya. Due to his outstanding grades, Chris was selected for a direct scholarship, provided to him by a Swedish woman named Hilde Back, who had fled Nazi Germany because of her Jewish heritage.  In the present day, Mburu has decided to create a scholarship program of his own, and names it after his former benefactor, Hilde Back. In Kenya, Three gifted students, Kimani, Ruth, and Caroline are vying for a scholarship that may be their only chance to continue school. Kimani, Ruth and Caroline take the [[Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]] Test, a nationwide standard that will determine their eligibility for Mburu's scholarship program. However, the violence and mayhem of the [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis]] may jeopardize the students' dreams.  Due to a lack of students meeting the predetermined threshold on the tests, Kimani is given a scholarship.

The Social Network
  In October 2003, 19-year-old [[Harvard University]] student [[Mark Zuckerberg]] is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright. Returning to his dorm, Zuckerberg writes an insulting entry about Albright on his [[LiveJournal]] blog and then creates a campus website called [[Facemash]] by hacking into college databases to steal photos of female students, then allowing site visitors to rate their attractiveness. After traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's computer network, Zuckerberg is given six months of [[Disciplinary probation|academic probation]]. However, Facemash's popularity attracts the attention of Harvard upperclassmen and twins [[Cameron Winklevoss|Cameron]] and [[Tyler Winklevoss]] and their business partner [[Divya Narendra]]. The trio invites Zuckerberg to work on [[Harvard Connection]], a social network featuring the exclusive nature of Harvard students and aimed at dating.  After agreeing to work on the Winklevoss twins' concept, Zuckerberg approaches his friend [[Eduardo Saverin]] with an idea for what he calls ''Thefacebook'', an online social networking website that would be exclusive to [[Ivy League]] students. Saverin provides $1,000 in seed funding, allowing Mark to build the website, which quickly becomes popular. When they learn of ''Thefacebook'', the Winklevoss twins and Narendra are incensed, believing that Zuckerberg stole their idea while keeping them deliberately in the dark by stalling on developing the Harvard Connection website. They raise their complaint with Harvard President [[Larry Summers]], who is dismissive and sees no value in either disciplinary action or ''Thefacebook'' website itself.  Saverin and Zuckerberg meet fellow student Christy Lee, who asks them to "Facebook me", a phrase which impresses both of them. As ''Thefacebook'' grows in popularity, Zuckerberg extends the network to [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]] and [[Stanford University]]. Lee arranges for Saverin and Zuckerberg to meet [[Napster]] co-founder [[Sean Parker]], who presents a "billion dollar" vision for the company that impresses Zuckerberg. He also suggests dropping "The" from ''Thefacebook'', just calling it ''Facebook''. At Parker's suggestion, the company moves to [[Palo Alto]], with Saverin remaining in New York to work on business development. After Parker promises to expand Facebook to two continents, Zuckerberg invites him to live at the house he is using as company headquarters.  While competing in the [[Henley Royal Regatta]] for Harvard against the [[Hollandia Roeiclub]], the Winklevoss twins discover that Facebook has expanded to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[London School of Economics|LSE]], and decide to sue the company for theft of [[Intellectual property rights|intellectual property]]. Meanwhile, Saverin objects to Parker making business decisions for Facebook and freezes the company's bank account in the resulting dispute. He later relents when Zuckerberg reveals that they have secured $500,000 from [[angel investor]] [[Peter Thiel]]. However, Saverin becomes enraged when he discovers that the new investment deal allows his share of Facebook to be [[Stock dilution|diluted]] from 34% to 0.03%, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Zuckerberg and Parker, and Saverin vows to sue Zuckerberg for all the company's shares before being ejected from the building. Subsequently, Saverin's name is removed from the masthead as co-founder. Later, a cocaine possession incident involving Parker and his attempt to place the blame on Saverin finally convinces Zuckerberg to cut ties with him.  Throughout the film, the narrative is intercut with scenes from [[Deposition (law)|depositions]] taken in the Winklevoss twins' and Saverin's respective lawsuits against Zuckerberg and Facebook. The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. At the end, Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's own callous attitude will make him highly unsympathetic to a jury. After everyone leaves, Zuckerberg is shown sending a friend request to Albright on Facebook and then refreshing the webpage every few seconds as he waits for her response.  The epilogue states that Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss received a [[Settlement (litigation)|settlement]] of $65&nbsp;million, signed a [[non-disclosure agreement]], and rowed in the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Beijing Olympics]], placing sixth; Eduardo Saverin received a settlement of an unknown amount and his name was restored to the Facebook masthead as a co-founder; the website has over 500&nbsp;million members in 207 countries and is valued at $25&nbsp;billion; and Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest self-made billionaire.

Something Like a Business
   
The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010 film)
  In 740 AD, in [[England]], the mighty magician [[Merlin]] has three apprentices; Balthazar Blake, Veronica Gorloisen and Maxim Horvath. Horvath betrays his master by joining forces with the evil sorceress [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana le Fay]]. Morgana mortally wounds Merlin before Veronica is able to rip Morgana's soul from her body and absorbs it into her own. As Morgana attempts to kill Veronica by possessing her from within, Balthazar stops her by imprisoning Morgana and Veronica in the "Grimhold", a magic prison in the shape of a [[nesting doll]]. Before dying, Merlin gives Balthazar a dragon figurine that will identify the Prime Merlinean, Merlin's descendant and the only one able to defeat Morgana. While he searches for his descendant throughout history, Balthazar imprisons Morganians, sorcerers who try to release Morgana, including Horvath, into successive layers on the Grimhold.  In 2000, in [[New York City]], 10-year-old Dave Stutler, encounters Balthazar in his Manhattan antique store, after straying from his school field trip. When Balthazar gives Dave Merlin's dragon figurine, the statue comes to life and wraps itself around the boy's finger to form a ring. When Balthazar goes to retrieve a book meant to teach magic, Dave accidentally opens the Grimhold, releasing the imprisoned Horvath. While battling for possession of the Grimhold, Balthazar and Horvath are imprisoned in an ancient Chinese [[urn]] with a ten-year lock curse. Dave is then ridiculed by his classmates when he claims he saw magic, only to find the shop empty. He is faced with severe bullying, and is misdiagnosed with [[hallucination]] caused by a "glucose imbalance". David nevertheless keeps the ring.   Ten years later in 2010, Dave, now 20 years old, is a [[physics]] student at [[New York University]], and meets his childhood crush Becky. He immediately becomes smitten with her, and repairs the transmitting mast of the radio station she works at after it is struck by lightning. The ten-year imprisonment curse of the urn ends, releasing Horvath and Balthazar. Horvath pursues Dave and the Grimhold. Balthazar rescues Dave, riding an animated steel eagle adapted from a [[Chrysler Building]] gargoyle. Dave initially refuses to help Balthazar, having been under psychiatric care since their first meeting, until the elder agrees to leave after finding the Grimhold. They track the Grimhold to [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], where Horvath has released the next Morganian, Sun Lok. Dave defeats Sun Lok, and Balthazar retrieves the Grimhold. Dave changes his mind, deciding that he likes magic after all, and agrees to become Balthazar's apprentice. He also becomes romantically involved with Becky against Balthazar's wishes and advice, impressing her by playing the [[OneRepublic]] song "[[Secrets (OneRepublic song)|Secrets]]" with the [[Tesla coils]] he has been experimenting with. Horvath enlists a youthful Morganian, celebrity magician Drake Stone to get back the Grimhold. They attempt to kill Dave, but Balthazar saves him. Cued by Horvath, Dave demands to know the truth about Balthazar's quest. Balthazar reveals that Morgana is trapped in the Grimhold with Veronica. Morgana, if freed, would cast a spell called "The Rising", which would revive sorcerers from the dead and enslave mankind. As Prime Merlinian, Dave will become powerful enough to cast spells without his ring (a focus, which for any other magician is the only way to channel their magic), and is the only one who can stop her. Despite Balthazar's disdain of his relationship with Becky, Dave convinces to allow him to meet her for a date. Dave tries to use magic to clean his lab, but loses control of his animated cleaning mops and forces him to cancel his date with Becky.  He is saved because of Balthazar's intervention and, disillusioned, decides to give up on magic, until Becky unknowingly changes his mind.  He returns to his underground subway lab, just as Drake and Horvath try to kill Balthazar and steal the Grimhold. Horvath, having no more use for Drake, casts a parasite spell and steals Drake's magic and his ring. Horvath releases the witch [[Abigail Williams (Salem witch trials)|Abigail Williams]], uses her to kidnap Becky, then steals her magic and pendant focus. He threatens to kill Becky, forcing Dave to surrender the Grimhold and his ring. Balthazar goes after Horvath in [[Battery Park]], sure that Dave, without his ring, will be killed. Horvath releases Morgana, who begins the Rising Spell while Horvath animates the [[Charging Bull]] sculpture and commands it to attack Balthazar. Dave arrives and stuns Horvath with a Tesla coil tied to Balthazar's car while Balthazar's eagle flies away with the bull. Becky interrupts the Rising Spell, stunning Morgana. Balthazar takes Morgana, body and soul, from Veronica into himself, but Morgana escapes and tries to incinerate them. Dave attempts to stop her without his ring and succeeds, proving that he is the Prime Merlinean. Morgana shoots plasma bolts at the three and overwhelming Balthazar and Veronica's shield spells, kills Balthazar when he bodily intercepts a bolt meant for Veronica. Dave makes another, larger Tesla coil out of the square's lamp posts and power lines to overwhelm her and then fires a plasma barrage which finally destroys her. He revives Balthazar by restarting his heart with plasma shocks. Balthazar and Veronica reunite. Dave and Becky kiss, and fly to [[France]] for breakfast on Balthazar's eagle.  In a post-credits scene, Horvath takes his hat at Balthazar's shop.

Sound of Noise
 A group of six anarchist drummers led by musician Sanna Persson and a conductor named Magnus set out to make music with objects that are generally considered non-musical. They plan out a concert with four humorously titled movements to be played across the city after carefully analyzing what objects can be used to make good music. All the while, the group is pursued by Amadeus Warnebring, a tone-deaf policeman born into a distinguished musical family<ref></ref> who hates the sound of music.  The group begins by playing in a surgery room using a notable TV reporter who has been admitted to the hospital for hemorrhoid surgery.<ref name="lee 2010">Lee, Noah (September 26, 2010). [http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/26117/#ixzz2HRhdkMg2 Sound of Noise.] ''[[Film Threat]]''</ref> Their next piece is set in a bank where they ostensibly hold up the staff and customers. They then feed banknotes into the shredding machine for a distorted bass sound. The next piece uses bulldozers thumping the ground at the fountain in front of an opera house. For the crescendo, they strike the fountain knocking it to the ground. The last piece involves them hanging from high tension power cables and playing the suspended cables like violins.  Warnebring eventually comes to realize that the objects and people used by the anarchists as instruments are rendered silent to his ears after the fact, due to his tone-deafness. From this he forms a plan to force the drummers into using the entire city as an instrument by way of rhythmically controlling the power supply. The plan succeeds: Persson observes that the ambient sounds around her have become musical, while Warnebring can hear no such sounds. The film ends with the anarchists exiled from the city and performing as a lounge act as Warnebring enjoys a silent orchestral concert elsewhere.

None of them know about his job. One day, Gillian leaves to visit her father in a hospital in [[Denver, Colorado]] and leaves Bob to take care of her children, who all despise him and plot to get rid of him. Using some technology from the CIA, Bob is able to get control of them. His partner, Colton James, informs him that Poldark has escaped prison and they suspect there is a mole in the CIA. Colton sends a file to Bob's computer for a top-secret formula for an [[Microbial biodegradation|oil-eating bacteria]] Poldark is working on. While snooping around Bob's house, Ian downloads the file, which he mistakes for music, onto his iPod. Poldark discovers the download and sends some of his people to Bob's house, but Bob overpowers them.  After the attack, Bob and the children hide at a Chinese restaurant, where Poldark's teenage henchman, Larry, tries to kill Bob. Bob defeats him and is forced to tell the children about his job.

Space Battleship Yamato (2010 film)
 In 2199, after five years of attacks by an alien race known as Gamilas which rendered the surface of the Earth uninhabitable and forcing humanity to evacuate underground, the Earth Defense Force launches a counter-offensive near Mars. The fleet's weapons are no match for the Gamilas, who easily wipe out much of the force. During the battle, EDF captain Mamoru Kodai volunteers to use his damaged ship, the destroyer ''Yukikaze'', as a shield to cover Captain Jyuzo Okita's battleship, allowing his escape. Mamoru's ship is destroyed.  On Earth, Mamoru's brother Susumu is scavenging on the irradiated surface near the half-buried wreck of the [[Japanese battleship Yamato|battleship ''Yamato'']], when an object impacts near him and knocks him unconscious. He awakens to find an alien message capsule. Susumu also notices that the [[radiation]] has been reduced to safe levels around him. He is rescued by Okita's returning ship and it is discovered that the capsule contains engineering schematics for a new warp drive and coordinates for the planet from which it came, Iskandar. After learning what happened at Mars, Susumu accuses Okita of using his brother as a living shield and tries to hit him, but crew member Yuki Mori violently stops him.  The radiation that covers the Earth's surface is slowly sinking into the ground, scientists predict that the human race will become extinct in one year. Okita believes the hope for humanity lies at Iskandar. A request for volunteers for the mission is sent out, saying that Iskandar possesses a device that can remove the effects of radiation. Kodai - a former EDF pilot - decides to reenlist. Their last battleship, the long-dead ''Yamato'', is rebuilt and enhanced with alien technology. Before the ''Yamato'' can launch, the Gamilas attack with a gigantic missile. Captain Okita gives the order to fire the yet-untested Wave Motion Cannon, which successfully destroys the incoming missile. Kodai is reunited with his old fighter squad. Yuki, who joined the EDF years ago because of her admiration for Kodai, is bitter towards him, believing he left out of fear.   The ''Yamato'' crew performs their first warp test and encounters more Gamilas ships. Since the Wave Motion Cannon is powered by the same reactor as the warp drive, the crew has to wait until the engine recharges before they can warp again. The ''Yamato'' destroys the alien capital ships, but the battle damages Yuki's fighter. Kodai launches to rescue her and is sent to the [[Military prison#Brig|brig]] for disobeying orders. Shima, Kodai's former squadmate and the acting navigator, tells Yuki that Kodai left the service because he accidentally caused the death of his own parents and also nearly Shima's pregnant wife during a mission.  After warping out of the Milky Way, the ''Yamato'' crew finds a Gamilas fighter adrift and recovers it to study. At the same time, Captain Okita goes into [[cardiac arrest]] and is revealed to be terminally ill. However, the alien pilot is still alive and possesses Commando Team Leader Hajime Saitō, in order to communicate. The alien calls himself Dessla and says the Gamilas are a race with a [[Group mind (science fiction)|hive mind]]. Kodai stuns the possessed Saito and the alien apparently is destroyed.  Later, an ailing Captain Okita makes Kodai the acting-captain. He also reveals that the capsule contained only the plans for the Wave Motion Engine and the coordinates to Iskandar, and the idea of the device was made up to give humanity hope. The crew discovers the captured Gamilas fighter contains a homing beacon, giving away their position. The ''Yamato'' fires its Wave Motion Cannon to destroy a Gamilas ship, but a stealth Gamilas spacecraft latches onto the ship's occupied third bridge on the bottom of the hull and begins a self-destruct sequence. Kodai reluctantly orders Yuki, in her fighter, to blast the third bridge support away moments before it detonates, saving the ''Yamato'' but killing several crew. Kodai apologizes to Yuki for ordering her to doom their crewmates, and they have a romantic moment as the ship warps again.  The ''Yamato'' arrives at Iskandar, but is met by a large Gamilas fleet that sends a spacecraft to obstruct the muzzle of the Wave Motion Cannon. With their main weapon disabled, Kodai makes the dangerous choice to conduct a random warp and ends up at the opposite side of Iskandar. They are surprised to see that it is lifeless, and in fact strongly resembles Earth in its presently irradiated state. It is then discovered that Gamilas and Iskandar are the same planet. The crew thinks it is a trap, but Kodai urges them to go ahead. He leads an attack party to the planet's surface against heavy Gamilas opposition. Much of the assault force is killed, and the remaining pilots stay behind to cover for Kodai, science officer Sanada, Saito and Mori as they head for the coordinates.  Once they reach the coordinates, an alien possesses Yuki's body and explains that the Gamilas and Iskandar are two aspects of the same race. The alien says their planet is dying and they saw Earth as the most suitable replacement, after first killing off humanity. Iskandar did not agree with this and thus they were imprisoned. Iskandar implants in Yuki the ability to cleanse the radiation from Earth. As she and Kodai return to the ''Yamato'', Saito and Sanada sacrifice themselves by destroying the Gamilas power source, destroying most of the Gamilas forces. The ''Yamato'' returns to Earth, where Okita dies. The crew rejoices at their return home, but a surviving Gamilas ship ambushes them and severely damages the battleship, disabling all of its weapons. Dessla now appears and says they no longer wish to invade the Earth; however, since the majority of the Gamilas were killed, he intends to destroy the planet with his ship to avenge his race. Kodai orders the surviving crew to abandon ship before he pilots the ''Yamato'' on a [[kamikaze]] attack against Dessler's ship. He fires the blocked Wave Motion Cannon, which vaporizes both spaceships.  The ending shows Yuki standing with a child, possibly Kodai's son, on the Earth's surface now restored to its original state.

However, Comet finds out that he was removed from the last space mission because of budget cuts. While Ham and Luna are goofing off, Comet rebelliously interferes with the controls on the rocket, accidentally launching the ship into space. Comet lands on Planet Malgor where he meets Ham's alien friend, Kilowatt ([[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]]), for the first time and gets respect from the residents there.   However, back on [[Earth]], Zartog ([[John DiMaggio]]), the villain from [[Space Chimps|the first film]],  sneaks in and takes over Mission Control with a remote that departiclizes objects and zaps the three scientists, Dr. Bob ([[Patrick Breen]]), Dr. Jagu ([[Omid Abtahi]]) and Dr. Poole ([[Jane Lynch]]) out of existence. Zartog wants to get revenge on Ham for foiling his plans and encounters an oblivious Titan ([[Patrick Warburton]]) who gives him a tour of Mission Control.  Comet, accompanied by Kilowatt, return to Earth, while Ham evades Zartog on a [[jetpack]]. While Zartog's distracted, Comet manages to steal the remote back and rewires it to bring the scientists back and shrink Zartog; Zartog escapes while the others laugh. The film ends with Zartog running from a dog he harassed earlier.  
Space Dogs
 A man in black is carrying a small cage from the [[Soviet Union]] to the [[United States|U.S.]] President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]]. In the cage is a present from [[Nikita Khrushchev|Krushchev]] to [[Caroline Kennedy]], a puppy named [[Strelka (dog)|Pushok]]. He finds the other Kennedy pets and tells them his story.  Three years earlier, in [[Moscow]] 1960, a strange man showed up, who was catching street dogs and taking them away. Once he tried to catch a dog named [[Strelka (dog)|Strelka]], but she ran away with her friend, the rat Venya. Then, Strelka went to go dig for bones and Venya went to a pay telephone to get some money.  Meanwhile, while Strelka was running from the strange man, at a local circus there was a bad situation at the circus: Vova, a pig, became too fat to fly on a rocket, and [[Belka (dog)|Belka]], a dog, flew instead of him. But Belka lost control of the rocket and flew away from the circus. After some time she crashed onto the pay phone where Venya the Rat was looking for coins. The crash broke the phone and Venya got all the money from the broken phone. After the crash Belka, Strelka and Venya were met by three other street dogs: a bulldog named Bula, a pug named Mula and a mutt named Pirate. Belka and Strelka ran from the other street dogs but the next morning all three of them were caught by the strange man.  After being caught the dogs are put on a train to [[Baikonur]] where they ended up at a Soviet space program training center. There they met their trainer, Kazbek, who had to choose the two best dogs from the group. A month before launch date the chosen group was Bula and Mula, but on the final training day Venya came in first, with Belka and Strelka in 2nd and 3rd place. Belka and Strelka needed to fly with Venya, because he was first and the flight group was chosen.  At the end of their flight, Strelka wanted to stay in space, because her mother had said that her father, Sirius, is living among the stars. Kazbek shows up having stowed away on their flight, and tried to convince Strelka to turn around. They saw a formation of objects flying towards them, believing them to be Space Dogs but they turned out to be meteorites, they got hit by a meteorite shower and the rocket caught fire from the damage. Strelka, Venya and Kazbek went to the back of the rocket to fight the fire with their feeding formula as water, Belka was afraid but still jumped through the fire ring in to the driver's seat to turn the rocket back towards Earth. Strelka extinguished the fire, and Kazbek confessed his love for Belka. The dogs look at various constellations and Strelka salutes [[Canis Major|Sirius]] in lieu of her father. The dog flight crew makes it back to Earth alive.  Strelka, Belka and Venya receive a heroes welcome, and it is discovered that Kazbek stowed away on the flight, but the Scientist in charge of the project tells him that Soviet [[Propaganda]] won't allow the world to know that a stow-away had been on the flight.  The other Kennedy pets, led by the cat, don't believe Pushok's story, except one French dog who sees the [[Cosmonaut]] Patch on Pushok's cushion. She then asks him to tell her what happened afterwards. Strelka returns to live with her mother. Venya holds conferences, telling his story to any willing to listen to him. Belka returns to her circus as the main star, flying the repaired rocket from earlier in the film. Kazbek lives together with his love Belka, and everyone lived happily ever after.  During the end credits, real-life archive footage from the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Soviet space program|Space Program]] and [[Soviet space dogs|Space Dogs]] is shown.

Spiderhole (film)
 Four homeless art students move into an abandoned house in London where a hidden terror lurks.  The movie begins with Molly (Emma Malin) waiting in an emergency room.  There is a television news broadcast about a missing girl. After being told by the physician that she has heartburn and to "lay off the spliffs," she's off riding her bike to her art class where she is drawing a nude woman. Luke (Reuben Henry-Biggs) is walking down the school hall to meet up with Molly to go squat.  Both walking to their vehicle, they meet up with Toby (George Magire) and Zoe (Amy Noble), all packing the van to go searching for a vacant home to squat.  While driving, they all discuss the legality of squatting and what they will be doing while [[squatting]].  When they arrive at their first destination, they quickly discover the residence is too secured and decide to drive around to find a new place.  They drive up to a huge abandoned home, break in, and quickly make themselves at home. Trying to turn on the water valve, Toby and Zoe have a quick sex scene.   Toby bumps into a wardrobe and a few pieces of clothing fall out.  As Zoe dances around the room with a hat from the wardrobe, Molly and Luke quickly recognize there is blood on the clothes.  Everyone is then freaked out and want to leave.  Toby suggests sleeping the night and leaving in the morning.  Everyone agrees.   After walking up, they discover they are locked inside the house and the tools they used to break in are now missing.  They discover their phones are also missing and there is no possible way out of the house.  They quickly come to the conclusion they are not alone and begin exploring the house.  They discover a dank room with four empty chairs lined up.  Going back to the room they slept in the night before, they notice a tiny hole in the boarded window.  They begin yelling for help when they see a patrol officer in front of the house looking at their parked van.  A door in the room quickly slams shut and a gas begins to seep through the threshold and knocks all four of them out.  Once they awake, Toby is missing and the remaining three frantically start looking for him.  While looking, Zoe cuts her leg.  The films cuts to Toby sitting in one of the four chairs in the dank room and a rubber gloved hand covers his mouth.  Back to the remaining three, Molly asks Zoe to show her where she cut her leg.  She brings them to a metal locker.  Luke and Molly move the locker and a horrible smell is omitted from a huge hole in the wall.  Luke stands in front of the hole and although we do not see him enter the hole in the wall, we are to assume he did as we get a glimpse of a few teeth in a wall pipe.  The film cuts back to Toby as he is now tied to a metal cot and he is thrashing in attempts to break free.  A man in a hazmat type suit and a surgical mask quickly enters the room and gives him a sedative that knocks him out.  The film cuts back to the remaining three.  Zoe starts to verbally assault Luke and asks him what he saw, that he looked shaken up by what he saw.  Luke claims he saw nothing, then confesses he saw mutilated body parts. Zoe and Molly are disturbed.  As Molly and Luke are talking, Zoe walks back to the hole in the wall and peeks inside.  As Luke and Molly realize Zoe is not in the room with them, they rush to the hole in the wall just as Zoe is being dragged in by the man in the hazmat suit.  As Molly and Luke are now in a new room (where the hole in the wall leads), Luke tells Molly not to look around as it is gory.  The film cuts to Zoe tied to a metal cot.  She can see the man in a hazmat suit cut out Toby's eye and put it in a jar.  The man then walks to Zoe.  As she pleads for her life, she asks why is he doing his.  He mumbles, "I father fear."  He exams Zoe's cut leg, leaves the room, and then returns with a hack saw.  The film cuts back to Molly and Luke as they find a key in the wall to the fuse box.  As Luke opens the box and stats turning on lights, the lights in the room with the man and Zoe start to flicker.  Annoyed by this, the man leaves Zoe to deal with Molly and Luke.  Luke is hiding behind a door when he sees the hazmat suited man walk past slowly.  Luke and Molly attack the man violently with planks only to find that the hazmat suited man tricked them and put Toby in the suit.  Toby quickly dies and the old man appears behind Molly and Luke with the sleeping gas.  As Molly tries to drag herself away, Luke is dragged off into a room.  Molly passes out.  The film cuts back to the doctor returning to Zoe, who has almost freed herself.  He slaps her across the face and begins to quickly cut her leg off. Molly awakens and is in the dank room with four chairs from the beginning.  She sees the old man looking at her through a room but does not try to escape.  She leaves the room and returns to the room where they spent the first night.  She begins removing two stair railings and starts to break the stairs from underneath.  She is then in a room eating an ice cube when the old man comes in and knocks her out.  When she awakes, she is tied to a gurney.  The man is about to cut her chest when he realizes he has no water in his bowl.  Going upstairs to get water, the stairs Molly previously began destroying are starting to give way.  The man returns without incident and attempts to cut Molly's chest.  He hears a noise upstairs and goes to check it out, leaving the scalpel on the gurney.  Molly grabs the scalpel and begins to cut herself free.  As the man comes down the stairs, he falls through the sabotaged steps, Molly grabs a wooden object and hits him in the head, knocking him out.  She grabs his keys and begins running through the house trying to get free.  Entering a room, she sees Luke with a plastic sheet covering him.  The old man awakens and begins to get free from the stairs.  Molly runs into what looks like the living quarters and finds a door out with a few locks.  Fumbling for the right key, she cannot get the locks opened quick enough before the old man is in the same area she's in.  She hides behind a door while the man looks around for her.  She sees a few newspaper articles about how a father was beaten in front of his son, and a few identification cards showing the old man was or is a surgeon.  The man enters the same room Molly is in, but she has already snuck out and returned to the door to unlock it.  The old man is standing in front of an urn (we assume it is his father's ashes) when he hears the jingle of the keys Molly is using to try to get free.  The man quickly approaches Molly and attacks her.  The movie goes silent, but the movie is showing her struggle with the man as he drags her though the house and throws her in a dark room.  The sound returns as Molly is locked in the room with the only light is a TV that is knocked down and showing only static.  She hears a sound and starts to see that there is another person in the room with her.  It is the girl from the missing persons broadcast from the beginning of the movie (while Molly was in the emergency room), but she is clearly exhibiting animal instincts.  The girl attacks Molly and the movie ends.

Natalie is hiding the fact that her brother is Julien, the leader of the House of Samurai, and lies about everything but the love connection between her and Luke.  Natalie faces a hard decision between her love and her family. She confronts Luke and asks what happened with him and Julien. He says that Julien was a member of the House of Pirates, but has a gambling problem and he once wagered against the Pirates and threw the battle, so the Pirates kicked him out. After arguing with Julien, she decides to leave Luke rather than betray him further. Julien uses her phone to invite Luke for her birthday party.

Moose helps out Luke by bringing the House of Pirates back together, and giving him additional members for his crew including Camille and The MSA Crew from ''[[Step Up 2: The Streets]]''. They discover that the former members are now performing with the House of Samurai. They also find out Julien is buying their warehouse, but says if they throw the battle, they can have it back, but they do not take the offer.  Natalie helps Luke and the Pirates win the World Jam with the routine they had practiced. She invites him to come with her to [[California]], which he does by meeting her at the train station and kissing her just as Moose kisses Camille. Before leaving, Luke gives Moose the pair of Limited Edition Gun Metal Nike Dunks.

Stake Land
 When a pandemic of [[Vampire|vampirism]] strikes, humans find themselves on the run from vicious, feral beasts. Large cities are left as tombs and survivors cling together in rural pockets, fearing nightfall. When his family is slaughtered, young Martin (Paolo) is taken under the wing of a grizzled, wayward vampire hunter, called Mister (Damici).  Mister takes Martin on a journey through the locked-down towns of America's heartland, searching for a better place in the famed 'New Eden', up north, while taking down any bloodsuckers that cross their path. Along the way, they are joined by fellow travellers, the first being a nun known only as Sister (McGillis), whom they rescue from two young rapists whom Mister kills without hesitation. They continue to move north, avoiding major thoroughfares that have been seized by The Brotherhood, a fundamentalist militia headed by such fanatics as Jebedia Loven ([[Michael Cerveris]]), who interprets the plague as God's will at work.  The group is then captured by The Brotherhood and it is revealed that one of the rapists killed by Mister was Loven's son. As punishment, Mister is left at the mercy of a group of vampires, while Sister is taken as a sex slave and Martin will be kept as a forced convert to the Brotherhood. Martin promptly escapes the Brotherhood camp and discovers that Mister has survived the vampire attack and they drive off together, unable to help Sister.   Coming across a survivors' roadhouse, they pick up another traveler, the pregnant Belle (Harris), who hopes to make it to New Eden to have her child. Later, they also pick up Willie ([[Sean Nelson]]), a former Marine, who is found hiding in a [[Port-a-potty|workmen's toilet]] having been abandoned as vampire bait by The Brotherhood. Willie informs the group that American military forces were withdrawn from the Middle East to help contain the outbreak, and that there is no Middle East to fight over anymore, as it is completely overrun by vampires. He goes on to say that The Brotherhood was partially responsible for the fall of America, ramming cars filled with vampires through blockades and crashing airplanes filled with vampires into cities. Overwhelmed as the plague spread across the U.S., the Armed Forces collapsed and no longer exist. The four decide to go after Jebedia, whom they successfully ambush, then tie to a tree and leave for the vampires.  The group next encounters a survivors' settlement and discover that Sister also escaped. The same night, celebrations are interrupted when The Brotherhood, using helicopters, drops vampires into town, killing many residents. Though invited to stay and help rebuild the settlement, the group decides to move on towards the north again.   Midway, their car breaks down and they have to continue their journey on foot. They manage to avoid dangerous areas for some time but, while sleeping at an abandoned auto junk yard, they are attacked by 'berserkers', the oldest and strongest kind of vampire. They run into a corn field, and Sister diverts the chase away from the others, then shoots herself in the head when overrun.  After several days of walking through the wilderness, they take shelter in a broken-down school bus turned camper and notice in the morning that Willie is missing. The three search for him, first finding his blanket then finding Willie killed and strung up in a tree. Mister notes he has never encountered a thinking vampire before and warns the others to stay alert.  Despite their best efforts, Belle is taken from their campsite during the night and Mister and Martin find her in an abandoned silo the following day, wrapped in barbed wire and bitten. Jebedia Loven, now a thinking vampire thanks to having given himself willingly to the vampires that attacked him, reveals himself and attacks Martin and then Mister. Martin manages to impale Jebedia, and an injured Mister is successful in finishing him off. Martin [[coup de grâce|mercy kills]] the dying Belle, saving her from becoming a vampire.  The duo then heads north again, acquiring a pickup truck, and they meet Peggy, who lives alone in an abandoned restaurant and who picks off approaching vampires using a crossbow. Martin and Peggy have an instant connection, and Martin easily attacks and kills a vamp outside the restaurant that night, with Mister covertly looking on. The next day, Mister is gone and Martin finds his mentor's skull pendant hanging from the truck's mirror. He and Peggy head off by themselves, finally arriving at the border to Canada, or the New Eden for which they were searching.

As Paula's nightmares persist, Linda provides her with comfort and support, even allowing Paula to sleep in her bed. When Paula finds Linda editing her novel one morning, she flies into a rage. Linda reacts by murdering Paula's cat. Unaware of the cat's disappearance and feeling guilt for shouting at Linda, Paula apologises to Linda and admits that she is impressed by Linda's additions to the book. Linda offers to write some more of it and give Paula the opportunity to take the day off. Linda then takes control of the book and Paula's life, screaming at her to send the staff home when the noise they make distracts her. Paula, too timid to fight back, meekly obeys Linda and becomes bedridden with Linda locking her in her room. When a successful writer named Robert Gainor ([[Billy Murray (actor)|Billy Murray]]) comes to the house to interview Paula, Linda answers the door, claiming to be Paula and invites Gainor into the kitchen where they open a bottle of wine and eat some cheese with biscuits. When Gainor asks Linda if he can record their interview, she flirts with him before slashing his throat and revealing that her brother abused her when she was thirteen and she stabbed him to death. She hides Gainor's body in the cellar and tells Paula that he simply came to interview her but Linda told him that she was busy and he left. When the housekeeper, Mrs. Brown (Linda Hayden) finds Gainor's body, Linda kills her too.  Paula awakes from a nightmare one night discovering that she has cut her wrist and the sheets are covered with blood. Soothing her and bandaging her wounds, Linda changes the bedclothes and sends Paula back to bed.  Meanwhile, Paula's psychiatrist Leo Fox (Colin Salmon) and her publicist Sara Phillips (Jennifer Matter) discuss Paula over dinner. They are beginning to worry about her seclusion, having not seen her since she went to Crow's Hall. When they get back to Leo's home, he plays a recording of a furious Linda screaming and swearing. When a disturbed Sara asks who it is, Leo says that is the voice of someone has been stalking Paula since she was a girl.  When the young gardener, Josh comes the following day asking after Mrs. Brown, Linda, concealing a kitchen knife behind her back tells him that she is down in the cellar. Paula has escaped from her room and witnesses the ensuing scene. Josh tells Linda to ask Mrs. Brown to get in touch with him before leaving the house. Linda shuts the door behind him, allowing Paula to see the knife behind her back. Linda turns and sees Paula on the stairs and the terrified Paula flees back to her room, locking Linda out.  Later on, she goes down to the cellar and finds the bodies of Gainor and Mrs. Brown. When she emerges, Linda is waiting with a knife but when Paula flees back to her room, she makes no attempt to pursue her. In a panic, Paula phones Leo, leaving a message on his phone telling him that she is locked in the house with Linda who has killed two people. After receiving the message, Leo drives over to Crow's Hall accompanied by Sara, to whom he reveals that Linda does not exist but is a split personality developed by Paula to cope with her brother's abuse as a teenager. This recurrent alternate personality has been "stalking" Paula ever since. When they arrive at Crow's Hall, Leo finds Paula sat on the floor sobbing Sara finds Paula/Linda's laptop and the manuscript of the book which she discovers is extremely good. Meanwhile, Paula slips back into Linda's personality and stabs Leo to death. Sara attempts to leave the house with the laptop but comes across Linda. Regaining control, Paula warns Sara to flee. Sara runs back to her car, only to discover that she has left her keys in the house. As Linda regains control, she pursues Sara who runs barefoot into the forest, only to be grabbed by Linda/Paula, whom she rams into a tree. Paula is impaled on a jagged piece of wood extending from the tree and dies. Sara takes the laptop and claims authorship of the manuscript. The film ends with the book having been published with Sara's voice stating "Everything's just perfect", having presumably become wealthy and famous, before the ending credits roll.

Super (2010 American film)
 Short-order cook Frank Darbo recalls his only two good memories from a disappointing life: marrying his wife, Sarah, and an incident in which he directed a police officer to catch a purse snatcher. Frank immortalizes these two events in a pair of crayon drawings that he hangs on his wall for inspiration. Sarah, a recovering addict, leaves Frank for Jacques, a charismatic strip club owner who gets her hooked on drugs. Frank sinks into depression, where he has a vision in which he is touched by the finger of God and meets the Holy Avenger, a superhero from a [[public-access television]] show (based on the actual Christian superhero series, ''[[Bibleman]]''<ref></ref>), who tells Frank that God has chosen him for a very special purpose. Frank believes that God has chosen him to become a superhero and goes to a local comic book store for inspiration. His claim that he is designing a new superhero is met with enthusiastic appreciation from the store clerk, Libby. Frank creates a superhero costume and assumes the identity of "The Crimson Bolt."  Armed with a pipe wrench, he begins to fight crime by delivering savage beatings to various rulebreakers, ranging from [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealers]] and [[Child sexual abuse|child molesters]] to a man who cuts in line at the movies.

Initially, the media view him as a violent [[psychopath]], but he begins to gain public appreciation after the criminal backgrounds of many of his victims come to light. Frank later attempts to rescue Sarah at Jacques' house, but Jacques' thugs recognize him under the costume and shoot him in the leg as he flees while climbing over a fence.  A wounded Frank goes to Libby for help. Libby cajoles Frank into letting her become the Crimson Bolt's "kid sidekick," christening herself "Boltie" and designing a costume. She proves to be even more unhinged than Frank, using her superhero guise to nearly kill a man who possibly vandalized her friend's car. Frank decides to let her go, but changes his mind when Libby rescues him from some of Jacques' thugs at a gas station. Libby soon becomes enamored with Frank, but he turns down her advances, insisting that he is still married. Arguing that it is different when they are in their superhero identities, Libby [[rape]]s Frank while the two are in costume. Frank runs to the bathroom and vomits, where he encounters a vision of Sarah in the toilet. He decides that it is time to rescue her from Jacques.  Armed with guns, pipe bombs, and bulletproof vests, Frank and Libby sneak into Jacques' ranch, killing the first few guards they encounter. However, they are both shot. Frank is struck in the chest, his bulletproof vest sparing him, but Libby is shot in the head and killed. Devastated by her death, Frank goes into a rage, slaughtering all of Jacques' thugs. Inside, Jacques shoots Frank, but Frank gains the upper hand and stabs Jacques to death as Sarah watches, horrified.  Frank takes her home, and she stays for a few months "out of a sense of obligation" for saving her life, Frank surmises. However she leaves him again. This time, however, she manages to overcome her addiction and uses her experiences to help others with similar problems. She remarries and has four children. Frank is convinced that her children will change the world for the better. Frank, now with a pet bunny, looks on his wall of happy memories.

Superman/Batman: Apocalypse
 Weeks after the [[Superman/Batman: Public Enemies|events]] that led to [[Lex Luthor]]'s arrest, the [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] of his [[President of the United States|presidency]], and [[Superman]] and [[Batman]]'s success in saving the world from a meteor, a spaceship crash-lands in [[Gotham City]] Harbor. While Batman investigates the sunken craft, a beautiful young girl emerges from the water and accidentally wrecks Batman's boat. She is naked and has no knowledge of Earth languages or customs. On the shore, she encounters three longshoremen, one of whom tries to advance on her. She attacks two of them out of self-defense, while the third one gives her his coat to cover herself. As the girl progresses into the city, she inadvertently wreaks havoc with her [[Kryptonian]]-esque powers until Superman arrives to correct the damage, while Batman pursues her and eventually exposes her to a piece of [[Kryptonite]].  With Superman's help, they discover the girl is [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Kara Zor-El]],  the niece of [[Jor-El]] and Superman's biological cousin. While Superman welcomes Kara, teaches her English, and helps her adjust to Earth's society, Batman remains suspicious. Tipped off by Batman, [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Lyla]] ambush Kara and Clark Kent, Superman's alter ego, in a park and suggest they train Kara at [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], the only place where she can she learn how to control her powers. Superman reluctantly agrees to let them train Kara, but still prefers to watch over her himself; however, Batman and Wonder Woman inform Superman to steer clear of Kara, refusing to believe his care for her.  On the desolate planet [[Apokolips]], [[Darkseid]] learns of Kara's presence on Earth and orders [[Granny Goodness]] to have her brought to Apokolips as a possible leader for the [[Female Furies]], as [[Big Barda]] is no longer his servant and the warrior Treasure being a failed candidate. Two months later, Batman and Superman are checking on Kara on Themyscira during a sparring match against [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]]. While Kara and Lyla later sneak away for a swim, a horde of [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] clones arrives from Apokolips. Superman, Wonder Woman and the Amazonian army fight them until Superman vaporizes them all with his heat vision. Batman, however, guesses the reason for the clones' attack and discovers Kara missing and Lyla dead; a last manifestation of her precognition reveals that the culprit is none other than Darkseid, who ordered a diversion to keep them busy allowing time for Granny to kidnap Kara.  To save Kara, Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman recruit Big Barda to help them find their way on Apokolips. There, Superman infiltrates Darkseid's palace while Wonder Woman and Barda go through the sewers directly into the fighting arena, where Granny Goodness and the Female Furies ambush them. After a hard fight, Granny and the Furies are subdued. Separating himself from the others, Batman finds Darkseid's supply of Hell Spores, the source of the fire pits on Apokolips. Superman encounters Darkseid, demanding that Kara is to go back with him. Darkseid says that Kara may leave, if she wants to, but sets Kara on Superman. She has been hypnotized into serving Darkseid and wears a seductive outfit and a sharp hairstyle. Kara fights a reluctant Superman while Darkseid watches, until Batman confronts Darkseid and informs him that he has activated the Hell Spores, which will destroy Apokolips. He issues Darkseid an ultimatum: free Kara and promise to leave her alone, and Batman will deactivate the Spores. Superman defeats Kara, and Barda and Wonder Woman present Darkseid with the subdued Granny, whereupon Darkseid finally releases Kara, and the heroes leave Apokolips, bringing Kara back to Themyscira.  Back on Earth, with their lives apparently normal again, Clark takes Kara to meet his [[Jonathan and Martha Kent|adoptive parents]] in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]]. However, Darkseid, who was waiting to kill Superman, ambushes them: he had promised to leave Kara alone, but not Superman or Earth. Darkseid almost kills Superman with his Omega Beams before Kara takes the blast for her cousin. Superman attempts to fight Darkseid, but is quickly overwhelmed and punched into space. Kara engages Darkseid in a lengthy battle and manages to hold her own, having received Amazonian and Apokoliptan training, but he eventually gains the upper hand and tortures her into unconsciousness. Before Darkseid can leave, Superman returns to Earth and reengages him. He pummels the villain with all his strength, but Darkseid regains his hold and tortures Superman with his Omega Beams. Kara recovers and uses Darkseid's [[Mother Box]] to activate a Boom Tube behind him, and Superman blasts Darkseid through with his heat vision. While Superman anticipates Darkseid's eventual return from Apokolips, Kara informs him that she changed the coordinates to a random spot in space, leaving Darkseid floating, helplessly frozen.  Having saved her cousin's life and found her place on Earth, Kara decides to use her powers to fight for [[altruism]] under the alias of [[Supergirl]], and she is met with applause by Wonder Woman, the Amazons, and finally Batman. Superman and Supergirl fly to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] together, happy as two cousins can be.  
Superman/Shazam!: The Return of Black Adam
 The film opens with [[Black Adam]] returning to Earth, seen as a meteor crashing into a hillside at night.   The film then cuts to young [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]] living alone in a rundown slum in Fawcett City.  It is later revealed that Billy is an orphan whose foster parents threw him out.  He goes to a diner to meet with [[Superman|Clark Kent]] who is writing an article about Billy's situation.  Black Adam arrives and attacks Billy, stating his intent to kill the boy before the Wizard can get to him.  Clark distracts Adam, allowing Billy to escape while he changes into [[Superman]].  Black Adam chases Billy through the streets but Superman intervenes and battles him.  At first the two seem evenly matched, but Superman's vulnerability to magic gives Adam the upper hand.  Billy manages to run into the subway where he escapes with the help of a homeless man he had unsuccessfully tried to save from a mugging.  Black Adam corners Billy on the tracks, but Billy is apparently run over by a train.  He awakens to find he is on an empty subway car which takes him to a gigantic cave.  There Billy meets the Wizard [[Shazam (wizard)|Shazam]] who tells him that he is the next Chosen One.  The Wizard explains that Black Adam had been his champion 5000 years ago, but Adam had used his power for personal gain and corrupted the gift.  He was then banished across the universe but has now returned seeking vengeance against the Wizard and his new champion.  The Wizard bestows his power to Billy and causes a cave in, wishing to atone for the mistake of creating Black Adam.  He tells Billy to say his name if he needs help.  Billy escapes the collapsing cave and arrives outside.  Billy confronts Adam and, saying "[[Shazam! (DC Comics)|SHAZAM!]]," finds himself instantly transformed by a bolt of lightning into a powerful adult version of himself with superhuman strength, speed, durability, and flight.  The transformation is reversed in the same manner.  Billy and Superman join forces to battle Black Adam in the skies.  Realizing that he can't defeat both of them, Black Adam destroys a dam which threatens to flood the city.  While Superman diverts the flood, Adam takes a motorist as hostage and tells Billy to surrender himself in his mortal form to secure her release.  Billy complies, but Adam throws the hostage into the sky and silences Billy before he can catch her.  The woman is rescued by Superman who attacks Adam and frees Billy.  This allows Billy to transform back into Shazam and quickly defeat Black Adam.  Shazam is about to kill him but Superman convinces him to be better than a murderer.  Adam declares that only death will stop him.  The homeless man reappears and reveals himself to be the boy's guardian angel [[Tawky Tawny]].  Tawky reverts to his true form as a tiger and threatens to get the Wizard to banish Adam even further across the universe.  Unwilling to be banished again, Adam shouts "SHAZAM" reverting to the mortal Teth-Adam.  Having been Black Adam for millennia, his mortal body cannot withstand the ravages of time and he turns to dust.  It was an apparent bluff, as Tawny confirms the Wizard is indeed dead before leaving.  Days later, Billy is reading Clark's article when he encounters some bullies.  They try to intimidate him but he simply smiles and a bolt of lightning strikes the city.

The Switch (2010 film)
 30-something Kassie Larson ([[Jennifer Aniston]]) is single, hasn't found love yet, and decides she wants to have a baby. Despite the objections of her [[neuroticism|neurotic]] long-time best friend Wally Mars ([[Jason Bateman]]), she chooses to do so alone because she can't wait any longer. She also wants a face-to-face sperm donor, disdaining using a sperm bank. Wally suggests he be the donor, but Kassie sees him as a bit too neurotic, pessimistic, and self-absorbed, and besides, as best friends, "that would be weird." Wally has always had feelings for Kassie, and they dated six years ago, but his friend Leonard ([[Jeff Goldblum]]) points out he missed his chance when she put him in the "friend zone."  Kassie selects as sperm donor a handsome and charming (and married) assistant professor, Roland ([[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]]). Kassie organizes an "[[insemination]] party", where Wally meets Roland and takes an instant dislike to him. Roland is then called upon and produces his sperm in the bathroom, leaving it in a sample cup. Wally uses the bathroom and sees the sample. Drunk and doped up after taking a pill provided him at the party by Kassie's friend, Debbie ([[Juliette Lewis]]), and not liking the idea of Kassie being inseminated with this sperm, Wally plays with the cup and accidentally spills it into the sink. Panicking, he replaces the sperm with his own. The next day at work, still [[hangover|hungover]], he remembers nothing. The insemination is successful. Wally is then upset when Kassie tells him she is returning to her family home in Minnesota, as she thinks that would be a better environment to raise a child in, instead of New York City. She leaves, and Wally maintains a non-fulfilling, dreary existence.  Seven years later, Kassie returns to [[New York City|New York]] along with precocious-but-neurotic six-year-old son Sebastian (Thomas Robinson). She wants to reconnect with Wally, and is eager to introduce her son to him. After an awkward first meeting, Wally eventually forms a bond with this loveable and seemingly mini-version of himself, and Sebastian starts to become close to Wally, but the bad news is that Roland is in the picture too: Kassie has started dating him because he is now divorced and, as she thinks he is Sebastian's father, and a nice guy, maybe it would work.  After Wally notices the similarities between himself and Sebastian, and after talking to his friend Leonard, Wally realizes what happened seven years earlier. Just before Roland proposes to Kassie, Wally reveals to Kassie that Sebastian is his son, along with his true feelings for her. She is shocked and angry and does not want to see him again. Some time passes, and one day, as he is leaving work, Wally finds Kassie waiting for him on the street outside his office building. She tells him Sebastian really misses him and needs him. Wally admits he misses and needs Sebastian too. Kassie then discloses she isn't with Roland any longer, and that she loves him, even with all of his idiosyncrasies. Wally proposes to her, Kassie accepts, and they kiss. The final scene shows a happily married Wally and Kassie throwing Sebastian's eighth birthday party.

Shortly afterwards, the Queen gives birth to Princess Rapunzel. While attempting to recover the flower, Gothel discovers that Rapunzel's hair contains the flower's healing properties, and that cutting her hair destroys its power.

On the eve of her 18th birthday, Rapunzel requests to leave the tower and discover the source of the lanterns, but Gothel refuses, claiming that the outside world is a dangerous place. Meanwhile, a thief called Flynn Rider steals Rapunzel's crown from the kingdom and inadvertently discovers the tower after ditching his allies, the Stabbington brothers. Rapunzel captures Flynn and discovers and hides the crown, but is unaware of its significance.

There, Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown and after fulfilling her dream of seeing the lanterns in person, Rapunzel and Eugene realize they have fallen in love with each other and attempt to kiss until he sees the Stabbingtons on the shore.

Takers
  Detectives Jack Welles and Eddie Hatcher, investigate a daring heist by a group of well-organized bank robbers. The crew, led by Gordon Cozier, consists of John, A.J., and brothers Jake and Jesse Attica. The crew is without a former member, Ghost, who was caught during a previous robbery five years ago. In his absence, Jake began a relationship with his former girlfriend Lilly, who has accepted his marriage proposal.  After Ghost is released from prison, he meets up with the crew to plan a heist, in which it is discovered that two trucks will travel together, but that all the money is kept in the lead truck, which holds $12 million.  The crew, dressed as construction workers, hide out underground, while Ghost poses as a police officer, so he can keep an eye out for the trucks. Meanwhile, in order to cover themselves in case Ghost is setting them up, John heads to the top of a nearby garage to take out Ghost with a sniper rifle in case things go wrong. The blast, having been perfectly timed to the time the trucks had turned the last corner, occurs too far forward, because the lead driver had stopped short to avoid a bicyclist, and the ruse is up. The lead driver radios the police, while armed guards pile out of the rear truck.  A gunfight ensues between the robbers in the crater and the guards on the street, until John, commandeers the rear truck, and rams the lead truck into the crater. John and the other robbers pack the cash into bags, and flee by heading down a variety of different tunnels, with the plan of connecting into various subway lines to make their escape.  Welles and Hatcher show up on the scene, and, after learning of the robber's escape through the sewer system, remembers a map of the city subway system from the Russian gang hideout, and deduces that they must be escaping through the stations marked on the map where the sewers intersect the subway. They rush to the nearest station, where they find Jesse, and a chase ensues, during which Jesse hides his bag of money and is cornered, and is forced to shoot Detective Hatcher in his escape. Jesse escapes, while Welles stops to aid his partner, who dies from his wound.  Jesse reconvenes with the rest of the crew at a hotel room, and admits to the shooting of Hatcher. It is now revealed that Ghost had previously cut a deal with the Russian gangsters to kill his former henchmen in exchange for half of the heist's take. Ghost gives the Russians the hotel room number, then escapes out the bathroom window, just before the Russians storm the room and attempt to kill the crew. A.J. dies in the ensuing firefight, but the rest of the crew is able to kill the Russians, and flee the building before the police arrive. Jake and Jesse return home where, to their horror, Jake finds Lilly's corpse, and Jesse finds the safe where they kept their secret stash of money opened and cleaned out. The police surround their home, and shoot the two when they make a suicide charge outside, killing them.  Gordon and John separate to make their escape, but realize that Ghost intends to take all of their money, which is being held by Scott, a well-connected [[fence (criminal)|fence]]. Ghost sneaks onto Scott's private plane and kills him, taking their laundered money in two suitcases. Gordon and Detective Welles arrive, and a three-way [[Mexican standoff]] results in which Ghost hits both Gordon and Welles. As Ghost prepares to finish Gordon off, John arrives and shoots him dead. John recognizes Welles as the same cop, who was with the little girl. John and Gordon refuse to kill Welles. John and an injured Gordon take the money and drive off, with Gordon's sister Naomi in tow. A gravely-wounded Welles manages to call 911 for help on his cell phone.  The film ends without revealing whether either Gordon or Welles survive their injuries.

Venkat tries to use this experiment in a game called [[Teen Patti]] (a [[Poker|poker game]]), which he plays on the Internet. According to this experiment if a person playing Teen Patti knows the three cards with one of the players (except him) he/she can guess the other cards with the rest of the players and therefore can guess who is going to win with the theory of probability.  Venkat succeeds on his theory and submits his report to the institute where he teaches, but they reject his report. Venkat is sure about his theory and wants to try out in reality with live players. So he talks with younger professor Shantanu ([[R. Madhavan]]) about his theory and tells him to get three students to try out this experiment. Shantanu arranges three students &mdash; Sid (Siddharth Kher), the college rockstar; Aparna or Apu ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]), the studious geek, who has a crush on Sid' and Vikram or Vikku (Dhruv Ganesh), the boy next door. They come together and start playing the game. Venkat's theory, like the last time, proves to be successful. Venkat says that after a few more games he'll be sure to crack his [[equation]] and even be able to study it better. Shantanu tells him that he should try using his theory in the real world, where there are people who actually gamble and play Teen Patti, i.e. in underground dens or 'addas'.  Although Venkat has no interest in the money that could come from practicing his equation to crack Teen Patti, he eventually succumbs to Shantanu's charismatic persuasion. Soon, with the help of his new students, they explore the addas of wild [[Bombay]]. Later another student from the institute, Abbas ([[Vaibhav Talwar]]), the rich spoiled brat joins the gang and arranges for them parties in [[casino]]s, private clubs, etc. But what starts out as an experiment between a charismatic young professor and an eccentric older one soon descends into a game neither of them can control. The money they earn gets stolen; someone is blackmailing them; they get greedy about money and, in the course of time, they change into different people and even start betraying each other.

She reciprocates his feelings, and the two start a relationship. Shiva is then challenged by Priya's rich and powerful father Kodeeswaran, who refuses to give his daughter to a poor man. Shiva swears to become a billionaire, and promptly does so, during the course of a 2:50 minute song.  Kodeeswaran accepts Shiva as a suitor, and fixes his engagement to Priya. During the ceremony, Shiva hears a passing comment that he does not know his own father. Offended, he travels to Cinemapatti, accompanied by Bharath, to learn his roots. After encountering a host of Tamil-cinema stereotypes of several decades ago, he succeeds in uniting with his family when a woman (revealed to be Shiva's father's concubine) leads him to his father, mother and sister.

The ganglord who commandeered the slain criminals, a mysterious person simply called "D", organises the kidnapping of Priya, and has Shiva beaten up. Shiva recovers, saves Priya by fighting off thugs using exaggerated stunts, and comes face to face with "D", revealed to be his grandmother. She explains that she did it to increase the fame of her grandson, and a heartbroken Shiva is forced to arrest her.  At the trial, Shiva accidentally kills an assassin who targets his grandmother, and is put on trial himself. He is saved, however, when a man who had helped him in Cinemapatti earlier testifies that Shiva was a victim of circumstance. Both Shiva and "D" are pardoned, and Shiva who has been promoted to [[Director General of Police|DGP]], unites happily with Priya, his family and friends.

All of his cousins hate him, except the one who comes to know about his honesty. The brother engages in a brawl in a hotel killing his opponent.

Kochukunju is waiting for the day they come out and he can hand them their property. But they come out and kill the lawyer, and both Nandu and Kochukunju decide to kill them. He kills them and returns to Kerala.  His brothers try to kill him by sending out a rogue, who is defeated, and the truth is brought out. They did it for property. He tells them to take whatever they want, and that he does not need a penny, except for his mother and Helen.  The day arrives when the property is divided, and a stranger buys their whole property. The person is a benaami and the real owner is a big person, who then comes out, i.e., David and his wife are shocked. He introduces himself, and everyone is shocked. He tells them he did not come for their money or wealth, although the only one with the right to it is Kochukunju. He reveals that Kochukunju is the real owner who bought all the property and is not the loser that they think he is. He had acted in front of them for this long, but became a successful businessman.  He also says that Kathreena's brothers sent out a man to kill him. She and her brothers ask for forgiveness.  He comes to their room where his photo is displayed with a lit candle. Kochukunju is happy as his father is back now and, with his mother's permission, blows out the candle that was kept burning in remembrance of David. His mother gives him a light slap for hiding the truth for so long and the family—Kochukunju, his parents and Helen—is united.

Thillalangadi
 Krishna ([[Jayam Ravi]]) is a happy-go-lucky youth who excels in every field, but always does strange and dangerous things to obtain a certain "kick" – a thrill or excitement that he craves. One such activity is secretly double-crossing his childhood friend Dass ([[Sathyan Sivakumar]]) while helping him elope. At this point, he meets Nisha ([[Tamannaah]]), who is shocked at his recklessness and writes him off as crazy. Krishna, however, sets his sights on Nisha and woos her in a very unorthodox way; he begs her ''not'' to fall in love with him. After a host of comical situations involving Krishna's caring but easy-going parents ([[Prabhu Ganesan|Prabhu]] and [[Suhasini Maniratnam|Suhasini]]), local thugs ([[John Vijay]] and [[Mayilsamy]]), and an ever-present comic relief named Jackson ([[Vadivelu]]), Nisha accepts Krishna's love. However, she sets a condition: Krishna must stay in a well-paying job (he had resigned from other jobs due to lack of "kick") and only then will she agree to marry him. Krishna accepts, but soon resigns again for the same reason and tries to hide it from Nisha. When Nisha finds out, she breaks up with him and leaves him for good.  Some months later, Nisha's parents arrange for her to meet a prospective suitor in [[Malaysia]]. Though reluctant, she meets the suitor Krishna Kumar ([[Shaam (actor)|Shaam]]), a tough, honest policeman. She narrates the story of her affair with Krishna, and Krishna Kumar reveals he is tracking a dangerous thief who has stolen large amounts of money from wealthy (mostly corrupt) politicians. At Malaysia, Nisha, her sister Ammu ([[Sanchita Shetty]]), and Jackson run into Krishna again, but learn that he has lost his memory and can't remember his past life. Nisha sees this as an opportunity to start their relationship again from scratch. However, it is revealed that Krishna isn't really suffering from amnesia; he has faked his condition by convincing an actual amnesiac Paul ([[Santhanam (actor)|Santhanam]]) that he is a doctor, and tricked him into diagnosing his condition falsely. Nisha is initially upset, but realizes that it was done due to his love for her, and she has hidden her own feelings from him. They reconcile.  Meanwhile, it is revealed that the thief whom Krishna Kumar has been tracking is none other than Krishna himself. His motives are simple; he steals ill-gotten money from politicians to pay for operations of children suffering from cancer. After manipulating various people (Vannai Vasanthi ([[Nalini (actress)|Nalini]]), Karuppu ([[Ganja Karuppu]]), etc.) and stealing from them, he is finally caught in the act by Krishna Kumar. Krishna is still unfazed however, celebrating his failure at a street party. He dares Krishna Kumar to catch him in his final crime: stealing money from MLA Rajaraam ([[Radha Ravi]]). After many harrowing stunts, Krishna pulls it off successfully. Krishna Kumar is demoted from his job for his failure, and is shocked to learn his replacement is none other than Krishna, who promises to "guard" Rajaraam's remaining money. Knowing what's in store for the politicians, Krishna Kumar leaves with a new respect for his foe.

There Are Things You Don't Know
 The film tells the story of a reclusive taxi driver in [[Tehran]] in the days leading up to an [[earthquake]]. He has chosen to distance himself from society and to be passive so as not to be hurt. Finally one of his passengers gives him enough motivation to act and bring about a change in his life.  
They Walk
 The film starts by following a young couple, John and Nicole, through a graveyard, shortly after leaving a party. While the couple hears distant sounds, small meteorites hitting the ground nearby, and are well aware of the meteor shower passing that night, they distract themselves, and John is hit in the back with a meteorite. He is killed while lying on top of Nicole, who passes out from his dead weight. She wakes to find him gone, and in searching for him, finds he has turned into some sort of creature, a zombie.  Back at the party, a large group of friends drinks and ignores the meteor shower, and where their friends may have gone. In the morning, some of the party-goers have disbursed, and John's roommate Dennis, and his girlfriend Lisa, become worried about them. They join the party-goers from the night before and discuss what to do to remain safe, having seem the aftermath of the zombie outbreak on the news and when driving through town. The group forms four separate plans and takes up arms, just before finding the reanimated John and Nicole in the front yard and dealing with them. One of the home owners, Mike, is killed in the fray just before the others leave.  Stephen, the owner of the party home, having put an end to his roommate Mike after being fatally wounded and torn apart by the reanimated couple, begins to get drunk and regale himself with stories from his past. He arms himself with a revolver and spends time thinking about his roommate, the current situation, and his life prior to the epidemic. He remembers a high school love, Suzie, and how they stopped talking just before graduation. To his surprise, Suzie finds herself knocking at his door, her family having been killed. She has been bit, and Stephen must decide how to handle her, knowing that the bites are fatal and what will become of her.  Two couples, Scott and Lauren and friends Eric and Sarah, decide to pack up supplies and head to somewhere that they might be able to fortify, a more expendable place, rather than board up Stephen's apartment in the event that the epidemic would be short-lived. They come upon a stranded man, Brian, who tells them of an abandoned house he was aware of. The group fortifies the rather run-down abandoned house, boarding windows and learning to use their weapons. Lauren has been scratched in the fray with John and Nicole, and Sarah tends to the wound. When the undead make their way into the first floor of the house, the group head upstairs and burn the staircase, leaving them safe, but without a way down. Brian later admits he did not search the upstairs fully, and this coupled with Lauren's slow but potential death add to the group's dire situation.  Dennis and Lisa decide to flee in their car rather than returning home, assuming that the epidemic was localized. They find the back roads to be the safest, but eerily empty, as if those fleeing by car had left hours before. When signal is available, the radio tells of the outbreak being a highly debated topic, some suggesting the undead to simply be sick people, mentally or physically, while others suggest it to be the end of times. After hours of driving, the couple hit a roadblock, abandoned cars and bodies lying along the road randomly, but only occasionally. They arm themselves with firearms found in the trunk of an abandoned vehicle, but the roadblock appears to be the end of the road for the couple entirely.  The front man for a local rock band leaves Stephen's apartment at leisure and takes his time getting back to his band and playing their scheduled show as if nothing were unusual. This proves to be somewhat of a mistake, and the band members pay for the mistake.  A group of punk rockers, a "band" themselves, though having no real songs or talent, had left the party early, complaining about the "losers who can't hold their booze." In the morning, the leader of group, Hogger, and his girlfriend Engine, find their roommates gone. They return with boxes of stolen goods, babbling about the crazed city and the "sickos" shambling about, one of which has taken a bite out of the roommate's arm. Dismemberment, B-movie antics, and an arm-mounted weapon made from a flower pot, shotguns, and zip ties follow.  
Third Star
 After celebrating his 29th and - as everyone including himself knows - last birthday, James, a young man terminally ill with [[cancer]], sets out on a last hiking trip with his three best friends, Davy, Bill and Miles. Their destination is James's favourite beach at [[Barafundle Bay]], on the [[Pembrokeshire]] coast.   Davy is a kind, loyal and responsible soul who has been unemployed and helping James's family take care of him for quite a while already. Bill is boisterous and fun-loving, and everybody hopes he is finally getting around to breaking up with his oppressive girlfriend. Miles, lately absent from James's life, is a handsome intellectual turned into a businessman and the son of a successful novelist who died, also of cancer, when Miles was a child. James's and Miles's friendship used to be very close and has always bordered on rivalry, particularly as aspiring writers. James is too weak to walk much any more, so he mostly sits in a special cart and needs a lot of very practical and physical help from his companions, in addition to [[Morphine|liquid morphine]] and other medications at increasing frequency to manage his chronic pain and other symptoms. Having been ill for years already, he seems to be at peace with his rapidly approaching death and takes childlike delight in everything this last journey has to offer. However, his failing strength and increasing discomfort and outright pain also bring out his bitterness in the knowledge that his life will be over before he ever had time to make anything much of it.  Traveling over the rugged and isolated coastal terrain, the young men fool around having light-hearted, juvenile fun to give James the time of his life. They also encounter various odd persons and situations and are faced with a series of setbacks and accidents, including loss of various supplies and finally the cart. Everyone's nerves and patience are sorely tested by James's outbursts at each of his friends in turn: out partly of premeditation and partly of spontaneous pain-induced anger, he seems to attempt to shake them out of mediocrity, settling for things and excessive unselfishness and into making what they actually want out of the lives they still have ahead. Davy is mortified by James's observations; Bill reveals that his girlfriend is pregnant and while he knows that they are not right for each other, he can't and won't leave her; Miles counters James's attacks with equally brutal honesty regarding James himself. Eventually James and Miles come to reveal the guilty secrets each has kept from the other. James found and read a novel manuscript Miles finished years ago without ever telling anyone, and has been jealous ever since but also impressed by Miles's talent. Miles has kept away from James lately because he has been unable and unwilling to cope with his best friend's illness, but he is in love and sleeping with James's married sister, and she and her children will soon come to live with Miles – something he did not intend James ever to know.   On the night they finally arrive at Barafundle Bay, James reveals the true purpose of the trip: he plans to drown himself in the sea before pain takes his life over completely. He asks his friends to let him do so and tell his family and the police that they woke up in the morning and found his body in the water. Horrified at the thought, they refuse; however, after temporarily losing James's morphine supply and witnessing him struggle with severe pain, they change their minds.  In the morning, James swims out with his friends keeping him company, and eventually Miles helps James drown himself near the shore and brings his body back.  
Thirst (2010 film)
 Four young friends—fashion photographers Brian and Tyson, Brian's medical student wife Noelle, and fashion model Jennifer — who is referred to by the nickname "Atheria" — travel deep into the desert for a photography session. They suffer a car accident that renders their car hopelessly stuck in a ravine, stranding them in the desert.  Brian separates from the party to search for a way out of the desert, while Noelle notices that Atheria begins to show signs that she is suffering from both a concussion and a [[subdural hematoma]] as a result of the crash. She resolves to perform an emergency procedure to relieve life-threatening [[intracranial pressure]] inside Atheria's skull, but fails to save Atheria, who dies from her injuries. In desperation, Tyson torches the car as a signal fire.  Brian returns and explains that there is no sign of civilization in any direction, and thus no one to see the signal fire. After spending roughly 24 hours camped out by the car, Brian, Noelle, and Tyson decide that there is no hope of rescue, and realize that they have to hike out of the desert. Tyson advocates walking the 80 mile road that led them to their present location, since they at least know where it leads, but Noelle argues that there might be water in the mountains, which are closer. Brian recalls reading on a map that there is a town just west of the mountains—the only form of civilization around for many, many miles, and agrees with Noelle's plan.  Heat and thirst wear away at the three friends as they trek through the desert for days on end. Initially, Tyson seems to be the most resourceful of the three; he knows enough to nourish himself by drinking blood from a rattlesnake. However, as Brian, Noelle, and Tyson grow increasingly desperate for water, Tyson foolishly tries to alleviate his thirst first by eating a cactus—which only makes him more thirsty—and then by drinking a pool of water that Noelle warns him is tainted with pathogens. Tyson dies in the middle of the night as a result.  The next night, Brian and Noelle seek shelter in a cave, where they realize that they are dying of thirst. Motivated by Noelle's revelation that she is pregnant, Brian slits his own throat so that Noelle can save her own life by drinking his blood. Noelle at first refuses, but when it becomes clear that she cannot prevent Brian from bleeding to death, she drinks.  The following day, Noelle continues to hike alone, and despairs when she happens upon the crash site, and realizes she has traveled in a big circle. In a moment of despair she remembers that Atheria mentioned breast implants. She desperately searches her friend's grave, which has been picked clean by wolves, and finds one intact. She then uses it to set up a [[saline I.V.]] Afterwards, she continues to walk until she sees a car that will presumably come to her rescue. As she collapses from exhaustion, it begins to rain.

 Concerned that he cannot remember his past, Pete Nelson prepares for the end of the world by going to Las Vegas.  In his hotel room, three distinct personalities emerge and argue with each other over the nature of reality and how to best spend the remaining time.  The first personality, a bitter man who blames his failed life on "the system", wants to explore his forgotten past.  The second personality, a drunken hedonist, wants to leave the hotel and take advantage of the prostitution and gambling in Las Vegas.  A third personality, which emerges after debates between the first two, questions the nature of reality and states that they are all fictional characters in the screenplay of a [[hack writer]].  Eventually, a ghost appears, whom Pete identifies as Jimmy, a friend who died years ago.  Jimmy points out plot holes in the film, including the fact that he can perceive each of the three personalities.  With this evidence, Pete's personalities become more convinced that they are in a film, though they also debate the idea that he whole situation is a dream, which the third personality decries as further evidence that the writer is a hack.  Nelson experiences a series of hallucinations or dreams in the form of parodic short films and trailers laced with conspiracy theories.  One lampoons the Apple "[[think different]]" ad campaign and states that anyone who actually thinks differently is assassinated.

There, the man reveals himself as a former CIA agent and the screenwriter who created Pete.  Depressed about his lack of success in finishing the screenplay, the writer explains that he has become suicidal and threatens to kill himself, which was the source of the apocalypse in Pete's world.

Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue
 Like the other fairies, [[Tinker Bell]] attends fairy camp on the mainland. When she attempts to go find some lost things, Vidia reveals information about a human house nearby, which arouses Tink's curiosity, prompting her to stray from camp, with Vidia following behind to watch over her. When she reaches the house, she is amazed by their "horseless carriage", which is actually a car. She takes the time to flitter around under the car, while Vidia tries to get her to leave. Eventually they do, but on their way back to camp, Tink and Vidia stumble upon a fairy-sized house made by Lizzy Griffiths, a human girl who wishes to meet a real fairy. Tink immediately heads in to investigate, despite Vidia's constant warnings. Tink claims it to be perfectly safe, so Vidia slams the door shut in an attempt to scare her but unintentionally locks Tink inside. When Lizzy begins to approach the house, Vidia tries to free Tink to no avail, resulting in Lizzy discovering Tink inside and taking her home. She prepares to show Tink to her father, Dr. Griffiths, a very busy and serious scientist, but upon seeing all the butterflies he has pinned in display for research, she decides to keep Tink a secret.  Meanwhile, Vidia rallies Rosetta, Iridessa, Fawn, Silvermist, Clank and Bobble to rescue Tink. Due to the storm, they are unable to fly, so Clank and Bobble builds a ship. They get of to a good start until reaching a running stream, which destroys the ship. They continue on foot but upon crossing a mudbank, Vidia gets stuck waist deep. While Clank and Bobble try to find something to pull her out, the other fairies are nearly run over by a car but are saved when Iridessa blinds the driver, who then vacates the car, giving the girls a chance to get Vidia out by grabbing onto the driver's shoelace.  Back at the human house, Lizzy reveals her fascination of fairies. Tink is flattered by her obsession and since Tink can't leave the house because it's raining outside, she decides to teach her nearly everything about fairies. They record their information in a new research book given to Lizzy by her father. During this time, they have grown a great friendship. After a while, the rain dies down, and Tink is able to return to camp. She gives Lizzy a hug and makes her way out but before she leaves, she watches Lizzy attempt to show her father the research. Unfortunately, Dr. Griffiths is too busy fixing the house's leaks to pay her any mind, so Tink returns and fixes the leaks, saving Lizzy's father from the burden. Afterwards, she makes the choice to release a captive butterfly Dr. Griffiths was planning on showing to a group of scientists. However, thinking that Lizzy was the one who set the butterfly free, he grounds her.  Meanwhile, Vidia confesses to the rescue team that it was her fault that Tink has been captured. They comfort Vidia about the situation, informing her that it could have been worse without her presence. Once the rescue team finally reaches the human house, they are attacked by Lizzy's pet cat, Mr. Twitches. Despite being an animal fairy, Fawn is unable to immediately tame a cat under pressure. A chase ensues before she is able to find catnip, eventually taming the cat.  Back at the house, Tink shows Lizzy how to fly in her room with pixie dust. Then her father walks in, forcing Tink to hide in the fairy house. He finds footprints on the ceiling and sternly demands the truth. Lizzy confesses in tears tells him about Tink and shows him the research book. Her father, however, still refuses to believe in fairies, and he and his daughter get into a disagreement. Angered by Dr. Griffiths' stubbornness, Tink reveals herself and chides him. The sight of the fairy astonishes the scientist and prompts him to capture Tink so that he could take her to London for research, but Vidia arrives just in time and pushes her out the way. Vidia is instead captured by Dr. Griffiths, but Lizzy and the fairies are able to convince him to think otherwise.  In the end, Dr. Griffiths apologizes to his daughter for not believing her. Vidia is then freed, and she and Tink form a friendship. Lizzy and her father are now closer than ever.  
Tiny Furniture
 Having been dumped by her boyfriend after graduation, Aura ([[Lena Dunham]]) moves back home to her mother's loft in [[TriBeCa]] for the summer. Aura's plan is to save money until her friend Frankie finishes her degree at [[Oberlin College]] and can move to the city so that they can be roommates. Aura's mother Siri is a successful photographer who takes pictures of scenes using tiny furniture. She is aided by Candice, her assistant, and Aura's teenage sister, Nadine. Siri is initially supportive of her daughter's return home while Nadine appears condescending toward her. Upon moving back into her old room, Nadine commands Aura to replace a lightbulb. While searching for one, Aura stumbles upon her mother's journals from when she was Aura's age, and she begins reading them clandestinely.   Shortly after arriving home, Aura goes to a party where she meets Jed, a mildly successful filmmaker who puts his work on [[YouTube]]. She also runs into her childhood friend Charlotte ([[Jemima Kirke]]), a recovering drug addict. She and Aura return to Charlotte's apartment that night, where they smoke marijuana. Charlotte also helps Aura land an $11/hour (no tips) job taking reservations at a restaurant. The news that she has landed a job is quickly overshadowed by the fact that Nadine has won a prestigious poetry prize for high school students. Aura begins to feel anxious in comparison to her put-together younger sister and resents the close bond between Nadine and their mother.   Depressed, Aura begins to spend time with Jed, who is [[couchsurfing]] as his agent tries to land him a TV development deal, and flirts with Keith ([[David Call]]), a junior chef at the restaurant. When her mother and sister leave for a week in order to tour colleges, Aura invites Jed to stay with her. Together they discover that Aura's pet hamster Gilda has died, and they store it in the freezer in a plastic bag until Aura can bury her. Jed and Aura ultimately neglect to take care of the apartment while drinking most of Siri's wine and eating frozen dinners. Siri eventually confronts Aura about these things upon her return, which Aura first lies about before throwing a tantrum in front of her mother and sister. Despite this, Aura later asks her mom to let Jed extend his visit by having him stay on an inflatable mattress in her room. She is eventually forced to kick him out after he annoys Siri with his entitled attitude.  Meanwhile, Aura's flirtation with Keith hits a snag when she discovers he has a girlfriend and only seems interested in her ability to obtain prescription pills through Charlotte. After Keith stands her up when they make plans to get high together, Aura impulsively quits her restaurant job. Later that night, Nadine has a party in their loft while their mother is out for the night. Aura becomes upset, ostensibly by the number of drunk high schoolers at the party, and calls Charlotte to help deal with the situation. Charlotte, however, only enjoys the party for herself. Nadine eventually confronts Aura over her immaturity, yelling at her to grow up. The next morning, Aura's mother finds the frozen hamster in the freezer, which Aura promptly disposes of. Aura also tells a bewildered Frankie that she no longer can move in with her, offering the excuse that her mother needs her too much.  Unsure of what to do with her filmmaking degree, Aura lucks out when Charlotte asks a curator friend to put one of Aura's college videos in his gallery. At the exhibit, Charlotte is annoyed when Frankie appears to discuss living arrangements with Aura. Charlotte encourages Aura to leave Frankie in order to spend time with Keith, who also showed up. Ditching Frankie, Aura goes with Keith and the two smoke marijuana in the street.

Titanic II (film)
 In the [[Arctic]] waters near the [[Helheim Glacier]] in [[Greenland]], a person is surfing on waves created by falling chunks of ice that fall off the glacier and into the ocean caused by the effects of [[global warming]]. However, a very large chunk of ice falls into the water, creating an especially large wave. The surfer tries to escape from the wave, but it is far too fast for him, and in a matter of seconds, it catches up to him then drowns and kills him instantly.  On 10 April 2012, 100 years after the launch of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']], a new, similar-looking luxury [[cruise ship|cruise liner]], the SS ''Titanic II'', is christened. She embarks on her maiden voyage using the same route the ''Titanic'' took 100 years before in reverse direction (from [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], US to [[Southampton]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]). During the [[Transatlantic crossing|Atlantic crossing]], back up near the Glacier, an even larger chunk of ice collapses into the water, creating a [[tsunami]] that sends an [[iceberg]] crashing into the ship, while the passengers are celebrating in the dining saloon. The entire starboard side of the ship and the starboard lifeboat ramps are crushed; immense pressure is placed on the ship's turbines. As people struggle to escape the rising waters and run for the submarine-shaped lifeboats on the port side, the turbines eventually explode, killing many people, including ship captain Will Howard; the explosion also causes an immense fire on the ''Titanic II'', which is sinking by its bow while also listing at a shallow angle to its starboard side.  Soon, another more powerful tsunami hits the ship's starboard side, flipping it upside-down and [[drowning]] most of the passengers still on board. All the [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboats]] are destroyed by various pieces of iceberg, killing everyone inside them. Having chosen to stay aboard the ship instead of going to the lifeboats, ship owner Hayden Walsh and nurses Amy Maine and Kelly Wade survive to this point. (This was against the orders of Amy's father, [[United States Coast Guard]] Captain James Maine.) Kelly is later killed when a very heavy door crushes her. With most of the ship flooded, ''Titanic II'' finally sinks.  The ship's diving facility only has one oxygen tank and scuba suit, which Hayden gives to Amy. Before sacrificing his life for her, Hayden kisses Amy and with his last words tells her to resuscitate him should he drown before they are rescued. Captain Maine arrives to rescue Amy and Hayden, but Hayden has drowned by then. Amy and an unknown number of injured passengers whom Hayden ordered his helicopter to take (earlier in the film) are the only known survivors of the disaster.  
To Die Is Hard
 ''To Die is Hard'' is a spoof comedy that follows the exploits of Dr. Joe McCann (played by Berggoetz), an English professor.

Utilizing cunning and some awkward martial arts moves, McCann takes on the terrorists one by one.  The film climaxes when McCann finds himself face-to-face with the terrorist mastermind Anton (played by actor Baird Lefter), and the two men engage in hilarious hand-to-hand combat.  The film is a spoof of the [[Die Hard (film series)|''Die Hard'' series of films]].

To Be Friends
   
Tooth Fairy (2010 film)
 Derek Thompson (Dwayne Johnson) is a minor league hockey player nicknamed the "Tooth Fairy" for hitting opposing players so hard that he knocks out their teeth. One night, Derek steals a dollar from his [[girlfriend]] Carly's (Ashley Judd) six-year-old daughter Tess (Destiny Whitlock) that had been left for her lost tooth and tells her that the tooth fairy doesn't exist. Then he receives a magical summons under his pillow. He grows wings and is transported to the realm of tooth fairies. He meets his case worker, Tracy (Stephen Merchant) and the head fairy, Lily (Julie Andrews). He has an adversarial relationship with them. Lily tells Derek that he is a "dream crusher," due to his unsympathetic dealings with children like Tess. He is sentenced to serve two weeks as a tooth fairy. Later, he meets Jerry ([[Billy Crystal]]), who gives him his tooth fairy supplies, which include "Shrinking Paste," "Invisible Spray," and "[[Amnesia]] Dust."  Carly's teenage son, Randy ([[Chase Ellison]]) dislikes Derek. Randy wants to grow up to be a [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] star. When Derek defends Randy against a bully, he begins to win him over, and Derek begins teaching him to play his electric guitar better so he can win a talent show.  Derek visits several children and tries his best to be a good tooth fairy, but ends up causing more harm than good. Lily says that he is the worst tooth fairy ever and denies him more supplies for the remainder of his sentence. He buys [[black market]] supplies from another fairy named Ziggy ([[Seth MacFarlane]]), but they malfunction and he is seen by a child's mother and arrested. While behind bars, Tracy tells Derek that his duty is extended to three weeks. Carly bails Derek out.  Despite managing to improve his tooth fairy skills, as well as bonding with Tracy and continuing to bond with Randy, this progress is halted when Derek becomes frustrated after he can't score a goal at a hockey game. He takes his anger out on Randy, telling him that he will never become a rock star. His dreams crushed, Randy smashes his guitar and Carly breaks up with Derek. Later, Tracy comes to Derek's house and announces that he is a tooth fairy in training, but that Derek's cruel remarks hurt himself more than others. The next game, Derek gets back on the ice and sees Tracy. Tracy wants to teach Derek the importance of dreams, encouraging Derek to score a goal and to go get Tess' tooth. With a renewed spirit, Derek scores the goal, gets into his tooth fairy costume, and flies away while Tracy spreads Amnesia Dust on the audience to cover up the event.  At Carly's, Tess sees Derek taking her tooth, but she promises to keep it a secret, and Derek apologizes to Randy and encourages him to keep pursuing his dreams, using his magic wand to grant Randy a new guitar. Downstairs, Carly sees him as a tooth fairy, but assumes that he rented a costume for Tess' sake, causing her to forgive him. Derek flies Randy to the talent show and throws Amnesia Dust on him when they arrive.  Derek heads back to the fairy realm to give Lily the tooth, and is told that because of this job, as well as reaffirming Tess' belief, he has been relieved of his fairy duties. Lily explains that he will never see the tooth fairies again and he will have Amnesia Dust thrown on him. Before departing, Derek says a friendly goodbye to Tracy. Lily throws Amnesia Dust on Derek and transports him back to the talent show. There, Randy outperforms everyone and ends up forming a band. Derek proposes to Carly, and she accepts.  During the credits, Derek is shown playing left wing for the [[Los Angeles Kings]], and when he sees Jerry in the crowd, he doesn't recognize him. His fairy friends secretly help him score a goal.

After driving Ellie's parents' [[Land Rover Defender|Land Rover]] into the mountains, they hike down into a remote valley known as "Hell".  During their second night camping, Ellie wakes to a sky full of military aircraft. Upon arriving back in town, the group finds their homes abandoned, without power, internet and telephone lines down. From the hill overlooking Robyn's house, the group sees that the only lights on in town are at the hospital and showground. Upon reaching the showground, they find that the citizens of the town are being detained by a foreign military group. Ellie witnesses a man being executed with a shot to the head, and in her horror retreats too quickly, being spotted by a searchlight. They flee but are pursued by soldiers into the backyard of a house. Ellie, using Kevin's singlet, lighter and the fuel tank of a [[Lawn mower|ride-on lawn mower]], creates an explosion that eliminates the squad.  On return to Corrie's house, they find that Lee and Robyn are missing.  Ellie and Corrie witness an [[Royal Australian Air Force|RAAF]] jet fighter being shot down by enemy aircraft. Whilst the group gathers inside to plan for their return to Hell, an enemy helicopter performs a close examination of the house. Homer shoots out searchlight of the helicopter, which retreats after dropping flares. The group barely escape with their lives as a jet destroys the home.  That night, Ellie and Homer sneak back into town and find Robyn in her house. Lee has been wounded, and is being treated by Dr Clements ([[Colin Friels]]), the local dentist, who informs them that the invading forces are bringing in their vehicles and equipment from ships moored in Cobbler's Bay over the Wirrawee Bridge. After a brief skirmish with a pair of armed [[dune buggy|buggies]], Robyn, Homer, Lee and Ellie meet back up at Corrie's home. They decide to return to Hell.  On the way, they stop at a house and are greeted by school mate Chris, who is incredibly stoned and has no idea that a war is going on. Chris joins the group. They return to Hell, with plans to use it as a secluded hideout where the enemy forces will not find them. While there, they hear a radio transmission revealing that Australia has been invaded by "The Coalition Nations" from nearby Asia, who believe that they have a right to the country's vast natural resources and wealth in order to sustain their growing populations. The transmission also reveals one of the three main ports being used to deposit soldiers into the country is nearby Cobbler's Bay, the only exit from which is the Heron Bridge, which the group then makes plans to destroy.  The group sneaks back to [[Tomorrow series#Wirrawee|Wirrawee]], and devise a plan to blow up Heron Bridge. Ellie and Fi steal a petrol tanker from the council depot. They park it near the bridge and wait for the rest of the team to take their positions. After being discovered by guards, they rush to drive the tanker forward under the bridge. The plan necessarily brought forward, Homer and Lee scare a herd of cattle onto the bridge, forcing the sentries to flee their posts, allowing Ellie to park the tanker under the bridge unhindered. Working together, they manage to explode the tanker, which utterly destroys the bridge. Corrie however is shot as the group escapes.  Despite certain capture, Kevin decides to drive Corrie, who is seriously wounded, to the hospital and remain by her side. The group return to Hell. Ellie then finishes her video log, revealing their ongoing guerrilla war, the necessity to fight, and that they have yet to be found.

Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes
 In Victorian London, an unseen criminal begins masterminding his "perfect plot on paper" which starts with a robbery taking place and three cats stealing a pink diamond. Three constables spot them and give chase, but the cats escape to the rooftops and glide off into the night, giving the stolen diamond to a mysterious horseman. The next day [[Dr. Watson]] rushes to 221B in Baker Street and informs his colleague [[Sherlock Holmes]] of the robbery. Holmes calls [[Jerry Mouse]] to bring him a copy of the Times. Jerry heads out to buy it, bumping into [[Tom Cat]] on the way, who has something for Holmes. Jerry sends a pile of bricks on Tom and Tom gives chase. Jerry returns to Holmes' flat and hands him the paper or what was left of it after the chase. Reading a letter Tom had given to them, for the night, Holmes and Watson decide to go to the Bruce Nigel Theatre and see a lady named [[Red (Tex Avery)|Red]]. Holmes is told that she is being blackmailed and Holmes suggests who the perpetrator might be – [[Professor Moriarty]]. Holmes deduces that the Star of Punjab, a diamond that is light sensitive to the light of a solar eclipse which was to happen the following day, is to be stolen by the mastermind of the blackmail.  At the Punjab Embassy, [[Spike and Tyke]] are assigned to guard the Star of Punjab. Spike begins to teach Tyke how to be a good dog guard, but the three cats from the previous night steal the diamond while an unfocused Spike is not looking. The three cats then leave a small button and retreat. They climb out through a hole in Red's home that leads to the tunnel and escape before Holmes, Tom and Jerry arrive. Upon arriving, Jerry tricks Tom into stepping into a broken board and the trio check the tunnel. Finding sawdust, they retreat once hearing Tyke sounding the alarm. Holmes and Watson leave to find the shop from where the button came from, while Tom and Jerry are left to take Red to Holmes' flat.  The police believe Red is behind the crimes and offer a reward for the one who finds her. Butch and [[Droopy]] move in to take the case and race to see who gets it. Butch then bumps into Tom, Jerry and Red. They begin a tiring chase and Tom drops a lantern on Butch's head. They run to [[St. Paul's Cathedral]] and are let in by Jerry's brother [[Nibbles (Tom and Jerry)|Tuffy]]. Tuffy and Red escape but Tom and Jerry hide in the organ. Droopy and Butch then play a song on it and send Tom and Jerry flying out of the cathedral.  Tom catches his back in a pitchfork and Jerry informs Tuffy and Red that the cats are inside the pub, [[The Man With The Twisted Lip|The Twisted Lip]]. Red distracts the cats while guiding Tom, Jerry and Tuffy to the cats, the former getting punched in the face on the way by a customer (for bringing his drink to a different customer). Although the cats escape in time and kidnap Jerry, Tom follows them and rescues Jerry, except for the diamond. They are sent flying again, and Jerry lands to safety, but Tom lands on another pitchfork. The trio follow the cats to a graveyard and find the diamond. However, the mysterious horseman from previously gets there before them but Jerry secretly steals a key. Red decides to go to her friend's place, who is a professor.  Red is brought in by the professor but accidentally bashes Tom in the face with the door, leaving him, Jerry and Tuffy locked outside. They then see Butch and Droopy coming their way and hide in a stable. Tom catches his bottom on a pitchfork again and Jerry is forced to cover his screams. They find the horse belonging to the mysterious horseman and discover that the thief is in the house, also that Red may be in danger! They use the key they got to sneak inside and they find a machine containing the stolen diamonds. Tuffy catches the Star of Punjab but slips on the chimney. Tom and Jerry stumble after him but find that Red is tied up. The professor captures the trio and reveals himself as Moriarty and reveals his plans to steal the [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]]. By using the eclipse's light, Moriarty will utilise the diamonds as a heat-ray that would fire and ricochet off several mirrors, planted on many of London's landmarks, and slice a hole into the [[Tower of London]].  Moriarty then makes his way to the Tower of London with a captive Red. Spike and Tyke are left to guard the Crown Jewels after the incident at the Embassy, but the sliced wall from Moriarty's heat-ray crushes Spike and Moriarty's cats steal the Jewels. However, Tom knocks out one cat and tricks him into firing the ray on the cage setting them free. They use the cat's winged backpack to fly to the Tower but Moriarty escapes with the Jewels. Tom then crashes into the carriage and they free Red. Jerry frees the horse and spots Holmes and Watson making their way to Moriarty (who earlier had been deduced by Holmes to steal the Jewels). Butch fails to catch the cats and Droopy sends them into the Tower, where they are beaten up by Spike.  Moriarty activates his horseless carriage and he and Holmes fight atop the carriage. Tom accidentally breaks the brake and the carriage steers off an unfinished [[Tower Bridge]]. Red, Tom, Jerry and Tuffy make it back to the bridge but believe Holmes to be dead. However, Watson arrives and finds Holmes clinging to an edge with the Jewels. Moriarty and the three cats are arrested but Droopy gets the reward instead of Butch, having chained him to a fence when he wasn't looking.  At St Paul's, Red marries a wolf and they start howling and run off. While Holmes and Watson watch them run off, Jerry then secretly sets Tom's tail on fire and Tom gives chase to Jerry. It is then revealed that Droopy had done the wedding, and Droopy smiles at the screen.

The Town (2010 film)
 Four lifelong friends from the [[Boston]] neighborhood of [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]], Doug MacRay, James 'Jem' Coughlin, Albert 'Gloansy' MacGloan, and Desmond 'Dez' Elden, rob a bank. They take the manager, Claire Keesey, hostage, but release her unharmed. When they find out Claire lives in their neighborhood, Doug begins to follow her to find out how much she has told the police, and to make sure that Jem does not eliminate her as a witness. Soon a romance grows between them, which Doug hides from the gang. As they grow closer, Doug tells Claire of his search for his long-lost mother, who he believes went to live with his aunt in [[Tangerine, Florida]]. He also recounts his chance to be a professional hockey player which he threw away for a life of crime, following in his father's footsteps. She in turn tells Doug that she saw a tattoo on one of the robbers, and he realizes that she can identify Jem and send them all to jail. He knows that Jem will kill her if he discovers the truth, so he persuades her that the authorities cannot protect her, and she decides not to tell the police.  After Claire tells Doug about being harassed and her car vandalized by Alex, a local thug, Doug enlists Jem for a favor, which they can never talk about. Doug and Jem don hockey masks and violently assault the offenders without Jem knowing the true reason for the favor is to protect Claire.  [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Agent Adam Frawley surveils the gang and recognizes their ties to local crime lord Fergus 'Fergie' Colm, who has another robbery planned for them. During a visit to his father Stephen in prison, Doug reveals his plans to leave Boston and go to Florida. The gang's next robbery in the [[North End, Boston|North End]] goes awry, and the gang barely escapes. The gang is interrogated by Frawley, but he fails to get any confessions and is forced to release them. Doug asks Claire if she will go away with him, and she agrees. When Frawley learns that Claire quit her job, he wiretaps her phone, and threatens to prosecute her as an accomplice after realizing that she is seeing Doug. Shocked to discover that her lover was one of her assailants, she is forced to cooperate with the FBI and breaks up with Doug. Meanwhile, Fergie and Jem are pressuring Doug about the next heist, but Doug is determined to get out. Fergie threatens to kill Claire if Doug does not go through with the job, and reveals to Doug how he controlled his father by making his mother an addict, which led to her suicide. Doug gives in but swears that he will kill Fergie if anything happens to Claire.  At [[Fenway Park]], Doug and Jem enter disguised as [[Boston Police Department|Boston police]] officers, steal $3,500,000 in gate cash, and prepare to escape in an ambulance, disguised as paramedics. Krista, Doug's ex-girlfriend and Jem's sister, threatened by Frawley and heartbroken by Doug's going away without her, reveals enough for the FBI to surround Fenway before the gang can get out. The gang is caught in a firefight with [[FBI Special Weapons and Tactics Teams|FBI SWAT]] officers, and Dez and Gloansy are killed. Frawley spots Jem and they exchange gunfire. Jem, determined not to go back to prison and out of ammunition, commits [[suicide by cop]] by running out of cover with his guns unloaded and is killed. Knowing that Claire is in danger and that he will never escape as long as Fergie is alive, Doug murders Fergie and his bodyguard and calls Claire. Watching from across the street via binoculars, Doug sees that the FBI are with her as she tells him to come over. He at first thinks she means to betray him, but eventually she gives him a clue to warn him away, which he picks up on. Doug flees instead, donning an [[MBTA]] uniform and escaping on a train. He leaves a note on Frawley's car, reading "GO FUCK YOURSELF". Later, while gardening, Claire finds a buried bag containing the stolen money, a tangerine, and a note from Doug, suggesting that she can make better use of the money than he can, and that they might see each other again. Claire donates the money, in memory of Doug's mother, to refurbish the local ice hockey arena where Doug once played. From the deck of a small house, Doug looks out over the water, forlorn and alone, but seemingly safe in Florida.  
The Tourist (2010 film)
   A British woman, Elise Clifton-Ward, is being followed by French police who are working with [[Scotland Yard]] under the direction of Inspector John Acheson. Acheson has spent years hunting Alexander Pearce, a lover of Elise, who owes £744 million in back taxes, and is believed to have received plastic surgery to alter his appearance. At a Parisian cafe, Elise receives written instructions from Pearce: Board the train to [[Venice]], [[Italy]]; pick out a man; let the police believe that he is Pearce. Elise burns the note, evades the police and boards the train.  On the train, Elise selects Frank Tupelo, who is apparently an American mathematics teacher from a community college in [[Wisconsin]]. She spends much time with him, seeming to start a romance. Meanwhile, the police have managed to salvage the ashes of her burned note and assembled them to extract information regarding her rendezvous, as well as her ruse. Aware of her location, but not of the ruse, an informer from the police station communicates to Reginald Shaw, the mobster from whom Pearce stole $2.3 billion, that Pearce is traveling with Elise on the train to Venice. Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice.  Elise invites Frank to stay with her at her suite in the [[Hotel Danieli]] in Venice. Pearce leaves further instructions for Elise to attend a ball. Elise abandons Frank, who is then chased by Shaw's men. While trying to escape from them, Frank is detained by the Italian police, ostensibly for his own safety, only to have a corrupt inspector turn him over to Shaw's men in exchange for the bounty that has been placed on Pearce's head. Elise rescues Frank just before he is handed over, leading Shaw's men on an extended boat chase and finally escaping. She leaves Frank at the airport with his passport and money, urging him to go home for his own safety.  Elise is revealed to be an undercover Scotland Yard agent who was under suspension for her suspected sympathies with Pearce. She agrees to participate in a sting operation. At the ball, as Elise tries to spot Pearce in the crowd, an envelope is placed on the table in front of her, but the man disappears into the crowd. She tries to follow him through the crowd, but is stopped by Frank. Frank claims to be in love with Elise and invites her to dance with him. After the police surprise Frank, Elise reads the note. She leaves suddenly in her boat to be tailed by Shaw. Both parties are followed by the police. Frank is held handcuffed.  When Elise arrives at the destination, Shaw takes her prisoner, threatening to harm her unless she reveals the location of the stolen money. The police monitor the situation inside the rendezvous room through audio and video links. Despite Elise's peril, Acheson repeatedly turns down police requests to intervene with their snipers. While the police are occupied in monitoring the situation, Frank escapes from the police boat and confronts Shaw, claiming to be Pearce and offering to open the safe if Elise is allowed to leave safely. Shaw is skeptical and makes a counter offer that Frank should open the safe if he does not want to see Elise tortured by his men. Chief Inspector Jones arrives at the police stake-out, overrides Acheson, and orders the snipers to fire, killing Shaw and his men. To Elise's obvious pleasure, Jones lifts her suspension and terminates her employment.  Acheson, receiving a message that Pearce has been found near their position, rushes to find the police have detained an Englishman. The man, Lawrence Mason, says he is a tourist following written instructions received via his mobile phone, for which he has been receiving payments. Elise tells Frank that she loves him, but she also loves Pearce. Frank then suggests a "solution" to this dilemma; to Elise's surprise, he opens the safe by entering the correct code, thus revealing that he is really Alexander Pearce. When the police open the safe they find only one cheque: It is for £744 million. Acheson prepares to chase after Pearce, but Jones overrides him, reasoning that with the taxes now paid in full, Pearce's only crime is that he stole money from a now-dead gangster. Jones orders the case to be closed, much to Acheson's frustration. Frank (Alexander) and Elise sail away.  
The Tortured
 The film tells the story of a couple, Elise Landry ([[Erika Christensen]]) and her husband, Craig Landry ([[Jesse Metcalfe]]), whose lives are shattered when a serial killer named Kozlowski ([[Bill Moseley]]), kidnaps, tortures, and kills their only son, Benjamin.  Craig feels immense guilt, as he saw Benjamin being kidnapped, but could not catch up to the fleeing vehicle. Elise blames Craig for not watching the child more closely. During the trial, Kozlowski makes a plea bargain, and in exchange for providing details on other murders, is sentenced to only 25 years to life. Elise and Craig are livid with the court's verdict. Elise asks Craig to get her a gun so that she can kill Kozlowski, but Craig refuses. Elise moves out of the house and Craig, left alone, contemplates suicide. Later, he meets Elise to say that just killing Kozlowski will not be enough, and the two formulate a plan to kidnap the killer.   Craig steals medical supplies and drugs from the hospital where he works. They follow Kozlowski when he is being transferred to prison via police van. The officers soon stop to get some coffee. Craig distracts them, while Elise spikes their drinks. After some time, the police van pulls over, and Craig is successful in hijacking the van with the prisoner inside. In the confusion and panic of the escape, Craig crashes the van and it rolls over a bridge. Elise, following behind in her car, is relieved to see Craig is all right, and the prisoner, though thrown from the van and severely injured, is also still alive. Elise soon receives a call from the case detective ([[Fulvio Cecere]]) informing her that Kozlowski had taken the police van and escaped. She is able to sound normal to avoid arousing any suspicion.   They take their captive to the basement of an abandoned cabin and chain him up, just as he did to their son. They gag him, stating that nothing he could say will make them change their minds. They berate him as less than human for his abominable actions. They begin to torture him in various painful ways. During one session, Craig hangs the key to the chains above the captive, taunting him. As the torture progresses over several days, both Elise and Craig are haunted by their deeds, but carry on, remembering the horrific loss of their son.   Meanwhile, the police manhunt for the escaped Kozlowski begins narrowing down to the area near the cabin.   Back in the basement, Craig removes the gag in an attempt to suffocate the captive, who begs for a chance to talk. He explains he has no recollection of anything before the van accident. He claims he does not think he could be a vicious killer. The Landrys are taken aback, and retreat upstairs to discuss. Craig feels the torture is unnecessary on someone who cannot even remember his crimes. Elise is certain he is merely lying to avoid any more suffering. They return to the basement and begin crushing his foot in a vise until he tells the truth. Elise demands that he speak their child's name. Under duress, he eventually says 'Benjamin', which convinces Craig that they can continue with their plan. They leave him alone for the evening, promising that the next day's torture will be the worst yet. Through extreme agony, he manages to reach the key and free himself. He makes his way upstairs and there is a struggle. Craig is knocked down the stairs and the captive escapes out the back door. The police finally track down and apprehend the captive in the woods nearby.  Flashbacks show that unknown to the Landrys, the prison van was actually carrying ''two'' convicts; Kozlowski, and another man serving time for tax evasion. Following the crash, Craig mistook the bloodied man thrown from the vehicle as Kozlowski and took him as a hostage instead. The real Kozlowski later emerged from the van relatively unhurt and went on the run. Coming by the cabin, Kozlowski witnessed Elise's and Craig's torture of the other man.  At the cabin, Elise and Craig enter the barn, finding the real Tax evader (who they believe is Kozlowski) just as he hangs himself in the barn, with a note in hand. Based on what the couple did to him, having amnesia, he believes he must be a monster, and that he deserved everything they had done to him. In the letter, he apologizes and begs forgiveness. He simply could not stand any more torture, so he hanged himself.   Satisfied, the Landrys get in their car and leave, unknowingly passing the police - who are returning Kozlowski to prison.

Toy Story 3
  Now 17, Andy is headed to college, and his toys have not been played with for years. He has sold most of them except [[Sheriff Woody|Woody]],  [[Buzz Lightyear]], [[Jessie (Toy Story)|Jessie]], [[List of Toy Story characters#Bullseye|Bullseye]], [[List of Toy Story characters#Rex the Tyrannosaurus Rex|Rex]], [[List of Toy Story characters#Slinky Dog|Slinky]], [[List of Toy Story characters#Hamm the Piggy Bank|Hamm]], [[Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mr.]] and [[Mrs. Potato Head (Toy Story)|Mrs. Potato Head]], the [[Squeeze Toy Aliens|Aliens]], and the [[List of Toy Story characters#Sarge and the Bucket O' Soldiers|Green Army Men]]. He intends to take Woody with him and puts the other toys in a trash bag to be stored in the attic, except for the Army Men, who leave. Andy's mother mistakenly throws the bag out. The toys escape and climb into her car, into the donation box with Molly's discarded [[List of Toy Story characters#Barbie|Barbie]], bound for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody follows but is unable to convince them Andy meant to keep them before Mrs. Davis donates them.  Andy's toys are welcomed by [[Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear]] ("Lotso") and the other toys at Sunnyside. Except Woody, Andy's toys are delighted to learn that Sunnyside never runs out of children to play with, and [[Barbie]] is enamored of the handsome [[List of Toy Story characters#Ken|Ken]]. Woody attempts to return home, but is found by Sunnyside student Bonnie, who brings Woody home and plays with him with her other toys, which are well-treated. Woody meets a depressed clown, [[List of Toy Story characters#Chuckles|Chuckles]], who explains that he, Lotso, and [[List of Toy Story characters#Big Baby|Big Baby]] once had a beloved owner named Daisy, but were lost during a family trip. They made it home, where Lotso found he'd been replaced. Lotso's personality changed; he lied to Big Baby, saying Daisy had replaced all of them. When they found Sunnyside, Lotso took it over, and Chuckles only escaped because Bonnie took him home for repair.  At Sunnyside, Andy's toys are horrified at the toddlers' rough play. Buzz asks Lotso to move the toys to the older children's room, but Lotso turns on Buzz and restores him to original factory setting, erasing his memory. Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she lost in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for them. They realize Woody was telling the truth and try to leave. Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's henchmen who rely on "new recruits" to save themselves from the preschoolers' abuse.  Woody returns to Sunnyside and learns from a [[Chatter Telephone]] that the only way out is through the trash. Andy's toys accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish-language mode instead of his old persona. Spanish Buzz promptly allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso's gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals Lotso's deception to Big Baby, who throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso's henchmen retreat and Lotso drags Woody into the dumpster as the truck collects the trash. The rest of Andy's toys fall into the truck while trying to rescue him, except Barbie, Ken and Big Baby who fails to make it on time. A falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and personality. The truck brings the toys to a landfill, where the Aliens are swept away by spotting "The Claw" and the other toys are deposited on a conveyor belt that leads to an [[Incineration|incinerator]]. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate and prepare to die, but are rescued by the [[Squeeze Toy Aliens|Aliens]] operating the industrial claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who ties him to his truck's radiator [[Grille (motor vehicle)|grille]] and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.  In Andy's room, Woody climbs into the box of college supplies, while the other toys prepare for the attic. Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, takes the toys to Bonnie's house. To Andy's surprise, Woody is at the bottom of the box and Bonnie recognizes him. Though hesitant at first, Andy passes Woody on to Bonnie, and they play together before he leaves. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie.  In the credits scene, Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have made vast improvements to Sunnyside and maintain contact with the other toys through letters. After parachuting in, the Army Men are welcomed to Sunnyside.  
The Tree (2010 film)
 Dawn and Peter O'Neil live together with their children (three boys and a girl), on the outskirts of a small country town. Next to their rambling house stands the kids' favourite playground: a giant [[Moreton Bay Fig]] tree (now known in real-life as the [[Teviotville Tree]]), whose branches reach high towards the sky and roots stretch far into the ground.  Everything seems perfect until Peter suffers a heart attack, crashing his car into the tree's trunk. Dawn is devastated, left alone with her grief and four children to raise. Until one day, 8-year-old Simone, reveals a secret to her mother. She's convinced her father whispers to her through the leaves of the tree and he's come back to protect them. Dawn takes comfort from Simone's imagination, and starts to believe in it herself; just like Simone, Dawn also likes to spend time in the tree. It starts to dominate their physical and emotional landscape. But the close bond between mother and Simone forged through a mutual sorrow and shared secret, is threatened by the arrival of George, the plumber, called in to remove the tree's troublesome roots.  As the relationship between Dawn and George blossoms, the tree continues to grow, with its branches infiltrating the house, its roots destroy the foundations. Dawn decides the tree has to go. George and some other workmen arrive, but Simone climbs in the tree to defend it. Dawn and George try to convince her, but she refuses to come down. George argues to Dawn that the girl is only 8 years old, Dawn should not allow her to stop the necessary removal of the tree. This irritates Dawn, and she cancels the operation, and tells George she does not want to see him again.  In a big storm the house is demolished by the tree, and the family leaves the area, planning to start living somewhere else, perhaps in a tent.  
Tracker (film)
 Arjan van Diemen is a renowned [[Boer commando|Afrikaner commando]] leader of the [[Second Boer War]], and a master tracker. After the end of the war, after the defeat by the British, he emigrates from South Africa to [[Auckland]] in the British colony of New Zealand, but is recognised by Sergeant-Major Saunders, a British soldier who also fought in the Second Boer War, and is arrested upon entry. However Major Carlysle, also a British Boer War veteran, and now the officer in charge of the British garrison in Auckland, respects van Diemen as a former opponent and releases him.  Meanwhile, Kereama, a [[Māori people|Maori]] [[harpooner]] on a [[whaling ship]], sleeps with a prostitute in an army stable. A drunk Sergeant-Major Saunders arrives with two of his comrades expresses his anger at the Maori coupling with "pure British women". He and his comrades then beat and taunt Kereama, who fights back; in the confusion Saunders accidentally kills one of his own men. Saunders evades responsibility by blaming Kereama. Kereama knows that he will not have a fair trial and runs. After Saunders convinces a sceptical Major Carlysle of Kereama's guilt, Carlysle with Bryce, a civilian tracker, and a posse of soldiers pursues Kereama. Carlysle knows that van Diemen is a master tracker and offers him a substantial reward to help them. Eventually van Diemen surprises and captures Kereama.  Kereama persistently protests his innocence of the murder of the soldier as van Diemen takes him back, and says he will not have a fair trial.  However, notwithstanding their common traumas at the hands of the British, van Diemen refuses to release Kereama and they make their way back across the New Zealand landscape heading for the British garrison and the prisoner’s certain execution.   The filmmakers describe the story's background as follows:  <blockquote> The Second Boer War, a conflict between the [[British Empire]] and the two independent Boer republics in [[South Africa]], lasted from 11 October 1899 until 31 May 1902.  With the British in nominal control of the republics by 1901, the Boer farmers adopted [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics: strike fast and hard causing as much damage to the enemy as possible, and then withdraw and vanish before enemy reinforcements could arrive. This strategy proved effective and the British were forced to revise their own tactics.  The British retaliated with a “[[Scorched Earth]]” policy, bringing the Boers to their knees. As British troops swept the countryside, they systematically destroyed crops, burned homesteads and farms, poisoned wells and interned Boer women and children in [[Internment|concentration camps]].  In the aftermath, many of the defeated Boers were unable to return to their farms at all; others attempted to do so but were forced to abandon farms as unworkable given the damage caused by farm burning and salting of the fields in the course of the scorched earth policy. Thus, many drifted to the far corners of the empire, in search of a new home... </blockquote>  
The Traveler (2010 film)
 A stranger walks into a small town's police station during a rainstorm on [[Christmas Eve]]. He tells the desk sergeant that he wishes to confess to murder, after which the desk sergeant points a handgun at him and calls for his colleagues to restrain him with handcuffs.  The stranger refuses to reveal his name, preferring to be known as "Mr. Nobody." After the stranger provokes them, the officers are about to assault him as detective Alexander Black walks in. The stranger states that he will confess to six murders, and when he describes each murder, the officers graphically die in the same way he explains though the stranger himself remains incarcerated. While the officers panic, the stranger notices a dedication text on detective Black's golden-metal pen and remarks upon it, drawing the suspicion of Detective Black, who received the pen from his murdered daughter, Mary Black.  The officers think that the stranger could be a suspect whom they arrested a year ago when they were investigating the disappearance of Mary Black. Unable to prove his guilt, they tortured and beat him to get a confession, though he continually maintained his innocence.  However, they realize that the victim of their violence should still be in a coma that resulted from their brutal torture, stationed at a medical facility. The officers telephone the facility and discover that the victim had died earlier that evening, at the same time as the stranger entered the police station, which proves that the stranger is  not who they thought he is.  Despite this new evidence, the officers believe that the stranger is a [[vengeful spirit]] of the previously tortured man. Detective Black talks about superstition and his experiences in [[Gulf War]], while the remaining officers continue to die in ways that mirror the acts they committed against the now-dead suspect a year earlier, until only detective Black remains.  Detective Black apologizes to the stranger for killing an innocent suspect, but the stranger says that he was the one who murdered his daughter. Detective Black then stabs his daughter's golden-metal pen inside his own ears to avoid hearing the stranger's confession. Black's dead daughter then appears. She tells him she knows the name of the stranger and whispers into his deaf ear. Black shoots the stranger with a shotgun and causes him to fall through a window.  After the stranger's death, Christmas Day arrives and Detective Blake sees his daughter leave up the stairs, presumably leaving to the afterlife.

Antonio de la Maza was killed in turn by a death squad led by [[Ramfis Trujillo]].  
Tron: Legacy
  In 1989, seven years after the events of [[Tron|the first film]], Kevin Flynn, who has been recently promoted [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of ENCOM International, disappears. Twenty years later, his son Sam, now ENCOM's [[controlling interest|primary shareholder]], takes little interest in the company beyond playing an annual prank on its [[board of directors]].  After being freed from police custody for his most recent prank, Sam is asked by Alan Bradley, an ENCOM executive and Flynn's old friend, to investigate a strange [[pager]] message originating from Flynn's shuttered [[Amusement arcade|video arcade]]. Sam discovers a large computer in a hidden basement, which suddenly teleports him to the Grid, a [[virtual reality]] created by Flynn that exists within ENCOM’s [[Mainframe computer|computer mainframe]].<ref></ref> He is quickly captured and sent to "the Games", where he is forced to fight a masked program named Rinzler. When Sam is injured and begins bleeding, Rinzler realizes that Sam is a human "User" and takes him before Clu, the Grid's corrupt ruling program who resembles a younger Kevin Flynn. Clu nearly kills Sam in a [[Tron (franchise)#Light cycles|Light Cycle]] match, but Sam is rescued by Quorra, an "apprentice" of Flynn, who conveys him to his father's hideout outside Clu's territory.  Flynn reveals to Sam that he had been working to create a "perfect" computer system and had appointed Clu and Tron (a security program created by Bradley) its co-creators. During this construction, the trio discovered a species of naturally occurring "[[Isomorphism|isomorphic]] [[algorithm]]s" (ISOs) not conceived by Flynn, bearing the potential to resolve various mysteries in science, religion and medicine. Clu, considering them an aberration, betrayed Flynn, seemingly killed Tron, and destroyed the ISOs. Meanwhile, the "Portal" permitting travel between the two worlds had closed, leaving Flynn trapped in the system. Having gained complete control, Clu sent the message to Alan in order to lure Sam onto the Grid and reopen the Portal for a limited time. As Flynn's "identity disc" is the master key to the Grid and the only way to traverse the Portal, Clu expects Sam to bring Flynn to the Portal so he can take Flynn's disc, go through the Portal himself, and impose his idea of perfection on the human world.  Against his father's wishes, Sam returns to Clu's territory on Quorra's tip-off to find Zuse, a program who can provide safe passage to the Portal. At the [[newline|End of Line]] Club, its owner Castor reveals himself to be Zuse, then betrays Sam to Clu's guards. In the resulting fight, Flynn rescues his son, but Quorra is injured and Zuse gains possession of Flynn's disc. Zuse attempts to bargain with Clu for the disc, but Clu simply takes the disc and destroys the club along with Zuse. Flynn and Sam stow away aboard a "solar sailer" transport program, where Flynn restores Quorra and reveals her to be the last surviving ISO.  The transport is intercepted by Clu's warship; as a diversion, Quorra allows herself to be captured by Rinzler, whom Flynn recognizes as Tron, reprogrammed by Clu. Sam reclaims Flynn's disc and rescues Quorra, while Flynn takes control of a Light Fighter on the flight deck. Clu, Rinzler, and several guards pursue the trio in Light Jets. Upon making eye contact with Flynn, Rinzler remembers his past and deliberately collides with Clu's Light Jet, but Clu uses Tron's spare baton to escape while Tron falls into the Sea of Simulation below. Clu confronts the others at the Portal, where Flynn reintegrates with his digital duplicate, destroying Clu along with himself. Quorra, having switched discs with Flynn, gives Flynn's disc to Sam and they escape together to the real world. In Flynn's arcade, Sam [[Backup|backs up]] and deactivates the system. He then finds a waiting Bradley and tells him he plans to retake control of ENCOM, naming Bradley chairman of the board. He departs on his motorcycle with Quorra, and she witnesses her first real sunrise.  
Trigun: Badlands Rumble
  The exposition shows a bank robbery orchestrated by the titanic, towering thief known as [[List of Trigun characters#Gasback|Gasback]]. As a thief, he only pulls off the most difficult heists that offer the biggest rewards. Gasback's trio of henchmen, however, are tired from the increasing danger and expense of each successive job and decide to seize the winnings from his latest heist at Macca City, kill Gasback and retire to a life of luxury. When Cain, the leader of the trio goes to fire the killing shot, his gun is mysteriously knocked out of his hand.  [[Vash the Stampede]] appears from underneath a counter where he had been cowering and immediately throws the thieves off guard with his odd behavior and complaints about ruining his doughnuts. Gasback attempts to shoot down his former companions as they run away, but Vash manages to throw his aim off and no one is killed. Police begin to circle the building just as it is revealed that Vash is the legendary "Humanoid Typhoon." Gasback is confused why he would want to try to save even robbers and Vash responds in his usual way telling him that it's better to be alive. Gasback escapes the police by using a barrage of explosives for cover, one of which damages the city's power Plant.  20 years later the movie picks up with Gasback's former henchmen who had been living luxuriously on the money they had stolen. Gasback has taken revenge on one of them, destroying his business and property and leaving him to seek refuge with Cain Kepler. Cain used his portion of the robbery money to repair the city's Plant that was damaged by Gasback's escape and became Mayor. His vanity culminates in a huge rotating statue in his image built in the center of the city. Fearing Gasback will try to steal it, he insures the statue for 5 billion double-dollars prompting [[Milly Thompson]] and [[Meryl Stryfe]] to travel to Macca City to run risk prevention.  Vash travels to the city aboard a sand steamer and intervenes in an escalating brawl with some thugs harassing a young woman named [[List of Trigun characters#Amelia|Amelia]]. She is appreciative of Vash's assistance, but spurns his over-the-top advances (and rather humorously has a physical allergic reaction to men touching her). Amelia is actually a bounty hunter who has traveled to Macca City in anticipation of Gasback's appearance. Over the years the thief has accrued a 300 million double-dollar bounty and Amelia is only one of a great number of bounty hunters gathering to take a shot at bringing the criminal down. Meanwhile, Gasback continues planning his revenge and is ambushed by police who open fire on the bar he is playing poker in and level it to the ground. Gasback is shielded from the gunfire by his bodyguard who turns out to be [[Nicholas D. Wolfwood]]. Gasback discovered the priest dying of thirst in the middle of the desert (in a nod to Wolfwood's first appearance in the anime) near a water vending machine that wouldn't accept his crumpled bills. Feeling indebted to the thief, Wolfwood agrees to act as his bodyguard, but not actively participate in the robbery against Cain.  Vash continues trying to unsuccessfully court Amelia and they end up at dinner with Milly and Meryl. A brawl breaks out and afterward Vash carries the inebriated Amelia back to their hotel. That night Gasback attacks and destroys a factory owned by the second henchmen at a nearby town, leaving him to seek refuge with Cain and word spreads that the rumored attack on Macca City was a hoax. The bounty hunters, including Amelia, begin to leave the city early the next morning just as Gasback arrives. The bounty hunters, most of them nursing hangovers from drinking the night before, offer little resistance and soon Gasback fights his way to Cain's doorstep where he is halted by Vash. Wolfwood orders Vash to let Gasback pass and opens fire, distracting him just long enough for the thief to get inside the mansion. With his contract complete, Wolfwood puts his gun away allowing Vash to chase Gasback inside.  Gasback confronts Cain just as Vash and Amelia arrive. Vash hopes to defuse the situation while Amelia aims to kill Gasback. Amelia learns that Vash was the one who allowed Gasback to escape from the botched robbery 20 years ago. During Vash's interruption Cain manages to escape and once again Vash allows Gasback to leave despite Amelia's protests. She tells Vash that because he saved Gasback 20 years ago countless lives were affected by his robberies including her own life and her mother's who suffered because of the thief. She swears to chase him down and take revenge.  Elsewhere in the city Gasback confronts Cain once again and explains to his betrayer that he's not going to kill him, but instead steal everything that belongs to him. Cain had believed the target of the theft was his statue, but in fact the object is far more valuable. Gasback sets off a string of explosions which separate the city's Plant from its cradle and the massive light-bulb like Plant rolls through the town past dumbstruck citizens straight to the city's main gates where a special getaway vehicle secures the Plant and drives away. Amelia immediately takes a vehicle and chases after Gasback and she is followed by Vash and Wolfwood. She catches up to Gasback and starts shooting coming dangerously close to hitting the Plant. Vash and Wolfwood pull up between them and Vash tries to calm Amelia down, but he is shot by one of Gasback's henchmen and falls into [[dry quicksand]]. Wolfwood leaps in after him to save him, but only manages to pull up Vash's sunglasses. They take the sad news back to Milly and Meryl in the now darkened city and Amelia starts to think that she's no better than Gasback.  The following day Amelia enlists Wolfwood (wearing Vash’s sunglasses in tribute) to help track down Gasback and reclaim the Plant. They attack the thief’s caravan, but are quickly outmaneuvered. Just as one of Gasback's men moves to shoot Amelia, the gun is shot out of his hand by Vash, who reappears without a scratch. The bullet that struck him lodged in an extremely tough piece of smoked meat he was carrying in his coat pocket (and he barely avoided drowning in the quicksand pit due to Milly and Meryl nearly falling in the same pit and inadvertently pulling him out). Gasback then challenges him to a duel and Vash handily defeats him with a shot to the leg and shoulder. Gasback then activates a secret energy-based weapon, but Amelia steps forward and reveals a strange mechanical glove she wears which counters the weapon. Gasback recognizes the glove immediately as something he made for his wife, Amelia's mother. Amelia explains she was born shortly after Gasback left home to commit another robbery. The thief left his wife well-provisioned, but rival thieves came and stole almost everything they owned and none of their neighbors would help the family of the notorious criminal Gasback and not even doctors would help when Amelia's mother lay dying. Amelia holds the gun on him, but decides to spare his life having adopted Vash's outlook. A disheveled Cain arrives on the scene with a gaudy missile bearing his face which Wolfwood dispatches with a single shot from his Cross Punisher.  The closing credits show scenes where the town is restored. Vash and Wolfwood are walking when they are greeted by Meryl and Milly, who go off to report on the events. Gasback, his henchmen and his former cohorts including Caine have been taken into custody; as the police caravan travels, Amelia is seen following them from a distance. Vash and Wolfwood discuss the events of the last few days, including the circumstance that if Vash had not saved Gasback 20 years ago, Amelia would not have been born. A newspaper page blows into Vash's face. Vash reads it and declares they are heading in a new direction. Wolfwood asks what is going on and learns from the paper that the Dodongo Brothers have escaped prison. Wolfwood interprets Vash’s silent detachment as a sign that the legendary outlaw has something to do with the Brothers as well.

Trollhunter
 A group of students from [[Volda University College]], Thomas (Glenn Erland Tosterud), Johanna (Johanna Mørck) and their cameraman Kalle (Tomas Alf Larsen), set out to make a documentary about a suspected bear poacher, Hans ([[Otto Jespersen (comedian)|Otto Jespersen]]). At the site of an illegally slain bear they interview local hunters, who comment that the bear tracks look odd, as well as Finn Haugen ([[Hans Morten Hansen]]), head of the Norwegian Wildlife Board. Finn dismisses the idea that the bear tracks could have been faked. The students follow Hans in an attempt to secure an interview but he continually rebuffs them. After following him into a forest at night time, they see mysterious flashing lights and hear roars. Hans comes running back, screaming "Troll!" Thomas is attacked and bitten by a large animal. They escape in Hans's [[Land Rover]] and discover their own vehicle turned over with the tyres ripped off. Hans admits that he does not hunt bears, but [[troll]]s. Though sceptical, the students ask if they can join Hans and film his hunt, to which he consents on the condition that they do as he instructs.  The next day Hans makes them disguise themselves with "troll stench" (a slimy concentrate made from "everything you can squeeze out of a troll") and checks if any of them believe in [[God]] or [[Jesus]], because a troll can smell a [[Christian]] man's blood. Hans wields a "flash gun", a weapon that emits powerful [[Ultraviolet|UV-rays]] to simulate sunlight and turn trolls to stone, though he comments that sometimes the trolls "just explode". The students are stunned when Hans flushes out a giant three-headed troll. Hans manages to turn the troll to stone and explains to the students that he only allowed them to come along because he's tired of working for little compensation and wants them to divulge the truth. Finn, who actually works for the Troll Security Service (TSS), arrives with a team to deposit a bear carcass and plant fake tracks, and tells the students that they will not be allowed to keep their tapes. In a series of interviews, Hans reveals that Finn's work is to keep trolls a secret, while his is to kill any that come near populated areas. He also explains that the trolls have been acting aggressively lately and have begun to leave their territories more often than usual, and that he must get a troll blood sample to try to determine why.  The students accompany Hans on another hunt using live goats on a bridge as bait. Hans successfully obtains a blood sample from a bridge troll and takes it to a veterinarian who works for the TSS, but finds that it will take several days before any results can be found. Investigating a farm where a number of trees have been uprooted, Hans and the film crew find troll tracks leading into an abandoned mine, the lair of a pack of trolls. The trolls return unexpectedly and the group is trapped inside. The situation gets more tense as Kalle confesses that he is a Christian. The trolls eventually smell Kalle's scent and discover the group. In a panic the group runs for the safety of daylight at the cave entrance, but Kalle is killed.  The replacement camerawoman is Malica, a [[Muslim]]; Hans is uncertain about how trolls will react to that. Finn demands that Hans head north to troll territory to get the problem under control. The group finds signs of a [[Jötunn|Jotnar]], a giant mountain troll 50–100 metres tall. Thomas falls ill, and they learn that the troll blood sample came back positive for [[rabies]]; Thomas has been infected by the bite he received several days earlier.  After several attempts, Hans manages to kill the Jotnar by launching a rocket-like projectile that transforms the troll into stone. He directs the others to find the highway. Finn and his government agents arrive to confiscate the students' tapes. Thomas flees with the camera and is seen collapsing at the side of a road when the tape cuts out. Just before the cut to black a truck is seen stopping next to the camera. Presumably the driver is the person who "found the footage". An epilogue tells the audience that none of the students were heard from again. The film ends with a news clip of the Norwegian Prime Minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]] appearing to admit to the existence of trolls, though the press fails to take notice.<ref name="Eggertson"></ref>

This is because years ago, Su's father killed Yuan's father when the latter went too far in learning an evil martial arts technique called the Five Venom Fists. Su's father then took Yuan in, but he harbours concern that Yuan is still vengeful. Su is naive and assures his father that everything will be alright.  When Yuan returns, a homecoming party is held. Yuan greets his sister Ying, Feng, and Su's father. Su's father knows what is impending and asks Yuan to take his revenge on him alone, sparing Su and his family. Using his mastery of the Five Venom Fists, Yuan kills Su's father and decapitates him. He expresses his desire to be with his sister (Ying) and her son Feng as a family. When Su hears the news of his father's murder, he rushes to the scene of his father's death and is attacked by the Iron Twins. He chases them to a rapid where Yuan is offering Su's father's head to his real father as a symbol of revenge taken. A battle ensues between Yuan and Su. Yuan has a dark armour sewn into his body, making him partially invulnerable to blades. Using his Five Venom Fists, Yuan deals a deadly poisonous blow to Su who is defeated. Feng begs for Su's life and Yuan spares him but throws him into the rapids. Ying jumps into the rapid to save Su and Yuan is heartbroken at the loss of his beloved sister. He takes Feng in as his only family.  Ying awakes in forest area and tries to bring her husband to civilization and safety. They are found by a herb researcher and wine maker, Sister Yu, who treats Su's wounds. Su comes to consciousness but is broken to find his right arm severely weakened with all tendons torn. At first, he is desperate and turns to drinking, but with Ying's support, he focuses on training in order to save Feng. He meets Wu Shu God and an old sage and asks to be their disciple. At a sacred site, he trains with the Wu Shu God for years, always trying to defeat him but never able to. Later, by checking Su's pulse, Dr. Du reveals to Ying that Su is going mad and that there is probably no Wu Shu god or Old Sage since she is the only one living in the area. Ying follows Su into the forest one day and finds him fighting (seemingly) with himself, oblivious to the fact that he is only battling with the Wu Shu god in his mind. Ying pleads with Su to come to his senses but he does not believe her. By the time Su realizes the truth, it is too late. Ying has left to try to save Feng by herself.  At Yuan's palace, Ying is now a captive of Yuan. Su arrives shortly after and fights his way through the guards. He also battles the Iron Twins and with his improved skills, impales both on a podao, a saber like spear. Yuan orders his men to bury Ying alive in a box and then kills the men who buried her so that only he knows her location. A crazed Su battles with Yuan in his training chamber and ultimately defeats him, even gnashing though a poisonous snake in the process. Feng screams that Yuan must not die because only he knows Ying's location, but a maddened Su delivers a fatal blow to Yuan's throat, thus executing him in anger. Realizing the words of Feng, he rushes out and a dying soldier reveals the vague location of Ying. Su and Feng rush to search for her but are too late digging her out. Ying dies from lack of air, and Su goes mad with grief.  ----  The era changes from the dynastic to the colonized. Su has lost his mind after the loss of his wife and the previous delusions he had. A homeless Feng leads his father through the streets by rope and takes care of him. A Kung Fu master is killed in a fighting arena - part of a foreigners' club - leaving Su's old friend, Ma, as leader of the Wu Shu Federation. The arena is a stage below which tigers lurk freely, waiting for any unfortunate fighter to drop below.  In the meantime, Su goes into an inn and creates trouble by stealing wine and countering people bent on stopping him with martial art moves. He then meets a fellow drunkard (the Wu Shu god in disguise) who spars with him and gives him a few philosophical tips. The two of them start using Drunken Fighting (Zui Quan) techniques, and Su regains his sanity. The inn lady calls Ma to deal with Su and Ma recognizes Su. They have a talk and Ma gives Su back his sword. Su asks Ma to take care of Feng since he is unfit to be a father but Feng persists, staying with his father instead.  The next day, Su and Feng show up to support Ma in his arena battle. Su goes about drinking in the club's bar area, oblivious to Ma receiving a serious beating in the ring. When Feng tries to save Ma from being killed, the opposing wrestler grabs Feng and holds him in the air. Feng screams for help from his father. His son's cries awake Su from his drunken state and Su rushes into the arena. As Ma and Feng are being taken out of the arena by bystanders, Su battles and defeats the wrestler. Anthony, owner of a wrestling stable, orders his lot to pour into the arena, resulting in a mismatch of three wrestlers to one (Su). Using the drunken martial arts technique learned from his fellow drunkard in the inn, Su's defeats the fighters although he is heavily injured. At the end of the battle, the other fighters are either dead or unconscious, and only after a vision of Ying and the dramatic cries of Feng in an otherwise silenced arena, does a semi-conscious Su manage to stand up. He is declared the winner.  The film ends with a seemingly restored Su practising his moves of old but with long hair reminiscent of the insane period of his life, with Feng observing. Su has seemingly found his passion.  
True Grit (2010 film)
 Mattie Ross's father was murdered by Tom Chaney when she was 14 years old. While collecting her father's body in [[Fort Smith, Arkansas]], Mattie asks the local sheriff about the search for Chaney. He tells her that Chaney has fled with "Lucky" Ned Pepper and his gang into [[Indian Territory]], where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy U.S. Marshal]]. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses [[Rooster Cogburn (character)|Rooster Cogburn]]. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, not believing she has the money to hire him, but she raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill.  [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] LaBoeuf arrives in town, pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas [[State Senator]]. LaBoeuf proposes joining Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn but he leaves without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward.  After being refused passage on the ferry that conveyed Cogburn and LaBoeuf, Mattie crosses the river on horseback. LaBoeuf expresses his displeasure by [[spanking]] Mattie with a stick, but Cogburn eventually allows Mattie to accompany them. After a dispute over their respective service with the [[Confederate Army]], Cogburn ends their arrangement and LaBoeuf leaves to pursue Chaney on his own. Cogburn and Mattie meet a trail doctor who directs them to an empty dugout for shelter. They find two outlaws, Quincy and Moon, and interrogate them. Quincy insists they have no information about the Pepper gang, but eventually Moon divulges what he knows; Quincy fatally stabs Moon, and Cogburn shoots Quincy dead. Before dying, Moon says Pepper and his gang will be returning for fresh horses that night.  LaBoeuf arrives at the dugout and is confronted by the Pepper gang. Cogburn, hiding on the hillside with Mattie, shoots two gang members and accidentally hits LaBoeuf, but Pepper escapes. However, Cogburn and LaBoeuf argue the next day, and the latter departs again. While retrieving water from a stream, Mattie encounters Chaney. She shoots him, but he survives and drags her back to Pepper, who forces Cogburn to leave by threatening to kill her. Pepper leaves Mattie alone with Chaney, ordering him not to harm her or he will not get paid after his remount arrives.  Chaney tries to knife Mattie, but LaBoeuf appears and knocks Chaney out. They watch from a distance as Cogburn fights the remaining members of Pepper's gang, killing two and wounding Ned before his horse is shot and falls, trapping his leg, whereupon LaBoeuf snipes Pepper. Chaney regains consciousness and knocks out LaBoeuf, but Mattie seizes LaBoeuf's rifle and shoots Chaney in the chest. The recoil knocks her into a deep pit, where she is bitten by a rattlesnake. Cogburn cuts into her hand to suck out as much of the venom as he can, then rides day and night to reach a doctor, carrying her on foot after her horse collapses from exhaustion.  Mattie's left forearm is amputated due to gangrene from the snakebite. Cogburn stays until she is out of danger, but leaves before she regains consciousness. She never sees Cogburn or LaBoeuf again, despite writing a letter inviting Cogburn to collect the money she owed him. Twenty-five years later, she receives a note from Cogburn inviting her to a travelling [[Wild West shows|Wild West show]]  where he now performs. She arrives, only to learn that he died three days earlier. She has his body moved to her family cemetery. Standing over Cogburn's grave, she reflects on her decision to move his remains, and about never having married, as well as the possibility of seeing LaBoeuf again.  
Tucker & Dale vs. Evil
  A reporter and cameraman sneak into a closed off murder scene looking for anything the police missed in the hopes of breaking a bigger story. They are ambushed by a crazed man with half of his face burned, and who is badly injured.  Allison, Chad, Chloe, Chuck, Jason, Naomi, Todd, Mitch and Mike are going camping in [[West Virginia]]. While at a gas station, they encounter Tucker and Dale, two well-meaning [[Hillbilly|hillbillies]] who have just bought the vacation home of their dreams: a run-down lakefront cabin, deep in the woods. On Tucker's advice, Dale tries to talk to Allison, but because of his [[inferiority complex]] and appearance, he only scares her and her friends.  Tucker and Dale arrive at their decrepit cabin and begin repairing it. Nearby in the woods, Chad tells a story about the "Memorial Day Massacre", a hillbilly attack which took place 20 years ago. The college kids go skinny-dipping where Tucker and Dale are fishing, and Allison, startled, hits her head. Tucker and Dale save her from drowning, but her friends think she has been kidnapped. When Allison wakes up in Tucker and Dale's cabin the next day, she is initially scared but gradually befriends them. The other college kids arrive at the cabin to save Allison from her "psychopathic captors", and Chuck runs away to get the police. While Dale and Allison are inside the cabin, Tucker angers some bees and frantically waves around his chainsaw, which the college kids misinterpret as hostility. They scatter through the woods, where Mitch accidentally impales himself on a broken tree, killing himself. After finding Mitch's body, Chad persuades the others that they are in a battle for survival.  Allison's friends follow Tucker and Dale back to their cabin and see Allison helping out with construction of an outhouse, but they assume she's being made to dig her own grave. The college kids attack, but Todd and Mike end up accidentally killing themselves, and Allison is accidentally knocked unconscious by Dale's shovel. The other kids assume the hillbillies killed the two when they see Tucker trying to save Mike from the wood chipper. Tucker and Dale think the college kids are suicidal and that contacting the police will make them murder suspects. Chuck arrives back with a sheriff, who expresses doubt over Tucker and Dale's suicide-pact theory. The sheriff goes inside the cabin and accidentally kills himself, then Chuck accidentally kills himself with the sheriff's gun. Chad reappears and attempts to shoot Tucker and Dale but only manages to capture Tucker, whom he ties upside down to a tree. Chad then tortures Tucker and cuts off two of his fingers. He sends them with a message to Dale, to come and get Tucker.  Dale leaves to rescue Tucker while Chad and Naomi return to the cabin to save Allison. When Allison tries to explain the situation, they accuse her of having [[Stockholm syndrome]]. Tucker and Dale return, and Allison attempts to lead a calm discussion. Chad says his grandmother told him that his father was killed in the Memorial Day Massacre, and his mother was the lone survivor. Jason and Chloe break in to save everyone, and a fire breaks out. Tucker, Dale, and Allison escape; Naomi, Chloe and Jason die, and Chad, insane and scarred, vows revenge. After a car crash, an injured Tucker tells Dale that Chad has taken Allison to an old [[sawmill]].  At the sawmill Chad ties Allison up and forcibly kisses her. Dale arrives and rescues Allison, and the two barricade themselves inside an upstairs office where they discover news clippings revealing Chad's father to be the killer and rapist, not one of the victims. Chad becomes enraged, and Dale stops his attack by throwing a box of [[chamomile tea]] at Chad, giving him an asthma attack. Chad, standing near a window, convulses and falls to his apparent death.  The police and a news crew arrive late at the cabin and broadcast a news report stating that the deaths appear to be the result of a suicide pact and a deranged killer; the reporter and cameraman are the same two from the movie's opening scene. Tucker watches the report on the news while convalescing in the hospital. Dale enters and they discuss Tucker's recovery. Tucker asks Dale whether he managed to invite Allison on a date and is happy to hear the two of them are going [[ten-pin bowling|bowling]]. Later that night at the bowling alley, the two profess their feelings for each other and kiss.  The beginning of the film is revealed to be the chronological ending and the person who attacks the reporter and cameraman is revealed to be Chad, who had survived his fall.

Trust (2010 film)
 Fourteen-year-old Annie Cameron lives in suburban [[Chicago]]. On her birthday, her parents give her a laptop. When she meets Charlie in an online [[chat room]], she establishes an instant connection with him. At first, Charlie states that he is 16 years old. Over time, as the two bond by sending phone text messages and through [[instant messaging]], he bumps his age up to 20, then 25. Annie is taken aback at first, but comes to believe that the two of them are in love.  After two months of communicating electronically, Charlie invites Annie to meet him at the mall. While her parents are dropping off Annie's brother at college, Annie goes to the mall and awaits her first face-to-face meeting with Charlie. When he appears, she discovers that he is a man in his 30s. Annie is upset at first, but he charms her into going with him to a motel. Charlie then has her try on some lingerie which he bought for her and begins to touch her inappropriately. When she tells him no, he pushes her down onto the bed and [[rape]]s her, and even films the [[sexual assault|assault]].  At school, Brittany, Annie's best friend, deduces Annie had sex, as she had seen her and Charlie that day at the mall. Brittany is concerned about this and notifies the school administration. The police arrive and depart with Annie, drawing unwanted attention from fellow students at her high school. These actions initiate an [[FBI]] investigation. The FBI have Annie contact Charlie, in an attempt to identify him, but he figures out the ruse and breaks off contact with her before the FBI can trace his location.  Annie's father, Will, starts his own investigation, by taking up the services of a private investigation firm in [[New Jersey]] and even stealing a collection of his daughter's chat conversations with Charlie from the FBI. The private investigation proves fruitless, as it is discovered Charlie masks his IP address so his location shows up as the [[Czech Republic]]. His relationship with his daughter and his wife, Lynn, starts to become alienating, and he questions his work at an advertising firm, which uses provocative advertisements involving teenagers.  In the midst of her father's pursuit of her attacker, Annie, upon the insistence of her parents, begins to see Gail Friedman, a hospital counselor. Annie is cold towards Friedman at first, but quickly begins to express her need to be loved and validated. It's at this point that Annie's so-called "love" for Charlie is obstructing her view of what really transpired on the day that they met.  Annie is evidently bitter towards Brittany and her parents, as she's under the delusion that Charlie loves her. A few more days pass, and although Charlie has not been identified, DNA evidence proves he has sexually abused several other young girls. After seeing pictures of Charlie's other victims, she flees her home and seeks consolation from Friedman, before finally admitting to herself that she was raped.  The next day, Annie tries to move on with her life by participating in her school's volleyball game. There, Will sees a man in the crowd taking pictures, whom Will recognizes as a registered [[sex offender]]. Will violently confronts him - who turns out to be the father of one of Annie's teammates. The assaulted man chooses not to press charges for fear that he will be outed as a sex offender to his family. Will apologizes to the man but Annie feels humiliated. At home, Annie confronts her father, and insists that she wants to move on with her life.  Annie hears from Brittany about a website in which people are belittling the fact that she was raped and posting photo manipulations of her in pornographic poses, as well as revealing her phone number and address. She locks herself in the bathroom and attempts suicide by overdosing with pills, unbeknownst to her father, who's still at home. A panicked call from Lynn leads Will to search the house for a semi-conscious Annie. Will forces Annie to vomit up the pills, and she's hastily rushed to a nearby hospital. Brittany spends the night to keep her company, mending their broken friendship.  Annie wakes up early the next day, and discovers her father sitting outside in the freezing cold weather. He pleads for her forgiveness, even though he believes he does not deserve it. Annie starts to cry and then embraces him.  As the credits roll, a home video reveals Charlie to be a high school physics teacher named Graham Weston, a married father with a young son.  
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse
  In Seattle, not far from Forks, [[List of Twilight characters#Victoria|Victoria]] is still vengeful on Bella for James’s death. Learning that Laurent is killed by wolves and to replace him and James, she attacks and bites [[List of Twilight characters#Riley|Riley Biers]] in order to begin creating an army of newborns, who are many times stronger during their first few months than older vampires. Back in Forks, [[Edward Cullen]] and [[Bella Swan]] resume their relationship, and discuss the complications of becoming a vampire. At eighteen years old, one year older than Edward was when he became a vampire, Bella dislikes the idea of marrying so young, though Edward refuses to turn her into a vampire until they are married, his argument being that she should have a normal, human life. While Bella's father, [[List of Twilight characters#Charlie Swan|Charlie Swan]], investigates the disappearance of Riley Biers, Edward suspects his disappearance was caused by Victoria and her newborn's army, furthering his suspicions of Riley Biers' intrusion into Bella's bedroom to steal her red blouse.  Bella insists that [[Jacob Black]] and the rest of the wolf pack would never harm her. Bella wants to go to Jacob's home, even though Edward expresses his dislike of Jacob and concern for her safety, but she returns unharmed. During one of her visits, Jacob confesses that he is in love with Bella, and forcefully kisses her. Furious, she punches him and sprains her hand, and Edward later threatens Jacob and tells him to only kiss her if she asks him to. Bella even revokes the invitations of Jacob and his pack members to her graduation party at the Cullen house, but when Jacob apologizes for his behavior, she forgives him and lets him and the wolf pack attend the party.  Meanwhile, [[List of Twilight characters#Alice Cullen|Alice]] sees a vision that the newborn army will attack Forks within the week, led by Riley Biers. Jacob, accompanied by [[List of Twilight characters#Quil Ateara|Quil]] and [[List of Twilight characters#Embry Call|Embry]], overhear this, which leads to an alliance between the Cullens and wolf pack. Later, the Cullens and the wolves agree to a meeting place and time to train and discuss strategy against the powerful newborns. During their training [[List of Twilight characters#Jasper|Jasper]] explains to Bella that he was a Major in the Confederate Army during the Civil War, and he was created by a vampire named Maria to control a newborn army. He eventually realized that Maria used him to fulfill her own ambitions. He didn't know there was another way until he met Alice and joined the Cullens. Bella sees the true bond between a mated vampire pair and begins to understand Jasper better. Despite her reluctance to marry young, Bella realizes that spending eternity with Edward is more important to her than anything else and accepts his marriage proposal, along with his late mother's engagement ring. Edward and Bella camp in the mountains to hide Bella from the bloodthirsty newborns. During the night, Bella overhears a conversation between Edward and Jacob, in which they temporarily put aside their hatred towards each other. In the morning, Jacob overhears Edward and Bella discussing their engagement and is furious. Bella desperately asks Jacob to kiss her, and she realizes that she loves him. Edward learns about the kiss but is not upset, because Bella says she loves him more than Jacob.  When Victoria appears, Edward kills her while Seth kills Riley. The Cullens and the wolves, meanwhile, destroy her "army", though Jacob is injured saving Leah from a newborn. Several members of the vampire overlords, the [[List of Twilight characters#Volturi|Volturi]], arrive to deal with the newborn army, and are surprised the Cullens weren't killed. They also see that the Cullens are guarding the newborn, [[List of Twilight characters#Bree Tanner|Bree Tanner]], who had refused to fight and surrendered to Carlisle. Jane briefly tortures Bree to get information, then has Felix kill her, despite the Cullens' efforts to spare her. Carlisle treats Jacob at his home, and Bella visits him to tell him that even though she loves him, she has chosen Edward. Devastated by her choice, Jacob reluctantly agrees not to come between her and Edward.  Bella and Edward go to the meadow, where she tells him she has decided to do things his way: Get married, have a normal honeymoon, then be transformed into a vampire. She also explains that she never has been normal and never will be, that she's felt out of place her entire life, but when she is in Edward's world she feels stronger and complete. At the end of the story, they know they need to tell Charlie about their engagement, for which Bella is happy Edward is "bulletproof."

Ultramarines: A Warhammer 40,000 Movie
 The film opens with a group of Space Marines of the [[Imperial Fists]] Chapter under attack from an unknown enemy. A Space Marine by the name of Nidon is told to protect "the Codex" and races to obey his orders, just before a fireball engulfs them all. Elsewhere, aboard a Space Marine Strike Cruiser, Brother Proteus and Captain Severus of the Ultramarines Chapter spar in a training duel. Proteus manages to disarm Severus, however, he quickly escapes Proteus's grasp and in turn defeats him, proclaiming that a Space Marine never yields. The members of Ultima Squad are then shown a sacred weapon in their ship's reclusium, a Relic Thunder Hammer. The Captain and his right-hand man, Apothecary Pythol lead the initiates in a swearing-in ceremony on the Hammer. With the ceremony finished, Ultima Squad prepare themselves for their first mission—a sortie to the planet of Mithron.  In orbit above the planet, Captain Severus departs the cruiser with only the Ultima Squad, highly eager to prove themselves in battle, for support. En route to the planet's surface, Severus<ref></ref> addresses the squad, informing them of the distress call received shortly before all contact with the planet was lost, and how it is still unclear whether it is automated or not. Soon they are on the tough and unforgiving surface of Mithron, and the only location of importance is a shrine guarded by 100 Imperial Fists. Ultima Squad quickly discovers that a terrible battle has taken place, with the garrison force annihilated and the planet's [[Imperium (Warhammer 40,000)|Imperial]] shrine desecrated. It is also evident that the forces of [[Chaos (Warhammer 40,000)|Chaos]] are responsible, and Severus decides they must continue the mission to search for any remaining survivors.  While approaching the ruins, the Ultramarines are ambushed by the Black Legion. Three Ultramarines are killed but the ambush is thwarted. The squad continues on, and in a dark passage of the shrine they are attacked by a [[Daemon(Warhammer)|Daemon]] Prince which grapples with Severus, and they both fall through the wall and down a ravine. With Severus gone and Crastor dead, command of the squad falls to Proteus who decides to continue with the mission. Progressing to the reliquary at the shrine's summit, they find Chaplain Carnak and Brother Nidon, the sole surviving Imperial Fists. They reveal they have been protecting the Liber Mithrus, an ancient sacred Codex given by [[The God-Emperor of Mankind]] himself. Ultima Squad agrees to help escort the book to safety, but Verenor and Proteus remain suspicious, questioning how just the two of them have managed to survive for so long. As Ultima Squad<ref></ref> retreat to the extraction point, they are attacked by a huge force of [[Chaos Space Marines]]. During the fight they suffer heavy casualties, and just as they are about to be overwhelmed, Severus suddenly reappears and aids their escape.  Back on board, Proteus confides to Severus his suspicions of Carnak and Nidon, believing that they may have been tainted by Chaos. They confront the Imperial Fists, with Severus taking the book and discovering that it is blank. When Hypax enters with the Ultramarines standard, it ignites, indicating the presence of Chaos. Severus declares that Carnak has been tainted and kills him. Nidon becomes enraged and attacks Severus, but is easily thrown off and knocked unconscious. Hypax questions why the standard continues to burn with Carnak dead, and it clear that Severus was possessed by the Daemon that he fought. Hypax charges the daemon, and pushes it into the armoury. When Proteus and Nidon regain consciousness, they find both Hypax and Decius slain. Accompanied by Nidon, the three confront Severus in the ship's reclusium. Severus assumes daemon form and reveals its plans to possess Proteus and infiltrate the Ultramarines' homeworld of Macragge. Pythol arrives in time to save Proteus, but is killed. Using the diversion, Proteus then takes the Thunder Hammer to kill Severus and banish the daemon possessing him. Later it is shown that Proteus is promoted to Sergeant, with Verenor as his second in command, and the final scene mirrors the opening one, showing the new recruits swearing on the sacred hammer.  
Udaan (2010 film)
  17-year-old Rohan is expelled from the reputed [[Bishop Cotton School (Shimla)|Bishop Cotton School, Shimla]] boarding school along with three friends Vikram, Benoy and Maninder when they are caught by their warden watching an adult movie off campus.  Rohan returns home to [[Jamshedpur]] to a stern, abusive and alcoholic father and a 6-year-old half-brother, Arjun (whose existence Rohan hadn't known about), not knowing what's in store for him. His father forces him to jog every morning and race him at the last leg. Rohan then must work at his father's metal works factory and attend engineering classes at the local university immediately afterwards. His father's disappointment takes the form of verbal and physical abuse and constant humiliation. Rohan's kind uncle supports his ambitions of being a writer but his father will have none of it. One night he sneaks out of the house, takes his father's car and goes to a local bar. There he meets some seniors from his college who try to rag him but later become his friends. This - taking his father's car and drinking at the bar - becomes a regular habit.  An uninterested Rohan deliberately fails the exam so that his father will give up on him, leaving him free to pursue his dream of becoming a writer. At the same time, his father is summoned to school to take Arjun away because of something he has done. This causes his father to lose an important contract. Rohan comes home to a scene where Arjun is being rushed to the hospital for some unknown reason. His father says that Arjun fell down the stairs. Fearful of complicating matters, Rohan lies to his father and says that he passed his exams. His father then goes to Calcutta on an urgent business trip leaving Rohan to take care of Arjun in the hospital.  In the hospital, Rohan impresses a lot of people including doctors and nurses with his stories and poems. He befriends Arjun and discovers that he was beaten by their father after losing the contract. His father returns from Calcutta and finds that Rohan has failed the exams. Enraged, the father assaults Rohan in the night but apologizes the very next day. The next morning their father declares that he is going to marry again and decides to send Arjun to a boarding school while Rohan is supposed to quit college in order to work full-time at the factory. When Rohan's uncle offers to take Arjun in, he is belittled by Rohan's father for his impotency and thrown out of the house while Rohan pleads with his uncle to take him away. Furious about this, his father burns Rohan's diary where he has written all his poems. Some time later, Rohan's father introduces his new wife and step-daughter to Rohan. On his 18th birthday, his father gives him his watch, originally belonging to Rohan's great-grandfather and says that he should continue the tradition. Rohan calls his friend Maninder, who is living a successful and happy life with his friends in Mumbai and breaks down on the phone unable to say anything about his own life to his friends.  One day, Rohan takes all his frustration out on his father's car by a river but some policemen happen to see him in the act. He spends a night in prison after his father comes to know about the car and leaves him to his fate. He finds his to-be stepmother and her relatives in the house when he returns. Rohan learns from Arjun that he would be leaving for boarding school the next day. Rohan simply wishes him luck and prepares to leave home. On his way out, Rohan exchanges bitter words with his father in front of his guests and when confronted and aggravated by his father, punches him and runs away. His father chases Rohan through the streets on foot, but cannot catch up to him anymore. Rohan spends the night at his uncle's house. His uncle has a quiet word with Rohan in the night, it is implied that it is regarding Arjun's fate. The next morning Rohan returns to his father's house and finds Arjun waiting outside while his father has gone to get an auto-rickshaw to take him to boarding school. Rohan convinces Arjun to go with him to Mumbai leaving the watch and note behind explaining his decision and warning his father not to look for them with the threat of revealing his attacks on Arjun to the police. The movie ends with Rohan and Arjun walking away holding hands.

Taking the planet hostage and brainwashing the guardian of the planet, Kaiser Belial is victorious in capturing the planet.  Back in Nebula M78, The Land of Light is attacked by one of Belial's robot carrier, containing 3 Darklopses. Luckily [[Ultraman Zero]] shows up along with UltraSeven and destroys the Darklopses before they can get away. Tracing the energy where the Darklops came from, the Ultras come to a conclusion that the Darklops came from an alternate universe and therefore are unable to come together to stop them. Ultraman Zero obligates to go by himself to stop Belial, and so the Ultra Brothers and all of the citizens create a travel sphere to send Ultraman Zero to the universe that Belial is terrorizing. Before departing however, [[Ultra Seven]] gives Zero a newly crafted item known as the "''Zero Bracelet''," an item that acts as a backup power source should Zero run out of energy when things are in a dire state. It can be used for only 3 times.  On Planet Esmeralda, Belial's Legionoid Army is causing destruction and attacking a group of rebels who are trying to attack. Battling against the Legionoids are Nao and Run, two brothers who pilot a vehicle to do battle against the army. When Run tries to save Nao from falling into a volcanic pit, Ultraman Zero arrives and notices the situation the two are in. The bracelet proved to be useful as the suns in that universe are incapable of recharging Ultra beings. As a result, Ultraman Zero uses Run's body as his host and shortly after joining, Zero easily takes out the Legionoids. However, in doing so Ultraman Zero is forced to assume the identity of Nao's brother, Run to both keep the heavily wounded Run alive as well as to conserve energy.  After greeting Nao and telling him of the situation, Zero (as Run) learns that Belial is harvesting the universe for [[Emerald]]s, which can be converted into raw energy. Belial is planning on using mass quantities of the emeralds' power in his conquest of the universe.

Along their way, the heroes meet . A wily crew of hostile pirates that sail throughout a galaxy known as "The Space [[Nitromethane]] Sea." With them is their more hot-tempered and feisty bodyguard, . At first identifying the Jean-bird with hostility, Run becomes Ultraman Zero for the first time to try and reason with the crew of Pirates. Shortly after, Glenfire and Ultraman Zero battle to prove Zero's innocence, with the fight ending in a standstill and Zero gaining the Pirates' and Glenfire's trust. Suddenly the crew are attacked by Kaiser Belial's Squadron of Legionoids, lead of one of Kaiser Belial's generals, . Outnumbered and overpowered by Darkgone's squadron of Legionoids, Glenfire provides information about the whereabouts of the Shield of Baradhi to Zero and proceeds to agitates the mass quantities of  Nitromethane with his fire abilities and causes a massive explosion, destroying all the Legionoids, scares away Darkgone, and seemingly killing Glenfire in the process.  Now with the location of the Shield revealed, The heroes head off to the 2-D . There they meet another bodyguard to the planet and the Shield known as , (who was corrupted and brainwashed by Kaiser Belial, as seen at the start of the film.) Run transforms into Ultraman Zero a second time and proceeds to battle with the corrupted Mirror Knight and in the process, expels the evil energy from within Mirror Knight, restoring him back to his senses. Redeemed and grateful, Mirror Knight joins the heroes in their journey and informs them of the Shield of Baradhi's location below the Planet's surface.  Upon reaching its location, The Shield of Baradhi is revealed to be a statue known as "Noa" and a trinket around Nao's neck is all that is left to complete the shield. However, in placing the final piece to the shield, the shield to disintegrate into sand as a result of time passes for centuries, shocking and saddening the heroes for their journey being wasted. Suddenly, the Planet of Mirrors is attacked by another one of Kaiser Belial's generals, , who proceeds to destroy the Planet of Mirrors with the help of several of Belial's ships. In the ensuring chaos, Mirror Knight is defeated and Run is separated from Nao and Emerana and falls unconscious just before attempting to transform into Ultraman Zero for the third and final time.  Awakening, Run finds himself inside of Belial's massive vessel that is still attached to the planet of Esmeralda and is confronted by a scarred and vengeful Kaiser Belial. Reveling in his "victory," Kaiser Belial reveals that he will send thousands of Darklopses to attack the Land of Light out of revenge for what happened to him in the past. Run watches in horror as the Ultras are beaten by Belial's forces but is overjoyed when he learns that Nao and Emerana have survived the destruction from previously. Also surviving from the destruction was Mirror Knight, who emerges and frees Run so that he may transform into Ultraman Zero. The Final Battle between Ultraman Zero and Kaiser Belial then proceeds and the two battle to a standstill. However, Kaiser Belial unleashes a Deathcium Ray and incapacitates Ultraman Zero before fleeing.  Meanwhile, Iaron and Mirror Knight face off in Kaiser Belial's headquarters and Darkgone faces off against Jean-bird, who is running out of power. With no other option, Emerana sacrifices herself to fuel Jean-bird with her own Emerald energy by locking herself into his main engine, allowing Jean-bird to transform into his more humanoid robot form known as "." With Nao's help, Jean-bot destroys Darkgone and Mirror Knight is victorious in killing Iaron as well.  Suddenly, Ultraman Zero finds Kaiser Belial standing atop a mountain of Emeralds he had harvested from planets and Kaiser Belial proceeds to absorb its massive energy qualities, transforming Belial into a towering monster known as . Now physically towering and unstoppable, Arch Belial overpowered and tortures Zero as Mirror Knight and Jean-Bot are unable to stop him. Miraculously, Glenfire returns and rescues Ultraman Zero, as well as reveals that he and the Pirate of Flames also brought along help in the form of the Planet of Mirrors army and Esmeralda's royal guard, whom altogether hold off Belial's Legionoid and ship fortresses. Arch Belial however intends on destroying Zero and Esmeralda with his Arch Deathcium Ray. Ultimately during the battle with Belial and having all energies in his bracelet used up, Zero's strength is spent and finally dies from exhaustion.  Now understanding the purpose of the Shield of Baradhi, Nao informs everyone not to lose hope and eventually, Zero is revived and brought forth by [[Ultraman Nexus#Ultraman Nexus's modes|Ultraman Noa]], who bestows the Shield of Baradhi onto Zero, transforming the Ultra into . With his enhanced powers, Ultimate Zero destroys Arch Belial with the Final Ultimate Zero, saving the universe from his tyranny.  With Belial gone for good, tranquility returns to the universe. Princess Emerana reveals to have survived using her energy to power Jean-Bot, the Ultras back in M78 are revealed to have not only survived but has also stopped Belials forces as well, and Ultraman Zero separates from Run's body, allowing him to live a normal life with Nao again. Ultraman Zero proceeds to head back to his home Universe, but has a change of heart when Glenfire, Mirror Knight, and Jean-Bot urge him to stay. Thus, Zero forms  out of the allies and friends he had made along his journey and Zero decides to stay with the group after all.

Undocumented (film)
 Filmmakers Travis, William, Liz, Davie, and Jim are filming a documentary on illegal Mexican immigrants. After interviewing several of Davie's family members and harassing an employer of illegal immigrants named Whitaker, the group accompanies a large group of immigrants including Davie's cousin Alberto and his wife and child, across the Mexican border into the U.S.  Once in the [[United States]], the truck carrying the immigrants is stopped and taken by what seems to be the [[United States Border Patrol]]. The truck is instead taken to a facility where the filmmakers are interrogated and the immigrants taken captive. The group that has taken them is a radical patriot group that despises illegal immigrants, Mexicans in particular. The patriots, led by "Z", gives the filmmakers a proposition. Film the patriots and document what they do to captured illegal immigrants, and be let free, or die along with the immigrants. The leader of the patriots lets all of the children go, including Alberto's daughter.  The first part the filmmakers must film is the torture of an immigrant who smuggles drugs across the border into the U.S. Liz tries to intervene but the immigrant is beaten to death. The next morning, one of Z's henchman give the filmmakers a tour of the facility. When they are shown around the "pens" holding men and women, Alberto gets riled up and is sprayed by a high pressure hose. Alberto is then taken to a room where he is quizzed on several questions about America's government and history. If he gets a question wrong, Alberto's wife's joints are pulled into stress positions. When asked who said the quote "Give me liberty or give me death," Alberto incorrectly answers [[Thomas Jefferson]] after given the answer by William, causing Alberto's wife and William to be killed.  The same night, the group tries to escape from the facility in the cover of darkness by using the cameras night vision mode. During the attempt, Travis knocks over a metal fence, causing Z's wife to check on the imprisoned immigrants, where the filmmakers are hiding. After a close call, the group escapes outside, where Alberto's daughter was killed by [[razor wire]]. Alberto's grieving alerts Z's henchman and a watchdog that mangles Jim's arm and leg. The filmmakers are then forced to record a conscious immigrants organ removal, when Jim passes out. When the filmmakers visit Jim, Liz gets into a confrontation with Z, leading to them being trapped back in their room.  After trying to signal a truck that was unknowingly operated by one of Z's henchmen, Davie's aunt is killed, leading to Davie being beat to death after attacking a henchman.

Travis, who was given an injection before the branding, is forced to swing a baseball bat at a [[pinata]] that is unknowingly wrapped around Jim. Liz attempts to kill Z with the bat, but is sedated before she can strike him.  The two are now being kept indefinitely. When the henchman in charge of guarding Travis and Liz gets impatient, Travis beats him to death and steals his gun, shooting a second henchman in the leg. Travis and Liz release the immigrants and save Alberto. When they attempt to start an old truck, Z nearly kills Travis, but he is shot by Alberto before doing so. After escaping, it is shown that the three reached help, and state police raided the compound.

Undisputed III: Redemption
 Years have passed since Yuri Boyka suffered a humiliating defeat and a broken knee at the hands of George "Iceman" Chambers. Humbled by his injury, he has relegated to becoming the prison janitor. Meanwhile, mob boss Gaga has expanded his prison tournament enterprise into an inter-prison tournament called the Prison Spetz Competition (PSC), which gathers the best prison fighters from around the globe to compete for a chance at a cleared record and early release. As Boyka hears the preliminaries taking place within his prison, as well as failing in his parole, he begins training privately to bring his knee back into fighting shape. Just after current champion Vladimir Sykov defeats his opponent in the final round of the prison's tournament, Boyka challenges him on the spot and swiftly defeats him, thus becoming the Russian representative for the PSC.  Boyka is transferred to Gorgon prison in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] where he is joined by a diverse group of eight international prison fighters. Though the fighters are allowed one hour each day for training, they are still grouped into the general population for hard labor while Colombian fighter and local inmate Raul "Dolor" Quiñones is given private sparring sessions and a regimen of performance-enhancing drugs. During his stay, Boyka gets into odds with an American boxer Jericho "Turbo" Jones who is shown to be disrespectful, insubordinate, and a loudmouth.  He also reminds Boyka of Chambers. Boyka, Turbo, Dolor, and Brazilian fighter Andriago Silva advance to the second round of the tournament while the losing fighters are sent home, only to be shot dead by waiting guards.  The next day, Turbo instigates a fight with Boyka before both men are thrown into solitary confinement. They are eventually released due to some manipulations by their managers Gaga and mafia don Gio Farnatti, who are old friends and rivals. Upon hearing of the prison's treatment of their fighters, the two mob bosses confront Warden Kuss, but PSC mastermind Rezo explains to them that the tournament has always been fixed to ensure the "highest profit at the lowest risk". He advises them to liquefy their assets and place their bets on Dolor to ensure their profit. Realizing that the loyalty to their fighters only extend to their payout, Gaga and Farnatti agree to this arrangement. Meanwhile, Boyka and Turbo slowly develop a trust in each other and focus their attention at beating Dolor in the tournament. They both start using the hard labor as part of their training. With Turbo's attitude eroding, he starts showing signs that his ego evolved from a highly disciplined past as a U.S. Marine. In addition to reciting, "[[Culture of the United States Marine Corps|Improvise, Adapt, Overcome]]" as part of his training, he recommends some holistic medicine for Boyka to soothe his knee.  In the semi-finals, Boyka defeats Silva by making him tap out to a [[triangle choke]]; he helps his opponent up and commends him for a good fight. Realizing that Boyka and Turbo are stronger than predicted, Rezo and Warden Kuss arrange to have the guards beat Turbo to a bloody pulp. When the prisoners are taken for the next round of hard labor, Boyka tries to convince Turbo into escaping rather than face Dolor wounded. Knowing that Turbo used to be in the military, the plan is to escape to the forest where the security is lightest and survive long enough to eventually get in touch with the black market. Turbo initially disagrees, until another prisoner reveals that the losers are executed. Caught trying to break their chain, the two fight off the guards long enough to get a key. Freed, Turbo makes a run for the forest.  Boyka is returned to the prison where he is confronted by Rezo, Warden Kuss, and Gaga. Knowing he has lost all support, he commits himself to ruining their wagers by defeating Dolor in the newly improvised final round. Dolor takes an early lead with his exceptionally quick hand blocks and strikes, as well as exacerbating the problems with Boyka's weak knee by using a submission hold on it. Deprived of his kicking ability and agility, Boyka recovers first by relying on his endurance and pain tolerance, persevering past some devastating hits. It looks like the fight is over when he is kicked out of the ring, but when he catches a glimpse of the mop and bucket used for sopping up blood after the bouts, which bears a striking resemblance to the ones he used during his training, he returns into the ring before the ten-count. Remembering Turbo's mantra, "Improvise, Adapt, Overcome," he takes the blood-soaked pad off the mop and ties it around his knee. Forced to adapt, he begins using a new style mixing in elements of grappling, dirty boxing [[Headbutt|head-butts]] and elbows, [[wrestling]], and [[Chinese martial arts|wu-shu]]. Dolor, in a final moment of rage, breaks his shin against Boyka's knee block, ending the match.  Desperate and despondent, Farnatti confronts Warden Kuss and shoots Rezo over the money that he's lost before being shot by the warden himself. Despite winning the tournament, Boyka is not allowed to go free because the guards have not found Turbo. Because Boyka was responsible for his escape, the arrangement is that Turbo will remain free while Boyka will be transferred back to his original prison, to which Boyka responds that he does not care — he has proven his point. Like the other prisoners, Boyka is instead taken out to be shot, but he is rescued at the last minute by Turbo. The duo retreat to a waiting car where Gaga sits inside with a suitcase of money. He reveals that he always knew Boyka was the best fighter in the world, especially when he was angry, so he bet all of his money on him all along and deceived the other managers — even going so far as to rescue and hide Turbo when he escaped. Boyka decides to part ways, finally revealing his first name, Yuri, to Turbo. In turn, Turbo confesses that his real name is "Jericho," not realizing that Boyka has a special appreciation for religious references. In gratitude, he thanks Turbo for "bringing down the walls" and setting him free. Turbo then requests a match with Boyka in future and Boyka accepts. As the car leaves, Boyka happily walks with the money filled briefcase toward freedom laughing joyfully.

Unthinkable
 An American man and former [[Delta Force]] operator, Yusuf (Sheen), makes a videotape. When [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special Agent]] Helen Brody (Moss) and her team see news bulletins looking for Yusuf, they launch an investigation, which is curtailed when they are summoned to a high school, which has been converted into a [[black site]] under military command. They are shown Yusuf's complete tape, where he threatens to detonate three [[Nuclear weapon|nuclear bombs]] in separate U.S. cities if his demands are not met.  A special [[Interrogation|interrogator]], "H" (Samuel L. Jackson), is brought in to force Yusuf to reveal the locations of the nuclear bombs. H quickly shows his capability and cruelty by chopping off one of Yusuf's fingers with a small hatchet. Horrified, Special Agent Brody attempts to put a stop to the measures. Her superiors make it clear that the potentially disastrous consequences necessitate these extreme measures. As the plot unfolds, H escalates his methods (with Brody as the [[Good cop/bad cop#|"good cop"]]). Brody realizes that Yusuf anticipated that he would be tortured. Yusuf then makes his demands: he would like the [[President of the United States]] to announce a cessation of support for [[puppet state|puppet governments]] and [[Dictatorship|dictatorships]] in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] and a withdrawal of American troops from all Muslim countries. The group immediately dismisses the possibility of his demands being met, citing the [[United States]]' declared policy of not negotiating with [[Terrorism|terrorists]].  When Brody accuses Yusuf of faking the bomb threat in order to make a point about the moral character of the United States government, he breaks down and agrees that it was all a ruse. He gives her an address to prove it. They find a room that matches the scene in the video tape and find evidence on the roof. A soldier removes a picture from an electrical switch, which triggers a tremendous [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4]] explosion at a nearby [[shopping mall]] visible from the roof. The explosion kills 53 people. Angry at the senseless deaths, Brody returns to Yusuf and cuts his chest with a [[scalpel]]. Yusuf is unafraid and demands she cut him. He justifies the deaths in the shopping mall, stating that the Americans kill that many people every day. Yusuf says he allowed himself to be caught so he could face his oppressors.  H questions whether Yusuf will reveal the bombs' location unless Yusuf's wife is found. When she is detained, H brings her in front of her husband and threatens to [[Mutilation|mutilate]] her in front of him. Brody and the others begin to take her away from the room in disgust. Out of desperation, H slashes her throat, and she [[Exsanguination|bleeds to death]] in front of Yusuf. Still without cooperation, H tells the soldiers to bring in Yusuf's two children, a young boy and a girl. Outside of Yusuf's hearing, he assures everyone that he will not harm the children. Yusuf's children are brought in, and H makes it clear that he will torture them if the locations of the bombs are not divulged. Yusuf breaks and gives three addresses (in [[New York City|New York]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[Dallas]]), but H does not stop, forcing the others to intervene. Citing the amount of missing nuclear material Yusuf potentially had at his disposal (some 15–18&nbsp;lbs. were reported missing, with about 4½ lbs. needed per device), H insists that Yusuf has not admitted anything about a heretofore-unreferenced ''fourth'' bomb. H points out that everything Yusuf has done so far has been planned meticulously. He knew the torture would most likely break him, and he would have been certain to plant a fourth bomb, just in case.  The purpose of the preceding [[torture]] was not to break Yusuf, but rather to make it clear what would happen to his children if he did not cooperate. The official in charge of the operation demands that H bring Yusuf's children back in for further interrogation. H demands that Brody bring the children back in because her decency will give him the moral approval that he needs to do the "unthinkable". When Brody refuses to retrieve the children for H, he unstraps Yusuf, sarcastically setting him free. The official draws his pistol and aims it at H to coerce him into further interrogation. Yusuf grabs the official's gun. He asks Brody to take care of his children and kills himself. Brody walks out of the building with Yusuf's children.  === Extended version === An FBI [[bomb disposal]] unit arrives at one of the disclosed locations and resets the timer, preventing the bomb from going off. As the FBI is celebrating, however, behind a nearby crate, the originally unconfirmed fourth bomb's timer counts down to zero.  The extended version is NOT on Netflix, making the end vague.  
Unstoppable (2010 film)
 While moving an Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad (AWVR) train pulled by two [[GE AC4400CW|AC4400CW]] locomotives, #777 and #767, at the Veteran AWVR [[Classification yard|trainyard]] in the fictional city of Fuller, Pennsylvania, the two [[railroad engineer]]s, Dewey and Gilleece, take ill-advised shortcuts and accidentally allow the train to leave the rail yard on its own power without the [[Railway air brake|air brakes]] engaged. Initially believing the train to be [[Energy-efficient driving#Coasting or gliding|coasting]], [[yardmaster]] Connie Hooper orders Dewey, Gilleece, and chief [[welder]] Ned Oldham to drive and catch up to the train to stop it. When Oldham finds that the train has already passed where it was supposed to be, they realize that the train is running on full power and now poses a dangerous threat. Dewey and Gilleece manage to catch up to 777 using a high railing truck but fail to board the train in time. Hooper alerts Oscar Galvin, [[Chief operating officer|director of operations]] for AWVR, and also instructs the local and state police and sheriffs to secure all the [[Level crossing|grade crossings]] to prevent injury. Visiting [[Federal Railroad Administration]] safety inspector Scott Werner warns that eight cars being pulled by 777 contain highly toxic and highly flammable molten [[phenol]], which would be a major disaster if the train should crash or [[Derailment|derail]] in a populated area. Triple 7 is also filled with around 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel, which poses another serious threat. News of the runaway train soon becomes a [[media event]].  Hooper suggests they purposely derail the train, but Galvin disagrees and believes they can safely stop the train by lashing it behind two slower-moving [[EMD SD40-2|SD40-2]] diesel locomotives helmed by veteran engineer Judd Stewart, which would slow it down long enough for AWVR employee and former [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] Ryan Scott to descend via helicopter to 777's cab and stop the train manually. Though the lashing initially works, a sudden hard bump as a result of Stewart applying the lash-up’s breaks injures Scott and renders him unconscious. In an attempt to get 777 off the main line, a switch to a [[Siding (rail)|siding]] is throen down the tracks. Stewart is unable to slow down 777 sufficiently enough to take the siding, and the two SD40-2s end up derailing while going into the it, causing them to explode, ultimately killing Stewart in the process. Due to its high speed, 777 goes over the switch without going into the siding or derailing, and continues down the main line. They realize that 777, traveling at its current speed, will certainly derail on "Devil's Curve", a tight, elevated portion of track in the middle of the city of Stanton, and would supposedly crash into a large fuel depot near the curve on the eastern side of the state. Plans are made to purposely derail the train outside the town of Arklow using multiple portable derailers.  Meanwhile, retiring AWVR [[Railroad engineer|engineer]] Frank Barnes and [[conductor (railroad)|conductor]] Will Colson, a new hire looking to turn his life around after an incident with his now estranged wife, are pulling several cars with SD40-2 locomotive #1206 from Stanton. Though originally aware of 777 coasting away from the Fuller train yard, they are ordered at the last minute to pull into a [[RIP track|Repair-In-Place track]], making it just in time as 777 races by and clips the last few cars they are pulling. Barnes observes that the last car on 777 has an open [[railway coupling|coupler]], which means that if they could catch up to the train, they could couple their engine to 777 and use their own brakes to slow the train before it reaches Stanton. As Colson unhitches their cars to give them the best chance of catching up, Barnes reports his plan to Hooper and Galvin and warns them that the derailing idea will not work given 777's momentum. Galvin then threatens to fire Barnes if he continues. Given that AWVR has already given him a forced early retirement notice, Barnes ignores Galvin and sets 1206 on course to catch up with 777. As 777 passes Arklow, police attempt to shoot the fuel shutoff switch on the engine, but fail to hit it. As Barnes predicts, the train barrels through the derailers without slowing down or derailing. Hooper and Werner fully support Barnes's plan and take over control of the situation from Galvin.  Barnes and Colson catch up to 777 and attempt to engage the coupling. Their attempts to connect with 777 cause the seal on the last grain car of the consist to break and leak grain at a blinding rate. Colson then notices the locking pin on the coupler is not engaged. He attempts to kick it in but the pair again hit 1206 and Colson gets his right foot crushed in the process. However, he is able to hold on enough to fully engage the locking pin. Barnes then begins to work his way across 777’s consist to its cab, manually engaging the brakes on the freight cars along the way, while Colson engages 1206's [[Dynamic braking|dynamic brakes]], which initially slow down 777, but would prove to be no match for 777's speed. They are able to reduce the speed slow enough to clear the Stanton Curve without derailing by using the independent brake, but 777 remains out of control and threatens to crash into the Stanton train yard. Despite attempting to reach the locomotive by jumping on the cars, Barnes finds his path blocked to 777's cab, but Oldham arrives in his truck with a police convoy and drives on a road parallel to the tracks. Colson jumps to Oldham's truck, and Oldham drives him up to the front of 777, allowing Colson to get into the cab and engage the brakes. 777 is safely stopped before it reaches the end of the line.  Barnes, Colson, and Oldham are heralded as heroes, with Barnes retiring (with full benefits) and Colson reuniting with his wife and child. Hooper is promoted to Galvin's former position for her leadership, Ryan Scott recovers from his injuries, and Dewey goes to work in the fast food industry, indicating he was fired.

Uninhabited (film)
  [[Marine biology]] student Beth and Harry are a young couple seeking a distinctive holiday trip, and they spend ten days on a deserted and idyllic [[coral island]] on the [[Great Barrier Reef]] in Australia, recording many of their adventures with a camcorder. The first two days manifest that they are not alone and the island has a disturbing history. Haunted by a presence, they find an abandoned grave next to an old shack, the latter which has an old drawing and seven [[tally marks]] inside on the wall. When Beth and Harry sift through their camera, they discover they were filmed sleeping. Alarmed, Beth wants to leave, but Harry intends to stay, believing kids are playing pranks. They sight fishermen on a boat with guns and later realize that the grave has been remodeled, now decorated with [[red coral]], with a wooden cross embedded at the head of the grave that reads "Coral" on it.  The following day, Beth and Harry find severed [[sea cucumbers]] (trepang) hanging from a nearby line. By this episode, they realize they are in trouble and their phone, which they plan to use to call for rescue, goes missing. Searching for the phone, they come across Spiro (Billy Milionis) and Elias (Terry Siourounis), the two lunatic Greek fishermen they had seen the day before. This leads to Beth and Harry being tied up after snooping around their space and boat, accusing them of stealing their phone. Beth is sexually molested, but a female ghost appears and injures one man, as the fishermen flee from the island on their boat, and Harry and Beth manage to free themselves.  The next day, Beth reads an old journal left behind in the shack. She learns the ghost is a girl named Coral (Tasia Zalar), a young island girl who worked for a company, harvesting sea cucumbers in the 1920s. Treading on a venomous [[stone fish]], she became an object of ridicule and was raped by seven men from the company. Ever since her death, her soul seeks vengeance against all men who visit the island. Beth is wrapped up in the story that Harry initially believes to be a hoax, and Beth admits she would do the same as Coral if she was the victim. Realizing they're in grave danger, the next day they plan to create a bonfire in the hopes a rescue team finds them. However, a ringing phone brings Harry alone to the shack and he encounters Coral, who kills him with a knife and hangs his naked body in a tree above her grave. As night falls, Beth finds his hanging corpse dripping blood onto the grave and faints.  The next morning, Beth recovers to find all trace of Harry's body gone&mdash;but one of the graves near the campsite has been filled in. While lighting the bonfire, she sees Coral standing on the reef. She runs in the water towards her, only to step on a stone fish, sending the painful poison running through her legs, as she manages to return to shore. On the tenth day, Jackson comes back to pick up the couple he dropped off, but no one is seen. He goes to enter the shack finding the journal resting on a chair. A menacing Beth confronts and presumably kills him. One of the final scenes show Beth's grave next to Coral's, appearing as if they joined forces.  
The Unjust
  After the rape and murder of 5 elementary schoolgirls, a crime which deeply upsets the entire country, a fleeing suspect is shot and killed by the police. This leads to bad publicity because the guilt of the suspect cannot be proved, and the real attacker may still be at large. Under pressure from the Blue House, a senior police official assigns Choi, a police captain, on a highly sensitive mission, namely to find a former child rapist who can take the blame. Choi, in return, is promised a promotion and the dismissal of an internal investigation against him, which was caused by his brother-in-law receiving money from Jang, a corrupt businessman. Meanwhile, a corrupt prosecutor named Joo cancels the criminal charges, brought about by an investigation lead by Choi, against a corrupt businessman named Kim, who is also Jang's rival in a bid for a construction deal.  Choi searches through several profiles of rapists, and having settled upon Lee, a school-bus driver, he enlists Jang and his henchmen to kid-nap Lee and coach him in how the confession should be delivered. At the same time Jang takes photographs of Kim and Joo playing golf, and has a henchman approach Kim and murder him. The photographs are mailed to Joo to ensure that Jang will never be prosecuted. At the police station, Lee is denied immunity to the death penalty, and as such, reneges on the deal and tells Joo the truth. In response, Jang sends the earlier henchman to suffer arrest and murder Lee from within the jail. This makes Joo furious and he investigates Choi, with the help of a corrupt journalist, finding evidence of his and Jang's partnership. Choi, in response, pleads with Joo not to dismantle his career, and the two agree on a truce.  Meanwhile, Jang, who is tired of being black-mailed by Choi, has saved recordings of Lee's coaching session, and black-mails Choi in return. Choi reacts by murdering Jang using a rigged elevator, and pretends to make peace with Jang's assistant before murdering him as well. However, this incident is seen by Choi's lieutenant, who wrestles with Choi and tries to stop him. During the struggle, Choi accidentally kills his lieutenant, and afterward stabs the dead body with a knife, so that the police will assume that Jang's assistant and the lieutenant killed each other. As Choi receives his promotion and the lieutenant's family mourns, Choi's subordinates become suspicious and privately capture another one of Jang's henchmen, who served as Jang's videographer and who recorded Jang's death and the ensuing fight. Ironically, DNA testing finally succeeds on the body of one of the girls mentioned earlier, and Lee is proved as the real attacker all along. Nonetheless, the subordinates release the video of the coaching to prove Choi's connection with Jang, and what is more, they order Jang's henchman to ambush Choi at a charnel house and murder him in revenge. The final segment shows that they also released the golf photographs, but in spite of the media reporting that charges will be filed, Joo meets with his father-in-law, a senior official who calmly assures him that everything will be alright.

Vanishing on 7th Street
 Paul ([[John Leguizamo]]) is a projectionist in a [[Detroit]] theater who is reading about the 16th century disappearance of the [[Roanoke Colony]] when the lights suddenly go out in the theater. He finds that all the staff and patrons have mysteriously vanished, leaving only their clothes and non-biological parts behind. He comes across a security guard who is holding a flashlight. As Paul had a [[Headlamp (outdoor)|headlamp]] on for his reading they deduce that people holding sources of light are protected against whatever dwells in the darkness. The guard's [[flashlight]] goes out, and he vanishes. As Paul investigates, his headlamp goes out as well.  The following morning, news reporter Luke Ryder ([[Hayden Christensen]]) wakes to find that there is no power in the building. After descending from his apartment, he notices that the doorman is missing and the paper is still the previous day's edition. People have completely vanished from downtown streets, now littered with abandoned cars and pieces of clothing. He heads to the news station to find his girlfriend, and it is later revealed that he discovered a recording which shows his girlfriend vanishing on air when the lights go out. The only thing he is able to recover is her ring. He also found a live video from Chicago where a newscaster tells him that he must always keep a light source on himself at all times.  Three days pass, and Luke is alone trying to scavenge flashlight [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] or other sources of light. He briefly encounters a man who is taken by the darkness, before coming across a bar being powered by a [[backup generator]]. Luke and James have a confrontational first impression, and Luke explains that it is eleven in the morning and still completely dark, implying the sun is no longer providing light in regular intervals. The bartender's young son, James Leary ([[Jacob Latimore]]), allows Luke to enter, followed soon after by another survivor, Rosemary ([[Thandie Newton]]).  Rosemary proves distant due to the trauma of her baby disappearing during the blackout, while James is convinced that his mother is at a church down the street and will soon return. They hear a man outside, and see Paul, who has mysteriously ended up under the lit sign of a bus stop across the road. Luke reluctantly leaves the safety of the bar to recover him and Paul reveals that he had been taken by the darkness, but the headlight that he had on had activated and he had found himself in the street three days later.  Due to Paul's massive concussion, Rosemary says that they need to find a hospital, and Luke suggests going to [[Chicago]], where he saw a recording of a man just before the power went out at the news station three days prior. Paul tells them about the mystery of the Roanoke Colony where over a hundred settlers disappeared overnight, and they seem to be experiencing the same sort of occurrence.  He tells them that the word "CROATOAN" was found carved into a fence post at the site of the empty colony when the next ship arrived. With the generator running down due to extended use, they realize it is only a matter of time before the power goes out on them.  Luke comes up with a plan to take one of the nearly dead trucks on the street and feed power to it with the generator. He and Rosemary leave to obtain one, nearly getting caught in the darkness when the vehicle breaks down and they lose the light. Rosemary hears a baby crying in the dark, ignoring Luke's warnings that it is the darkness trying to trick her, she is lured under a solitary street light, and the lamp goes out taking her with it.  At the bar, James goes to get Paul some water, and the drain on the power causes the lights to flash out. Wearing a glow-stick necklace, James is safe, but Paul vanishes from the pool table on which he is lying.  Luke manages to push a truck back to the bar, and he escapes with James using the generator to get the truck started. As they pass the church up the block, James gets out to find his mother. Luke leaves, but after a conflict of conscience, and seeing the word "CROATOAN" carved into a sign hanging off a bridge, he returns, using the high beams from the truck to fend off the darkness. When Luke gets out of the truck to get James, the car battery dies and Luke too disappears. As James cowers under the glow of candles, which begin to go out, he pleads with the darkness "I exist." and all but one candle goes out.  James wakes to daylight and sees the last candle had been burning all night. A little girl, Briana (Taylor Groothuis), appears and insists that James is sleeping on her bed, but urges him to stay with her. She shows him her flashlight, which is solar powered, allowing it to stay on all night without having to search for new batteries, although James is aware that eventually the sun will no longer provide light and therefore the flashlight will eventually run out of solar power.  As they leave the church, they encounter a police horse eating spilled apples on the ground and decide to take it to Chicago. As the sun sets on the children leaving the city, the camera pans to the bar, casting the shadows of Luke, Paul and Rosemary watching the two leave as the darkness falls. As it gets dark, Briana's light comes on, ensuring their protection against the darkness as they begin their journey.

Villain (2010 film)
 Abandoned by his mother at an early age, Yuichi Shimizu ([[Satoshi Tsumabuki]]) is a young man who lives with and takes care of his grandparents in a decaying fishing village near Nagasaki.  He works as a blue-collar day-labourer and leads a lonely life: his only real interest is his car.  Looking for companionship through online dating sites, Yuichi meets Yoshino Ishibashi ([[Hikari Mitsushima]]) a young insurance saleswoman from Fukuoka.  But it is clear that Yoshino has no respect for Yuichi. she looks down on him, and even demands money for their encounters, which—as she candidly tells her friends—are just about sex.  It becomes apparent that Yoshino keenly feels her own lack of social status (as the daughter of a barber), and has her real sights set on a spoiled rich university student by the name of Keigo Masuo ([[Masaki Okada]]), whom she met in a bar and subsequently pesters with emails.  During a fateful evening when Yoshino has just met Yuichi for one of their regular trysts (and also to collect money from him), she by chance runs into Masuo, and unceremoniously dumps Yuichi (who has driven hours from Nagasaki to see her) with hardly a word spoken.  But, in his turn, Masuo has no respect for Yoshino, whom he feels is beneath him.  He agrees to take her for a drive (and presumably something more), but is increasingly disgusted by her, insults her, and ends up violently throwing her out of his car on an isolated mountain road, leaving her stranded in the middle of the night.  The humiliated Yuichi, however, has secretly followed the couple in his own car, and attempts to come to the aid of the abandoned Yoshino.  But—far from being grateful—Yoshino scorns and abuses Yuichi in much the same way that Masuo has just scorned and abused her.  The abuse turns into ugly threats, a tussle ensues, and in a fit of rage Yuichi stangles Yoshino and then flees.   Since Yoshino had openly bragged to her friends beforehand that she was to meet the rich playboy Masuo that evening (and not her shameful working-class sex partner Yuichi), Masuo becomes the prime suspect in the murder. In a state of silent anguish, Yuichi attempts to go on with his daily life.  The following day, however, Yuichi receives an email. The message is from Mitsuyo Magome ([[Eri Fukatsu]]), a woman from Saga.  Yuichi and Mitsuyo had exchanged emails once before, after meeting through the same online dating site.  Mitsuyo also lives a lonely and mundane life, working at a men's clothing store and living with her younger sister.  Looking for companionship, Mitsuyo decided to re-contact Yuichi several months after their initial correspondence.  Their first encounter is far from romantic—Yuichi is obviously troubled and only interested in sex.  It seems unlikely they will meet again, but some days later he turns up at her place of work to apologise for his behaviour.  In this impossible and doomed situation, a passionate love springs up between Yuichi and Mitsuyo: they run off to a seaside resort town, where Yuichi confesses his crime to her.  By this time, however, Masuo has been cleared of the murder, and evidence has surfaced of Yuichi's involvement—Yuichi is now the wanted criminal: his face appears on the news, and his family are hounded by the media.  Nevertheless, Mitsuyo persuades Yuichi to stay on the run with her and not turn himself in.  This act places a heavy burden on their own families as well as the victim's family.

Virsa
 Virsa is the story of Nawaz Ali and Ranvir Singh Grewal and their families. Nawaz Ali hails from Lahore in Pakistan and Ranvir Singh Grewal belongs to a village, Jakopur, in Punjab, India. About 20 years ago, both of them migrated to Sydney, Australia, in search of work, where they met and became the best of friends. Gradually, their hard work paid off. Ranvir opened an Indian restaurant, which became a runaway success. Nawaz Ali opened a shop opposite Ranvir’s restaurant. It did well and he could manage to lead a comfortable life but he was not as successful as Ranvir.  Nawaz Ali was very grounded in his culture and values and this helped him to remain level-headed and not get carried away by the comforts of life in Australia. He never lost sight of what was morally and ethically right and stood by his Asian values.  On the other hand, Ranvir got carried away by his success. He felt that he was superior to the other Indians and Asians who were not as successful. He found merit in all things associated with the white folks – their lifestyle, their values and culture, their behaviour and mannerisms – and looked down upon his Indian upbringing and values. He had no more use for ethics and morality. He became very conscious of his money, status and reputation.  The difference in outlook and behaviour drive the two friends apart until they reach a point where Ranvir stops talking to Nawaz. However, Nawaz still cares for his friend and tries to keep their friendship alive.  As the film opens, Ranvir and Nawaz are well settled in Australia with their respective families. Nawaz has one son, Amaan Ali and Ranvir has a son, Yuvraj, and a daughter, Meet. Amaan and Yuvraj are roughly the same age and best buddies since childhood, despite the rift between their fathers. However, the difference in the thinkings of the two fathers is reflected in the personalities of their sons. Amaan is a sensible, level-headed young man. He is strongly grounded in and comfortable with his Asian identity. However, he is contemporary in his outlook. He does a fine balance of sticking to his values even as he adapts to the society around him and its mores and traditions.  Yuvraj is the exact opposite of Amaan. Due to Ranvir’s indulgent attitude, Yuvraj grows up to be a rich, spoilt brat. He also feels closer to the white folks than to the Asians around him. He has no idea of Indian culture or values, no ethics and no morals. He loves women, booze, drugs...  Yuvraj’s sister, Meet, is quite like him in her values, upbringing and behaviour. She is going steady with a white young man but is not sure how her father will react to this development. However, she also has a special relationship with Amaan. Nothing is said but she instictively feels that she can always depend on his help, that he will always be there for her. Amaan too feels an instinctive pull towards her but waits for the right time to tell her of his love for her.  Ranvir feels that the people in his village look down upon him because they feel that he is not a good son, since his father, Sardar Joginder Singh, lives here all alone. Sardarji wants to stay in Punjab, till his last breath. Ranvir cons Sardarji into going with him. In Australia, however, things are very different. The cost of living is high and labour is expensive. Ranvir enlists Sardarji’s help for his restaurant. Gradually, Sardarji’s status becomes no more than that of a paid servant.  One night, at a party, Yuvraj meets Mahi. Mahi has come from Punjab to Sydney for her studies. She is a modern-day young Indian woman, contemporary but with a solid foundation in Indian values and culture. She is beautiful, sexy, intelligent and confident. As they fall in love, she tries to reform him and for some time, it seems as though he will sort his life out. But old habits die hard. Yuvraj gradually falls back into his old ways and Mahi is unable to stop him.  Will Ranvir ever see Nawaz’s point of view and will they ever be friends again? Will Sardarji remain a prisoner to his son’s whims or will he rebel against him and return to Punjab? Will Yuvraj ever understand ethics and morality? Will Mahi return to Yuvraj? Will Ranvir accept a white boyfriend for Meet? And Amaan, who loves Meet – will he ever tell her about his love? As Virsa answers these and other questions, it makes a strong statement about remaining true to one’s values, culture and upbringing even as we constantly adapt and adjust to the society around us. It explores ways of addressing the identity conflicts of immigrant Asians in Western societies so that the succeeding generations can benefit from the best facets of both the cultures.

She claims he had only sucked on her breasts. Nicole's father then comes and takes Nicole away from Matt and then pushes Matt into a bush after he breaks up with her. The entire segment on the failed date soon becomes popular on [[YouTube]]. A young woman, Becca, sees the video and claims that she feels bad for Matt. She leaves a video response letting him know she is experienced and would love to be his first. Becca's first requirement for the date is that Matt buys a very expensive suit. Matt is then reminded by Zack that his mother left him a large amount of money and convinces Matt to withdraw it for the suit. Matt then learns that his father withdrew the money when he was younger and the funds are not available. Angered by this, Matt decides to confront his father about it. After doing so, he learns his father has no desire to pay him back and claims the money was used for drugs. The boys and Krysta, Zack and Matt's adopted other adopted sibling, get drunk and camp. During this time Krysta unsuccessfully tries to have sex with Matt. When the boys return home, they come up with a plot to steal the suit, which is successful.  Matt finally meets Becca and she tells him that she has a son. They then plan the date and as she is leaving, hands Matt a note that lets him know he needs to be shaven in all parts of his body including his pubic region. Preparing for the date, Zack ends up shaving Matt's pubic region for him. When Matt arrives at Becca's residence, he is told by Becca the cameras cannot stay and film, and that he must practice sex on a blow-up doll, which has an inflatable penis as well. Instructed by Becca, Matt uses the doll's penis in place of the vagina. Becca then leaves for nearly 3 hours before Matt leaves. The film then shows Becca on a video blog admitting her name is not Becca and that she is actually a graduate student studying male behavior and notes that he waited over twice as long as any other male had in the past. She also admits that her child was not hers, but someone else that she used for her studies. The video of him with the blow up doll becomes a huge YouTube success and ends up leaving Matt ashamed and embarrassed, leading to him staying in his room for two weeks.  In an effort to get Matt out his funk, the boys come up with a plan for Matt to have sex with his favorite porn star, [[Sunny Leone]]. They contact her and she agrees as long as the funds are paid. The boys and others raise the funds and then come up with a plan that Jacob is going into the military to be able to get Matt out of the house. They go to a strip club and meet Sunny and then go out to her bus so Matt may have sex with her. In the bus, Sunny lets Matt know that she has changed her mind and says that he should find someone he loves to have sex with. He then requests to spend five minutes alone with her, which is granted. After a few minutes, Matt emerges from her bedroom and we see Sunny putting her shirt back on. He sucked on her breasts to even out what Nicole did to him. He then finds Nicole at a party, explains what he did, and the two have sex. The boys use the bong to celebrate Matt losing his virginity.

When they arrive, they meet Cody's ex-girlfriend, Michelle, and her younger sister, Megan, who has a crush on Cody.  After the party, Michelle and her husband take leave, which strands Megan at the cabin with Cody, Q, Elroy, and Shade.  Though everyone else has left the party, Megan sees people outside the cabin and tries to get a ride from them.  Having no luck locating the people she saw, she returns to the cabin and finds her sister bloody and near death.  Michelle begs for help and collapses into unconsciousness before they can get any answers from her.  At the same time, the cars and cell phones stop working.  As the others attempt to figure out a plan, Elroy sexually assaults Michelle, but she surprises him by suddenly waking up and responding positively to him.  As they begin to have sex, Michelle bites Elroy hard and tears away a piece of flesh from his neck.  Elroy screams for help and tries to defend himself from Michelle as she tears into him.  The others pull Michelle off Elroy, who is now heavily wounded, and, unsure what to do, they bind Michelle to the bed with tape.  Cody and Megan set off to find help, while Shade attempts to communicate with Michelle, whom she believes is possessed.  During the conversation, Michelle loses control and attacks Shade.  Shade barely escapes, and Q shoots through the door with a rifle.  Michelle hides on the ceiling and attacks Q when he enters the room.  Meanwhile, Cody and Megan discover that their closest neighbor is dead, and his wall is littered with missing persons reports that date back to the 1950s.  They return to the cabin and discover the aftermath of Q's fight with Michelle: Michelle has disappeared, and Q wants to give up on finding her.  Megan is outraged that Q would try to kill her sister, and Cody insists that they stay to help Elroy and find Michelle.  Q and Cody come to blows, and Q leaves alone after failing to persuade Shade to accompany him.  As Q walks down the road, he meets Michelle's dead husband, who is now alive again and talking about hearing strange, beautiful music.  At the same time, Elroy, who is in the cabin, also mentions hearing music.  Elroy and Michelle's husband both explode as their bodies are overcome in a blinding light.  Vernon, Jazz, and Murderball, psychopathic [[greaser (subculture)|greasers]], appear at the cabin, take everyone hostage, and torture them for information.

Outraged, Cody and Q overpower Vernon and shoot him with Q's rifle, but it has no effect.  Murderball kills Q, and Vernon reveals that he knew Michelle's location the whole time; he just wanted to torture them for the fun of it.  Vernon claims to have been hiding in a human body for the past 60 years and to be originally from a void beyond time and space that was the inspiration for human myths about heaven and hell.  After he completes a ritual involving Michelle, Vernon releases Cody and Megan, saying that he likes them and pities their fate.  As Cody and Megan flee to a nearby town, they see the people around them dropping dead, and the sky darkens ominously.

Louis Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other [[Wall Street]] banks but is blocked by Bretton James, head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz (Church), which KZI had refused to help during the [[dot-com bubble]] years earlier. Despondent, Zabel commits suicide by jumping in front of a [[New York City Subway|subway train]]. A distraught Jacob proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts.  Jacob attends a lecture given by Gekko and introduces himself. Gekko tells him that KZI's collapse started when Bretton spread rumors of KZI having [[toxic debt]]. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton for his actions against KZI and for providing evidence against Gekko years ago. In revenge, Jake illegally manipulates the market by spreading rumors about the nationalization of a foreign oil field which Church has invested in. The company loses $120 million, but Bretton gives Jake a job, impressed by his initiative. Jake further impresses Bretton when he convinces Chinese investors to invest in the fusion project through Church.  Jake attends a $10,000-a-seat fundraiser with Winnie, buying a seat for Gekko to facilitate a "chance" meeting. Gekko confronts Bretton about what he did to him and to KZI. Bretton replies that no one cares what Gekko thinks anymore. Gekko also bumps into Bud Fox ([[Charlie Sheen]]), and they discuss their shared experience going to jail. Gekko follows Winnie outside, where she explains why she blames him for everything that went wrong, stemming from his affairs and her brother Rudy's suicide.

Shortly after Winnie informs Jake that she is expecting their first child, Jake learns that Bretton is diverting the Chinese investment into underperforming solar panels, which are not a threat to his large position in fossil fuels.

Gekko proposes using a $100 million trust fund account, which he hid in Switzerland for Winnie in the 1980s, to fund the fusion research. She signs the money over to Jake, not knowing he would entrust it to Gekko to complete the investment. When Gekko betrays them by leaving the country with the money, Winnie breaks up with Jake. Gekko sets up a hugely successful investment company in [[London]], capitalized by the $100 million. Jake visits him to propose a new trade: Winnie gets her money back, and Gekko can participate in his grandchild's life. Gekko refuses.  Jake pieces together all the details of Bretton's dealings, from KZI's collapse through to his unnecessary government bailout of Bretton's company.  He gives the information to Winnie, telling her that revealing it will bring her website publicity and credibility. When Winnie runs the story, Bretton finds himself under intense government scrutiny and is fired by his company's board, who then turn to Gekko's firm for a partnership, which recently posted a $1.1 billion return on investment.

The [[Soviets]], unable to get him to say he is a spy, take his wife into custody; from her they extort a statement condemning him. He is sentenced to 20 years in a [[Gulag]] labour camp deep in [[Siberia]].  There he meets those with whom he later plans an escape: Mr. Smith ([[Ed Harris]]), an [[United States|American]] engineer; Khabarov ([[Mark Strong]]), an actor; Valka ([[Colin Farrell]]), a hardened Russian criminal; Tomasz ([[Alexandru Potocean]]), a Polish artist; Voss ([[Gustaf Skarsgård]]), a Latvian priest; Kazik ([[Sebastian Urzendowsky]]), a Pole suffering from [[night blindness]]; and Zoran ([[Dragoș Bucur]]), a Yugoslav accountant. Khabarov secretly tells Janusz that he is planning to escape south to [[Mongolia]], passing [[Lake Baikal]]. Smith cautions Janusz that it is Khabarov's way to discuss escape plans with newcomers, to maintain his morale, but nothing will come of it. At times Janusz seems to hallucinate the front door of a country home and adjoining window ledge, which holds plants and a rock he attempts to reach for. Janusz follows through with the escape with Smith, Valka, Voss, Tomasz, Zoran and Kazik during a severe snowstorm that covers their tracks.  Kazik freezes to death the second night of the trek, after losing his way back to the campsite while looking for wood, and the group buries him. After many days of travelling across the snows of Siberia, the group reaches [[Lake Baikal]]. There they meet Irena ([[Saoirse Ronan]]), a young Polish girl, who tells them that Russian soldiers murdered her parents and sent her to a [[collective farm]] near [[Warsaw]], where they treated her cruelly, so she escaped. Smith realises the inaccuracies in her story, as Warsaw is [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|occupied by the Germans]]; nevertheless, despite his misgivings that she'll slow them down and tax their meager food supply, he agrees with the group to let her in. Smith eventually cautions her about the lie and says he will not tolerate any more, in response to which she admits that her parents were communists but the communist rulers killed them anyway and sent her to an orphanage.  When the group reaches an unpatrolled border between the Soviet Union and [[Mongolia]], Valka, who idolizes [[Joseph Stalin]] and does not know what he would do elsewhere, decides to stay.

Once there, he anticipates he will be able to connect with the US military, his return to America ensured. The remaining three continue to trek through the [[Himalayas]] and soon reach India.

The Warrior's Way
  In 19th century Asia, Yang ([[Jang Dong-gun]]) is a warrior and member of the Sad Flutes clan, the cruelest assassins in the east. His personal goal to become the greatest swordsman in the entire world is accomplished when he kills the former greatest swordsman in the entire world and leader of the enemy clan. Both clans swore to fight until every single member of the opposing clan was dead. Yang has killed every member, except a baby girl he comes upon, spares and decides to watch over. This act makes Yang a sworn enemy of his own clan, and forces him to flee his homeland.  After making his way to the [[American West]], Yang arrives in Lode, a small, dusty town, where the main attraction used to be a carnival. There he seeks out a fellow rogue warrior friend known to the townsfolk as Smiley. Yang discovers Smiley died 3 years ago, but ran the town's laundry shop. Among the townspeople Yang meets, he is introduced to the gang of friendly carnies led by dwarf Eight-Ball ([[Tony Cox (actor)|Tony Cox]]), Ron ([[Geoffrey Rush]]), the vagrant drunk and Lynne ([[Kate Bosworth]]), a spunky young woman who was friends with Smiley.  Lynne gives Yang the nickname Skinny and agrees to teach him how to do the laundry. Yang begins to enjoy his life in the town, learning to enjoy pleasures he never knew as a warrior. He becomes friendly with the people, a hard worker, and an able gardener, while the baby, dubbed April (Analin Rudd), is adored by all. He even finds an interest in opera, after Lynne shows him a gramophone. Lynne reveals to Yang that Smiley taught her both a little bit of the sword and the Sad Flute clan. She wants Yang to teach her more, and asks about the Sad Flutes' name. He explains that it describes the sound of blood coming from your victim's slit throat, but he is reluctant to show any of his warrior skill. Back in the East, Yang's former clan is shown to be looking for him. His former master Saddest Flute ([[Ti Lung]]) and his warrior army take the same boat to America, killing the entire crew in the process. Saddest Flute states that to find Yang in such a large country, they would wait and listen.  Yang one day sees Lynne place flowers on a grave, and asks Eight-Ball what happened. He explains in a flashback that, years ago, when Lynne was an adolescent girl, the town came under siege by a corrupt Colonel ([[Danny Huston]]). His preference to rape women with healthy teeth prompts him to choose Lynne as his victim while her father is held to the ground, and mother and baby brother forced to stand by. When Lynne is brought to the Colonel in a kitchen, she manages to evade him by throwing a pan of potatoes frying in grease on his face. She runs outside, and the Colonel shoots her in the back. Her father struggles free and is shot dead by the Colonel, while her mother holding her brother runs over and both are also killed.  When the townsfolk buried her family, they found Lynne still breathing. Since then, Lynne has made revenge on the Colonel a priority, aching to learn to fight and kill, and practices throwing knives, at which her aim is lacking. Yang surprises Lynne by showing her that her knife throwing was inhibited by her sight, not her arm, and gives her a successful lesson by blindfolding her. Lynne is clearly fond of Yang, and gives him a charm on a necklace that belonged to her mother, as a present.  Yang shows her his jedok geom (a Korean single-edged sword), but Lynne notes it is welded to its scabbard. Yang explains it is so his past cannot hear the sound of the lives he has taken, and if his past finds him, there will be no more music. In a flashback, it is shown as a young boy, Yang was given a present of a small puppy from his master, and was being trained to become the strongest.  The Colonel returns to the town to terrorize the people. He now wears a frightening face prosthetic to hide the grotesque scar from the hot grease. The Colonel tortures a clown by having his men shoot at a bucket of water on the Clown's head, and is about to have them shoot at a glass of whiskey when Ron the drunk takes the shot glass and drinks it. Ron is dragged through the town by a whip around his neck pulled by horse. The Colonel then inspects a lineup of women for their teeth, and chooses a Hispanic woman whose husband begs for mercy. The Colonel releases the woman to her husband, to only shoot them down simultaneously with a single bullet.   Eight-Ball and the other carnies tie Lynne up in a cellar for her own good as well as the people. Yang removes her blades, agreeing with the carnies. Lynne manages to free herself with a concealed knife in her boot. The Colonel has the Hispanic woman's daughters cleaned to be raped, but Lynne, disguised as a prostitute, offers herself instead. She fools the Colonel, thinking she will be able to kill him when he reveals he recognized her after smelling her neck. The Colonel's men rush in to hold Lynne down to the bed. Back in the laundry, the carnies run in looking for Lynne, and Yang realizes where she is. He grabs an iron and shatters the seal on his sword to free it. Far away, Saddest Flute jerks up from meditation, sensing the seal break, and is aware of Yang's location.  Just as she is about to be raped, Yang bursts in through the window, expertly and easily slaying everyone in the room but Lynne and the Colonel. As Yang turns to kill him, Lynne intercedes that she will do it, but the Colonel grabs her and leaps out the other window, using her to break his fall. The Colonel runs down an alley to escape. Lynne sees him fleeing on a horse and shuts her eyes to deliver an expert knife throw to the back of his head. The townsfolk pull off the prosthetic to reveal a lackey of the Colonel, now especially scared that the Colonel will return with an army of outlaws to kill them all. Yang is about to leave town before the Sad Flutes come for him, but the townsfolk implore him to stay and help.  The people are worried they don't have the means to defend their town, but Eight-Ball has Ron's secret stash of guns and explosives unburied. Ron is shown to be an expert marksman, shooting a bowling pin down amidst his best liquor from hundreds of feet away. Yang asks Ron while preparing why Ron stopped shooting. Ron explains that he was once an outlaw, using his great skill to rob banks and trains. His criminal career ended when the woman he loved was shot during a gunfight, and he vowed to never pick up a gun again, until that day. Ron advises that, for men like him and Yang, the best thing they could do for the ones they loved was stay as far away from them as possible, that they are like flowers while he and Yang are sand. The day before battle, Lynne comes to Yang and asks to leave with him after the fight, and to think on it. Later that night, Yang comes to Lynne's house. He gives her his own twin short swords, explaining these were to kill. Yang tells her to come close.  The day comes and the Colonel arrives with scores of outlaws to charge the town. Yang stands across his flower garden, waiting. As the men approach, they are met with explosions. From far away in the top [[Ferris wheel]] cabin, Ron is sniping sticks of dynamite hidden in the garden as riders come. In the ensuing dust and chaos, Yang rapidly and stealthily disposes of many of the men. The outlaws are lured to the Ferris wheel, where Yang and the carnies ambush them. Ron slides to safety on a cable, and the Ferris wheel is blown up, killing many of the Colonel's men. Thinking it safe, the carnies come out from cover, only to be attacked by the numerous remaining outlaws. The Colonel's men chase the carnies to the center of town, where the Sad Flutes suddenly assemble. Saddest Flute instructs them, 'Kill.' Yang looks to Lynne holding April and tells her to run. The carnies manage to get away before the bloodshed between the outlaw cowboys and clan warriors starts.  Yang runs after Lynne and must cut down several warriors before following her to the laundry shop. Meanwhile, the cowboys in town manage to shoot down some clan warriors, but are engaged in lethal battle. In the laundry, Lynne hands April to Eight-Ball so she can help Yang. While he is killing a warrior, she saves him from another sneaking in. After they are safe for the moment, they hear shots, and run to Eight-Ball, where he is dying and says he couldn't protect April. He dies and the Colonel is seen carrying her in a building, yelling at his men to make sure no one gets in.  The Sad Flutes pursue hotly, and are mostly fended off with a small machine gun, but the outlaws are unable to stop Yang, as he brutally slices through them all. He comes in the room to find the Colonel holding a gun to April's head, and leaps up to cut the barrel and bullet in half mid-firing. Catching April from falling, Yang steps aside to let Lynne fight the Colonel. After a tense battle, Lynne manages to finally drive a sword into the Colonel's back. Yang and Lynne exit the room to find Saddest Flute sitting across the carnage at the end of the hall. He tells Yang that April is the enemy, and asks if he would ever tell April that he killed her parents and her whole clan. He observes that Yang ran away from his old life of killing to kill more. He says Yang does not belong there. Yangs claims he does, or did, and will not kill April. Yang and Saddest flute go to the desert in the sunset, and duel to the death. During the duel, flashbacks show Saddest Flute training Yang as an adult in pouring rain, drilling him through adolescence in the snow, and forcing child Yang to kill the puppy he was given, declaring Yang's biggest enemy would be his heart, and as an assassin, he must kill what he loves. In the present, Yang wins the duel, cutting Saddest Flute's throat.  Lynne tells Yang she knows she won't be coming with him, and tries to hand him April, but he refuses. He makes the baby laugh once more, and gives Lynne a caring look. Yang turns to the sunset, and Ron tells him to 'keep walking, sandman.' Ron narrates that the warrior never stopped walking, to put as much space between him and the little lady he loved as possible, showing April then Lynne. The scene then shifts to a snowy, glacial environment. Opera plays from a small fish shack where a hooded man in a parka sits. Another approaches and asks how much for a fish. The sitting man nimbly kills the other, knives falling out of the latter's hands as he collapses, and answers "free." The sitting man, revealed to be Yang, stands up and goes to his shack, where he takes the pendant he had been given by Lynne, his sword disguised as a snowman's broom, and April's pacifier, and sets the hut on fire. Walking out to the snow, a slew of clan warriors leap out of the snow, and Yang unsheathes his sword as the scene fades.  
The Ward (film)
 In rural [[Oregon]], at the North Bend Psychiatric Hospital in 1966, a young patient named Tammy is killed by an unseen force at night.  Kristen ([[Amber Heard]]), a troubled young woman, sets fire to an abandoned farmhouse and is arrested. The local police take her to North Bend, where she meets the other patients in the ward: the artistic Iris ([[Lyndsy Fonseca]]), the seductive Sarah ([[Danielle Panabaker]]), the wild Emily ([[Mamie Gummer]]), and the child-like Zoey ([[Laura-Leigh]]). Kristen is taken to a room previously occupied by their friend, Tammy. Kristen also meets her therapist, Dr. Stringer ([[Jared Harris]]), and she reveals that she is unable to recall anything about her past. Later, she sees a horribly-deformed figure staring at her in the middle of the night. Kristen is later attacked by the deformed figure, but upon telling the nurse this, she is drugged and put through intense [[electroshock therapy]]. During a session with Dr. Stringer, Iris mentions Tammy but is immediately halted by the doctor.  In a therapy session, Dr. Stringer uses [[hypnotherapy]] to unlock Iris' hidden memories. After the session, Iris is killed by [[transorbital lobotomy]] by the deformed figure. In Iris's sketchbook, Kristen finds a sketch of the figure that had attacked her, with the name ''Alice Hudson'', a former patient at the hospital, written on top. That night, Kristen and Emily attempt to find Iris and escape. However, the alarm is triggered. Kristen is thwarted by Alice, and goes unconscious. She reawakens in her room, and it is revealed that Emily was caught.  Sarah is later electrocuted and killed by Alice. Kristen discovers that all of the girls had killed Alice, led by Tammy, because Alice constantly hurt them. Now Alice is after them for revenge. Emily attempts to commit suicide, thinking she is doomed. Kristen attempts to stop her, but Alice appears and kills Emily by slitting her throat. Kristen plans a last attempt to escape by holding Zoey as a pretend hostage but is drugged and placed in a [[straitjacket]]. However, she escapes it and takes Zoey with her to try and get out. Zoey is captured by Alice and killed off-screen. After a lengthy chase around the hospital, Kristen seemingly manages to destroy Alice. She finds Alice Hudson's patient file in Dr. Stringer's office, which details her treatments and each one of the girls' names, including Kristen herself.  Dr. Stringer, catching Kristen in his office, then reveals that Kristen is actually one of many personalities of the real Alice Hudson. Alice was kidnapped at eleven years old eight years previous. She was left chained up for two months in the basement of the same farmhouse Kristen had burned down; in order to survive the trauma, she developed [[multiple personality disorder]], creating each one of the girls from the Ward as a different personality. Over time, Alice's own personality became so overwhelmed by the others that she became lost. Dr. Stringer attempted experimental techniques to bring Alice's own personality back, resulting in the manifestation of Alice, that was destroying the individual personalities. He explains that her treatments were working until "Kristen" appeared, yet another invention of Alice's mind to protect itself from reliving the trauma at the farmhouse.  Alice's parents come to take her home because she is finally fully treated. Before leaving, Alice takes one last look around her room. Just then, Kristen suddenly comes out and attacks her. The camera cuts to black.

He meets up with Ella, Xandrie's friend who was with her at the party, but got separated from her and doesn't know where she is.   Darren gets no answer from Zack and instead follows Jonathan. He denies Darren an answer and is beaten up by him as a result. Darren tracks Xandrie's home address and visits her, but she doesn't answer her door. Xandrie eventually shows up at school and discovers her reputation is destroyed by false rumors surrounding her disappearance. Karenn threatens her, saying how the majority are more likely to believe their story than hers due to Zack's wealth and reputation. Darren decides to find out what really happened to her and hacks into Jonathan's laptop. He is sick to discover a footage of Xandrie's assault. At school, Darren finds Xandrie and tries to help her, but she refuses and tells him she passed out when it happened and has no concrete evidence. Zack pays Xandrie a visit and warns her about divulging the truth, as it could affect their chances of graduating.   Xandrie and Darren soon reconcile. Brook convinces Zack that Darren knows the truth and might discredit them both. Zack has Brook corner him before beating him up. Bloodied, he is taken outside by Brook and Jonathan while Xandrie shows up with a gun, contemplating about killing Zack. He tells her that shooting him won't change a thing -- they will still believe his story more than hers. Despaired, Xandrie shoots herself instead.  To secure his reputation, Zack soon throws another party. Filled with angst, Darren shows up at the party and makes Simone feel guilty about Xandrie's suicide, and convinces her to drug Zack's drink. Darren also spreads the footage of Xandrie's assault to everyone in the party through their phones. Brook finds out about this and confronts Darren, who hits him in the head with a bottle. The partygoers question Zack about the truth and he blames it on Brook and Jonathan, who overhear him outside. Soon, the drug in his drink takes effect. He follows Darren (whom he sees as Xandrie) in the basement, where he passes out. He wakes up bound in one of two seats before a device Darren had engineered. Darren tells him that the partygoers will decide which one of them should die via their phones, as they are seen on the televisions around the house, placing a gun on the device, which will shoot one of them depending on the votes. He sits beside Zack in one of the seats, and the gun later shoots.  Darren is later shown swimming in a pool at some kind of a facility.

We Are What We Are (2010 film)
 In the opening scene, Dad dies on the sidewalk at a local shopping mall. At home, his family is wondering what has become of him. Dad is a watchmaker who repairs watches at the local street market, and the family's sole means of support.  As Dad has not appeared for the day's work, Alfredo and Julián head to the market. Julián gets into a fight with a customer who claims that his watch is three weeks overdue. The woman who runs the market appears and tells the boys to get out; the rent for their booth at the market is three weeks in arrears.  When the boys arrive at home, their sister Sabina enters in a state of shock and announces that their father has died. Their mother, Patricia, locks herself in her room; the children wonder who is going to provide for the family now—specifically, their meals: this family performs cannibalistic rituals.  In a local morgue, Tito the coroner and the director of the funeral home bring in Octavio and Owen, two police detectives. The coroner shows them a finger in a jar: it was pulled from Dad's stomach. The detectives are asked to solve this cold case. Initially, they resist, but as the film continues, they become more interested in the fame that will come with solving it.  Alfredo and Julián attempt to kidnap a homeless child from under a local bridge, but are chased off by the other children. Next, they attempt to kidnap a prostitute, who also resists; Julián punches and stuffs her into the back seat of their car.  Back at home, the boys tie the prostitute to the kitchen table. Patricia comes in and beats the woman to death with a shovel, claiming that Alfredo doesn't know what he's doing, and that prostitutes are not appropriate for the ritual. Alfredo runs out while Julián and Sabina wrap the dead woman in a sheet. Julián and Patricia take the prostitute back to the corner where the boys picked her up and dump her in front of the other street workers. Patricia tells the women to leave her sons alone. The prostitutes report the incident to detectives Octavio and Owen.  Alfredo goes looking for another potential meal; he finds one in a gay bar. Alfredo brings the young man home with him, but Julián says he won't eat a homosexual. As Alfredo and Julián argue the point, an older man comes down from their mother's room. Alfredo's prey escapes while Patricia beats the older man over the head with a shovel and the family later kills him.  As Sabina and Patricia prepare the man for eating, Alfredo and Julián chase after the gay boy. The boy runs to a fast food stand and asks the police to protect him. Detectives Octavio and Owen hear the call over their police radio and head to the scene. They decline to call for backup, as they want to keep the glory of the collar for themselves.  Detective Octavio stops Alfredo and Julián in an alley, but is shot by a beat cop who mistakes Octavio for one of the cannibals. Detective Owen discovers Sabina and Patricia preparing their meal in a ritualistic fashion, but the women kill him. Alfredo and Julián arrive home; Patricia insists on completing the ritual, but Alfredo drags her away to escape over the rooftops.  The police break into the family's home and Julián shoots several of them before the family manages to hide upstairs. Their mother says that one must survive to carry on the ritual and flees to the rooftop. The prostitutes earlier in the film see her escaping and pursue her.  Meanwhile, Alfredo bites Sabina's neck. Julián, thinking Alfredo's attempting to eat Sabina, shoots Alfredo. The police kill Julián and take Sabina away in an ambulance, believing that she is a surviving victim. The next morning Patricia's body is discovered in a playground, beaten to death.  At the end of the film, Sabina escapes from the hospital and is seen watching a young man in the local market, intent on her next meal.

She flees, but a police officer, Tom, chases after her and eventually catches up with her on a bridge. After a short conversation, he tries to arrest her, but Lena hits him in the face, kicks him between the legs and jumps off the bridge onto a passing boat.  Later that evening, Lena goes to a nightclub, which is run by Louise. Inside the club, Louise dances with Lena and offers her a drink. When Lena goes to the bathroom, Louise follows and bites her. The terrified Lena runs home. When she awakes in the morning, the sun burns her and she craves blood. Lena returns to the club to confront Louise about what has happened. She meets Louise's two companions, the stoic Charlotte and the cheerful Nora.

The women enter the compound and kills the pimps but fail to notice one mobster hiding in fear. Before leaving, Nora steals one of the mobster's [[Lamborghini]].  When Lena awakes at the hotel, Louise gives her a glass of what appears to be blood. As Lena drinks, she feels her strength return. Louise bathes Lena and tells her the story of how she was changed. At first she hated her maker, but grew to love her after traveling throughout Europe and getting to know all the benefits of the immortal life. After her maker was killed by sunlight, Louise wanted to commit [[suicide]] to join her, but instead began searching for a new companion. As Lena bathes, her short hair grows and returns to its natural color, her piercing falls out and she loses all bruises and wounds (including a tattoo on her belly).

The next night when Lena returns home to pick up some belongings, she is met by Tom, who used a file on Lena to find her home address. The two have coffee and talk, but when Lena suddenly sees Louise approaching, she uses her Lamborghini to retreat to the nightclub. She finds Charlotte in a private room where Charlotte tells Lena that she was a [[silent movie]] actress in the 1920s and that she had a husband and daughter. Louise enters the room and asks Lena why she is acting different. Lena lies that she misses the sun, so Louise takes the girls to [[Tropical Islands Resort]] that has artificial sunlight allowing them to have a pool party "in the sun". Two night watchmen find the girls and Nora convinces the men to join them in the pool. Lena is concerned they are going to harm them, but Louise gives Lena her word they will not hurt the men. However, Nora quickly kills off one of them, but the other tries to escape. Charlotte sadisticly kills this man and Lena flees the scene in terror.  Tom and his partner, Lummer, interrogate the surviving mobster who says that the devil killed his friends and stole his Lamborghini. Tom realizes that the stolen car is the car he saw Lena drive. The [[Spezialeinsatzkommando|SEK (German SWAT unit)]] is invades the hotel and in the chaos, Nora dies when she is exposed to the sun.   The three remaining women escapes and hide at the abandoned [[Teufelsberg]] and prepare to flee to Russia. Before leaving, Charlotte demands to see her elderly daughter, whom Charlotte sings a lullaby to as she dies. With a whole day before their departure to Russia the girls return to their hideout to perform their morning ritual. As the sun rises, Charlotte locks Lena and Louise inside and [[suicide|allows the sun to kill her]].  Lena goes to Tom to say good bye and forces him to shoot her and the wound heals in front of his eyes to show her true nature. Lena begins to cry while Tom holds her and they fall asleep. Lummer, who has suspected Tom of having some involvement with the women since the hotel attack, has the SEK incarcerate them. Louise goes to the watchmen while they're in the shower and kills them. Louise ask Lena through an intercom how she would manage to live with a man destined to die, herself knowing the pain of losing a loved one. Louise kidnaps Tom and Lena follows her. At Teufelsberg, Louise wants Lena to tell her, "I love you". Lena does so and Louise says that that's the most beautiful lie she's ever heard and shoots Tom. Louise and Lena have a fight and Lena throws Louise into the sunlight, where she dies with a peaceful smile. Lena runs to Tom and wants to bite him, but stops, kisses him and begins to cry.  At the end the SEK arrives with Lummer. Lena and Tom are gone with no trace other than Louise's gun. Lummer looks outside and whispers ''Good luck'' and walks away from the scene.  
Welcome to the Rileys

Because of her grief, Lois has become a cold and distant [[agoraphobia|agoraphobic]]. Doug begins an affair with Vivian, a younger local waitress. However, Lois manages to maintain her appearance and the presentation of her home despite never leaving and inviting no guests aside from her sister, Harriet. She has even already had headstones put next to their daughter's for them both and made funeral plans.  One morning, Doug is informed that Vivian has died, and he travels to [[New Orleans]] on a business trip to clear his head. Instead, however, he ends up in a [[strip club]] where he meets 16-year-old [[stripper]], Mallory ([[Kristen Stewart]]). He politely turns down her offer for a private dance and refuses any sexual contact, but instead accompanies her home and makes an unusual proposition: if Mallory will allow him to stay in her run-down house long enough to straighten himself out, he will pay her $100 a day for her trouble. For Mallory, who isn't used to getting money for doing nothing, it seems like a great deal. She accepts and Doug phones home to tell Lois he won't be coming home for a while. She tells him that she knew about his affair with Vivian but before the conversation can go any further, she hangs up.  As time passes, Doug and Mallory settle into an unconventional kind of domesticity, and he becomes more of a father figure for her than anything else including teaching her how to make a bed properly and taking care of her money. Meanwhile, back home, Lois realizes that she'll have to act fast in order to save her marriage, even if that means venturing outside for the first time in nearly a decade. After a couple of attempts, Lois manages to start up her car and get on the freeway heading south.  One night, Doug gets a call from Mallory who is in trouble after being robbed of the money she carries around by a client. He goes to pick her up and after arguing about how stupid she's being, he makes her realise that she needs to make some changes before things get worse. The following morning, Lois arrives in town and calls Doug to let him know, who is stunned that she not only left the house but drove all the way instead of flying. He immediately goes to meet her and they embrace one another for the first time in years. On the drive back, he tells her about Mallory (whose real name is Alison) and what she does for a living, which Lois instantly disapproves of. She is shocked to learn how young and foul-mouthed Mallory is. However, like Doug, Lois quickly warms to her due to her striking similarities to Emily.  Before long, Lois has also moved into Mallory's home and the three start to form an unconventional family. Lois helps her out with female problems and takes her shopping to buy suitable underwear, making her feel like a mother again, which she enjoys dearly. But later on when Lois attempts to steer Mallory from the path of self-destruction, the young girl flees. Mallory is then later arrested for an altercation with a client, and Doug and Lois rush to be by her side, but shortly after they bail her out, she runs again. In that moment, Doug and Lois realize they cannot use Mallory as a substitute for their daughter and return home to [[Indianapolis]].  A few days later, Doug receives a phone call from Mallory in Houston. She looks cleaned up and healthier, and announces her plans about moving to Las Vegas, just before boarding the bus. Doug tells her that he and Lois will always be there for her.

Welcome to the Space Show
 ''Welcome to the Space Show'', whose story "surpasses ''[[Star Wars]]'' in its scale" according to its producers, tells of the four adventures of five schoolmates and an alien dog in space during summer vacation.<ref name="ANN1"></ref>  The plot revolves around five elementary school kids on their "school trip". In the process of looking for their missing class pet (a rabbit named Pyon-Kichi), the children rescue a dog they find injured in a corn field. The dog turns out to be an alien called Pochi Rickman, and he invites them to visit the moon as a reward for helping him. However, through a series of strange events, they become stranded and must make their way across the galaxy to get to Pochi's homeworld, Wan, so that they may return to Earth. Along the way they are pursued by the aliens responsible for Pochi being injured in the first place. The aliens work for the host (called Neppo) of the universe's most popular entertainment, "The Space Show", which appears to be a variety act broadcast from a mysterious moving spaceship.  Neppo is bent on using the power of the ship, called the Pet Star, to become a god. However, the ship requires a particular power source to run; namely a substance called Zughan, which turns out to be a close relative of the wasabi root. As Natsuki is carrying some of the root with them in her bag, Neppo has thus targeted the group. When his thugs fail to retrieve the bag, Neppo goes himself; arriving just as the children and Pochi reach Wan. The Pet Star's tractor beams steal the bag, but they also take Amane as well.  This leads to a show down at an interstellar festival, where with the help of friends they've made along the way, the children manage not only to defeat Neppo and rescue Amane but also save the entire universe. The children are then able to return home (along with Pyon-Kichi, who had been kidnapped by Neppo's henchmen as well) and arrive at the school just before their parents show up to retrieve them.  
West Is West (2010 film)
 The film is set in the year 1976, five years after the original film ''East Is East''. Little is known about most of the Khan children, except that they seldom communicate with their parents. Tariq is now a [[hippie]] (looking like [[George Harrison]]) who runs a new age shop with older brother Nazir and has an English girlfriend who is unaware of her true ethnicity, and Maneer is living with his extended family in [[Pakistan]] where he is searching for a suitable wife. Sajid, the youngest, who no longer wears a [[parka]], is a truant who is constantly bullied due to his Pakistani background, although the headmaster—a former British soldier who had served in the [[Punjab]]—is sympathetic and encourages him to embrace his heritage. After Sajid is caught [[shoplifting]], his father George, who has somewhat retained his bullying nature, attacks him at home. When Sajid retaliates by calling him a "dirty [[List of ethnic slurs#Paki|Paki]] bastard", a devastated George states all of his other children in England have become British and he cannot lose Sajid as well, so he decides to take him to Pakistan to meet his extended family and show him that life there is better, though Ella openly disapproves.  On arriving in Pakistan, George and Sajid are greeted by a few of George's relatives including Tavnir, a lazy man who often tries to swindle George—and is his [[son-in-law]] through his marriage to one of George's daughters with his first wife Basheera. On the family farm, George is reunited with Basheera and their daughters, whom he had abandoned thirty years before, and hands out gifts to all, then tells them that he has come for a month to find Maneer a wife, but he soon discovers that no family will offer their daughter in marriage as they fear that Maneer will leave his wife for an English woman as his father George did when he left Basheera for Ella. Furious, George blames his family in England, but Maneer reminds him that he himself is at fault, and Basheera is also angry with George for abandoning her when she needed him.  When Tavnir explains to Sajid that he will not tolerate any trouble, he is abruptly told to "fuck off". Sajid is taken to the local school for enrolment, where he meets spiritual teacher Pir Naseem and local boy Zaid who Sajid loathes at first and refuses to enrol. Zaid, who can speak basic [[English language|English]] as he is being taught by Pir Naseem, advises him, and the two soon become friends. Zaid teaches him Pakistani ways and Pir Naseem promises George that he will discipline his son when he misbehaves.

What Men Talk About
 What Men Talk About? Of course, women. But also about work, money, cars, football ... but in general about women. And if they have two days when they escape from their offices and families, to get away from all the cares and commitments – two days, eventful and adventurous – you can be sure that this time they will have time to discuss a lot of things ... And More. From these conversations – we know for sure – many women learn about themselves a lot of new things.  Four friends are going to go to Odessa for the concert of a famous Russian band ‘B-2’. Two of them, Alexey and Sasha, have problems in the morning: one can not deal with things around the house, the other – cannot get rid of the annoying customers at work. When, finally, they join their other friends who already left, Camille and Slava, they begin to talk about all sorts of things. Thus, the first day on the road passes. They spend the night in a hotel village ‘Beldyazhki’.  The next day, the heroes continue to talk about life, passing through Kiev, where they buy paintings by Tishchenko and at the same time discussing modern art. By the end of the movie 4 men get into a car accident, but still make it in time for the concert.  "What Men Talk About" – this is the third, and by far, the best film of the cult theater "Quartet". Four middle-aged friends receive an invitation from their friend in Odessa to come to him for his birthday, and at the same time attend a concert of a famous Russian group "B-2". Each of them, like all of us, has a difficulty with time. One has work, the second – has his wife and children, the third – has both work and family, but still, with great a difficulty, they manage to escape for a few days. They sit in the car and go to the long journey. On the road, they have many adventures, many of which can knock a person out of a rut. But when you have people next to you with whom you can talk about everything, all the hardships of life become insignificant ... And real men are known to have a lot of different topics for discussion. Work, parties, money, music, clubs, and of course – women. If a man is still single, he is concerned about the issue – whether to get married. And married ones concern whether they can cheat on their wife.  
The Western Front (film)
 Based on the 2004 experience of Zachary Iscol, a US Marine who fought in Al Anbar, Iraq's most violent province. There, the inevitable result of violence was always more violence, until the Marine Corps eventually learned the unforgiving paradox of counterinsurgency-that killing is how you make enemies, not defeat them, and that peace is predicated upon working with former enemies. Zach returns to the province, now considered a counterinsurgency model, to confront the awful dilemmas he faced fighting an enemy that hid among civilians. The Western Front explores these dilemmas from all sides to reveal the harsh impact we had on our enemies, our allies, civilians, and our soldiers. Shot on location in Iraq, Iscol fuses haunting personal war stories with larger issues and makes for an affecting behind-the-scenes look at the challenges of war from a soldier's perspective.<ref>https://tribecafilm.com/filmguide/archive/512d0ace1c7d76e046002ddb-western-front</ref>  
When in Rome (2010 film)
 Successful and single Beth ([[Kristen Bell]]), an art curator at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]], is at a point in her life where love seems like a luxury she can't afford. Waiting for the "perfect" romance has embittered her. After flying to Rome to attend her younger sister Joan's ([[Alexis Dziena]]) impulsive wedding, she meets Nicholas Beamon ([[Josh Duhamel]]). He rescues her in a couple of difficult situations but they are both clumsy. Still, they hit it off.  As Beth comes to believe in love again, she sees Nick kissing another woman, who turns out to be the groom's ([[Luca Calvani]]) "crazy cousin." Slightly drunk and jealous at seeing Nick with another woman, she picks up coins (a [[poker chip]], a rare coin, a penny, a trick quarter and a [[Euro]]) from the "fountain of love" (probably based on the [[Trevi Fountain]]). Joan tells her that legend says if you take coins from the fountain, the owner of the coin will fall in love with you.  Beth is pursued back in [[New York City]] by a band of aggressive suitors whose coins she gathered, including a diminutive sausage magnate Al ([[Danny DeVito]]), lanky street [[illusionist]] Lance ([[Jon Heder]]), a doting painter Antonio ([[Will Arnett]]), and a narcissistic male model Gale ([[Dax Shepard]]). She must return the coins to the fountain to break the spell. As she falls in love with Nick, she realizes that the poker chip belongs to him and is convinced that he is under a spell, not truly in love with her.  Joan calls Beth on the day of a gala and tells her that the spell can also be broken by returning the coins to the original owner. Stacey ([[Kate Micucci]]), Beth's secretary, concerned about her, overhears the conversation and steals the coins. She believes that Beth would lead a better life with people loving her, regardless of the spell.  When Beth's suitors all show up together at her apartment, she tells them she does not love them and plans to return their coins. She also tells them of her love for Nick, but realizes that Stacey has stolen the coins. She sets off to retrieve the coins, aided by her suitors. All pile into a yellow [[Vespa 400]] microcar, which careens through city traffic, into the Guggenheim and up an elevator.  Stacey returns the coins and Beth gives them back to their respective owners. Left with the poker chip, she calls Nick and thanks him for making her believe in love again. Nick makes his way to the gala to search for Beth in a sudden lightning storm that hits New York. There he happens to pick up his poker chip, dropped by Beth, and convinces her his love was true.  On Beth and Nick's wedding day in Rome, Lance tells her he had several poker chips, and Nick did not break out of the spell. While exchanging wedding vows, Beth hesitates and dashes out of the church. She revisits the fountain and wades in again. Nick appears and joins her in the fountain. He said he had never thrown a chip in. He drops a poker chip in the water, and the priest is heard yelling, "Free of temptation!" Beth finally believes Nick and kisses him.  
The Whistleblower
 [[Kathryn Bolkovac]] is a police officer from [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], who accepts an offer to work with the [[UN Police|United Nations International Police]] in post-war [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] for a UK company, Democra Security (a pseudonym for [[DynCorp International]]).<ref name="Lynch"/> After successfully advocating for a Muslim woman who experienced domestic abuse, Kathryn is appointed head of the department of gender affairs.  Raya, a young [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] woman, and her friend Luba are sold to a Bosnian sex-trafficking ring by a relative. Raya escapes with Irka, another girl forced into prostitution, and they are sent to a women's shelter for victims of [[human trafficking]]. While investigating their case, Kathryn uncovers a large-scale [[sexual slavery]] ring utilized by international personnel (including Americans). She persuades Raya and Irka to testify against their traffickers in court, guaranteeing their safety; however, an indifferent UN official drops Irka at the border between Bosnia and Serbia when she cannot produce a passport. A corrupt peacekeeper tips off the traffickers, and Raya is recaptured and tortured. Although rescued from the woods by Kathryn, Irka is too afraid to proceed with the trial.  When she brings the scandal to the attention of the UN, Kathryn discovers that it has been covered up to protect lucrative [[Defense contractor|defense]] and security contracts. However, she finds allies in her investigation: [[Madeleine Rees]], head of the Human Rights Commission, and internal-affairs specialist Peter Ward. When Raya is found dead, Kathryn sends an email to fifty senior mission personnel detailing her findings; she is then fired from her job. She and Ward acquire evidence of an official admitting the scandal before she is forced to leave the country, and she brings it to the [[BBC News]]. The final credits note that after Kathryn's departure, a number of peacekeepers were sent home (although none faced criminal charges because of immunity laws), and the U.S. continues doing business with private contractors such as Democra Security (including billion-dollar contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan).

Wild Target
 Victor Maynard ([[Bill Nighy]]) is an experienced and efficient assassin living a [[Recluse|lonely life]] in accordance with his family's business. Victor follows a family line of professional assassins, and he completes his assignments quickly and without remorse. One afternoon, after killing one of his targets, he hesitates in killing the pet parrot, Roger, and instead takes him as a gift to his mother, Louisa ([[Eileen Atkins]]) an intimidating woman who was, until recently, also Victor's housemate. In celebration of his 55th birthday, she gives him a leather bound book with newspaper clippings of each of his kills from his first to his most recent, leaving pages for future hits to be included. She also expresses concern that he might be homosexual, wondering why he hasn't produced a successor.  Rose ([[Emily Blunt]]) is a not-so-average girl with a talent for thievery. Her most recent theft involves the sale of a fake [[Rembrandt]] painting (painted by her friend in the Restoration Department of the [[National Gallery]]) to Ferguson ([[Rupert Everett]]), managing to swindle him out of £900,000. Ferguson soon discovers the swap and hires the best hitman, Victor Maynard, to dispose of her. Victor takes the case and immediately tracks Rose down, missing several opportunities to kill her, and accidentally killing a random stall customer in a changing room. He follows her to a balcony opposite her hotel room and tries to shoot her through the window, but is interrupted by the arrival of the front doorman. Victor sets up a microphone and headset to keep her under surveillance, but falls asleep, unable to listen to their noisy lovemaking. He wakes the following morning, just as she is leaving. He has the opportunity to shoot but pauses.  His mother, Louisa, is disappointed by this missed target (and has apparently killed Roger with a knitting needle) and suggests that Victor apologize to his employer and offer to do the hit for free. He tracks Rose down in a parking garage where he sees another hitman ready to kill her. He takes the preemptive shot, killing the other assassin. He and Rose get into her car, only to be forced out again by Mike ([[Gregor Fisher]]), another assassin hiding in the back seat of her [[Mini]]. Mike throws Victor's gun away and lines them up on the wall to be shot and killed, but instead is wounded by Tony ([[Rupert Grint]]), an apparently [[Homelessness|homeless]] young man who had picked up the dead man's gun. Saying it was his first time handling a firearm, he impresses Victor enough to consider a [[protégé]]. But he sends Tony home and Victor and Rose flee.  Mike starts firing at them and they nearly run over Tony on his way out of the garage, forcing him to join the ride. Rose offers Victor his price of £30,000 a week for her protection, believing that he is merely a private detective. They travel to a luxury hotel where they can lay low, but by chance get a room on the same floor as Ferguson. Ferguson hires Dixon ([[Martin Freeman]]), reputed to be second only to Maynard in proficiency, to kill Rose and Maynard. After several close calls, Mike, who is also Ferguson's bodyguard, discovers their whereabouts when he spots a pair of boots that Rose had stolen from his dead partner. Tony is ambushed in the bathroom and nearly drowned in the bathtub by Mike, but he turns the tables and accidentally shoots Mike's ear off before the three of them escape the hotel. Ferguson and Mike pursue them in a high-speed chase through the streets of [[Central London|London]] until Mike loses control and crashes the car, sending the pair to the hospital.   They travel to Maynard's home, an exclusive farm deep in the countryside, where his furniture is [[Shrink wrap|shrink-wrapped]] and his cat, Snowy, resides with him. Maynard takes Tony on as his apprentice in "private detective" work. One night (after a sensual foot-massage between Victor and Rose), Rose is attacked by Louisa (Victor's mother), who had come back to the house to finish what her son had started. He eventually talks her down and after she leaves, the three of them work on becoming friends. Rose and Tony help Victor celebrate his birthday, and, after a brief period of sexual confusion between Tony and Maynard, Victor falls in love with and sleeps with Rose. Afterwards, his attitude becomes more friendly, and Victor peels off the plastic coverings on all of his furniture and opens up the house. Meanwhile, Rose looks around Victor's room, finding the leather book that his mother had given him and learning that she was actually his target for assassination. She also finds Victor's father's first gun, a [[Broomhandle Mauser]], and steals it for protection. She runs out of the house after making it clear that she trusts neither Victor nor Tony, and returns to the National Gallery, only to find her friend dead and Dixon and his assistant, Fabian ([[Geoff Bell (actor)|Geoff Bell]]), waiting for her. They quickly return to Victor's home, and Tony and Victor gain the upper hand when Louisa appears, killing Fabian with a machine gun. Dixon withdraws the old gun Rose had taken from Victor's room and fires at Victor. It backfires, sending the bolt into his skull. Victor, Tony and Rose bury the pair in the back yard and return to their lives.  Three years later, Victor and Rose are married with a son named Angel and Tony has moved in with them. While Angel is playing one morning, Tony comes outside asking Victor and Rose where the cat had gone off to. They look at Angel in awe as he is innocently patting soft dirt into the yard, suggesting he killed and buried the cat. Victor smiles with pride.  
Why Did I Get Married Too?
 The four couples prepare for their next marriage retreat in the Bahamas. Sheila and her new husband, Troy, are the first to arrive, followed (in order) by Patricia and Gavin, Terry and Dianne, and Angela and Marcus. The men and the women separate to talk about the good and bad about their marriages. In a surprising twist, Sheila's ex-husband, Mike, arrives, and Angela immediately starts a fight until he leaves the women alone to go see the guys.  That night, he talks about his and Sheila's relationship, which angers Troy. Dianne accidentally calls Terry "Phil" in the course of conversation. Angela is insistent about getting the password to Marcus' cell phone because she distrusts him, but Marcus distracts her using sex. Dianne and Terry hear arguing later and think it's Angela and Marcus, but it turns out to be Patricia and Gavin. When Dianne goes to investigate, she finds Patricia but cannot get her to tell her what's wrong. The next morning, Sheila makes it clear that, though Mike says he misses her, she is completely over him. At the beach, the women meet an elderly couple who have accidentally thrown a friend's ashes on Angela. Sheila invites them to dinner and they accept. At the "Why Did I Get Married?" ceremony, Patricia announces to the group that she and Gavin are getting a divorce, causing a distraught and angered Gavin to walk away from her, because he did not know she was going to announce it to them.  Back in Atlanta, Gavin and his lawyer meet Patricia with her lawyer, Dianne. Patricia and Gavin have decided to split everything down the middle in the settlement, but Gavin reveals that Patricia has not offered up the account containing her $850,000 book revenue. Patricia refuses to give Gavin any of her book money, but as she leaves, Gavin advises Dianne to tell Patricia to "prepare for a fight", as he intends to get half of that account as well. Meanwhile, Angela's neighbor tells her she's been hearing sexual noises from the house when Angela is not home. Angela believes Marcus is cheating and confronts him live on his television show, who then gives her his cell phone and password. Gavin comes home very drunk and confronts Patricia. He takes their son's baby photos and taunts her about her perceived lack of emotions, even about their divorce and their son's death, and then assaults her, douses her in vodka, then burns the photos.  Elsewhere, at Sheila's request, Mike agrees to help find Troy a job. Angela lectures Dianne and Sheila about how all men cheat. Patricia changes the locks and catches Gavin, Terry, and Marcus moving Gavin's things out, then learns Gavin has taken all their money, including her book money; enraged, Patricia trashes the house with his golf clubs. Angela comes home early to catch Marcus cheating and finds a couple in her bed, but after shooting up the room, she notices it was just the gardener and the maid having sex. Terry finally confronts Dianne about her infidelity; she reveals that she has been having an emotional affair and begs for forgiveness. Marcus and Angela fight, then reconcile, but only to fight again after Angela discovers Marcus has another phone. Troy arrives at Mike's apartment after finding out Mike got him his police job. After finding Sheila there, he angrily attacks Mike. Sheila tearfully confesses that she has been taking Mike to chemotherapy; she tries to apologize for being dishonest, but he leaves her.  The women go to Patricia's house to comfort her; they soon realize that they are ruining their marriages and lives with their constant selfishness, lies, dishonesty and inconsideration. The next day, Troy, himself, apologizes to Mike for the incident, who forgives him and invites Troy to have a drink with him and the guys, beginning a new friendship. Mike tells the men to fix their marriages because life is too short. The following day, Gavin finds himself humiliated at his job, harassed, and told off by an angry Patricia; to make matters worst, he is then struck and gravely injured by an oncoming truck. While the others wait to hear the status of his condition, a tearful and regretful Patricia instructs the wives to fix their marriages (such as Mike suggested to the husbands), and everyone makes up. Gavin's doctor shows up and informs them that he has died. The couples decided to have a memorial service for Gavin in the Bahamas.  One year later, as Patricia exits a university building she is approached by a colleague. She tells Patricia that she knows someone who wants to meet her, a philanthropist, but Patricia refuses. The professor goes on to tell her that she can at least say hi because the university needs funds. The man (Dwayne Johnson) tells her that her books have helped in his grieving process (divorce) and invites her to have coffee. The movie ends with Patricia smiling at him.  
Winter's Bone
 Seventeen-year-old Ree Dolly looks after her mentally ill mother, twelve-year-old brother Sonny and six-year-old sister Ashlee in the rural [[Ozarks]] of [[Missouri]]. She makes sure her siblings eat and teaches them basic survival skills like hunting and cooking. The family is destitute. Ree's father, Jessup, has not been home for a long time; his whereabouts are unknown. He is out on bail following an arrest for manufacturing [[methamphetamine|"crank"]].  Sheriff Baskin tells Ree that if her father does not appear for his court date, they will lose the house because it was put up as part of his [[Bail bond|bond]]. Ree sets out to find her father. She starts with her meth-addicted uncle Teardrop and continues to more distant kin, eventually trying to talk to the local [[crime boss]], Thump Milton. Milton refuses to see her; the only information Ree comes up with are warnings to leave the situation alone and stories that Jessup died in a meth lab fire or skipped town to avoid the trial.  When Jessup fails to appear for the trial, the [[Bail bondsman|bondsman]] comes looking for him and tells Ree that she has about a week before the house and land are seized. Ree tells him that Jessup must be dead, because "Dollys don't run." He tells her that she must provide proof that her father is dead to avoid the bond being forfeited.  Ree tries to go see Milton again and is severely beaten by the women of his family. Teardrop shows up and rescues Ree, promising her attackers that she will not say anything or cause more trouble. Teardrop tells Ree that her father was killed because he was going to inform on other meth cookers, but he does not know who killed him. He warns her that if she ever finds out who did, she must not tell him, implying that, if he found out, he would go and kill that person.  A few nights later, the same Milton women who beat Ree come to her house and offer to take her to "[her] daddy's bones." The women place a burlap sack on her head and drive her to a pond, where they row to the shallow area where her father's submerged body lies. They tell Ree to reach into the water and grasp her father's hands so they can cut them off with a chainsaw; the severed arms will serve as proof of death for the authorities. Ree takes the hands to the sheriff, telling him that someone flung them onto the porch of her house.  The bondsman gives Ree the cash portion of the bond, which was put up by an anonymous associate of Jessup. Ree tries to give Jessup's banjo to Teardrop, but he tells her to keep it at the house for him. As he is leaving, he tells her that he now knows who killed her father. Ree reassures Sonny and Ashlee that she will never leave them. As the three of them are sitting on the stairs of the porch, Ashlee goes and gets the banjo and starts to play - showing a natural affinity for it.  
Wild Things: Foursome
  Carson Wheetly is the wealthy and spoiled 20-year-old son of millionaire NASCAR car racer Ted Wheetly. Carson hates his father who he thinks might have murdered his mother one year earlier in order to inherit her money. Carson finds himself tangled up in a game of seduction, greed and murder after a raunchy night (a foursome) with three beautiful women: his girlfriend Rachel Thomas, her school friend Brandi Cox and Linda Dobson during a party.  A few days later, Ted dies during a race and the police get involved when Detective Frank Walker investigates Ted's death which happened under questionable circumstances. Ted's lawyer, George Stuben suddenly announces during the reading of the will that Carson cannot inherit Ted's money and estate until he turns 30 or marries. Carson quickly gets married to Rachel, and inherits. Carson and Rachel decide to kill the two other women and keep all the money for themselves. However, Rachel, along with Brandi, are also plotting to kill Carson so that Rachel can inherit as a grieving widow and split the money between them.  One evening, Rachel and Brandi lure Carson to a cheap motel in the Everglades with the intention of sex, and after a struggle, Brandi does murder Carson by shooting him in the head and leaves a forged suicide note implying the Carson killed himself. Rachel then inherits Carson's money, but rather than split the money, Rachel plots to murder Brandi to keep all the money for herself. Brandi, anticipating that Rachel might do just that, plots a scheme of her own to kill Rachel.  Brandi lures Rachel to an old cabin in the nearby swamps with the intention of sex. Rachel and Brandi, both try to kill each other, and though Brandi gets the upper hand, they get discovered. They are both arrested and are separately interrogated by Detective Walker, who reveals that he knows that both grew up together and plotted to find a man to marry and then murder so they can inherent a fortune. Brandi incriminates Rachel by revealing hidden video CDs that show that both Carson and Rachel tampered with Ted Wheetley's car on order to cause his death, as well as Rachel's blood-stained blouse from the motel, which suggests that Rachel murdered Carson all by herself. Rachel is arrested and sent to prison while Brandi gets away scot-free.  After closing the case, Detective Walker retires and joins Brandi on a motor launch boat, revealing himself to be a corrupt cop who helped Brandi incriminate Rachel for Carson's murder so he could get a share of the Wheetly money. However at sea, Brandi double-crosses Walker by stabbing him to death and throwing his body overboard. She then flees to the Caribbean to claim all of the money for herself.  As with the previous three ''Wild Things'' films, the movie closes with a series of scenes over the end credits revealing the truth behind the crime. It turns out that Ted Wheetly's shy, nebbish lawyer, George, was in fact the mastermind behind the whole scheme. George is actually a career con artist who, for many years, impersonated a lawyer who plotted to steal all of the Wheetly family's money, totaling $155 million. George approached Brandi, (who held a grudge against the Wheetly family) to help him, and Brandi then approached Rachel. Rachel and Brandi then manipulated Carson into believing that Ted murdered his mother so they could get his assistance. Brandi then pretended to bring rape charges against Carson during a party in order to blackmail him into marrying Rachel, and to get a share of Ted's money. George worked behind the scenes the whole time by changing the nature of Ted's will, as well as by planting evidence for Detective Walker to find. Brandi was the one who learned that Walker was corrupt and could by swayed by the offer of money. After killing Walker, Brandi meets with George at a Caribbean island. George empties all of his shell accounts to bring the money into his personal Cayman Islands account. George then betrays Brandi by planting a bomb in a motorboat that Brandi pilots away, and it explodes, killing Brandi. It is also implied that George had Rachel murdered in prison and set it up to look like a suicide. In the final shot, George walks off with all of the $155 million with his co-conspirator Linda Dobson, who happens to be his wife.

Identifying herself as the fiancée of  his brother Ben, she asks him to return home to help locate Ben who has disappeared. At first refusing, Lawrence changes his mind and returns to his family's estate in Blackmoor where he has an uneasy reunion with his estranged father, Sir John. Unfortunately, Lawrence has arrived just after Ben's mutilated body was discovered in a ditch near their home. At the local pub, Lawrence overhears the locals discussing the killing. It was thought to be a wild animal, but many blame Gypsies who are camped outside the town, while another patron claims there was a similar murder several decades earlier, and a werewolf was the suspected killer. Lawrence has [[Flashback (psychology)|flashbacks]] as he tours his family's home where his mother, Solana, committed suicide when he was a boy. Lawrence saw his father standing over her dead body; afterwards he was sent to an insane asylum in [[London]] having  suffered from [[delusions]] connected to the event.  Lawrence visits the Gypsies during a full moon. The local townspeople raid the camp to confiscate a [[dancing bear]] they believe is the killer, but a werewolf attacks the camp, and bites Lawrence in the neck before being chased away by local hunters. A Gypsy woman named Maleva sutures his neck wounds, but her daughter insists the now cursed Lawrence should be killed before he destroys other lives. Maleva refuses, saying he is still a man and that only a loved one can release him.  Lawrence recovers unnaturally quickly, and develops heightened vitality and senses. His father's servant Singh shows Lawrence a set of silver bullets and implies that something monstrous is loose in Blackmoor. [[Frederick Abberline|Inspector Aberline]] arrives to investigate the recent killings, and suspects Lawrence is responsible based on his mental history and portrayals of mentally-ill characters. Fearing for Gwen, Lawrence sends her away. He follows his father to his mother's [[crypt]], where Sir John locks himself in a room alone as he gives a cryptic warning to Lawrence. Lawrence undergoes a painful transformation into the Wolfman before running off into the woods and killing the hunters stationed there.  The next morning, Aberline and the police arrest the now human Lawrence. Taken to the same asylum he was committed to as a child, Lawrence is subjected to torturous treatments overseen by Dr. Hoenneger. Sir John visits Lawrence and explains that many years before while hunting in [[British Raj|India]], he was bitten by a feral boy infected with [[lycanthropy]]. Lawrence realizes his father, as a werewolf, killed his mother and his brother. Knowing that Lawrence would never be believed, Sir John confesses that this is true before leaving his son at the asylum permanently.  By nightfall, Dr. Hoenneger conducts an evening lecture with Lawrence as a case study, and assures Lawrence that he is only a werewolf in his imagination, seeking to prove it by putting him on display during the full moon. As moonlight streams through the window, Lawrence transforms into the Wolfman and goes on a rampage throughout the lecture hall and London, with Aberline in pursuit. The next day, the now human Lawrence visits Gwen's antique shop for help. They realize they are falling in love and share a passionate kiss. Aberline arrives and searches the shop, but Lawrence has already escaped to Blackmoor.  Lawrence arrives at Talbot Hall and finds Singh's mutilated body. He loads a gun with Singh's silver bullets, but when he attempts to shoot his father, he learns that Sir John had removed the powder from the cartridges years ago. The Talbots fight, transforming into werewolves when the full moon rises and setting Talbot Hall on fire. Lawrence kills his father as Gwen and Aberline arrive. Aberline attempts to shoot the Wolfman, but Gwen disrupts the shot. Attempting to physically confront Lawrence, Aberline is bitten.  The Wolfman pursues Gwen and traps her above a gorge. She pleads with Lawrence, whose consciousness recognizes her. As he hesitates, the hunters approach, distracting the Wolfman long enough for Gwen to shoot him. Lawrence reverts to human form, thanks Gwen for setting him free and dies in her arms. Aberline arrives with the hunters, but as he looks at the moon, he realizes his inevitable fate. As Talbot Hall burns, a howl is heard in the distance.  
Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos
 The film starts off with the funeral of a man named Panos. A very rich and handsome young man called Mihalis thinks he inherits all Panos' possessions but Panos has left all his estate to someone else. Soon after the funeral, cousin Tzimis rings Steve Karamitsis to announce he has inherited a beach worth 2.5 million euros, a tavern and a small house on the Greek resort island of [[Mykonos]] from his uncle Panos that he had never met. Steve watches his friend Tony the Yugoslav as he gets arrested in his father's shop for theft and drugs, losing the shop and his Beloved '69 [[Valiant Pacer]]. Steve and his old friend Frank who has lost his wife and his mistress fly together to Mykonos. Cousin Tzimis picks up the two friends from the airport and brings Steve up to speed with local customs and habits. Tzimis and his Spartan wife Voula are managing the tavern Steve has inherited. Steve finds out that to get his inheritance, he must pay 1.1 million euros in tax because he is not an immediate descendant of Panos. Steve does not have that much money. The two friends settle in Panos' home and discover Panos' old car, a rare 1964 [[Pontiac Catalina]] and a [[Kri kri]] goat called Apollo. Later Tony shows up, having managed to escape from the Australian authorities and calling himself Tony the Cretan, thinking that [[Crete]] is not a part of [[Greece]]. Two German environmentalists, Otto and Dieter, are after the goat Apollo claiming it is a rare species. Steve falls for Zoe, a beautiful down-to-earth singer who owns half of a local night club called "the Seven Sins". The other half is owned by Mihalis who is engaged to Zoe. Frank gets into a nasty bet with Pierluigi ([[Kevin Sorbo]]), who is called the King of Mykonos because he had sex with 43 women in one month, "a record that will never be broken" as Tzimis says. The bet is to seduce Enza ([[Cosima Coppola]]), a strikingly beautiful but distant and snob Italian girl. As the story progresses, it is revealed that no one is who it seems to be. Pierluigi is not Italian but an American and has a secret agenda, Mihalis has ulterior motive for taking over the beach, Steve is not as 'wog' as he thinks he is, Frank is not as successful with women, Zoe has a tragic past and is blackmailed by Mihalis, Enza is not snob after all and Panos was actually Steve's biological father. Steve fails to find hard evidence to prove Panos is his father. Mihalis steps in and claims the inheritance for himself, declaring that he can pay up for taxes. He intends to sell the beach. Steve then enters a rally competition with Mihalis trying to take the inheritance. Tony gets the parts needed for Steve to repair the Pontiac and race against Mihalis' [[Porsche 997]]. The two Germans interrupt the rally and reveal that they have discovered an ancient coin of great archaeological significance at Steve's beach, but Apollo swallowed it. If the coin is retrieved and delivered to the authorities, the beach becomes an archaeological site and cannot be exploited or sold. Mihalis and Steve abandon the race, search for and fight over the coin. At the last moment, Zoe steps in and delivers documents proving Panos was Steve's biological father. Steve gets the inheritance and gives up the beach to become a historical site named "Apollo" after the goat, Zoe is finally free from Mihalis' grasp and the film ends with the people of the island singing "[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]" by [[Men at Work]].

A love story is then told between two children, Rebecca and Tommy, who swear each other eternal love. When Rebecca departs suddenly for Japan with her mother, the two are separated. Twelve years later, Rebecca returns as a young woman to find that Tommy (Matt Smith) not only remembers her, but still cares deeply for her. The two begin a new relationship.  Tommy is a political activist fighting against the [[biotechnology|biotech]] corporations, who plan to open a new natural park populated by animals artificially created by [[cloning]]. Tommy plans to spoil the inauguration ceremony by letting loose rucksacks filled with cockroaches. Rebecca, herself a computer programmer of leak detection sonar software for underground storage containers, insists on accompanying Tommy.  Driving to the site of the new natural park through a lonely wilderness, Rebecca asks Tommy to stop the car so that she can relieve herself at the side of the road. Meantime, Tommy leaves the car and is struck and killed suddenly by a passing vehicle.  Rebecca and Tommy's parents are stricken with grief. Rebecca wants to use new scientific advancements to have Tommy cloned and thereby bring him back to life. She offers to be impregnated using Tommy's DNA. Though Tommy's mother objects, his father agrees to give Rebecca Tommy's cell material, but urges her to think through her decision carefully before proceeding. Rebecca, however, continues and gives birth to a new Tommy by [[Caesarean section]].  Tommy is now raised as Rebecca's son, and the two have a close relationship. Rebecca presents to him a [[pleo]], an artificial living animal created using new biotechnology. Tommy and his playmates observe a neighbourhood girl and try to determine if she has a "copy smell" as the girl is a clone. The neighbourhood mothers display prejudice against "copies", expecting Rebecca to not let Tommy associate with them. Rebecca, though horrified, agrees in order not to isolate her son. Eventually rumours about Tommy spread, and Tommy is forced to celebrate his birthday alone with his mother, his playmates all being barred from attending by their mothers.  Rebecca moves to a more remote location with Tommy. Tommy begins to ask questions about his father, wanting to know how his father died. He buries the pleo<ref name=rodos>[http://www.rodosnightlife.com/en2/movie/womb-2010-film-trailer-plot-cast-poster Womb trailer] </ref> his mother gave him for his birthday while out playing with his friend. His mother finds out and gives him back the pleo,<ref name=rodos/> which is now no longer working.  Years later, Tommy has grown as old as his original was when he died. As a result, he starts to manifest certain personality traits and interests of the original Tommy (such as his interests in biology). He is now the adult son of still-youthful Rebecca. When Tommy brings a girlfriend, Monica, home to stay with them Rebecca behaves jealously, to both Tommy's and Monica's bewilderment. Tommy struggles with what appears to be sexual tension [[Oedipus complex|between himself and his mother]]. The original Tommy's mother, now an old woman, arrives unexpectedly and stares silently at Tommy, who feels he recognizes the stranger. Frightened and frustrated by Rebecca's lack of explanation, Tommy lashes out at Rebecca, ignoring Monica, who quickly departs.  An angry Tommy demands answers from his mother, Rebecca, who gives him original Tommy's old laptop with pictures of himself and his real mother and father (the former he met earlier). Tommy, out of confusion and sexual tension, initiates sex with Rebecca. From the blood on her hand, it is implied he took her virginity in the process. The next day Tommy packs his things, then addresses Rebecca by her first name (and not as "Mom") and thanks her for the life he's had and then leaves.  The pregnant Rebecca, from the film's first scene, is carrying Tommy's child.

The family's French maid leaves after a dispute, so Suzanne goes to a church where the priest finds jobs for Spanish immigrants.

The apartment is a mess after days without a maid and Concepción gets some of her Spanish friends to rally round and clean it up, to the surprise and delight of Suzanne. When Suzanne wants some furniture moved up to a little room on the 6th floor that they use for storage, Jean-Louis discovers that the other little rooms there, all unheated, are occupied by Spanish maids, including their María. There is only one cold water tap on the landing for them to wash themselves and one [[Turkish toilet]] that is forever getting blocked. He calls a plumber to fix the toilet and says that María can use their own bathroom. He also lets another maid come in to use their phone for an urgent call home.  Though he has been struck by María since first seeing her, he becomes a friend to the other women too and starts learning about Spanish language, life and culture.

He goes to their church on Sundays, a new experience for him, and takes some of them in his car for a pilgrimage to [[Basilica of St. Thérèse, Lisieux|Lisieux]].  Concepción is now worried that María will again fall for a man who will not marry her and, to stop any affair between the two, tells María where in Spain the son of her previous relationship now is. María immediately tells Suzanne she is leaving to return to Spain and, going upstairs in an emotional state, lets Jean-Louis take her into his room and kiss her. She spends the night with him and next day disappears to Spain. He is very hurt, not only because she did not tell him but also because all the other women he thought his friends were silent too.  Three years later, Jean-Louis drives to Spain looking for Concepción. When he tracks her down, she claims she does not know where María is. However her husband, who recognises what Jean-Louis is feeling, secretly tells him.

The plot thickens when Marni's mother Gail ([[Jamie Lee Curtis]]) meets up with Joanna's aunt Ramona ([[Sigourney Weaver]]), Gail's former best friend who pushed her into a [[Swimming pool|pool]] at their senior prom. Ramona is now a successful, wealthy woman who owns several hotels and a private plane.  Although Gail seems willing to put the past behind her, she still feels the need to "outdo" Ramona during their interactions together. On the other hand, Marni is unwilling to forget the things Joanna did to her in high school, unless she apologizes, and decides to try to let her brother know of Joanna's bullying past. Her attempts to get Will alone for a conversation fail. When Marni tells Joanna that she knows who she really is, it is obvious that Joanna remembers Marni. She refuses to give Marni a meaningful [[Remorse|apology]], and treats her disrespectfully, leaving Marni convinced that Joanna has not changed. Meanwhile, Gail comes to Ramona's hotel room for "closure" about anything bad between them that happened in the past. They appear to make up, but Ramona still seems not to be too fond of Gail.  One day on the street, Will and Marni's grandmother Bunny ([[Betty White]]) meet a man named Tim ([[Kyle Bornheimer]]). Joanna reveals that they have dated, and Tim appears devastated when he hears that she's marrying Will. Marni decides to bring Tim to the rehearsal dinner as part of her plan to stop the wedding. When it is time for guests to make a toast to the bride and groom, Tim unexpectedly jumps up to give his toast to Joanna. He reveals to a stunned wedding party that Joanna left him at the altar. Later, a video is presented (recovered by Marni) from their old high school [[time capsule]]. The video reveals Joanna confessing who she was in high school: an [[Alpha male|alpha-female]] bully, with the footage showing proof of her tormenting Marni and other students. As the video is showing her ruining Will's basketball game; Will unplugs the video projector before the video is complete and walks out, furious.  Marni is in trouble when everyone discovers that she was responsible for the video at the rehearsal dinner. Joanna's defense for pretending not to remember Marni is: "I thought we could start over." Marni is now convinced that Joanna hasn't changed, and walks away. Joanna then starts a fight with Marni, who fights back. Will walks in and witnesses the fight. He confronts Joanna, calling her a bully and a liar and then scolds Marni for starting the mess behind his back. Joanna tries to reason with Will but he doesn't care about her past and is furious that she lied to him. He calls off the wedding, much to her devastation.  Ramona and Gail argue after the rehearsal dinner, and Ramona accuses Gail of trying to ruin her life throughout high school. A [[catfight|fight]] ensued, with both of them falling into the pool. Ramona reveals that she had a grudge with Gail, even when they were best friends, because she always competed with and outdid her, culminating with Gail taking the boy that Ramona wanted to the prom. Ramona stated that Gail was already a legendary head cheerleader and prom queen, and drama was supposed to be hers, yet Gail also defeated her with the auditions. She sarcastically thanks Gail for what she did, because it motivated her to become successful in life. Gail apologizes for being insensitive, but reveals that she is proud of Ramona, and that her family is her true accomplishment. Ramona, remorseful of her actions, reveals that she was just jealous of Gail's happy family especially that her marriages didn't work out, and feared that Gail was trying to take Joanna away from her. The two are hugging in the pool when Gail's husband, Mark ([[Victor Garber]]), shows up. At home, he says that he is disgusted with the wedding and weekend being a disaster and grounds Marni and Gail, despite protest.  Later that night, Marni finds Joanna in the kitchen wearing her wedding dress, crying and binging on junk food. She finally admits to Marni that she feels truly awful for bullying and tormenting her and feels like a terrible person, and that she loves Will and his entire family. She explained that after her parents died, she decided to reinvent herself as someone they could be proud of, and when she found out that Marni was her fiancé's sister, she panicked and decided to pretend not to remember her, because she had spent so much time distancing herself from the person she was in high school that she didn't know how to apologize to her. Marni forgives her and promises to get them back together. Marni apologizes to Will for her actions, saying she was only trying to protect him.  Joanna and Will reconcile in the family's old tree house, but it collapses and injures both of them. Marni and Will's little brother, Ben ([[Billy Unger]]), loosened the screws as a part of his plan in hiding the tree house because Will was going to move it as a wedding present. They are both forced to stay at a hospital, which delays the wedding. However, Marni puts together a makeshift wedding at the hospital, with the bride and groom bandaged, but properly dressed and able to walk down the aisle. Gail has a surprise for Ramona, it's Richie Phillips ([[Patrick Duffy]]), the boy from high school that Ramona wanted to go to the prom with. Richie welcomes Ramona home and wants to be her date for the wedding, which makes Ramona very happy and they appear to start a relationship. Marni appears to start a relationship with Charlie ([[Sean Wing]]), her brother's best friend who has always been kind to her. Joanna introduces Marni's grandmother Bunny to an elderly woman, Helen Sullivan ([[Cloris Leachman]]). Unfortunately Helen and Bunny were rivals in high school when Helen stole a boy from her. Bunny gets her revenge when she cuts in on Helen's dance and takes her partner.  At the [[wedding reception]], Marni presents her wedding gift to Will and Joanna—[[Hall & Oates]] in person performing Will and Joanna's favorite and special song, "Kiss on My List" (as the movie's couples, each share kisses—Will and Joanna, Marni and Charlie, Gail and Mark, Ramona and Richie, and Georgia forces a kiss from Tim). Everyone then joins Hall & Oates on stage.

YellowBrickRoad
 In 1940 the entire town of Friar, 572 people, abandoned their town and walked into the wilderness with only the clothes on their backs after a viewing of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', a film with which the entire town was obsessed. No one has ever been able to explain why they did this. Only 300 of the townspeople's bodies were recovered: some had frozen to death in the elements, while others were killed in horrific and bloody ways. The remaining 272 citizens were never found, and the government designated the trail that the townspeople took as classified. Despite this, the town was eventually repopulated, although the townspeople are cautious of the town's history.   In the present day, the trail's coordinates have been declassified, and a film crew has arrived to travel the trail to learn about the disappearances and deaths, as well as what lies at the end of the trail. Crew leader Teddy found the trail's coordinates via Friar's cinema. The crew befriends Liv, a townsperson who works at the local cinema, and she agrees to accompany them on their trip.   The journey goes well initially, but soon the crew is terrorized by loud and jarring music that appears to come out of nowhere. Then crew member Daryl brutally murders his sister Erin and flees in the only vehicle, which also contains their food supply.  Desperate, the crew begins to argue and turn on one another. Several of the group's members kill themselves, either out of despair caused by abandonment or because they have been driven mad by the music and associated events. Daryl returns and murders Teddy's wife Melissa, before being killed himself by Liv. A weary and visibly shaken Teddy crawls to the final portion of the trail, where the music finally stops. He finds himself at what appears to be the cinema from the beginning of the film. There, he meets a sinister Usher, who forces him to sit in a theater empty except for a brief glimpse of smiling theatergoers implied to be the spirits of the dead townspeople. On the screen is footage of his wife, who has been transported by the Usher into a hellish landscape. Horrified, Teddy begins to scream but is cut off.  
Yes or No (film)
  Pie comes from an upper middle class Thai family that adheres to traditional thought and customs, including the very vocal disapproval of homosexuality.  Kim, on the other hand, carries herself with  deliberate masculinity that defies convention and intimidates Pie upon first encounter, so much so that she immediately requests a roommate change which the college promptly denies.  Pie is reluctant to converse or interact with her roommate so she takes tape and  draws boundaries in the room to separate her space from Kim’s to avoid as much contact as possible. On the first day of class, Kim by chance meets Jane, who is seen still crying after her breakup. Kim offers her a handkerchief and Jane immediately gets smitten by her. Later that week, Jane walks into Pie and Kim's room and is embarrassed and shocked to see Kim. She immediately walks out, then comes back in and drags Pie out in the hallway. Jane confesses that Kim is the girl she has fallen for and uses Pie to get an introduction and thus begins her chase for Kim.  Despite how hard Pie tries to ignore or discourage Kim, the two begin to intermingle when Kim cooks and shares with Pie and the two have a short conversation together. One day Kim receives a package from her father's worker and is told to deliver to Aunt In.

Under pressure from the media campaign managers and in an attempt to please the monitory vote banks, the ideologies behind the parties are sacrificed, leaving the purists and youth betrayed.  Amongst the betrayed are also the youth who break away to establish themselves from under the shadow of the older leadership, only to find that their good work left aside when it is time for an election ticket allotment.

Following her death, Zatoichi ([[Shingo Katori]]) returns to his hometown, where he hopes to resume a normal life under the guise of farmer with his friend Ryuji ([[Takashi Sorimachi]]). However, the same group of yakuza plan to change Ichi's hometown into a harbor, and start exploiting local peasants for money. Ryuji's land deeds are taken and ransomed at a high price, so Ichi uses his gambling skills to win the money for the deeds. This unveils his identity as the infamous Zato Ichi which the Yakuza don't like and burn down the house. The villagers draft a Tanran scroll to present to a passing official asking for assistance. However having Zato Ichi, a wanted criminal, in the village would not work in their favor so they devise a plan to dispose of him. They give him a blank scroll to "deliver" to the officials and lead him on a dangerous path sending the yakuza after him. However, he realizes it is the wrong path and makes it to the officials. His betrayal is revealed when he shows the blank scroll to the officials and they are insulted and leave. Ichi takes the responsibility of getting rid of the yakuza on himself, going to the yakuza headquarters and killing the boss. However he is shot by Toraji and stabbed by one of the Yakuza minions. Crawling on hands and feet he goes to the beach where he presumably dies reuniting with his wife in the next life.

On September 25, 2003, Iranian-American girl Frida Abbas (Janette Armand) has returned to Port Gamble, her home town after dropping out of [[Princeton University]]. She runs into her neighbor, Joe Miller at a gas station with his wife, Judy, and their teenage son, Brian.  Meanwhile, couple Tom Hunt (Doug Fahl) and Lance Murphy (Cooper Hopkins) arrive in Port Gamble to tell Tom's mother that he is gay. While Tom and Lance explore the town, many island residents appear to have been zombified, including a [[police officer]].  Frida arrives at her house and finds her dad, Ali, praying. Frida sneaks out of the house with her boyfriend, Derek (Ryan Barret).  Tom and Lance are having dinner with Tom's mom, who reveals that she was bitten earlier by a bystander at the store. She goes into the kitchen to prepare dessert and Tom admits that he is gay while his mom becomes a zombie and tries to attack Lance. The TV news reveals that Port Gamble is experiencing a bio-terrorism attack, which turns its victims into zombies.  While Frida and Derek are outside, Derek's face is horrifically ripped off and eaten by a zombie. Ali leaves the house to look for his daughter, while Frida escapes from a group of zombies to her abandoned and surrounded house. Frida and Judy hide in the basement with Brian and Joe; Judy is bitten by a zombie while helping Frida inside. Joe sees that a terrorist claiming responsibility for the outbreak is wearing the same necklace as Frida. He ties Frida to a chair and asks her questions about U.S. history.  Tom and Lance find Mrs. Banks. They run into the local church where Reverend Haggis (Bill Johns), Mayor Burton, Larry, a married couple, a local senior woman, and another churchgoer are playing bingo. They begin to board the windows.  Back in the basement, Joe nails Frida's foot to the ground and begins to move a flame from a blow torch towards her face when Brian smashes a hole in his father's head with a hammer. Brian is able to lift the nail out of Frida's foot just before he is attacked and eaten by the zombified Judy. The wounded Joe watches in disbelief as his wife devours Brian.   As Mayor Burton starts to show obvious signs of infection, Mrs. Banks suggests quarantining him in a room, which causes Mayor Burton to rebel against her. Tom and Lance lecture Mayor Burton, which makes Reverend Haggis decide to turn Lance and Tom into straights by drugging them and making them watch gay "erotic" films. Larry and the married couple go downstairs to assist Haggis in the process, locking themselves in the basement. Mayor Burton reanimates into a zombie and bites the senior woman's jaw off, leaving Mrs. Banks alone with the zombie. As Lance is being drugged, Tom threatens the group with Larry's gun and forces them to let Mrs. Banks in. Mayor Burton enters with her. Larry and the couple quickly run out of the church with Tom, Lance, and Mrs. Banks following while Reverend Haggis attempts to talk to Burton, but is beaten half to death using his own torn-off arm.  Frida makes it home to her father, who turns into a zombie and she is forced to kill him. She prepares to commit [[suicide]] with her father's shotgun, but hears a helicopter. She runs out of the house into a playground full of zombies and the still-living Joe Miller. In a struggle, Joe tries to handcuff Frida to a slide but Frida breaks loose from his grip and handcuffs him to the slide and runs off. Joe cries that he's sorry and that he was stupid. Frida says that she forgives him but refuses to release him. The zombies devour Joe. Frida soon finds Tom, Lance, and Mrs. Banks and saves them from a zombie. They leave to find the helicopter where U.S. soldiers rescue them and take them to refuge.  Six months later, Port Gamble is out of quarantine and begins to be repopulated. Mrs. Banks is now mayor of the town and Frida is running her deceased dad's diner. Tom and Lance visit her and propose that she stay with them in [[New York City]]. She declines but promises that she will visit them soon. Tom and Lance leave the island while Larry and the married couple enjoy a meal at Frida's diner.  
Zombie Beach
 Centuries ago, rather than have a full-out war of the revelation, a deal was struck between the heroes of the good and the evil. As a result of the deal, a beach was sanctioned to the evil. There, the undead could walk like living beings among us, as [[Zombie (fictional)|zombies]].<ref>{{cite web   | last = Cordeiro | first = Rick   | title = Zombie Beach, Plot Summary   | url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1604064/plotsummary   | accessdate = 2012-12-08 }}</ref>  
Zohi Sdom
 The film starts with [[God]] ([[Eyal Kitzis]]) meeting [[Abraham]] ([[Moti Kirschenbaum]]) to sell [[monotheism]]. After Abraham declines, God promises to end Abraham's theft problem by destroying the city of Sodom, where the thieves are coming from, within three days. Abraham asks God to get his nephew [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] ([[Dov Navon]]) out of the city before he destroys it. God replays the command to his subordinates [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]] ([[Yuval Semo]]) and [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] ([[Maor Cohen]]).  Lot runs a [[lottery]] stall and collects the proceeds toward building a cultural center for Sodom's children. [[Lot's wife]] ([[Tal Friedman]]) is a former pop singer whose career went downhill after she married Lot. They have a single daughter, Charlotte ([[Alma Zak]]). Sodom is run by Bera ([[Eli Finish]]) the king of Sodom, a corrupt dictator surrounded by [[Sycophancy|yes men]], who has two sons—the elder and successful Ninveh ([[Assi Cohen]]) and the younger and stupid Liam ([[Mariano Idelman]]).  When Bera accidentally finds out that Sodom is about to be destroyed and Lot saved, he concocts a plan to switch places with Lot, as the archangels set to destroy the city had never actually seen Lot. He sends his elder son to seduce Charlotte, but to his chagrin his son falls in love. Bera tells Lot that he is ill and needs to get away from his usual surroundings, so they change places. As Lot takes the role of king, he becomes conceited and forgets his plans to help the children of Sodom.  Bera finds out that Ninveh plans to betray him for the sake of Charlotte, and has Ninveh imprisoned. He instead decides to wed his younger son Liam to Charlotte. Ninveh escapes and crashes the wedding, telling the guests that there is no food, so they start to riot. He tells everyone that Sodom is about to be destroyed, and Lot and Bera make their escape with their families. On their way out they are met by Raphael and Michael, who would only let Lot pass, but both Lot and Bera pretend to be Lot. Lot's wife betrays her husband and supports Bera. The angels propose splitting Lot's wife in two as in [[Judgment of Solomon|Solomon's Judgement]], but even though Lot cares more about her, they assume that Bera is in fact Lot, and let him escape with Lot's wife.  Sodom is then blown up with [[dynamite]], which Abraham witnesses and signs the contract with God. However, while it makes a big blast, no damage is done, and God tells his angels that it was a ploy to swindle Abraham into signing the contract. Bera brings Abraham the money from the wedding, and the latter accepts him into the family, while Lot remains to rule Sodom. It is shown that Sodom later moves to a more lucrative real estate location—[[Tel Aviv]].
