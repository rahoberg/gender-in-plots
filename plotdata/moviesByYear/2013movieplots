 Criminals Robert "Bobby" Beans ([[Denzel Washington]]) and Michael "Stig" Stigman ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) are questioned by the [[United States Border Patrol]] after a meeting with [[drug lord]] Manny "Papi" Greco ([[Edward James Olmos]]) in Mexico. Unknown to Stig, Bobby is an undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent named Bobby Trench and reports to his superior, Jessup ([[Robert John Burke]]), that he failed to acquire cocaine from Papi that they could use as evidence to convict him.  Against Jessup's orders, Bobby decides to remain undercover and assist Stig in robbing $3 million - stashed in the vault of the Tres Cruces bank - from Papi, so they can prosecute Papi for [[money laundering]]. Bobby has a rendezvous with fellow DEA agent and former lover, Deb Rees ([[Paula Patton]]), who is also seeing another man, while Stig, an undercover enlisted [[Office of Naval Intelligence|Intelligence Specialist]] with the [[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEALs]], meets with his commanding officer, LCDR Harold Quince ([[James Marsden]]), who instructs Stig to kill Bobby so the Navy can use the stolen money to fund unauthorized [[covert operation]]s.  During the heist, Bobby and Stig are surprised to find $43.125 million in the vault instead of the expected $3M. After the heist, Stig follows orders to betray Bobby and escape with the money, managing to pull his gun right as Bobby is about to pull his own. Unwilling to kill Bobby, Stig wounds Bobby in the shoulder, and then sees Bobby's DEA badge. Not sure what to think of Bobby, he leaves Bobby behind in the desert and leaves with the money. Stig meets with Quince, and after learning what happened, Quince attempts to have Stig killed. Stig escapes after learning the money will be transferred to a [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi|Navy base]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]. Meanwhile, a man named Earl ([[Bill Paxton]]) aggressively interrogates the Tres Cruces bank manager about the stolen money and also questions the vet who treated Bobby's wounds as he tracks Bobby's movements.  However, Bobby goes to Stig's apartment to find out where he took the money, only to have Stig contact him from a sniper's post across the street. A hit squad sent by Quince attacks the apartment but Bobby and Stig escape. Bobby visits Jessup to tell him what happened, but Earl and his men are there waiting for him. Earl kills Jessup, frames Bobby for the murder and lets him go, making a deal that if Bobby returns the $43 million he will be cleared.  Bobby and Stig kidnap Papi and interrogate him in the garage at Deb's house. They find out Earl is a [[Black operation|black ops]] operative to whom Papi reports, and that the money they stole belonged to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. The garage is attacked by another hit squad, led by Quince. Bobby, Stig, and Deb escape, but so does Papi, who calls his crew. All three end up being captured by Papi, and taken to his farm in Mexico.  After beating them and receiving a visit from Earl, Papi gives the pair 24 hours to steal the money from the Navy and return it to him, or Deb will die.  At the base, Bobby infiltrates Quince's office, only to discover Quince is Deb's boyfriend, and they had planned to steal the money for themselves. Meanwhile, Stig asks Admiral Tuway ([[Fred Ward]]) for help. Tuway orders Quince's arrest, but disavows Stig to prevent the scandal from tarnishing the Navy's reputation. Quince evades arrest, as does Stig. Unable to find the money, Bobby is too late to prevent Papi from killing Deb. He later realizes that the money is in a motel room that he and Deb frequented and goes to help Stig, who had returned to Papi's farm alone to exact vengeance.  There, Stig is surrounded by Papi's men until both Quince and Earl intervene. Bobby arrives in a car filled with money, and then blows up the car, scattering the money everywhere, which leads to a massive shootout. During a standoff among Quince, Earl, Bobby, and Stig, Earl reveals that the CIA has 20 other secret banks, and the loss of the $43.125 million is only a minor setback. Signaling Stig with a phrase from an earlier conversation, Stig shoots Earl, and Bobby shoots Quince. Bobby and Stig kill Papi and the duo escapes, but not before Bobby shoots Stig in the leg as payback for shooting him in the desert. While planning to continue to take down the CIA's secret banks and sabotage their black operations, Bobby reveals to Stig that he did not blow up all the money and had some stashed away.

  While on the phone with his girlfriend Jill, who has moved away to attend college, David prompts her to explicitly wish that he were there to see her compete in a fencing tournament, only to surprise her with an unplanned visit. After the competition, David approaches Jill's similarly attired opponent from behind and flirts with her, thinking she is his girlfriend. Intrigued, she kisses David, and Jill storms off angrily after walking in on them. Later, David meets with his friend Teddy, a sex-obsessed student who tells him that Jill will attend a house party later. Hoping that she will speak with him in person, David attends the party, too.  A meteor lands near the site of the party, and electrical arcs cause a momentary blackout. The wild revelers do not notice brief, anomalous phenomena that occur during the blackout, such as a mirror image out of sync, but a drug dealer's girlfriend outside the party becomes spooked. As the raucous party proceeds, David searches the house for Jill, and Teddy attempts to charm Melanie. To Teddy's surprise, Melanie invites him to join her upstairs in ten minutes. Meanwhile, David spies on Jill as she flirts with a friend, and Allison, an outsider, unsuccessfully attempts to fit in. David attempts to apologize to Jill, but she becomes more angry with his fumbled apology and says that he makes her feel replaceable. The party moves outside, and the house empties except for David, Teddy, Allison, and Melanie.  When Teddy joins Melanie upstairs, he finds her naked on a bed. They proceed to have sex, and she steps into the shower afterward. During a second blackout, a duplicate of Melanie appears on the bed, surprised to find Teddy in the room. When the original Melanie exits the shower, the two Melanies come face-to-face, and Teddy flees the room in a panic. David confirms that the house has filled with duplicates of the party-goers, who repeat the actions their originals took ten minutes ago. Outside, the drug dealer and his duplicate get into a violent confrontation, and David watches as one of them murders the other. Worried that the duplicates may be hostile, the originals attempt to hide. Eventually, the duplicates disappear.  With each blackout, the duplicates momentarily reappear and reenact increasingly more recent actions. David becomes convinced that he can save his relationship if he crafts a better apology to Jill's duplicate, Allison befriends her duplicate, and Teddy accidentally ruins the rendez-vous between his and Melanie's duplicates. Teddy warns the others that his duplicate will now become belligerent, and he convinces the party-goers, most of whom are still skeptical, to hide from their duplicates in a pool house. When the duplicates reappear, David knocks his own duplicate unconscious and charms Jill's duplicate, and Teddy's duplicate attempts to convince the skeptical crowd of duplicates to attack the originals.  Worried about their safety, several of the originals sneak out and murder their duplicates, which turns the enraged duplicates hostile. The originals retreat back to the pool house, and the duplicates lay siege. The next blackout causes the duplicates to appear inside the pool house. The crowded room erupts in violence, and several people die, including Teddy. David tracks down the original Jill, who had wandered back to the house, and he murders her so that he can be with her duplicate. Allison seduces her duplicate, and they share a kiss. The final blackout causes the duplicates and originals to merge. David and Jill leave together and make their way to the pool house and have a make-out session. The confused party-goers stagger out of the pool house, and they begin to disperse. Two meteors, like the original, are shown passing through the sky and appear to be leaving Earth.

There, the intense man flirts with him, saying he admires how Jack is playing both sides against each other.

As she kisses him, Anders' men break in and kidnap both.  In the warehouse, Libby angrily asks Jack if he is the unluckiest man alive or a shrewd assassin who has engineered the entire plot.  Though professing to be an insurance salesman, Jack demands they let Rita go.  When Libby refuses, Jack grabs a pistol from one of the men holding him and kills all of Libby's henchmen, including Anders.  Before killing Libby, Jack reveals himself as an assassin hired by the Broker.  He whispers his true background to Rita, then advises her to leave Cuba immediately.

At the address taken from Randy's phone they discover that Jeff no longer lives there, and that there is a party being thrown. They join in on party games in order to access a boy who may know Jeff's current address. The party games include a drinking game against a group of Serbian party-goers.  When they finally find the boy who may know Jeff's address, they are disappointed to discover that he does not actually know it. They leave Jeff in the care of two stoners who undress him for fun, write "Douchebag" on his forehead, dress him in a lacy bra and glue a teddy bear to his penis. After leaving the party, Jeff goes out on the street still naked except for the teddy bear and the bra. Casey and Miller go after him to get him dressed, but he evades them and is apprehended by the police after running atop several cars and being a public disturbance. Casey and Miller go to the campus police station where they are told that Jeff has been transferred to the psychiatric unit. A woman offers to escort them to the hospital, but it is actually a trap set by the Latina sorority. They take revenge on Casey and Miller, who leave with buttocks branded and bruised by spanking. They have to walk across campus wearing nothing but socks on their penises until they get new clothes. In the mental health facility, Casey and Miller ask if they can take Jeff home, but the hospital refuses citing that Jeff is on a 24-hour hold. The two also learn that Jeff has attempted suicide before due to stress. They also encounter Nicole, who has broken up with Randy after he was injured by the buffalo.  Casey and Miller then learn Jeff's address from a man named "Chief", who states he lives next door to Jeff and thus realise they drove past Jeff's house several times (thinking the Chief had simply been moving around). They go to Jeff's room, smuggle him out of the window and throw him atop a car from the third floor. They worry that they killed him again, but somehow Jeff avoids injury. Awakened by the fall, Jeff steals the car on which he has landed (which turns out to be Randy's). The three boys flee with Jeff driving recklessly. During their reckless driving, police catch up to their tail but the trio manage to evade the police with Jeff steering the car over an overpass. Miraculously, they land without injury.  The boys finally arrive to Jeff's apartment with minutes to spare to get him ready for his medical school interview. They pull the teddy bear off (accidentally circumcising him in the process), shower and dress him. Randy goes to Jeff's home to destroy the room, but Jeff's father arrives and apprehends him. Encouraged by Casey and Miller, Jeff confesses to his father, who pressured him into going to medical school, that he does not actually want to. His father refuses to accept this and even insults his own son. Miller becomes angry for the way Jeff's father is treating his son and punches him. Jeff tells his dad to leave which he does. Randy admires Jeff for standing up to his father, and the two reconcile. Casey realises he has fallen in love with Nicole, and runs to her house, where they kiss.  Three months later, Miller, who is intelligent but lazy, improves his grades and wants to go to university. The night before his admissions interview, he is at a music festival with Casey, Nicole (who is now dating Casey), and Jeff. He has a wild night and arrives to the professor's office with red hair, a broken leg, and a coroner's uniform profusely apologizing for his current state. The professor turns out to be the "Chief" that they repeatedly saw dancing alone in the street on the night of Jeff's 21st birthday.

13 Eerie
  Six [[forensic]] undergrads, Megan ([[Katharine Isabelle]]), Daniel ([[Brendan Fehr]]), Josh ([[Brendan Fletcher]]), Patrick ([[Jesse Moss (actor)|Jesse Moss]]), Kate (Kristie Patterson) and Rob (Michael Eisner), are assigned to complete a scientific field exam on a deserted island known as Eerie Strait, where life-term prisoners were once held and corpses lay dead. With cameras set up, Professor Tomkins ([[Michael Shanks]]) dispatches them into pairs to examine corpses in different areas as part of staged murders, restricting the pairs from interacting, only allowing their use of [[walkie talkies]] to report back to him. Unfortunately these have been accidentally damaged. He also monitors their activities from a surveillance cabin.  Shortly, Larry ([[Nick Moran]]), an ex-con who transported the group, warns partners, Megan and Kate, about finding the unexpected corpse of a skinhead female in a [[jumpsuit]] which soon comes alive in their working area. Rob spots the zombie in the woods and tries to warn his partner, Daniel, who dismisses it. Due to the earlier damage, all of the walkie talkies lose battery life, and communication is broken. While in the woods alone, the zombie pursues Kate and cannibalizes parts of her. Josh and Patrick hear her screams and see a figure’s movements in the woods, suspecting there is a problem.  As Larry tries to inform an initially skeptical Tomkins, who is upset with Larry for inadvertently destroying much of the equipment, Megan finds Kate injured, carrying her back to the student cabin before she dies. Rob, believing something is up, leaves Daniel to go out on his own. As Kate revives as a zombie and Rob approaches her as one after being bitten to death by the tattoo zombie (Ryland Alexander) and thug zombie (Jason Truong), Megan is forced to gruesomely kill the two of them. The remaining crew splits up and searches for the missing others, and Daniel finds Megan. Back at the main cabin, as the zombies attack, Tomkins shoots the skinhead zombie that is outside and inside where Larry botches a [[molotov cocktail]], the thug zombie is able to pull Larry underneath the cabin to bite him to death.  Tomkins tells Megan and Daniel to hide in a school bus. Chased by the zombies, Josh and Patrick seek safety in a prison bus, honking the horn that alerts the others to their location. Leaving the school bus, Megan and Daniel see zombie Larry coming after them. Megan accidentally fires a shot that injures Daniel, but she shoots Larry dead. They are found and they join Josh and Patrick on the prison bus. The zombies attack the bus, and they crash the tattoo zombie into a nearby cabin, resulting in Patrick’s death. The thug zombie comes after them and it is shot down. They drive away, but the bus starts to smoke and it tips over a branch and crashes, though Megan, Daniel and Josh, who sustains a knee injury, all survive. Not long after, the tattoo zombie catches up to them and Megan shoots it, but runs out of bullets. As she is about to be bitten, Josh saves her, driving an arrow through the zombie’s head.  The next day Tomkins finds them. Captain Veneziano (Lyndon Bray) drives by and they have him pull over. Megan, Daniel and Josh get into the car as Tomkins attacks Veneziano, who is pressured to admit the island was used for conducting biological experiments on prisoners sentenced to [[death row]] and turned into a death camp when the testing went wrong years ago. The tattoo zombie approaches from behind and Tomkins sacrifices Veneziano to save his own life. He attempts to drive off with his students, only to realize the keys are clenched between the teeth of the zombie. The final scene shows Megan, Daniel, Josh and Tomkins looking terrified about their fates.  
20 Feet Below: The Darkness Descending
 Documentary filmmaker Chelsea enters the abandoned [[New York City Subway]] tunnels that homeless squatters use.  Cops Smitty and Lockeheed warn her to be careful, but she dismisses their concerns.  There, she befriends and interviews Skeeter, who leads her on a tour.  Skeeter introduces her to Jake, an ex-cop who has become self-destructive since his wife's murder; Gabriel, a former social worker; Harmony, an artist; Razor and Ajax, gang members; Flash and Alexis, orphaned twins; and, at her insistence, Angel, the leader of a cult-like, violent anarchist gang.  Angel plans a revolution against the surface world, whom he blames for persecuting the homeless.  After he offhandedly threatens to murder to Chelsea as a show of power, Angel releases her and tells her to warn the surface world of his wrath.   Instead of fleeing, Chelsea stays behind and records a hazing ritual performed by Angel's gang.  When Ajax discovers her, Jake rescues Chelsea, drawing the further ire of the gang, who promise retaliations against both of them.  The increased gang activity, including the murder of a Wall Street investor, draws the attention of the cops, who organize a sweep through the tunnels.  Lockeheed's aggressive behavior during the raid culminates in a violent confrontation with Jake.  As Smitty defuses the situation, the gang quietly abducts a young and idealistic cop named Jimmy.  Angel sets fire to Jake's home and mounts Jimmy's bloody body nearby as a warning.  Chelsea and Gabriel rescue Jake, and they attempt to help Jimmy, who is already dead.  Above ground, Smitty and Lockeheed argue over Jake and return to the tunnels to interrogate him about Jimmy, who has been reported missing.  When Lockeheed finds Jake next to Jimmy's dead body, Smitty is no longer able to hold him back.  Jake flees deeper into the tunnels, where he receives conflicting advice from Gabriel and Flash.  Gabriel advises him to avoid violence, and Flash urges him to confront Angel.  When Ajax fails to kill Flash and instead gets beaten, Angel kills Ajax.  Angel then sends his gang out to set bombs in the subway tunnels, and Jake forces Skeeter to lead him to Angel's lair, which is hidden in the deepest, maze-like tunnels.  Jake attempts to stop Razor from setting a bomb, but it explodes, derails a subway train, and brings further police activity in the tunnels.  Razor and Jake fight each other; when Lockeheed shoots Jake in the arm, Razor and Jake both flee into the tunnels.  Angel's gang wounds Flash as they kidnap Chelsea.  Smitty arrests Jake, but Jake convinces Smitty to let him go so that he can rescue Chelsea.  When Jake reaches Angel, he discovers that Angel has planned his own death so that he will become a legend to his followers.  Smitty and Lockeheed, who have reconciled, converge with the rest of the homeless people on Angel's lair, and they join Chelsea in attempting to stop Jake from killing Angel.  Sensing Jake's reluctance, Angel reveals that he was the one who killed Jake's wife.  At the last minute, Jake accepts Gabriel's advice and chooses to forgo violence and revenge.  Smitty and Lockeheed arrest Angel and lead him away.

47 Ronin (2013 film)
 In [[Edo period|late medieval Japan]], Kai is a half-Japanese, half-English outcast who lives in the [[Akō Domain]], which is ruled by the benevolent Lord [[Asano Naganori]]. When Kai was young, Asano adopted him as a foundling.  Asano's daughter Mika and Kai eventually fall in love, despite Kai being scorned by her father's samurai due to his mixed ancestry.  Before a planned visit from [[Shogun]] [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]], Asano is visited by the Shogun's master of ceremonies, Lord [[Kira Yoshinaka|Kira]], who wants to take Akō for himself. Kira enlists the help of a shapeshifting [[Kitsune]] named Mizuki who sends a [[Qilin|Kirin]] to kill Asano in the forest of Ako. Asano's samurai struggle in their battle with the monster so Kai joins in riding an abandoned horse. As the monster charges him, Kai recovers a lost sword that he uses to slay it. Shortly thereafter he spots Mizuki disguised in her white fox form with [[Heterochromia iridum|different coloured eyes]]. Later during the Shogun's visit, Kai sees that one of the Shogun's concubines has the same multi-colored eyes. He tries to warn Asano's principal counselor and samurai, [[Ōishi Yoshio|Oishi]], that she is the Witch.  Later, Kira arranges a duel for the entertainment of the Shogun: Kira's best warrior, the giant Golem Samurai, will battle a warrior of Asano's choosing. However, before the duel begins, Mizuki uses her magic to incapacitate Asano's combatant. Kai secretly dons his armor and fights in his stead, but his disguise is revealed and the Shogun orders him severely beaten as punishment. Later that night, Mizuki uses her magic to make Asano believe that Kira is raping Mika, causing him to attack an unarmed Kira in his delirium. Asano is sentenced to death for attacking a [[Bakufu#Shogunate|Shogunate]] official, though the Shogun allows him to die with honor through [[seppuku]]. The Shogun then gives Kira both the Akō domain and Mika, although he grants Mika one year to mourn the death of her father before marrying Kira. The Shogun also brands Oishi and his men [[ronin]] and forbids them from seeking vengeance for Asano's death. To ensure that the ronin do not interfere with his takeover plans, Kira imprisons Oishi in an outdoor pit to break his spirit.  Nearly a year later, Oishi is released by Kira's men. He now knows that Kira is guilty of treachery for using Mizuki's sorcery to cause Asano's downfall. Oishi reunites with his family and asks his son Chikara to aid him in reuniting the scattered ronin. They learn that Kai has been sold into slavery and Oishi rescues him from the fighting pits of the Dutch colony of [[Dejima]]. Kai leads them to the [[Tengu]] Forest, a mystical place he escaped from as a child, so that they can find swords for themselves. Kai instructs Oishi to never draw his sword while in the Tengu temple and continues alone to another room to face the Tengu Master, who once trained Kai in their fighting ways. While Kai confronts the Tengu Master in a battle of wills, Oishi watches an illusion of his men being slaughtered by the Tengu, during which he fights the urge to draw his own sword. With Kai and Oishi both successful in their Tengu challenges, the ronin are given Tengu swords.  Armed with their new weapons, the ronin plan to attack Kira on his pilgrimage to a shrine where he seeks blessings for his wedding to Mika. However, Kira's procession is a trap and the ronin are ambushed by Kira's forces, led by Witch and her companion Samurai. Several of the ronin are killed, and Mizuki, thinking they are all dead, takes Oishi's sword and presents it to Kira as a trophy. Mizuki later taunts Mika with their deaths and attempts to manipulate her into committing suicide from despair.  Oishi and Kai (having actually survived the attack) rally the surviving ronin. Oishi, Kai, and half of the ronin infiltrate Kira's castle by disguising themselves as a band of traveling wedding performers loyal to the memory of Lord Asano. With Kira's men distracted during the performance, the remaining ronin scale the castle walls, and the reunited groups start to battle with Kira's men. While Oishi fights Kira, Kai and Mika are attacked by Mizuki, who shape-shifts into a dragon. Kai uses his sword and draws on the mystical powers of the Tengu to finally kill her. After gutting him, Oishi emerges with Kira's severed head and Kira's men surrender.  After winning the battle, the ronin (including Kai) surrender themselves to Shogunate authority and are sentenced to death as they explicitly violated the Shogun's prohibition on avenging Asano. However, the Shogun finds that they followed the principles of [[Bushido]] in their actions and, therefore, restores their honor as samurai. Thus, instead of execution, the ronin are allowed to perform seppuku. They are also given the honor of burial with their master, Lord Asano. The Shogun gives Akō back to Mika, and at the seppuku ceremony, he pardons Oishi's son Chikara so that he may serve Akō and preserve Oishi's bloodline for the country.  A closing caption informs the audience of the tradition of paying respect at the graves of the 47 Ronin which continues every year on [[December 14]].

ABCD: Any Body Can Dance
   After having a bitter disagreement with his friend and manager Jehangir Khan ([[Kay Kay Menon]]) about the latter's blatant abuse of power and influence to win a dance competition called "Dance Dil Se" for his team JDC (Jehangir Dance Company), the [[choreographer]] of the dance company, Vishnu ([[Prabhu Deva]]), quits his job. At first he wants to return home to [[Chennai]], but his friend Gopi ([[Ganesh Acharya]]) asks him to stay in [[Mumbai]] with him. Vishnu observes several young men using [[parkour]] to evade the police. They turn out to be proteges of Gopi, but despite their obvious raw talent, they lack the discipline required to become serious artists; they demonstrate this disastrously at a local event for a politician, wherein they set the stage on fire. After witnessing the youngsters showing their dancing abilities at [[Ganpati]] Chaturthi against their equally talented rival neighborhood, Vishnu decides to start his own dance group with them ultimately preparing them to compete in "Dance Dil Se". However, the lack of discipline among the dancers and rivalry between the two factions in the group led by D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Rocky ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]) leads to multiple creative and emotional blocks. Initially, only Rocky and his gang are willing to attend the free classes, but soon D and his friends gravitate towards the studio.  They are soon joined by Chandu ([[Punit Pathak]]), a troubled but extraordinarily talented man suffering from a drug addiction, Shaina (Noorin Sha), a "bar dancer", and Rhea ([[Lauren Gottlieb]]), a Westerner who was JDC's star dancer until Jehangir tried to sexually assault her during a "private instruction". Rhea immediately becomes the new star of the company. Though the students are initially skeptical of Shaina because of her profession. Chandu demonstrates a great deal of respect for Shaina and defends her in front of the class despite teasing from his peers. The pair quickly fall for one another, leaving quite a few of the boys heartbroken.  Despite repeated pleas for peace in the studio, the two main gangs continue to clash, driving Vishnu to his wit's end. However, the students seem to improve and as a reward, he gives them money to buy new speakers, but they nearly lose it all when Rhea takes them to an elite dance club where they challenge the resident champions, a professional dance crew called "Fictitious Crew". Vishnu arrives at the last minute and wins back the money, but while his students gain new respect for him he is furious with them. After some hard apologizing, he forgives them and they return to class with greater discipline and drive, only to suddenly be thrown out on the street after D's father calls the cops. During all of this Rocky and Rhea start to fall for each other whilst D burns with jealousy.The community complains that their children should not be mixing in such a way and only through an impromptu dance performance are the youth able to convince their families of the importance of their talent. Only D's conservative and orthodox father refused to accept that his son desires to be a dancer.  The crew head to Dance Dil Se and audition, but when Rocky and D fight onstage for Rhea, their chances of appearing on the show in the first place seems bleak. Jehangir, in a bid to humiliate Vishnu publicly, persuades the judges to take the "Dhongri Dance Revolution" crew on as a "comedy act". Faced with ridicule and the idea that they are a joke and not true dancers, Vishnu asks Rocky and D to do a step that requires a great deal of trust from both, but they cannot muster the trust to manage it. Vishnu has them choose the people they would trust to perform the step with, but then tricks both dancers by blindfolding them and having them attempt it again; this time, they are successful. Vishnu then states that unless the two manage to do the step without blindfolds none of the dancers would be allowed to go home for the night. Several abortive and unsuccessful attempts later D and Rocky take a break and Chandu talks to D and tells him about Bhavana's secret love for D. Bhavana and D get together, D completes the move successfully with Rocky, and the two factions begin to trust each other and work together.  Before the semifinals, Chandu prepares to propose to Shaina, but he meets his old drug dealer on the street. Now completely free from the hold of drugs he refuses to fall back into that world, but the dealer, irritated, tosses the ring intended for Shaina at him and it falls into the street. As he retrieves it, Chandu is hit by a truck and killed, leaving the team devastated. Shaina, though barely able to stand from grief, becomes the centerpiece of the team's semifinal routine, in which they express the loss of their friend, bringing audience members to tears. The team and the community come together to cremate Chandu, and DDR resolves to continue in the competition in Chandu's memory. At the finals, Jehangir pulls a dirty trick: his informant Mayur (a performer in DDR but, tempted by Jehangir's offer of a main lead role in JDC began to feed information to the opposition) leads JDC's dancers to copy DDR's choreography and performance concept. Faced with losing, DDR crafts a new routine on the spot, based around Lord [[Ganesha]]. Their heartfelt and spontaneous performance reminds the cold-hearted Jehangir why he and Vishnu started JDC in the first place and he is humbled. The DDR crew are rewarded with thunderous applause and victory in the competition.

When he returns to the present, he finds Posy has never been born and that he has a son instead. His father explains that travelling back to change things before his children were born would mean those children would not be born. Thus, any events that occurred before Posy's birth cannot be changed, and Tim must accept the consequences as a normal person would. Tim accepts he cannot change Kit Kat's life by changing her past but he and Mary help her to change her life in the present. She settles down with an old friend of Tim's and has a child of her own.

Tim follows this advice and also travels back into the past to visit his father whenever he misses him.  Mary tells Tim she wants a third child. He is reluctant at first because he will not be able to visit his father after the baby is born but agrees. After visiting his father for the following nine months, Tim tells his father that he cannot visit any more. They travel back to when Tim was a small boy, reliving a fond memory of them playing on the beach, and afterwards have a heartfelt, tearful goodbye.

Afflicted (film)
 Childhood friends Clif Prowse and Derek Lee have decided to venture all over the world to film their travel [[web series]] “Ends of the Earth”. The trip is Derek's last wish, as he has an [[Cerebral arteriovenous malformation|AVM]], which could cause his death at any moment.  Clif and Derek stop in [[Paris]] to meet with old friends currently on tour with their band. After their initially uneventful stay, Derek picks up a woman by the name of Audrey after telling her about his AVM. Later that night, Clif bursts into Derek's hotel room as a prank, only to discover a bleeding and scratched Derek, and no sign of Audrey. Though Derek doesn't remember anything about the attack, they assume that Audrey planned to rob him.  Upon getting to Italy, Derek passes out and sleeps for an entire day. Clif awakens him the next afternoon for lunch. At the restaurant, Derek hungrily devours his pasta dish before suddenly projectile vomiting. Later, at a vineyard, Derek has an extreme reaction to sunlight, and is forced to flee inside, covered in burns. Back at the hotel room, Clif attempts to calm Derek down, only for Derek to explosively punch clean through the corner of a stone wall with his bare hands.  Over the next few days, Derek displays heightened strength, speed and agility. Clif attempts to persuade Derek to stop their trip and come home, but Derek continues to insist that there is nothing wrong with him. As Derek grows sicker due to not being able to eat, he finally agrees to go to a hospital. On the way, the two are almost hit by a car. Derek fights with the angry driver and passenger, completely overpowering them both, before licking their blood off his hand.  Clif correctly deduces that Derek has contracted [[vampire|vampirism]], but researching online proves useless. Derek first tries drinking blood obtained from a butcher, and then kills and drains a man's pet piglet, only to vomit out the blood on both occasions. Realizing that Derek needs human blood, he and Clif attempt to rob an ambulance, which proves unsuccessful, and they retreat back to the hotel. Derek enters a catatonic state, and Clif decides to slit his own wrist to give Derek some of his blood, but discovers that Derek has escaped. He attempts to find him, only to be ambushed and killed by the completely inhuman Derek. Upon regaining his senses and realizing that he has killed his friend, Derek shoots himself in the head with a shotgun. Shortly after, however, Derek's head heals with only slight scarring, and he is faced with the fact that he is unable to be killed.  Soon after, [[Interpol]] agents attempt to take Derek into custody, forcing him to escape in daylight, carrying only Clif's camera bag. He manages to get back to France and hides in an abandoned warehouse in Paris. Reviewing the footage of his meeting with Audrey, he realizes that her cell phone might be at the hotel where she bit him. After retrieving the cell phone, Derek texts every one of the numbers on the contact list in order to try and lure someone to him. Eventually, a man shows up, and Derek tails and kidnaps him. He then sets up a live-stream event to draw Audrey in, but his hideout is stormed by the [[GIGN]] and Derek is shot to near-death before entering a frenzy state. After slaughtering the police, Derek escapes once again.  Audrey finally meets Derek in an abandoned building, where she apologizes for accidentally making him a vampire, and tells him that there is no cure for his condition. Derek lashes out at her and the two briefly fight, but Derek is easily overpowered by the more experienced Audrey. Audrey urges him to feed every five days, lest he become inhuman again and begin killing indiscriminately. Audrey instructs him to choose whom he kills, and explains that she chose Derek because he was dying, and she thought she was being kind.  Later, Derek posts his final entry online, in which he explains that he can never contact his family again, but he can still avoid succumbing to his vampiric nature. He then kills and feeds from a child molester.  In a mid-credits scene, a teenage boy and two teenage girls are seen sneaking into a swimming pool, only to be attacked. The boy gets away, and with his camera running, finds the bloodied corpse of one of the girls before Clif, now also a vampire, appears and attacks him.

After Earth
 In the near future, an environmental cataclysm forces the human race to abandon Earth and settle on a new world, Nova Prime.  One thousand years later, The Ranger Corps, a peacekeeping organization commanded by General Cypher Raige (Will Smith), comes into conflict with the S'krell, alien creatures who intended to conquer Nova Prime. Their secret weapons are the Ursas, large predatory creatures that hunt by "sensing" fear. The Rangers struggle against the Ursas until Cypher learns how to completely suppress his fear, a technique called "ghosting". After teaching this technique to the other Rangers, he leads the Ranger Corps to victory. Meanwhile, Cypher's son Kitai Raige (Jaden Smith) blames himself for the death of his sister Senshi (Zoë Kravitz) at the hands of an Ursa. Kitai trains to become a Ranger like Cypher, but his application is rejected due to his recklessness, and Cypher views him as a disappointment. Kitai's mother Faia (Sophie Okonedo) convinces Cypher to take Kitai on his last voyage before retirement.  During flight, however, their spaceship is caught by an asteroid shower forcing them to crash-land on the now-quarantined Earth. Both of Cypher's legs are broken, and the main beacon for firing a distress signal is damaged. Cypher instructs Kitai to locate the tail section of the ship, which broke off on entry to the atmosphere. Inside is the backup beacon which they can use to signal Nova Prime. Cypher gives Kitai his weapon, a wrist communicator and six capsules of a fluid that enhances the oxygen intake so he can breathe in Earth's low-oxygen atmosphere. Cypher warns him to avoid the highly evolved fauna and flora, and be careful of violent thermal shifts. Kitai leaves to find the tail section, with Cypher guiding him through the communicator.  Kitai is attacked by giant monkeys and, during his escape, is bitten by a poisonous leech. Kitai administers the antidote, but two of his capsules are damaged and his nervous system shuts down. When Kitai awakens, he narrowly escapes a thermal shift. Kitai lies to Cypher, not informing him of the damaged capsules. That night, Kitai listens to Cypher tell him a story of when he was attacked by an Ursa, how he realized that fear is merely an illusion created by the mind's thoughts of the future, and thus he first began to "ghost" himself from the Ursas, choosing to live rather than to let his enemies, both fear and the Ursas, decide his fate.  The following day, Kitai reaches a mountaintop and Cypher learns about the broken capsules. Knowing that the only way to make it with two capsules would be to skydive, Cypher orders Kitai to abort the mission. Believing his father still sees him as a disappointment, Kitai blames Senshi's death on Cypher's absence on the day of the attack. He skydives from the mountaintop, but is captured by a large bird of prey and his communicator is damaged. Kitai wakes in a nest of the bird, where he is surrounded by big cats. The bird attacks the big cats, and Kitai escapes. He reaches a river, and builds a raft to continue along the river. Tired, Kitai falls asleep on the raft. He dreams of his sister, Senshi, who reassures him that Cypher's bitterness is just his own anger for not saving her. Senshi urges Kitai to wake up and when he does, he is surprised by another thermal shift and nearly freezes to death. Kitai is rescued by the bird, who sacrifices itself for him.  Kitai reaches the tail section and retrieves the emergency beacon along with another communicator, weapon, and more oxygen capsules. The communicator only allows Cypher to see and hear Kitai, but not for Kitai to hear him. Kitai learns the ship's Ursa escaped and killed the remnants of the crew. The emergency beacon does not activate and Cypher realizes that the atmosphere is blocking the signal. Kitai heads to a nearby volcano from which he can fire the beacon, and is injured when the Ursa attacks him. Kitai is able to control his fear and "ghost" himself from the Ursa enough to kill it. He then fires the beacon. A rescue team arrives, and the two travel back to Nova Prime.

After the Dark
 Mr. Zimit, a philosophy teacher at an international school in [[Jakarta]], has been challenging his class of twenty with thought exercises to prepare them for their future. On the last day of school, he holds an exercise in which he posits an oncoming atomic apocalypse. There is a bunker to shelter them for a year, but it only has supplies for ten people, so his students have to decide who of them should be allowed in. The top student, Petra, initially refuses to participate, but Zimit threatens to lower her boyfriend James' academic score if she does not.  Zimit distributes cards that contain a detail about the students' characters in the exercise: James is an organic farmer and Petra is an engineer. The students defend their right to enter the shelter, then there's a group vote after discussion. Students with skills judged useful for survival are allowed in, such as James and Petra, while those who don't are refused, such as Beatrice, a fashion designer. Zimit is part of the exercise but his skills are hidden. At first the students agree to let him in, but Zimit executes the students who have been rejected, claiming that it is more humane than letting them die by radiation. The remaining students race into the bunker before the explosion, locking out Zimit. Outside, Zimit holds up a card saying that only he has the exit code. After living out the year in the bunker, the survivors discover that the exit code is necessary. All attempts of breaking out of the bunker are futile, and after supplies run out they commit group suicide.  They decide to try the exercise again. The cards given earlier are revealed to contain a secondary detail that change the votes, e.g. Georgina, who was allowed in earlier because of her status as a surgeon, now has possibly contracted the [[Ebola virus]] and is rejected. Petra and James are still voted in despite James' additional character detail of being gay. Zimit and the chosen students enter the bunker, and agree to start procreating immediately. Various heterosexual pairs get together, but as James is gay in this exercise, Petra has to sleep with Zimit. After ten weeks there are no pregnancies, and Zimit argues that they need to change partners. When Bonnie, a soldier with [[eidetic memory]], refuses, Zimit threatens her with a gun. Jack stabs Zimit, who responds by opening the doors and killing everyone. James questions Zimit's motives for the exercise, asking why he seems intent on punishing them. After checking the box with the cards, James discovers that his and Petra's were fixed, though Zimit refuses to explain his reasons.  Petra insists the exercise be carried out a third time, and asks everyone to trust her to choose who gets to enter the bunker. She picks people who are a potential risk or have non-technical skills, including an opera singer and poet, which angers Zimit. Petra herself refuses to enter the bunker, but is pushed inside when Chips switches places with her before the door closes. Zimit is outright refused entry since his exit code is no longer necessary—Bonnie remembers it from the previous iteration. Petra continues the thought exercise, explaining that the year in the bunker was enjoyable and filled with creativity. When they leave, they discover that the bombs never fell. Zimit narrates that they will die, as none of them have the technical skills to survive, but Petra counters that they will live the rest of their short lives well and welcome death when it arrives. Zimit arrives at the beach, having survived in a cave for the past year, and threatens to shoot James, but the rest of the survivors stand in front of him.  Back in class, Zimit is discomfited by the latest exercise. At the end of the session, everyone leaves except Petra, who accuses Zimit of trying to use the exercise to punish her and James. Zimit has been having an affair with Petra, and he believes James is beneath her. Petra argues that intelligence isn't all that matters. The film ends with Zimit alone in the school as he contemplates suicide.

Rita is a leisure girl whereas Nadeem works as a hotel receptionist and they both fall in love. The differences between Nadeem and Rita's father Seth arises right from the beginning, esp. when he (Rita's father) criticised Nadeem for his social status and earning capacity, saying his daughter's [[sari]] costs 7,500 rupees as compare to his monthly salary of 750 rupees. But after a struggle by Rita and a threat to her parents that she would suicide if she would not be allowed to marry Nadeem, her father agreed. So both married but Nadeem knew that Seth was not really happy with this marriage. One day Rita's mother came to her daughter's house, located in a middle class, and offered Nadeem a job in Seth's friend's business firm, which he denied. Not only this, he also angried on Rita about the telephone (which was thought to be a very luxurious item esp. in those days) installed in his house by her. A few days later, Rita's mother purchased furniture for Nadeem's house (perhaps to hurt Nadeem's ego) and invited her guests to a dance party in Nadeem's house. When Nadeem came back home, he became very angry and he asked Rita to leave the house and stay in her father's house. Rita left, with tears, Nadeem's house. Next day, Nadeem got an appointment from a bigger company perhaps from a hotel in [[Murree]], so he has to leave the city immediately. But before leaving the city he tried to meet Rita, but, at the entrance of her house, he met Seth. Seth misinform him that Rita does not want to see his face again and decided to get divorce from him, as she has realised that she has made such a big mistake in marrying a poor man like Nadeem. Shocked and dishearted Nadeem left the city.  On the other side, Rita was waiting for him in the hope that he would come back and take her back to his home. But her father deceived her too that he had visited Nadeem but he insulted him in front of his friends and said that he is going to divorce her. This shocked Rita to such an extent that she could not bear the pain of pregnancy. So they moved to a hospital in the same city where the Nadeem was gone for his new job. During his journey to Murree, a car driver incidentally injured Nadeem. Nadeem moved to the same hospital where Rita was admitted for child delivery. In the hospital's lobby, he found his wife unconscious on the hospital bed, during this Seth interrupted and said that he is going to give away the child to an [[orphanage]], but Nadeem refused to do that and said that he will take care of child himself. The film has taken a very sad turn at that point esp. when Nadeem carrying the baby to his house and singing the sad version of the song and remembering those happy days with Rita. On the other side, Seth lied not only to Rita but to his wife also that the baby has died. This was a tremendous shock for Rita and she somewhat lost her mental balance. After few years the baby is grown up to a teenage boy, a very sensitive and very anxious about his mother. Whereas, Rita's mental instability grew day by day, so her mother asked Rita's father to let Rita visit her baby's grave which would perhaps help her. Next day all visited ([[Murree]]) and searched the graveyard, where they come across the real baby, who was picking flowers there. As there was nothing to found there, they started leaving the place. During this Shahzeb immediately reached home and asked his father about the features of his mother, Nadeem hand him over her photo. Shahzeb recognized his mother and ran towards the road where Rita and her parents come from and started singing the same song which he used to listen from his father. Rita stopped the car and ran towards the place where the voice was coming from and finally she reached Nadeem's house. Amazed by the situation both asked about the divorce, as both were in misunderstanding, the truth revealed that it was Rita's father who had actually planned their separation (not legal divorce) and who had lied to her that her child is dead. Rita turned angriely and slapped her embarrassed father, who was listening this. Her mother said at this moment "You have not slapped your father, but you have actually slapped that mentality that believes in differences between poor and rich". And then they lived happily ever after.

Alfie (2013 film)
  Alfie is a failing actress and a junkie lost in filth. One fine afternoon, she and her new lover travel to a remote waterfall inside the woods. Tired with all the walking, she soon falls asleep by the waterfall and the dream that follows is bizarre, horrifying, where she is bound up tight in a shady dungeon and tortured mercilessly.  Visually reminiscent of a Rembrandt, ‘Alfie’ tells a surreal tale structured uniquely to simulate a dream experience, immersed in Freudian eroticism, sexual deviance and biblical notion of Baptism. Where as it has a second meaning also that is somehow pointing to a fact that women are still objectified by men. The Man on the screen is shown dominating which before climax is tried by women too. But  the man oppresses her and tortures her. During  her last breath she was in her wonderland of dreams and there what she witnessed was only the beauty of nature that she was created to see. <ref>[http://www.reelport.com/index.php?id=300&movie_id=56781&last_page=catalogue.results.all Reelport.com]</ref>  
All Cheerleaders Die
 The film opens with Maddy Killian ([[Caitlin Stasey]]) recording footage of her childhood friend Alexis (Felisha Cooper) as she prepares for the final days of school before summer break and for cheerleading practice. She discusses how important it is to remain fit and how dangerous cheerleading can be, pointing out how easy it is for some of the more advanced cheerleader moves to end with severe or deadly injuries. This proves to be the case when Alexis is thrown into the air and her teammates fail to catch her in time, resulting in her death.   Once school resumes Maddy decides that she will try out for the cheerleading team and manages to impress the entire team with her acrobatic skills. After being accepted, Maddy notes that Tracy (Brooke Butler) has begun dating Terry ([[Tom Williamson (actor)|Tom Williamson]]), a star football player who had been dating Alexis prior to her death. She begins to get along with the other cheerleaders, the overly religious and prissy Martha (Reanin Johannink) and her shy sister Hanna (Amanda Grace Cooper), who serves as the cheerleading mascot. This provokes Maddy's ex-girlfriend Leena ([[Sianoa Smit-McPhee]]), who can't understand why Maddy would want to hang out with the cheerleaders. Unbeknownst to everyone else, Maddy has actually joined the cheerleading squad to take revenge on Terry for as yet unspecified reasons.   Maddy begins taking her revenge by convincing Tracy that Terry had cheated on her during the summer and even manages to successfully seduce her at a group gathering of cheerleaders and football players. This greatly hurts Leena (who had been watching the gathering from afar) and angers Terry, who starts a fight, and bans the "dogs" (football players) from dating the "bitches" (cheerleaders).  He then punches Tracy in a fit of anger. The cheerleaders all try to escape the raging football players, only for Terry to cause an accident that claims the lives of all of the cheerleaders. Horrified at what she's seen, Leena manages to revive all of the dead cheerleaders using Wicca magic and magic stones. The following day the girls are all disoriented and scared, especially Martha and Hanna, as they have also somehow swapped bodies.  None of them recollect exactly what happened until Leena reveals to them what occurred the night before. They're also very hungry, which prompts them to attack one of Leena's neighbors and suck out all of his blood. The girls then go to school, where the football players all watch them with disbelief, as they'd thought them all dead. During the day the cheerleaders pick off the football players one by one, either out of hunger or, in the case of Martha, out of anger when she realizes that her sister slept with her boyfriend, Manny (Leigh Parker), using her body.   While the girls were all initially willing to work together, their solidarity unravels due to the day's deaths and the discovery from Maddy's video diaries that she had joined the squad out of revenge. She tries to explain her cruel criticism of them, but none of the others will listen to her, especially not Tracy, as she had genuinely begun to fall in love with Maddy.  The only person who will listen is Leena and Maddy tells her that she had been raped by Terry while attempting to film a memorial video for Alexis and that up until that point, she had not wanted revenge. The girls are then picked off one by one by Terry, who has figured out what is going on and manages to defeat them by cutting out the magic stones (which reside in the girls' bodies) and swallowing them.  Terry manages to corner Maddy and Leena in a graveyard where he tries to force Leena to show him how to use her magic for his benefit, only for him to die after Maddy attacks him and Leena's magic somehow manages to force the stones out of him. Maddy dies again as a result of this but Leena manages to revive her through her own grief, the same thing that caused the original resurrection. The two embrace and kiss, only to find that a bloody Alexis is tearing her way out of Terry's corpse (as he had landed on her grave) and screaming Leena's name. The film then cuts to the title card, which reveals that the film is part one in a series and that there will be a sequel.

Sydney has improved Rosenfeld's scams, posing as English aristocrat "Lady Edith Greensly." Irving loves Sydney but is hesitant to leave his unstable wife Rosalyn, fearing he will lose contact with his adoptive son Danny. Rosalyn has also threatened to report Irving to the police if he leaves her. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Richie DiMaso catches Irving and Sydney in a loan scam, but offers to release them if Irving can line up four additional arrests. Richie believes Sydney is English but has proof that her claim of aristocracy is fraudulent. Sydney tells Irving she will manipulate Richie, distancing herself from Irving.  Irving has a friend pretending to be a wealthy Arab sheik looking for potential investments in America. An associate of Irving's suggests the sheik do business with Mayor Carmine Polito of Camden, New Jersey, who is campaigning to revitalize gambling in Atlantic City but has struggled in fundraising. Carmine seems to have a genuine desire to help the area's economy and his constituents. Richie devises a plan to make Mayor Polito the target of a [[sting operation]], despite the objections of Irving and of Richie's boss, Stoddard Thorsen. Sydney helps Richie manipulate an FBI secretary into making an unauthorized wire transfer of $2,000,000. When Stoddard's boss, Anthony Amado, hears of the operation, he praises Richie's initiative, pressuring Stoddard to continue.  Carmine leaves their meeting when Richie presses him to accept a cash bribe. Irving convinces Carmine the sheik is legitimate, expressing his dislike of Richie, and the two become friends. Richie arranges for Carmine to meet the sheik, and without consulting the others, has Mexican-American FBI agent Paco Hernandez play the sheik, which displeases Irving. Carmine brings the sheik to a casino party, explaining mobsters are there and it is a necessary part of doing business. Irving is surprised to hear that [[American Mafia|Mafia]] boss Victor Tellegio, right-hand man to [[Meyer Lansky]], is present and that he wants to meet the sheik. Tellegio explains that the sheik needs to become an American citizen and that Carmine will need to expedite the process. Tellegio also requires a $10,000,000 wire transfer to prove the sheik's legitimacy.  Richie confesses his strong attraction to Sydney but becomes confused and aggressive when she drops her English accent and admits to being from Albuquerque. Rosalyn starts an affair with mobster Pete Musane, whom she met at the party. She mentions her belief that Irving is working with the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]], causing Pete to threaten Irving, who promises to prove the sheik's investment is real. Irving later confronts Rosalyn, who admits she told Pete and agrees to keep quiet but wants a divorce. With Carmine's help, Richie and Irving videotape members of Congress receiving bribes. Richie assaults Stoddard in a fight over the money and later convinces Amado that he needs the $10,000,000 to get Tellegio, but gets only $2,000,000. A meeting is arranged at the offices of Tellegio's lawyer, Alfonse Simone, but Tellegio does not appear.  Irving visits Carmine and admits to the scam, but says he has a plan to help him. Carmine throws Irving out and the loss of their friendship deeply upsets Irving. The federal agents inform Irving that their $2,000,000 are missing and that they have received an anonymous offer to return the money in exchange for Irving and Sydney's immunity and a reduced sentence for Carmine. It is revealed that the Alfonse Simone whom Richie had arranged the wire transfer with was a con man working with Irving and Sydney. Amado accepts the deal and Stoddard removes Richie from the case, which ends his career. The Congressmen are prosecuted and so is Carmine, who is sentenced to 18 months in prison.

It turns out that she is also an artist who draws cartoons and designs her own clothes. She tells her grandmother, Mimi and friends about the situation, and they proposed a school-wide [[protest]] against the decision.  Tessa goes to Mimi's house with Saige instead of going to Dylan's house. Gabi invites Saige to her house, but Saige turns her down by saying she is busy. Tessa comes over to her house. They sing, paint, eat and play. Saige feels like she has her best friend back.  As Saige is telling her grandmother about Tessa and her other friends, Mimi trips over Saige's dog, Rembrandt, and breaks her leg and wrist. She is then [[hospitalized]] due to her injuries. At the hospital, she begs Saige to continue on with her protest. Saige agrees, and promises to do so for her grandmother.  At school, Saige, Tessa, Gabi and Dylan discuss plans on staging the protest, with Saige coming up with "A Day of Beige" after her visit to the hospital. Dylan suggests a [[press conference]] in order to gain more attention since her mother works as a news reporter, to which Saige reluctantly complies. The demonstrations are held as planned with all of the students wearing beige in protest, but is nearly put to a halt as Saige and her friends are summoned to the principal's office to explain the situation.

Principal Laird later tells the girls that there aren't any more funds to hire an art teacher, and that they would need to earn $5000 in six weeks for the art class to start. Mimi suggests a fund drive to be held at the [[Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta]], and to have her granddaughter lead the parade in her place as she may not make it in time for the event. Saige worries that she might freak out in front of people, but her father assures her that it will be alright.  The four girls take up various odd jobs to earn funds only to end up getting next to no money from doing so. Dylan suggests a concert at the fiesta, but Saige has doubts on it.  Later at the ranch, Saige and her horse Picasso do a practice run, but Saige is  frustrated as she can't concentrate on the ride. Saige and Gabi are worried that Dylan and Tessa's part for the fundraiser is getting more attention than theirs, and the two agreed to come at Mimi's ranch to further discuss on the matter. Saige and Picasso do another run at the ranch, this time with success as they manage to pull off a gait without being distracted.  The four girls talk about combining their efforts in the fundraiser. Dylan and Tessa argue that they have their plans already set for their part, but Saige insists, leading to a confrontation. Saige then tells Tessa that the Tessa she knows would agree with her before flying into a rage against Dylan and accuses her of stealing the spotlight over her efforts, for which she is rejected by Tessa.<ref name="saigerant"></ref>  Saige tries to talk Mimi into using the brush pens, but Mimi says that she can't do things as she did before. Saige tries to discuss doing art again, including coming to the parade; Mimi says that she's not up to any of it, even going to the parade. Saige gets upset and confesses that things are worse than she has been admitting, but that the Mimi she knows wouldn't give up before running off.  Another practice run with Picasso takes place, but Saige is too frustrated to continue, and worries that the fiesta is going to be a disaster. Her parents and Gabi watch her. Gabi leaves, because of Saige saying she wishes things were the same as last year.  Saige then joins her father in a [[hot air balloon]] ride. She later reconciles with Gabi, and apologizes to Mimi about how she got mad at how things turned out on her end. After her horse practice with Luis, Saige goes to Mimi's studio and decides to paint over her horse painting with a [[painting knife]], turning it into an [[Abstract art|abstract]] work. Tessa later sees it, and compliments Saige for what she did. Both Saige and Tessa admit to their mistake, reconcile, and agree to work together for the fiesta. Saige also makes amends with Dylan, with the latter apologizing over how she was taking over Saige's fund-raiser.  With the Balloon Fiesta taking place, Saige leads the parade in front of onlookers. She is nervous at first, but she eventually overcomes her fear as she performs the scarf trick. The girls later come up with the joint fund-raising art exhibit and concert as previously planned. The show is a success, but they were several dollars short of the $5,000 goal. Saige then makes a speech in front of the audience telling them about how important art is to her and to others, receiving a standing ovation. Once some extra money is put into the fundraiser from the audience, the donation goal is reached and with the art program being reinstated the girls rejoice over the news.  Back at the hot air balloon show, Saige, Tessa, Gabi, and Dylan (now all best friends) all ride a hot air balloon Saige designed as the film ends.

He intends to promote Corningstone, making her the first female nightly news anchor in the history of television, and to fire Burgundy due to his continuously sloppy performance on air. Burgundy grows jealous of Corningstone's success and storms out of the house, leaving her and their 6-year-old son Walter (Judah Nelson).  Six months later, Burgundy is back in [[San Diego]], but barely able to hold a job due to his depression. After being fired from [[SeaWorld]] and botching a suicide attempt, Burgundy accepts a job offered to him by Freddie Shapp ([[Dylan Baker]]) with GNN, the world's first [[CNN|24-hour news network]], for the station's official launch.

They are assigned the unpopular late-night timeslot while obnoxious rival anchorman Jack Lime ([[James Marsden]]) is put in a primetime slot. Meanwhile, Burgundy finds that Corningstone has started dating psychologist Gary ([[Greg Kinnear]]).  As GNN launches, Burgundy decides to broadcast what the people want to hear, rather than what they need to hear. He and his team devise a sensationalist and patriotic newscast.

He leaves angrily, gets his vision restored, and returns to GNN.  Back in New York, Burgundy is once again approached by Corningstone, who pleads with him to attend Walter's piano recital. At the same time, an exclusive news story comes in, requiring Burgundy to cover it. However, on live TV, Burgundy instead admits that news is supposed to inform, not entertain, and takes responsibility for the mistakes he made, following it up by quitting and walking off. He leaves for Walter's recital but is intercepted by an angered Lime and his team and several other news teams, all of whom want to kill him due to his fame. Burgundy's friends arrive to defend him and a massive battle ensues.

When her mother goes out, telling the family she is going out with friends, Fay sees her getting into a car and kissing a man who is not her father, while a girl who looks like Fay approaches the car. Later a neighbour tells Fay that she saw her walking down the stairs of their building. When Fay denies it was her, her neighbour says that she would never mistake Fay for anyone else because of her distinctive long red hair. Fay chases after the girl but finds no one. Returning home, she cuts her hair into a misshapen bob. At school, Fay frightens her friends by insisting that she is being stalked by a [[Doppelgänger]] who her friends suggest may be her understudy and rival Monica who similarly has long red hair. After her mother picks her up from school, Fay confesses her paranoia about being stalked by a twin, and her mother admits that Fay was a twin but that she had a late-term miscarriage with her sister, Lila.  After a successful rehearsal, Fay goes on a date with Drew. Returning home, she finds her father collapsed on the floor.

In the principal's office when Fay accuses Monica of impersonating her, the principal ([[Leonor Watling]]) informs her that it couldn't have been her in the schoolyard as she came in early.

When her mother picks her up from school, she confronts her about the affair she is having, and her mother promises to break it off. Drew then comes to visit her, and the two kiss. For a brief while Fay is content as her double disappears, and her parents seem more reconciled. She and Drew grow closer and have sex. However, after her father receives bad medical news, her mother reconciles with John. Walking home with Drew, Fay sees John's car smashed into a tree and the police officer on the scene tells her that a girl threw a rock at his car window, causing him to have an accident but her mother escaped uninjured. Fay believes that her twin attacked the car. Fay decides to take the day off from school and goes to visit John in the hospital. The next day at school Drew thanks Fay for a post coital picture of them he found in his locker. During rehearsals the principal, taking over for John tells Fay to say the lines the same way she did the day before. When Fay tells her she wasn't there, everyone tells her they saw her there.  Fay runs home where she tells her father she's going crazy, and he tells her that on the contrary he too can see her twin sister Lila. He warns her not to look Lila in the face as it will end her life. Fay goes to the underpass near her home and calls out to Lila asking her to leave the family alone and apologizing for her death.

She and her mother embrace.  Sometime later, it is the opening night of [[Macbeth]]. Backstage Fay's mother hugs her and tells her father would be proud of her.

The crew is visited by a man named Mr. Gaffney (Bill Lithgow), who tells the leader of the crew, Joel ([[Jeffrey Johnson (actor)|Jeffrey Johnson]]), that he knows of property back home where he fears evil spirits haunt the halls and attack humans. He then shows Joel a scar of where a ghost had scratched his chest, alarming the crew and solidifying their idea to investigate the area. Mr. Gaffney asks them to please get rid of the ghosts, though Joel tries to explain to him that they only investigate them and getting rid of ghosts is much more of a difficult challenge.  The crew travels to the area and they stop at a restaurant before heading to the haunted location, which is revealed to be an abandoned prison. Upon discussion, the locals inside the restaurant tell the crew to go back home and not to investigate the prison as it is too dangerous, though Kate (Linara Washington) explains that they are great at what they do and have no reason to worry.  Once at the prison, they are given a tour by Clive ([[Peter Mayer]]), a former worker. He also warns the crew to leave and not to proceed with their investigation. Joel explains them that they are "professionals" and will be alright. Clive tells them the story of a former prisoner who was very dangerous and deadly, serving time on the third floor of the prison. He tells them of the prisoner escaping from his cell and murdering another inmate by snapping his neck before biting off flesh.  Clive then takes the crew down to the [[infirmary]] where he tells the story of a doctor who paralyzed his inmate patients and then performed illegal experiments on them in hopes to fix their psyche. He explains that the legend says the doctor was eventually sent to prison himself and was killed by the inmates.  The crew then begins their overnight investigation of the prison. Kate watches over Joel, Roger (John Zderko), and Berger ([[Charley Koontz]]) as they move from room to room. When investigating the cell block, Roger is attacked by the ghost of a former prisoner. The ghost possesses Roger's body and creates large gashes and bruises on the side of his head. Berger and Joel rush Roger back to the video control room with Kate and decide to leave the prison, but discover that they are chain-locked in. They bandage up Roger, but realize that they don't have enough medical supplies, so they decide to go to the infirmary, where Berger is also attacked by ghosts and taken away.  Joel goes back to Kate and they decide it's best to go look for Berger, then come back for Roger and try finding a second way to escape the prison. Kate is also attacked by ghosts while searching for Berger in the cell block, but she gets away using a new device Roger purchased that disrupts ghost energy. However, the ghost possesses Roger's body, cornering Kate and Joel on the third floor of the prison. The ghost explains that him and the other spirits want the crew to bring them the doctor who tortured them. Joel and Kate try to tell the ghost that the doctor had been killed, but the ghost ignores them. Roger fights internally with the ghost and is able to speak with Joel and Kate, telling them that he can't have them hurt on his watch and ultimately hangs himself.  After mouring the loss of Roger, Joel and Kate begin their search for Berger again, finding him near the entryway. He explains that the ghosts dragged him away, but let him go. He tells Joel and Kate that he may have found a second way out. They follow Berger to an area of the grounds outside the prison, though still fenced in. Kate is able to find a signal on her cell phone out there and calls the police.  The next morning, the crew is let out of the prison and confronts Clive for locking them inside, but he insists it was not him. He compliments the crew on surviving as well as they did, despite losing a member to suicide. After the paramedics and police leave the area, the crew calls in Mr. Gaffney and asks him to come inside the prison to see if he notices any difference in the energy. He walks inside and explains that it felt different from they time he worked there.  Joel and Kate then begin to question him about his former job, and it is revealed that Mr. Gaffney was in the fact the doctor who tortured and sexually molested the inmates. He then begins to get angry at Joel and Kate when they explain that they did not get rid of the ghosts, but instead only investigated the prison to see if the ghosts were there for a reason. After the confrontation, Joel and Kate trick Mr. Gaffney, locking him inside the prison, where the ghosts are seen dragging him away from the doors. Joel, Kate, and Berger drive back to Los Angeles and vow to end the ''Ghost Sightings'' series.

Once released, Crunch works as a motorcycle daredevil alongside girlfriend Lola and an apprentice, Francie. Meanwhile, Nicky steals a painting by [[Georges Seurat]] with the help of a partner whom he double crosses. The partner seeks out and threatens Crunch to get information on Nicky's whereabouts. Shortly afterwards, Crunch informs an old colleague of his, 'Uncle' Paddy, that he's ready to work again. At Paddy's place, he and Francie run into Nicky.  'Uncle' Paddy explains that a priceless historical book needs to be stolen from a Customs warehouse in [[Canada]] and taken to the buyer's middle man in Detroit. The payout is over a million dollars so they agree. Crunch insists on recruiting an old partner, Guy de Cornet, for his skills and talent in [[forgery]]. Cornet creates an exact replica of the book which Crunch takes through the Canadian border station hidden inside a peculiar piece of art. An identity check prompts the police to impound his art, as planned, in the same facility where the historical book is being held. Meanwhile, Guy de Cornet passes as an art authentication expert and enters the facility, replacing the real book with the forgery and hiding the real book within Crunch's art piece. After Canadian border patrol clears Crunch's name, he goes to the facility and reclaims his art piece.  The team is in the process of taking the book to the buyer when Nicky persuades Crunch to keep the book and forge multiple duplicates to sell to multiple buyers at the same time, netting them several times the original payout. They run into a snag when Cornet reveals that in order for him to create forgeries that would pass such tests as carbon dating and professional scrutiny, they would need $750,000. Each person names an amount they could chip in and after some persuasion, Crunch agrees to fund the remaining amount. They agree not to contact one another until the required month has passed to conduct the transaction. Sometime during this month, Nicky secretly plots to create his own cheaper forgeries and beat his team at selling them to the same buyers. Nicky calls the original buyer and informs him that there will be a delay, but the buyer claims to know nothing about the deal. A frantic Nicky calls all people and organizations involved in the heist, learning to his dismay that they either could not be reached or had no knowledge of the book. Meanwhile, Crunch explains to his apprentice Francie how the historical book was a fabricated ploy and its true purpose was to steal the Georges Seurat painting from Nicky and make a great deal of money using Nicky's idea of multiple forgeries. Flashbacks reveal that Francie was the only one who did not know of the alternate plan. Meanwhile, Interpol receive an anonymous tip as to the whereabouts of Nicky and the painting that he stole from the partner that he double crossed earlier. The ending reveals the last player in Crunch's plan, an old reformed colleague of his by the name of Samuel Winters, who had been paired with the Interpol agent who had been watching them at the start of the plan.

One day, however, an accident leads to the fall of the wall, and later the sbornians begin to discover the modern customs. Two local musicians, Kraunus and Pletskaya, observe the reactions of their countrymen: while some quickly adopt foreign culture, others prefer to reaffirm the sbornians traditions and resist imperialism.<ref>[http://www.adorocinema.com/filmes/filme-222556/ Até que a Sbórnia nos Separe - Filme 2013 - AdoroCinema]</ref>  
Assault on Wall Street
 In the midst of the 2008 [[2007-2008 financial crises|financial crisis]], a portfolio-manager instructs his employees to neglect the best-interest of clients in order to increase company profits.  Meanwhile, Jim Baxford ([[Dominic Purcell]]), an [[Armored car (valuables)|armored car]] driver and former soldier, lives with his wife, Rosie, in New York City. Rosie is in the process of recovering from a near-fatal brain tumor. Their health insurance has reached its limit, and Jim finds that he is unable to afford her treatment. He decides to cash in the [[pension]] he earned from serving in the military, but learns that much of it is lost as a result of bad investments on the part of his financial adviser. In addition, he finds himself in a $60,000 lawsuit as a result of bad real-estate investments conducted by his rogue financial adviser.   Jim frequently lunches with a colleague in the armored car business, and two NYPD friends. He borrows $10,000 from the colleague to pay for an attorney to sue his financial adviser, and arranges a meeting with an assistant district attorney to discuss wrongdoings on the part of his financial advisers. However, the attorney he hired claims that he is unable to do anything and the assistant district attorney is unwilling to meet with him. Jim becomes frustrated at the loss of his money and his inability to pay for his wife's treatment and their mortgage. Because of his financial situation, his employer reluctantly fires him, as the company is not willing to trust him with large sums of money.  Rosie feels guilty for the financial strain that her illness has put on Jim and, unable to cope, commits suicide. Jim blames [[Wall Street]] financiers for ruining his life. Seeking vengeance, he purchases various firearms and grenades from an arms dealer, and begins a one-man army shooting spree on the Wall Street bosses that lost his money and contributed to the death of his wife. One by one, he kills those that have wronged him. Meeting with his friends at lunch, Jim casually admits to them that he is the Wall Street murderer. The three laugh it off, convinced he's joking.  The climax of the film has Jim staging a one-man assault and infiltration of a high-rise office building to confront and kill Jeremy Stancroft, a ruthless and greedy banker who is indirectly responsible for Jim's financial situation. Sitting at Jeremy's desk, Jim tells Jeremy why he is targeting him, of his corruption and asks why he should let Jeremy live. Jeremy defends his actions, saying that the famous rich people of history didn't get rich by honest work and that [[capitalism]] is a [[survival of the fittest]] society, where the "strong survive and the weak die off". Jim shows him a picture of his wife and tells Jeremy he's the reason his wife is dead. Shortly as [[SWAT]] begins to approach the office, Jim puts the gun on the table and counts to three. Jeremy grabs the gun when Jim gets to two, bragging about how he "won". Jim accuses him of cheating. Not caring, Jeremy pulls the trigger, only to realize that the gun is empty, for Jim cheated too. Just then, SWAT smashes the window and shoots Jeremy dead. Jim pretends to be an innocent wounded victim, having been shot in the arm by a security guard earlier, and is escorted away by SWAT, who is convinced Stancroft was the perpetrator.  A few minutes later, Jim stands in the lobby of the office building. He watches emergency personnel come and go, having just been treated for the gunshot wound to his arm. He is recognized there by his NYPD lunchmates, who had been called to the scene. Without a word, Jim is led out of the building by his friend to the street, to freedom. The film ends with Jim walking away, voicing over that he intends to continue his killing spree of white-collar businessmen elsewhere.<ref></ref>  
Astronaut: The Last Push
 The film opens with a montage of footage which include greetings from Earth and an interview of the sponsor of the mission. Astronauts Nathan Miller and Michael Forrest are onboard Life One, a [[spacecraft]] built by Moffit Industries. They are supposed to be in hibernation for 6 years until they reach [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], taking a route around [[Venus]], sling-shotting around [[Earth]] to gain speed to get to Europa.   Midway through the first leg of their journey, Life One's proximity sensors sound; the ship is impacted and Michael Forrest is awakened. Michael escapes and seals the damaged hibernation and re-entry capsule with Nathan still inside. The habitation module Michael escapes to is leaking oxygen and is quickly repaired. Michael then makes contact with mission control. Aside from damage to the hibernation and re-entry capsule, along with engine control, the ship is intact.  Michael struggles to stay sane in the solitude while attempting to make repairs to Life One in order to fire the engines after swinging around Venus. Without the engines firing, Life One would stay in orbit around Venus. Mission control and Michael keep in regular contact, with Michael giving regular status reports on himself, and mission control giving encouragement and help in repairing the ship. Michael grows more frustrated over time as the repairs prove ineffective during engine tests. During one of the engine tests, the ship suffers a complete power failure. Michael desperately attempts to restore power but slowly loses hope as time progresses, the repairs fail to restore power, and the ship becomes cold. After a hallucination of his fellow astronaut jolts him awake, he makes one final effort to repair the ship which proves successful.  As the ship rounds Venus, Michael dons his space suit and re-enters the damaged hibernation capsule for the first time since the accident. He looks out of the window in awe at the sight of Venus' atmosphere below him. After passing Venus, he successfully ignites the engines and is two years away from Earth. On arriving at Earth he only has to reignite the engines to slow the ship down for a re-entry, but chooses not to. He instead chooses to [[Gravity assist|slingshot]] past Earth per the original mission, and go to Europa, stating "Someone's supposed to go, Someone's supposed to see this". The film closes with him addressing Earth, as he ejects the hibernation capsule (along with Nathan) sending it to Earth, then reigniting the engines to take him to Europa.

Gautham tries to woo Prameela, but gives up when he learns that she is in love with another man. Sashi hates Gautham and is suspicious of him and Paddu, his friend and a nurse who is appointed to take care of Rajasekhar.  Sunanda later reveals to Gautham that she is aware of his real identity much before the incidents, and warns him to abstain from doing anything with the intention of taking her back to Raghunandan.  To save Prameela's love, Gautham and Paddu go to a village and accidentally, Sashi falls into the jeep due to a head injury, thus suffering with amnesia.

Atlantic Rim (film)
 Following the mysterious disappearance of an [[oil platform|oil rig]] and a reconnaissance mini-submarine in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], scientist Dr. Margaret Adams initiates the Armada Program, which consists of giant robots designed for deep sea rescue. The three robots — piloted by Red, Tracy and Jim — dive nearly 800 fathoms to the sea bed, where they not only discover the mangled remains of the oil rig, but encounter the monster that brought it down. Red pursues the monster, against orders from Admiral Hadley, prompting the Admiral to order every naval fleet on the East Coast to converge on the oil rig's site. Red emerges on a beach to warn the bystanders to leave the area; he is suddenly attacked from behind by the monster as their fight takes its toll on the city. An [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F-18 Hornet]] piloted by Spitfire assists Red in taking the monster down. Red, however, is arrested for disobeying a direct order. He is locked in solitary confinement until he is briefly released by Adm. Hadley and later given a medal of honor for his heroic actions, before serving the rest of his confinement.  Later, Adm. Hadley is informed by Sheldon Geise of a top-secret sonar program that discovered the monsters, which are hundreds of millions of years old and lay their eggs on a mixture of crude oil and saltwater. Two eggs have been discovered, one of which hatched into the monster that Red and Spitfire killed. Adm. Hadley orders a search for the other egg, but he is too late, as it has already hatched, with the secomd monster, much bigger than the first, feeding on the corpse of the first monster and destroying a whole naval fleet before wreaking havoc on the city. As the monster attacks the naval base, Tracy and Jim scramble to spring Red out of solitary before they are picked up by Lt. Wexler. Meanwhile, Geise informs Adm. Hadley that the President has authorized a nuclear strike on the monster, but Adm. Hadley defies that decision and orders everyone to evacuate the base. The monster retreats after a [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit]] drops a payload on it. Adm. Hadley is later informed that another egg has hatched off the Atlantic Coast.  Dr. Adams gives the trio special "halo" headbands that neurally link them to their robots, increasing their reflexes by using their direct body movements instead of joysticks. The system's downside is the pilot feeling pain for every damage the robot takes. After a crash course on the new system, the trio fly their robots to [[New York City]] to battle the monster. Following numerous refusals by Adm. Hadley to launch a nuclear strike, Geise orders the ''[[USS Virginia (SSN-774)|USS Virginia]]'' to launch a warhead. Red intercepts the missile and jams its frequency, saving the city from a nuclear holocaust. In retaliation, Geise threatens to shut down the robots, but is quickly subdued by Lt. Wexler, despite shooting the Admiral in the arm. During the battle, Tracy loses consciousness when her neural level goes critical. Jim takes Tracy to safety while Red grabs the warhead and the monster before flying them to the atmosphere. He then kicks the monster to deep space, detonating the warhead in the process and sending him crashing back to Earth. The trio and Adm. Hadley celebrate by heading to the local bar for some tequila shots.  
The Attorney
 In 1978, a former judge named Song moves to [[Busan]] to start his own law firm. The other lawyers look down on him because he had passed the bar-examination without ever going to university. Soon, however, he becomes rich from accepting the cases which his colleagues shun, even though they are the most profitable, such as [[real estate]] and [[taxation]]. Meanwhile, a [[detective]] named Cha is given orders from the highest levels of leadership to purge Busan of [[communism|communists]], even if it means resorting to fabrication. A [[medical officer]] from a nearby military base, Lt Yoon, is sent to oversee the health of the victims whom Cha's agents will [[torture]].  Years later, in 1981, Song is enjoying his new-found fame and respect, and he even buys a sail-boat with the hope of competing in the [[1988 Seoul Olympics]]. One night, while dining at his favorite restaurant with his high school classmates, he gets into a fight with a [[journalism|journalist]] named Lee who sympathizes with the frequent student protests, and who claims that the mass media is inherently deceptive. A short time later, a high-school student named Park, the son of the restaurant's owner, goes missing. Choi, the mother, frantically searches for him for nearly two months, even closing the restaurant, before it is revealed that Park and some other students are to face a trial for [[sedition]].  Realizing that the students' confessions were extracted using torture, Song agrees to take the case. At the trial, he notices a number of violations of the Korean constitution, but is told by the [[prosecutors]] and the [[judge]] that normal laws don't apply in cases of [[national security]]. The prosecutors begin by arguing that the students studied a book called ''[[What Is History?]]'' by [[EH Carr]]. In response, Song gets a note from the British consulate attesting that EH Carr was a British [[ambassador]], not a communist ideologue. Song is stunned, however, when Cha openly [[perjury|lies on the stand]] and denies that the defendants were tortured, claiming rather brazenly that all of their bruises and other injuries were [[self-harm|self-inflicted]].  A breakthrough happens when Lt Yoon agrees to testify. Lt Yoon confesses to the court that the defendants were tortured and is willing to describe the methods of their torture in detail. However, Cha reports the situation to his leadership, and they are able to frame Lt Yoon for desertion, thereby nullifying his testimony and sending him off to prison. The case is lost but the judge offers leniency by giving the students 2 years in prison at most.  By 1987, Song is a changed man and has become a protest leader himself. One day he is arrested for his activities and charged with sedition. To his amazement, 99 out of the 142 lawyers in Busan attend his hearing and express their support. Even so, free speech and the rule of law remain controversial subjects in Korea up to the present day.

August: Osage County (film)
 The title designates time and location: an unusually hot August in a rural area outside [[Pawhuska, Oklahoma]]. Beverly Weston ([[Sam Shepard]]), an alcoholic, once-noted poet, interviews and hires a young [[Cheyenne]] woman Johnna ([[Misty Upham]]) as a live-in cook and caregiver for his strong-willed and contentious wife Violet ([[Meryl Streep]]), who is suffering from [[oral cancer]] and addiction to narcotics. Shortly after this, he disappears from the house, and Violet calls her sister and daughters for support. Her sister Mattie Fae ([[Margo Martindale]]) arrives with husband Charles Aiken ([[Chris Cooper]]). Violet's middle daughter Ivy ([[Julianne Nicholson]]) is single and the only one living locally; Barbara ([[Julia Roberts]]), her oldest, who has inherited her mother's mean streak, arrives from Colorado with her husband Bill ([[Ewan McGregor]]) and 14-year-old daughter Jean ([[Abigail Breslin]]). Barbara and Bill are separated, but they put up a united front for Violet.  After five days, the sheriff arrives with the news that Beverly took his boat out on the lake and has drowned. Youngest daughter Karen ([[Juliette Lewis]]) arrives with the latest in a string of boyfriends, Steve Huberbrecht ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), a sleazy Florida businessman whom she introduces as her fiancé. Mattie Fae and Charles's shy, awkward son "Little Charles" ([[Benedict Cumberbatch]]) misses the funeral because he overslept and is met at the bus station by his father. Charles loves his son, whereas Mattie constantly belittles him. Ivy confides to Barbara that she is in love with her cousin, "Little Charles", who plans to move to New York, and she cannot have children because she had a hysterectomy. She feels this is her only chance to finally marry.  The family sits down to dinner after the funeral, fueled by Violet's brutal "truth telling", which results in Barbara pouncing on her mother. She decides she has had enough of her mother's drug addiction and confiscates all her several kinds of pills. Later, after Violet has had a chance to sober up, she has a tender moment with her daughters and shares a story that demonstrates how cruel her own mother was when she longed for a new pair of cowgirl boots when she was in her early teens.  As "Little Charles" sings Ivy a song he has written for her, Mattie Fae walks in and berates him. This exhausts Charles's patience with his wife's lack of love and compassion for her son, and he threatens to leave her if she keeps it up.  Mattie subsequently reveals to Barbara, who unintentionally listened in, that she had a long-ago affair with Beverly, and Charles is in fact their younger half-brother and that is the true reason why Ivy and "Little Charles" cannot be together.  That evening, Steve and Jean are playfully sharing a joint of marijuana. Johnna sees this and, sensing that he intends to molest her, goes after him with a shovel. Barbara confronts Jean and slaps her. This compels Bill to take Jean back to Colorado, leaving Barbara. Karen also leaves with Steve.  Later, Ivy tries to tell her mother about her love for "Little Charles". Barbara tries to deflect the admission. Violet tells Ivy that Charles is actually her brother, something Violet knew all along. Ivy leaves and promises to never come back. In the last confrontation between Violet and Barbara, Violet admits she was contacted by Beverly from his motel the week after he had left home, but did nothing to help him until after she removed money from the couple's joint safe deposit box. By this time he had already drowned. This revelation leads Barbara to depart, realizing that her mother has slipped beyond help. Violet is left with only Johnna.  Barbara is driving through the plains, stops, gets out of the car, cries then gets back in the car and follows signage showing highways and number of miles to Wichita, Salina and Denver.  
Aurangzeb (film)
  The story is set in the town of [[Gurgaon]], an industrial city near NCT Delhi. The film is presented from the view of ACP Arya Phogat ([[Prithviraj Sukumaran]]). ACP Arya, a police officer, has been brought up by his uncle, DCP Ravikant Phogat ([[Rishi Kapoor]]). His father, police inspector Vijaykant Phogat ([[Anupam Kher]]), had lost interest in life years back, after messing up an operation to kill Yashvardhan Singh ([[Jackie Shroff]]), due to lack of evidence against him. Yashvardhan’s wife, Veera ([[Tanvi Azmi]]), had become a police informer against her own husband and had to run away from him with one of her twin children Vishal ([[Arjun Kapoor]]) while Ajay is left with Yashvardhan. Vijaykant hides Vishal and Veera – whom he has begun to love – and passes it off as a botched encounter for which he takes the entire blame. Suspended from the police force, Vijaykant has a tough time over the years, caught between the love for his real family and son ACP Arya, and his adopted wife and son. Years later, just before he dies, he reveals to Arya that he has another wife and kid but doesn't reveal their real identity. Vijaykant dies few days later and Arya goes to meet Veera. There he is shocked to see Vishal, who is the exact replica of Ajay ([[Arjun Kapoor]]).  Ravikant, who is corrupt to the core, hatches a plot to expose the criminal activities of Yashvardhan, a mission left incomplete by his brother Vijaykant. He joins forces with nephew Arya and convinces Vishal to enter Yashvardhan’s house, posing as Ajay. To facilitate matters, Ajay is kidnapped by Ravikant and Arya and held captive by them, paving the way for Vishal to take his place and leak information about Yashvardhan's illegal activities to the police. Vishal has to pose as Ajay not just in front of his own father, Yashvardhan, but also in front of Neena Wadhwa ([[Amrita Singh]]), Yashvardhan's paramour and business partner. Vishal also has to feign an affair with his twin brother’s girlfriend, Ritu ([[Sashaa Agha]]). As days pass, Vishal falls in love with Ritu. Vishal keeps leaking information about his dad to Ravikant and Arya, who move forward in their exposé with the help of the incriminating evidence. On the other hand, Ravikant and Arya unite Ajay with mother Veera and also try to brainwash him (Ajay) into spilling the beans about his father’s illegal businesses before them.  Over time, Vishal develops a soft corner for his father and pleads for his safety from police. He also wins the confidence of his father, who is unaware that Vishal has replaced Ajay in the house. Calamity befalls Yashvardhan because of action initiated by Ravikant, and he has to be hospitalised. Vishal manipulates things in such a way that Neena has to resign from Yashvardhan Singh’s company. Even as the tension between Arya and foster-brothers Ajay and Vishal refuses to be diffused, the task before Ravikant and Arya becomes very difficult. To make matters more difficult for Ravikant, his son-in-law, Vishnu ([[Sumeet Vyas]]), lays his hands on evidence against Ravikant’s equally corrupt police officer-son, Inspector Dev ([[Sikandar Kher]]). Since Vishnu is the only honest cop in the family, he threatens to expose brother-in-law Dev and in order to prevent this Ravikant kills Vishnu. Ravikant also plans to take over Yashvardhan's empire with help from Neena. Ravikant orders Arya to kill Veera and Ajay. Arya, disillusioned by Ravikant's inhuman attitude, finally understands the choice his father Vijaykant made earlier to protect Vishal and his mother.  Meanwhile, Vishal is called for a meeting by Neena and her new partner, Bilal. Ravikant wants Vishal to use the meeting to give him more information about Yashvardhan. Ravikant plans things in such a way that Yashvardhan would be killed once the meeting between Vishal and Neena is over. Arya realises that Ravikant wants to eliminate Yashvardhan not as much to complete brother Vijaykant’s mission as to take over Yashvardhan’s business empire. Also, Vishal has revenge written all over him because Neena’s son, Inder ([[Kavi Shastri]]), had killed Ritu. Here, Ajay finally relents and agrees to help Arya but he also wants his dad, Yashvardhan’s safety. Arya asks Ajay to attend the meeting in place of Vishal.  Ajay kills Inder and when Inder's gang tries to kill Ajay, Arya's police team encounters all. Meanwhile, Arya has sent Vishal to the Hospital to save Yashvardhan. He also arranges his Police force to raid the Hospital. However Dev sends back the team. He later corners Vishal and Yashvardhan in the Hospital Store Room. Just when Dev was about to kill them, Ajay appears and shoots him. Ajay and Yashvardhan convinces Vishal to escape. Just when Vishal escapes Dev shoots and kills Yashvardhan. In retaliation Ajay kills Dev. When Dev's team was about to kill Ajay, Arya's police force rescues him by arresting Ajay. Arya helps Vishal and Veera escape. Ravikant meets Arya and Arya informs that he has the recordings of Neena's meeting which will expose Ravikant. Ravikant shoots Arya and just when he was about to kill him Vishal comes back and kills Ravikant.  Arya, even though injured, rides back to his pregnant wife Suman ([[Swara Bhaskar]]). Vishal and Veera get back to their earlier life while Ajay is jailed. The film then moves one year forward where we are shown that Ajay has re-united with Vishal and Veera once he is released from jail. We also hear a voiceover of Arya saying "This system of collection has been in place for years. The money from this system goes all the way up to the seniors and ministers. The nexus is not going to come to an end with just my Uncle's death. The DCP said that only two powers would survive - the politicians and the corporates. But if a policeman doesn't take bribes from any of them then he won't fear them either." In the final scene we see Arya leaving Veera's home once he makes sure that Ajay is re-united with his family.  
Austenland (film)
 Jane Hayes (Russell) is a single 30-something American woman obsessed with [[Jane Austen]], especially [[Colin Firth]]'s portrayal of [[Mr. Darcy]] in the [[Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV series)|1995 BBC version of ''Pride and Prejudice'']] who wishes for a nice Englishman of her own. After yet another failed relationship, Jane decides to blow her entire savings on a once-in-a-lifetime trip to a [[Jane Austen]]–themed resort in England.  The resort seems like the perfect escape from 21st-century life. The guests at Austenland, which is run by the prickly Mrs. Wattlesbrook (Seymour), are assigned pseudonyms, dress in period costume, and conduct themselves like ladies of the [[Regency era]]. They live without modern conveniences (though the plumbing is modern). Activities offered at the resort include needlepoint, riding, reading, shooting, and entertaining the other guests through musical performances or theatrics. At the conclusion of each guest's stay, a ball is held ... romance guaranteed! The highlight of the resort is the score of attractive young gentlemen actors who attend to the female guests—though no touching is allowed.  Upon her arrival, Jane realizes that, while she could only afford the cheapest "copper" package, the other guests—including Ms. "Elizabeth Charming" (Coolidge), an absurd and extremely wealthy American woman who has never read any of Jane Austen's books—have all purchased the most expensive "platinum" option. Although she quickly befriends Martin, the resort's chauffeur, Jane is treated with disrespect and disdain by Mrs. Wattlesbrook, who prefers the resort's wealthier guests despite their ridiculousness. While the other guests are given a wide choice of elaborate costumes and shown to luxurious rooms, Jane is given a plain dress and a sparsely-decorated chamber in the "creepy tower" of the servants' quarters.  At dinner on their first night, Jane and Elizabeth are introduced to the gentlemen of the house: Colonel Andrews (Callis), a silly and obsequious character who seems to love his job, and Mr. Henry Nobley (Feild), Mrs. Wattlesbrook's sternly handsome—albeit unenthusiastic—nephew. They are also introduced to another platinum level, long-term guest, who has been given the name Lady Amelia Hartwright (King). Amelia and Elizabeth flirt openly with Nobley throughout dinner, while Jane finds him rather disagreeable. Their argument mirrors the one had by [[Elizabeth Bennet]] and Mr. Darcy upon their first meeting in [[Pride and Prejudice]]. Ultimately, Jane is humiliated by Mrs. Wattlesbrook and leaves the table.  Throughout her experience at Austenland, Jane becomes somewhat disenchanted with the Regency era. She is self-conscious of her costume and treatment, bored without technology, and her modern independence is often at odds with expected behavior. The silliness of the guests and actors also acts as a mirror to her own formerly-obsessive behavior.    Jane again feels left out the following morning during a walk around the grounds. After leaving the group to seek solace with a book in the stables, she is discovered by Martin (McKenzie). Martin flirts with her, but the two are interrupted by Elizabeth, Nobley, and Colonel Andrews, who arrive with news of an upcoming hunt. Martin's attentions to Jane during the pheasant shooting incites Nobley's jealousy; Jane's surprising skill in turn incites Amelia's. When Jane is forced to walk back to the house in the rain, she is rescued by Nobley. That evening, Jane becomes bored of the group's card games and leaves the house for a walk around the grounds. She runs into Martin; after flirting and witnessing the birth of a foal in the stables, they kiss. The following afternoon, Jane convinces Martin to break the rules: they take a rowboat out on the canal and spend the afternoon together.  The following day, the party is disrupted by the sudden arrival of another actor, the handsome and flashy Captain East. Everyone except Nobley is impressed by the Captain, who in turn seems taken with Jane. Martin witnesses the Captain making a pass at Jane from a distance. When Jane comes to visit him in the stables, he rebuffs her for "parading around" with the actors. When she asks if he is breaking up with her, he replies that they were never "going steady." Jane is left alone, angry and confused.  The next day finds the actors and staff relaxing by the staff swimming pool, where Nobley's dislike of the self-absorbed George ("Captain East") is evident. Martin nonchalantly asks the other men's opinion of "that girl Jane," indicating that he likes her despite their argument.  Later that day, in the retiring room, Mrs. Wattlesbrook demands that Jane play the piano for the group. Frustrated by Mrs. Wattlesbrook's behavior, Jane defiantly chooses to play and sing the only song she knows -- "[[Hot in Herre]]"—before leaving the room. On her way to find Martin in the stables, Jane is stopped by Nobley, who knows about her dalliance with Martin and who insists upon the impropriety of a lady being alone at night, "let alone cavorting with the servants." His attitude frustrates Jane and leads to an argument. Back at the house, Jane is accosted by a drunken Mr. Wattlesbrook. She fights off his attempted assault, which draws the attention of Nobley and Captain Andrews.  Frustrated, Jane decides to take her "story" into her own hands and make her trip a growing experience. She asks Elizabeth for help and the two of them steal some of Amelia's extensive wardrobe of costumes. Jane wows the group with her charm and new-found boldness, but her stay at Austenland is threatened when Mrs. Wattlesbrook discovers her cell phone, which Jane had smuggled into her room at the start of her stay. Just when Mrs. Wattlesbrook is ready to evict Jane, Amelia surprises everyone and steps in to save her. In exchange, Amelia blackmails Jane into creating situations in which she and Captain East can be alone together.  Jane pairs with Nobley for the final play to allow Amelia time with Captain East. During rehearsals Jane and Nobley discover their mutual honest affection for the Austen era, for which Jane now has a healthier level of appreciation. The pair genuinely enjoy working with each other during the disastrous play (during which Elizabeth accidentally injures Amelia's eye), after the conclusion of which, Jane and Nobley sneak off to Jane's room, where Nobley confesses that he feels something for her and requests a dance during the final ball.  At the ball, Nobley draws Jane to a private balcony where he confesses his love for her. Disillusioned with "the game" after watching the other actors fulfill their guests' fantasies with elaborate (fake) proclamations of love and proposals of marriage during the ball, Jane decides she would rather have something "real" over the perfect Darcy fantasy with which she's finally been presented and leaves Nobley to spend the rest of the evening with Martin.  As their Austen experience has come to a close, Elizabeth decides to extend her trip to make sure the next batch of ladies knows Colonel Andrews is now hers. Jane is reluctant to tell her that Andrews is a gay actor, and not actually in love with Elizabeth. Jane and Amelia leave the house together. Upon departing, Jane is amazed to discover that Amelia is, in fact, an American, who visits Austenland yearly to distract herself from her marriage to a wealthy old man, and that Nobley is the one who had asked Amelia to pretend Jane's phone was hers to prevent Jane being sent away. As Jane leaves, Mrs. Wattlesbrook informs Jane that Nobley was not "assigned" to her—Martin was. Martin was actually an actor, meaning that his romance with Jane was fully scripted. Angry at being duped and suspecting that she is not the first guest to be assaulted by Mr. Wattlesbrook, Jane threatens to sue Mrs. Wattlesbrook and shut down Austenland.  Martin is sent to the airport on Mrs. Wattlesbrook's orders in an attempt to smooth things over. As Jane dismisses Martin's scripted claims of love, Nobley appears and pleads with Jane to believe that his own affections for her were genuine, but she doesn't believe him either. When the two start fighting in the middle of the airport, Jane dismisses them both, triumphantly declaring herself to be "over it all." When Nobley tries once more to express his feelings, Jane thanks him for being "perfect" and leaves in good spirits.  Back home, Jane clears out the remains of her Darcy collection (including photos, stuffed animals, and life-sized cardboard cutouts).  Nobley shocks Jane by appearing at the front door of her apartment, having traveled all the way across the Atlantic to return her sketchpad and profess his feelings once more. Jane, dubious of his intentions, tells him he needn't have come all that way—she wasn't going to press charges against his aunt. He explains that his name truly is Henry Nobley, that he is a history professor, and that he only agreed to work for his aunt as a favor to her so he could experience the Austen era, a time when love and life were simple. Jane finally believes him and they kiss.  In the post-credits scene, it is revealed that Elizabeth has bought Austenland and turned it into a theme park. Jane and Nobley are among the guests, obviously very much in love. Mr. Wattlesbrook now works as a garbage picker, Captain East does a strip show of which Amelia is a keen fan, and Elizabeth is living the dream, surrounded by handsome footmen, as well as keeping Colonel Andrews as her co-host/companion. Martin is seen attempting to pick up women as he drives a buggy around the grounds, but they all snub him.  
Avenged (2013 South African film)
 Chili Ngcobo, an undercover cop, blows his cover and is captured by a gang.  Chili frees himself and radios his partner for help, not realizing that Shoes' pistol has been sent in for repair.  Shoes insists they call for backup, but Chili refuses, as he does not want to share the large reward for the gang's leader.  With Shoes' tactical guidance, Chili takes down the entire gang despite having only two bullets.  When they bring in the gang leader, Captain Stone withholds the reward unless they will set free a suspected rapist who is politically connected.  Shoes is surprised when Chili suggests that they agree to the deal, and he refuses to compromise his principles.  Chili later comes to Shoes for help.  Mambane, a crime boss that the two have been investigating for several years, has a major heist planned.  Initially assuming that Chili intends to infiltrate the gang, Shoes comes to realize that Chili instead wants to cut him into the heist itself, after which can they arrest the gangsters at their leisure.  Shoes reluctantly agrees after Chili promises that no one will be hurt.  However, one of the gangsters, Skroef, becomes suspicious when he recognizes Chili from another undercover operation that resulted in his arrest.  The other crew consists of G8 and Warren, two mercenaries who worked together in an unsuccessful heist and now hate each other; Stakes and his lover Gugu, who is Mambane's daughter; Kenny, a failed actor who knows explosives; and Slim, a dim gangster.  Knowing that he needs to get rid of Skroef, Chili sends Shoes to arrest him.  The next day, while the criminals discuss the heist, Skroef shows up with Shoes, whom he has captured, and says that one of the crew is an undercover cop.  Chili convinces Mambane that their inside man, a security guard, is the culprit.  Their ire now redirected toward the guard, Chili convinces Mambane to spare Shoes' life to use him as a hostage despite Skroef's insistence that they kill Shoes immediately.  While the others are asleep, Chili tries to slip a small knife to Shoes, who says he will not go along with any plan that involves the murder of a security guard.  Skroef catches the two talking and instantly attacks Chili, whom he accuses of being an undercover cop.  Mambane threatens to kill both men but admits that he needs them to perform the heist.  Worried that the police may be on to their plans, Mambane advances the heist to the next day over the objections of G8, who advises that they abort.  At the last moment, Chili has second thoughts and attempts to warn off the armored truck that they have targeted.  Although the heist is successful, several members of the crew die, and G8 is wounded.  When they return to their base, Stakes and Gugu betray the others and attempt to run off with the money; as Skroef kills both, Chili arrives and takes the money.  G8 stalks Chili while Mambane and Skroef attempt to kill Shoes, who has overpowered Kenny and taken his weapon.  Using radios, Shoes and Chili warn each other of enemy movements and kill all their opponents but Skroef.  Skroef uses a radio to locate Shoes' position and wounds him.  Desperate to save his partner, Chili leaps from a higher floor onto Skroef, using the money bag as both a shield and cushion.  Both men are temporarily stunned by the collision, though Chili recovers enough to use the money bag to smother Skroef.  Chili realizes that the money is finally his.  However, the next day, he goes to the bank and drops the money bag off.  The film ends as he and Shoes return to their jobs as policemen.

Avalokitesvara (film)
 The film is set in China during the reign of [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Emperor Wuzong]] of the [[Tang dynasty]]. Prince [[Emperor Xuānzong of Tang|Li Yi]], a relative of the emperor, has been sickly since childhood. His mother, [[Empress Dowager Zheng|Lady Zheng]], commissions Yu Xiufeng, a craftsman from Mount Meicen ([[Mount Putuo]]), to create a porcelain figurine of [[Avalokiteśvara]] ([[Guanyin]]) so that she can pray to the [[bodhisattva]] to bless her son with good health. On the day the figurine is completed, Yu Xiufeng and his grandson, Haisheng, discover a baby girl in a lotus pond. Yu Xiufeng adopts the baby girl as his granddaughter and names her "Lianmei" ("Lotus Sister"). The figurine is taken to [[Mount Wutai]] and enshrined in a Buddhist temple there.  In 845 CE, Emperor Wuzong orders the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]] because he thinks that Buddhism is corrupting the masses. He also senses that Li Yi will become a threat to him, so he sends General Yuchi to assassinate the prince. At the same time, Reverend Wuchen asks Yu Xiufeng to collect the figurine from Mount Wutai and hide it at Mount Meicen. During the journey, Yu Xiufeng and his grandchildren meet Hui'e, a Japanese Buddhist monk sent by [[Tachibana no Kachiko|Empress Tachibana]] to find and bring the figurine to Japan. As Lady Zheng had secretly tasked General Yuchi's deputy, General Sima, with protecting her son, General Sima saves Li Yi when General Yuchi is about to kill him. General Sima defeats General Yuchi in a duel and wants to finish him off, but Lianmei stops him and asks him to spare General Yuchi. Li Yi and General Sima accompany Yu Xiufeng, Lianmei and Haisheng as they bring the figurine back to Mount Meicen. Hui'e finds out later and makes his way to Mount Meicen too.  General Yuchi tracks down Li Yi with the help of Governor Song, the governor of Mingzhou (modern [[Ningbo]]). To buy time for Li Yi and General Sima to escape, Lianmei and Haisheng disguise themselves to divert the pursuers' attention elsewhere, while Yu Xiufeng stays behind to distract Governor Song. The governor kills Yu Xiufeng when the latter refuses to reveal Li Yi's whereabouts, while General Yuchi goes after Lianmei and Haisheng – only to find out that he has been tricked. In the meantime, Hui'e finds the figurine and tries to sneak away with it. When Haisheng and Lianmei return home, they are horrified to see their grandfather dead. Haisheng sees Hui'e fleeing and immediately suspects that Hui'e killed his grandfather and stole the figurine, so he chases Hui'e, catches up with him, and starts beating him. Lianmei stops Haisheng and tells him she believes Hui'e when he claims he is innocent. However, she refuses to let Hui'e take the figurine with him. Hui'e feels so ashamed of himself that he gives up and returns to Japan.  Lianmei and Haisheng are captured later at a roadblock in Mingzhou by Governor Song, who seizes the figurine from them. The governor then tries to bribe General Yuchi to help him cover up for his failure to hunt down Li Yi, but General Yuchi refuses and accuses him of corruption. Meanwhile, Haisheng escapes from the prison and drags Lianmei along with him. General Yuchi is furious when he learns of their escape and orders the other prisoners to be executed. However, Lianmei succeeds in convincing Haisheng to go back to the prison with her because she knows what would happen if they escaped. General Yuchi is so impressed by Lianmei's act of sacrifice that he spares the prisoners.  General Yuchi sets a trap to lure Li Yi out of hiding. He announces that Lianmei and Haisheng will be executed for helping a fugitive escape, and predicts that Li Yi will come to save them. As expected, Li Yi appears and turns himself in to General Yuchi in exchange for Lianmei and Haisheng's release. However, General Sima also shows up and fights with General Yuchi and his soldiers to save Li Yi. Just then, a messenger arrives with an imperial edict announcing that Emperor Wuzong is dead and that Li Yi will succeed him. General Yuchi commits suicide in shame for failing to complete his mission. Li Yi returns to the palace for his coronation, while Lianmei and Haisheng bring the figurine back to Mount Wutai.  Hui'e travels to China again later to ask for the figurine. Reverend Wuchen initially rejects his request. However, Hui'e eventually manages to convince everyone of his sincerity by kneeling outside the temple for several days, so Reverend Wuchen allows him to bring the figurine to Japan. When Hui'e's ship sails past Mount Meicen, Lianmei rows towards the ship on a raft because she cannot bear to see the figurine leave. A fierce storm suddenly breaks out and causes the figurine to be cast overboard. When the storm has subsided, Hui'e is deeply saddened to learn that Lianmei and the figurine are lost at sea. Just then, lotuses appear all over the water surface. Hui'e sees a vision of Lianmei as Avalokiteśvara on Mount Meicen, and realises that he is not destined to bring the figurine back to Japan. However, he can bring back the virtues embodied by the bodhisattva – such as compassion and mercy – and impart them to his people.

Later, a group of friends, led by Brian, are brought to the same cabin by a guide, who is apprehensive about being in the area. After settling in, Brian mentions that the reason he got the cabin for such a low price is because it supposedly once belonged to a family that was massacred by the Axeman, an unidentified serial killer whose reign of terror ended as mysteriously as it started. When the discussion concludes, Randy goes off to spy on Vivian, and is murdered by the Axeman, who rips his head off.  The next morning, Doug gets into an argument with his girlfriend, Cassidy, accusing her of still having feelings for her ex, Brian, who is now dating Cassidy's best friend, Stacy.

While looking for somewhere to hide the cash, Doug is impaled and dismembered by the Axeman, his death going unnoticed by his friends, who are searching for Randy. Everyone soon regroups at the cabin, and Cassidy, unsatisfied with every explanation that they can come up with for why Randy, and now Doug, are gone, leaves to continue searching for them alone.  Tammy enters the garage, where she uncovers the robbers' money, and is forced to hide when the Axeman enters with her girlfriend, Liz, who he has fatally wounded. Before he can finish Liz off, the Axeman is distracted by a knock on the door, and answers it to reveal it is the sheriff, who he identifies himself to as "Bill".

Baadshah ([[N. T. Rama Rao Jr.]]) enters the underworld for his father Dhanraj ([[Mukesh Rishi]]). In the opening scene, Sadhu Bhai's partner, Crazy Robert ([[Ashish Vidhyarthi]]), captures Baadshah and his father as Baadshah revolts against Sadhu Bhai. But Baadshah easily defeats Crazy Robert's goons. However, Baadshah learns that both the Indian police, led by ACP Aadi ([[Navdeep]]) and IG Ramchandar ([[Sayaji Shinde]]), and the Hong Kong police are looking for him and he tries to find a solution for that.  The story cuts to [[Milan]], [[Italy]] where Janaki ([[Kajal Agarwal]]) is a social worker who has just finished her interior designing course. She lives there with her uncle, Pilli Gopi Krishna Simha ([[Tanikella Bharani]]), and cousins, Inky and Pinky. She meets Baadshah alias Rama Rao when he acts as if he is attempting suicide (to get her attention) as his fake, imaginary girlfriend Saira Bhanu dumped him. Janaki, who is not aware of the truth, asks him to spend a day with her, in return she will give him a hope for life. Janaki introduces him to various people who attempted suicide but found hope for life through Janaki's inspiration, one of whom is Dasu ([[Vennela Kishore]]), who wasn't actually suicidal and is a laid off slacker. But Rama Rao immediately discovers Dasu's true nature and buys him off to help him in making Janaki fall in love with him.  Meanwhile, Ramchandar leads a police funeral for DIG Balram ([[Nagendra Babu]]), who was murdered in the line of duty. ACP Aadi speaks a few words at the funeral and promises in front of the media that he will catch Baadshah at any cost, who Aadi and the police force believe killed Balram. Aadi swears he will avenge Balram's death. On the other hand, Baadshah fights off Sadhu Bhai's henchman, Rakhi Rasul ([[Supreeth]]), who comes looking for him. But one of Baadshah's right-hand men is killed by Crazy Robert when he refuses to give information about Baadshah. This is when Baadshah's past is revealed.  Dhanraj works for Sadhu Bhai and runs a casino in Macau through which Sadhu Bhai gets half of his income. Although Sadhu Bhai is the most powerful underworld don, along with his right-hand men Vikram ([[Vikramjeet Virk]]) and Rakhi Rasul, he was never able to conquer Hong Kong due to Violent Victor's ([[Pradeep Rawat (actor)|Pradeep Rawat]]) and his son Ruthless Johnny's ([[Ajaz Khan]]) control. When Dhanraj attempts to transfer the money from the casino to Sadhu Bhai through Hong Kong, Ruthless Johnny stops Dhanraj's henchmen and tries to steal the money. But Baadshah, Dhanraj's son, fends of Johnny's men. Impressed by his bravery and his fearlessness, Sadhu Bhai asks Baadshah to recover his henchmen Antony, who was kidnapped by Violent Victor. But unknown to Sadhu Bhai, it was Baadshah who kidnapped Antony. Baadshah demands control over Macau in return, to which Sadhu Bhai accepts. Baadshah uses this as an opportunity to attack Ruthless Johnny's place without suspicion from Sadhu Bhai, recover several flood victim children (with whom Ruthless Johnny planned to do illegal organ business), and kill Ruthless Johnny. Baadshah then hands over Antony to Sadhu Bhai as if he recovered him from Violent Victor.  But Violent Victor surrenders Hong Kong to Sadhu Bhai to seek his help in avenging his son's death. Although Sadhu Bhai initially disagrees, he accepts the offer when he finds out that Baadshah was behind Antony's kidnap and played a game with him to get Macau. It is then revealed that Baadshah's original intent on entering the mafia world was to defeat Sadhu Bhai and conquer his empire with the help of his uncle Ganesh ([[Adithya (actor)|Adithya]]). Sadhu Bhai sends his men to kill Baadshah but his uncle Ganesh is killed in the car instead in the process, due to Sadhu Bhai's men thinking that Baadshah was in the car. Baadshah goes as far as killing Violent Victor and defeats all of his accomplices. Sadhu Bhai then joins forces with Crazy Robert, Violent Victor's brother.   Ramchandar, IG of the Indian Police Service in Andhra Pradesh, finds out that Sadhu Bhai is shipping a container of RDX from Hong Kong to India, and sends a team headed by DIG Balram and ACP Aadi to intercept the container. In Hong Kong, DIG Balram  and ACP Aadi attack Sadhu Bhai's gang in a shootout. However, Aadi betrays Balram, and reveals that he works with Sadhu Bhai. Then Aadi brutally kills Balram. The container is successfully transported to India. Aadi then shoots himself so that the police won't doubt that he killed Balram. Aadi then makes sure Baadshah is framed for Balram's murder. Crazy Robert then kidnaps Dhanraj and captures Baadshah. This was the opening scene of the movie. Baadshah finds out that he was framed for DIG Balram's death and speaks to Ramchandar. Baadshah tells him that ACP Aadi works with Sadhu Bhai. Ramchandar is convinced that Aadi is a snake but finds it hard to convince the entire police department since Aadi is an integral part of that department. He tells Baadshah that Janaki is engaged to Aadi and that they will be married in a few weeks. Ramchandar tells Baadshah to get close to Janaki, which was why Baadshah met her in Milan and the rest of the story is already known. But in the process Baadshah falls in love with Janaki.  Janaki accepts when Baadshah confesses his love. Janaki's uncle agrees to help them when Baadshah reminds him that he cheated Janaki's father by telling him that he is a police officer, when he is actually a film shooting coordinator in Italy. Later, Janaki, Baadshah, Gopi Krishna Simha, Inky, Pinky, and Dasu travel to India.  Meanwhile, Sadhu Bhai plans several bomb blasts in all major cities in India with the RDX on the day of the [[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]] in Hyderabad.  Baadshah enters Janaki's household by posing as Wedding Planner Rama Rao. Janaki's household is headed by her father Dr. Pilli Jaya Krishna Simha ([[Nassar]]), a strict and disciplined Commissioner of the Indian Police Service in Andhra Pradesh. He expects all the men in the family to be disciplined police officers. But Padmanabha Simha ([[Brahmanandam]]) is lazy; he becomes an inspector due to Jaya Krishna Simha's influence. Because of his nature, Padmanabha Simha always gets admonished by Jaya Krishna Simha. Padmanabha Simha always waits for a payback opportunity. Aadi and his father ([[Jaya Prakash Reddy]]) arrive to Jaya Krishna Simha's house for Aadi and Janaki's wedding as well. Rama Rao uses this as an opportunity to trap Aadi and reach Sadhu Bhai.  At Janaki's household, Rama Rao takes advantage of Padmanabha Simha and others in hopes of exposing Aadi. When Rakhi Rasul and Crazy Robert enter the city to carry out the planned bomb blasts, Rama Rao goes with Padmanabha Simha and fights the gang and kills Rakhi Rasul. Rama Rao makes Padmanabha Simha take the credit for the job. ACP Aadi and Padmanabha Simha attend a press conference following Rakhi Rasul's death, and Padmanabha Simha takes credit for the murder, shocking Aadi and the rest of the police force. Padmanabha Simha becomes a media hero. The RDX is confiscated by the police.   But Rama Rao's mother ([[Suhasini Maniratnam]]) finds out that Rama Rao is Baadshah while Baadshah is talking to Ramchandar. Although she is initially disgusted she finds out from Ramchandar why Rama Rao became Baadshah. Before Rama Rao entered the mafia, Rama Rao, his adoptive brother Siddhu ([[Siddharth (actor)|Siddharth]]), and his mother were living happily. But the day Rama Rao was to leave for the US, his brother was killed in a [[2013 Hyderabad blasts|bomb blast]] which Sadhu Bhai planted. Motivated by the intent to kill Sadhu Bhai, who was behind the blast, he applies for a position in the Indian Police Service. But he gets rejected by the whole department because his father Dhanraj (whom Rama Rao thought was dead) was working under Sadhu Bhai, and no one with a criminal family history is allowed into the police department. But Ramchandar, impressed by Rama Rao's determination, tells him that his father was a very talented financial advisor. But since he did not get sufficient recognition in the society, he started working for Sadhu Bhai. But when he asks his wife to follow him with Sadhu Bhai when he is about to leave India, she rejects and later creates as if she and Rama Rao died in an accident. She also tells Rama Rao in his childhood that his father is dead. Ramchandar asks Rama Rao to go undercover as Baadshah and infiltrate the mafia to extract information about Sadhu Bhai for the police department under Operation Baadshah, and in return, all criminal charges against Rama Rao's father will be dropped. Hence, Rama Rao joins the mafia and turns into Baadshah, go avenge Siddhu and end ACP Aadi and Sadhu Bhai. His mother apologizes for not trusting him and Rama Rao reunites her with his reformed father.  Later at the Sangeet ceremony, Aadi gets tricked and spikes the juice with alcohol, making everyone at the ceremony drunk. Jaya Krishna Simha gets enraged and has a public dispute with ACP Aadi and his father.  Sadhu Bhai comes to Hyderabad and kills the police informer ([[Rajiv Kanakala]]) that notified the police of the RDX and Rakhi Rasul's location. He had found out from the dying informer that Baadshah and Ramchandar are behind Padmanabha Simha and that Padmanabha Simha is just a buffoon. Sadhu Bhai then makes ACP Aadi kidnap Ramchandar and capture Padmanabha Simha. Padmanabha Simha reveals that Rama Rao is Baadshah and finds out that he had been used.  ACP Aadi and Sadhu Bhai then attempt to leave Hyderabad, but Baadshah intervenes in the process. Ramchandar reveals that Baadshah alias Rama Rao has been appointed as the new Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP), and that he was hired when he recovered the RDX and proved his worth. Baadshah fights off all of Sadhu Bhai's goons and finally engages in a fight with ACP Aadi. He eventually kills Aadi and his father, Sadhu Bhai and his minions, and Crazy Robert, thus ending Operation Baadshah.  The movie ends on a happy note as he gets engaged to Janaki, and Jaya Krishna Simha is happy that another strong police officer is becoming part of his household.

Babysitter Massacre
  On [[Halloween]], a babysitter is sent several threatening text messages, the last of which reads, "[[The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs|I'm not in the house... yet]]". Moments later, the sitter is grabbed by a man in a white mask, who duct tapes her to a chair, rips three of her fingernails out, and slits her throat. Elsewhere, Angela chats with her neighbor, Mr. Walker, whose daughter, April, was abducted seven years ago, and has recently been deemed [[Declared death in absentia|deceased in absentia]]. Angela was a member of the same babysitters club as April, and when she was taken, every member of the club besides Angela blamed Bianca, who was with April when she disappeared. To try and cheer up the dour Bianca, Angela invites her to a party she is throwing, while out in the woods another girl is slain by the masked man. The killer then breaks into a house, where he murders a couple, mutilating the girl with a [[straight razor]] before slashing her throat.  Angela and her friend Lucky prepare for the party, as the killer butchers another girl and her co-worker in an office. Bianca, who had just argued with the victim, spots the murderer (whose disguise is similar to the one worn by the person she saw take April) leaving the building and tries to follow him, but he eludes her. The maniac continues his rampage as Angela and Lucky welcome their first guest, Arlene, and Bianca angrily blows off her ex-boyfriend, Tyler. Bianca visits Angela, but storms off when Arlene taunts her with a [[Ouija]] board, afterward deciding to check on the other babysitter club members with Tyler, due to her suspicion that the masked man could be the same one who kidnapped April.  After massacring a gathering of six people, the madman breaks into Angela's house, and [[chloroform]]s her, Lucky, and Arlene. Angela and Arlene awaken in the basement, where Lucky, who has been beaten and tied to a chair, informs them that their captor told her that he will free Angela and Arlene if they kill her with a hammer. As it is their only option, Lucky tells Arlene to sacrifice her, which the sobbing Arlene reluctantly does. Bianca has Tyler drop her off at Angela's house, where she is approached by Mr. Walker, who hints that he was the one who murdered April before he knocks Bianca unconscious with a head butt.  Mr. Walker proceeds to enter the basement, strangle Arlene, and unmask himself for Angela. Mr. Walker takes Angela upstairs, incapacitates her by cutting her ankles, and rants about how much he loves her; he murdered all of the others in order to free her from her old life, so that she could start a new one with him, asserting, "You will come to love me, in time". While Mr. Walker pours gasoline throughout the kitchen, Angela stabs him in the stomach, with Mr. Walker doing the same to her. Angela begins crawling away while Mr. Walker takes out a lighter, proclaiming, "The only thing more romantic than running away together, is dying together. Love is a bitch!" The disoriented Bianca enters, but is told to run by Angela, who reassures her by saying, "It's not your fault". The house erupts up in flames, and Bianca goes into hysterics as Tyler tries to console her, and emergency services approach.

Bad Words (film)
 Forty-year-old Guy Trilby discovers a loophole in the Golden Quill Spelling Bee which stipulates that participants must have not graduated from the eighth grade, allowing him to enter since he dropped out of middle school. He attends and wins a regional spelling bee, and progresses to the national competition after confrontations with both the parents of children and the spelling bee hosts. He is accompanied by Jenny Widgeon, a relatively unknown journalist hoping to make a story out of his participation in the bee. On the flight to the national spelling bee, Guy meets Chaitanya Chopra, a 10-year-old entrant in the bee who persistently attempts to befriend Guy. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, Guy meets the director of the spelling bee, Dr. Bernice Deagan, who expresses anger at his participation in the bee and places him and his reporter in a cheap hotel. Guy learns that Chaitanya is staying in the same hotel, and takes him out one night to expose Chaitanya to the wilder side of life: stealing food, drinking, and hiring a prostitute to briefly "flash" Chaitanya.  In the bee, Guy actively tries to distract and disconcert his fellow competitors, at one point insinuating that he was sleeping with another contestant's mother. Despite Dr. Deagan's tampering with the word list to give Guy the most difficult words, he spells long, complicated words with relative ease, impressing and angering both parents and staff at the spelling bee, including the event's founder, Dr. William Bowman. However, the parents petition for his disqualification and the resignation of Deagan. While researching Guy's background, Jenny discovers that Bowman is Guy's father. She reveals this to him and he admits that his prime motivation for entering the bee was to embarrass his father in revenge for abandoning him and his mother when he was a child. Soon before the final stage of the bee, Guy overhears Chaitanya and his father discussing his strategy to win, which is to befriend Guy so that he will allow Chaitanya to win out of guilt. Guy storms into the room and ends his friendship with Chaitanya, despite Chaitanya's pleas that he genuinely wanted to be friends. They later sabotage each other: Guy burns Chaitanya's study book, "Todd," and Chaitanya calls the LAPD and accuses Guy of kidnapping a young girl.  Meanwhile, only ten competitors remain in the bee, and the pool is gradually reduced to just Guy and Chaitanya. When a contestant's mother attacks Guy verbally and is subdued by the police on live television, Bowman is forced to intervene, to his embarrassment. Having accomplished his goal, Guy deliberately misspells a word in an effort to let Chaitanya win. To prove his friendship, Chaitanya also misspells his word, and they soon begin to argue.  This escalates into a physical fight, and when Bowman attempts to intervene, Chaitanya accidentally hits him with a chair. Although the bee is briefly halted, Bowman allows it to continue after deciding that both Guy and Chaitanya acted in an equally embarrassing manner. Their standoff of deliberately misspelling words continues until Guy intentionally misspells Chaitanya's word so that Chaitanya corrects him, thus causing Chaitanya to win the bee inadvertently. As Guy leaves, content, Chaitanya offers to give him half the winnings and names him co-winner of the bee. Guy writes a note to Bowman explaining his actions, which Bowman refuses to read until Guy reveals himself to be his son, and returns home. He resolves his conflict with Chaitanya by buying an old police car from an auction with his share of the winnings, and helping Chaitanya to chase down his school bullies.  
Bad Milo!
 A man named Duncan lives with his wife, Sarah, who worries about his constant stress. One day, he schedules an appointment with a [[gastroenterologist]] after experiencing a rather serious level of gastric stress the night before. During the appointment, the doctor and nurse spot a large "[[Polyp (medicine)|polyp]]" in his intestinal tract. After seeing a large amount of stress at a very fast pace from work with his boss placing him in charge of releasing employees to home, where a man his age is in a relationship with his mother and his wife is making him see a very eccentric therapist who keeps asking about his father issues, something unusual happens. The polyp forms into a 2-foot-tall sentient being, and begins killing each person the creature sees as a source of stress with each day. The local news counts the attacks as the result of a local rabid raccoon.   Duncan's therapist informs him that the creature is the living manifestation of his life's stress built up over time, and that mythology of this type of being states that the best way to eliminate it is to bond with it so it doesn't act so irrationally. To that effort, Duncan names this strange and unusual anal-dwelling creature Milo.   First, Milo kills his co-worker, then the E.D. doctor he didn't need, yet who wouldn't stop calling him. Soon enough, Milo kills Duncan's boss in an elevator during an Federal investigation at his office building. When it finally attacks his father, who apparently had a being of the same species, and begins killing the other being, Duncan loses his grip and moves Milo and himself to a hotel room far away and someplace safe. This doesn't work, much as it seems to at the outset and Milo tracks Sarah down to her house party where a violent battle ensues between Duncan and Milo. Ultimately Duncan dismembers Milo's left arm and legs, and finally saves its life, vowing to never ignore Milo's important influence and make amends with Milo, successfully doing so before Sarah reinserts Milo back up his rear end.  Ultimately Milo's bloodline is discovered to be carried on through Duncan's unborn son, the embryo of the new creature being seen in the system of the unborn foetus.

(Synopsis Written by Sougata Purakayastha) <ref name="Give something new, the eyes will follow"></ref>  A standout Bengali indie feature Author: Mahadyuti Adhikary  25 September 2013  Bakita Byaktigoto (Rest is Personal) is standout film because of its endearing and lucid simplicity. Most of the new-age Bengali films these days overuse and abuse the term surreal. However, Bakita Byaktigoto is rooted very much in the real, wrapped in a fairy tale bubble, with its fascinating docu-narrative blurring the boundaries between fantasy and reality. Riwtik, the lead protagonist, on an incredible quest for a seemingly intangible pursuit of love, steers the story on his able shoulders with a remarkable sense of economy in effortless acting and infectious honesty. Amit Saha and Aparajita Ghosh Das also play out their roles with astounding competence. Sumptuous camera-work, bearing the director's stamp of innate effective minimalism, and the score by Anindya Sundar Chakraborty, transiting from earthy notes to modern sound, are also worth mentioning. A laudable, stellar debut feature by Pradipta Bhattacharyya.  Sometimes it's the journey that teaches you a lot about your destination. This movie is all about a journey. A journey which will take you along and show you various aspects of love. The end of the movie will surely force you to have a deep thinking. Bakita Byaktigoto is rooted very much in the real, wrapped in a fairy tale bubble, with its fascinating docu-narrative blurring the boundaries between fantasy and reality.

On her sixteenth birthday, Lena's true nature will steer her towards either the light or the dark; Lena fears the latter, as it entails being consumed by evil and hurting those she loves. Ethan and her family insist she is responsible for her own choices and reassure her that she is a good person.  Matters are complicated by the arrival of two immensely powerful dark casters who aim to push Lena to the dark: Ridley, Lena's provocative cousin and childhood friend; who is a siren, a caster that can make any mortal (especially men) obey her command telepathically; and Lena's mother Sarafine, who did not raise Lena and has currently possessed Mrs. Lincoln, the mother of Ethan's friend Link. In a local church, the townspeople have gathered around to complete a petition to expel Lena from school. Then, Macon arrives and outside of natural reality Sarafine confronts him. She foresees that Lena will become an even more powerful caster, since the moon will bring out more energy and will contribute to the most powerful solstice. Sarafine intends for Lena to use her newfound power to purge the Earth of humans, leaving casters to rule in their wake. But Lena and Ethan use the locket to re-experience a whole flashback of their past at a movie theater, while on a date, which reveals that their ancestors, caster Genevieve Duchannes and mortal Confederate soldier Ethan Carter Wate, were in love. Ethan Carter was shot in battle, and Genevieve revived him using a forbidden spell that caused her to go dark, kill her one true love and curse all the Duchannes family's women into going dark. This mortifies Lena and she leaves the theater in fear. They consult with Amma, who is a [[Clairvoyance|seer]] and keeper of a caster library beneath the town library. The most ancient of these books, the ''Book of Moons'', reveals the secret to undoing the curse: someone Lena loves has to die. Unwilling to take Ethan's life, Lena has a final moment together with Ethan in which she makes it snow and then erases all his memories of their time together.  Ridley seduces Link and gives him a bullet to use in an upcoming [[Historical reenactment|Civil War reenactment]] of the [[Battle of Honey Hill]] which will take place on Lena's birthday. During the reenactment, Link and Ethan agree to "kill" each other so they can ditch the reenactment. While at the ceremony for her sixteenth birthday, Lena feels the shock of the curse being broken and runs off to Ethan, clutching his dying body as Ridley and Sarafine encourage her to surrender to grief and accept the dark. Lena lashes out in anger, sending lightning strikes and a huge twister through the crowd of reenactors and seemingly kills everyone until Ethan's body transforms into Macon, who had previously [[Shapeshifting|disguised himself]] as Ethan to become the needed sacrifice to lift the curse and reveals that he promised Ethan's mother to keep her son alive. His dying words encourage Lena to "claim yourself"; she then causes the moon to disappear, so it cannot claim her for the dark. Lena allows Ridley to flee and pulls Sarafine from Mrs. Lincoln's body, using her power to seal Sarafine's spirit away in the form of branches.  Six months later, a still-[[amnesiac]] Ethan stops by the library to visit Amma before leaving for an NYU college tour with Link. He apologizes to Lena for not having gotten to know her during their time in Gatlin. When he inquires if a book by Charles Bukowski (which she had shared with him when they first met) is any good, Lena asks him to define good (the same reply she gave the first time he asked) and presents the book to him as a "getting out of Gatlin present". As Link drives to visit his mother at the insane asylum, after being freed from Sarafine's possession, before leaving to NYU, Ethan reads a passage in the book that he had earlier associated with Lena, while Lena is revealed in the caster library to be a half light/dark caster, as one of her eyes turns a different color, shown the same way her cousin and mother had them. As Link and Ethan drive past the town line, Ethan glimpses the town's burned exit sign and has a moment of remembrance. The car skids to a halt; Ethan gets out of the car and yells Lena's name; she hears his call and is freed of her dark side before the screen fades to black.  
Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (film)
 ===Part 1===  After the death of his protégé [[Jason Todd]], billionaire industrialist Bruce Wayne was forced to retire from his [[Batman (Dark Knight Universe)|Batman]] persona. Ten years later, [[Gotham City]] is overrun with crime and terrorized by a gang known as the Mutants. The 55-year-old Wayne maintains a friendship with 70-year-old retiring Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] (who knows Wayne was Batman), while the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] (Batman's [[archenemy]]) has been [[Catatonia|catatonic]] in [[Arkham Asylum]] since Wayne's retirement. Arkham inmate and former district attorney [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] undergoes plastic surgery to repair his disfigured face. Although he is declared sane, he quickly goes into hiding following his release. Dent's disappearance, news stories of the crime epidemic throughout the city and the memory of his parents' deaths drive Wayne to become Batman once more. He combats serious crimes, rescuing 13-year-old [[Carrie Kelley]], but now struggles with the physical limitations of age.  Public reaction to his return is divided. Dent's psychologist Bartholomew Wolper blames Batman for creating his own [[List of Batman Family adversaries|rogues gallery]]. Dent resurfaces, threatening to blow up a building unless he is paid a ransom. Batman defeats Dent's henchmen, learning that the bombs will explode even if the ransom is paid; he realizes that Dent intends to kill himself. Batman disables one bomb, and the other detonates harmlessly. He defeats Dent, who reveals that he thinks the reconstructive surgery was botched, as he considered his undamaged half as disfigured. Kelley dresses as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and looks for Batman, who attacks a gathering of the Mutants with a tank-like [[Batmobile]] (incapacitating most of them). The Mutant leader challenges Batman to a duel. He accepts to prove to himself that he can win. The Mutant leader (who is in his prime) nearly kills Batman, but Kelley distracts him long enough for Batman to subdue him. The leader and many gang members are arrested. Injured, Batman returns to the [[Batcave]] with Kelley, and allows her to become his protégée in spite of protests from his butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]].  Batman has Kelley disguise herself as a Mutant, and she lures the gang to a sewer outlet at the West River. At the [[Gotham City Police Department]], the Mutant leader murders the mayor during negotiations. Commissioner Gordon deliberately releases the leader, providing an escape from the building, which leads to the sewer outlet. Before the amassed Mutants, Batman fights the leader in a mud pit; the mud slows the leader, removing his physical advantage, and Batman overpowers him. Seeing their leader's defeat, the Mutants divide into smaller gangs; one becomes the "Sons of Batman", a violent vigilante group. Batman's victory becomes public and the city's inhabitants are inspired to stand up against crime. Gordon retires after meeting his anti-Batman successor, Ellen Yindel. In Arkham, televised reports about Batman bring the Joker out of his catatonic state.  ===Part 2===  Feigning remorse for his past, Joker convinces Wolper to take him on a talk show to tell his story, and makes plans for his escape with an old henchman, who supplies him with mind-controlling lipstick. Meanwhile, [[Superman]], who works as a government operative in exchange for being allowed to covertly help people, is asked by President [[Ronald Reagan]] to end Batman's vigilante activities. Framing these events is a growing hostility between the USA and the [[Soviet Union]] over possession of the island of [[Corto Maltese (DC Comics)|Corto Maltese]]. As Batman's continued presence humiliates the national authorities, Yindel becomes commissioner and orders Batman's arrest, and Superman warns Batman that the government will not tolerate him much longer.  Joker makes his talk show appearance on David Endochrine's show as Batman fights with the GCPD on the studio roof; while they fight, Joker kills Wolper, gasses everyone in the studio to death and escapes. He finds [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle]] and uses one of her escorts and his lipstick to take control of a congressional representative, who calls for a nuclear strike on the Soviets before falling to his death. Batman's investigation leads him to Selina, whom he finds bound and dressed like [[Wonder Woman]]. Kelley notices cotton candy on the floor, and Batman deduces that Joker is at the fairgrounds. There Kelley accidentally kills Joker's henchman while Batman pursues the Joker, who indiscriminately guns down dozens of people. As Batman corners a wounded and partially blinded Joker, he admits to feeling responsible for every murder Joker has committed and intends to stop him permanently. In the ensuing fight, Joker stabs Batman repeatedly, and Batman breaks Joker's neck in front of witnesses.  Content that he made Batman lose control and that he will be branded a murderer, the Joker finishes twisting his neck, killing himself. The GCPD arrive and Batman, bleeding profusely, fights his way to Kelley and escapes. After Superman deflects a Soviet nuclear missile, he is hit with the blast and badly injured; the detonation creates an [[Electromagnetic Pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] that wipes out all electrical equipment in the United States and causes a [[nuclear winter]]. As the city descends into chaos, Batman, Kelley and Gordon rally the Sons of Batman and the citizens of Gotham to restore order, and Yindel accepts that Batman has become too powerful to take down. While the rest of the powerless U.S. is overrun with crime, Gotham becomes the safest city in America, embarrassing the President's administration and prompting them to send Superman and troop to finally stop Batman. Batman and Superman agree to meet in [[Crime Alley]].  Superman can't help but feel remorse for disregarding Batman throughout the years, and humbly asks him to not go through the fight. Wearing a powerful [[Powered exoskeleton|exoframe]] and supported by Kelley and former superhero Oliver Queen ([[Green Arrow]]), Batman fights Superman, using various tactics to make the fight even. When Superman gains the advantage, Queen hits him with an [[Trick arrows#Green Arrow's trick arrows|arrow]] made with synthetic [[Kryptonite]], severely weakening him. Batman defeats Superman, and claims that he intentionally made the Kryptonite weak, and tells Superman to never forget that Batman defeated him, and could have killed him had he wanted. Superman then notices Batman's heartbeat is irregular and rapid with his x-ray vision, and tries to warn him. Batman ignores Superman and continues beating him, all the while listing off his reasons for being angry at him. However, Batman apparently dies of a heart attack, while [[Wayne Manor]] self-destructs, and Alfred dies of a stroke. Superman holds Batman's body, orders the soldiers to stand down.   In the aftermath, the world learns that Bruce was Batman; all of his secrets are destroyed with the manor and his finances disappear. As Superman leaves Wayne's funeral, he gives Kelley a knowing wink after hearing a faint heartbeat coming from Bruce's coffin. In underground caves, Bruce is revealed to have survived his heart attack and faked his death to make preparations to continue his mission more discreetly, allied with Kelley, Queen, and his followers.

Behind the Candelabra
 In 1977, 18-year-old [[Scott Thorson]] ([[Matt Damon]]), who works as an [[Animal training|animal trainer]] for films, meets Bob Black ([[Scott Bakula]]), a Hollywood producer, in a gay bar in Los Angeles.  At Black's urging, he leaves his adopted home in search of better-paying work.  Black introduces Thorson to [[Liberace]] ([[Michael Douglas]]), who takes an immediate liking to the handsome younger man.  Liberace invites the two backstage and then to his luxurious home in Las Vegas.  Thorson observes that one of Liberace's beloved dogs is suffering from a temporary form of blindness, and with his veterinary assistant background, informs the famous pianist that he knows how to cure the condition.  After treating the dog, Thorson becomes Liberace's "assistant" at the performer's request. Thorson also becomes employed as Liberace's stage chauffeur, driving a Rolls-Royce limousine onto the stage for Liberace's grand entrances.  Thorson moves in with Liberace and becomes his lover.  At this point, Thorson says that he is [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] because he is also attracted to women.  Liberace is sympathetic, informing him that he wanted and tried to love women, but was exclusively attracted to men.  He relates a story of a "divine healing" in which a "messenger" informed him that God still loved him.  It gradually becomes clear that Liberace is trying to mold Thorson into a younger version of himself.  He asks his plastic surgeon, Dr. Jack Startz ([[Rob Lowe]]), to transform Scott's face to more closely resemble his own and makes an unsuccessful attempt to formally adopt him.  Thorson soon turns to drugs as he becomes more angry and frustrated with Liberace trying to control him as well as Liberace's obsession to publicly hide their romance at any cost.  By 1982, Thorson's increasing drug abuse and Liberace's interest in younger men, including dancer Cary James ([[Boyd Holbrook]]), creates a rift that ultimately destroys their relationship.  When Liberace begins visiting pornographic peep shows and suggests that they each see other people, Thorson becomes upset.  Thorson retains an attorney to seek his financial share of the property by suing Liberace for over $100,000,000 in [[palimony]].  As a result, Liberace ends their formal partnership and involves himself with his most recent, and much younger, "assistant".  In 1984, Thorson's palimony lawsuit starts where he gives details about his five-year romance with the entertainer, while Liberace flatly denies any sexual relationship.  Not long thereafter, in December 1986, Thorson receives a phone call from Liberace telling him that he is very sick with what is later revealed to be [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] and that he would like Thorson to visit him again.  Thorson agrees and drives to Liberace's retreat house in Palm Springs, where he and Liberace have one last, emotional conversation. Liberace dies a few months later in February 1987.  Thorson attends Liberace's funeral, in which he imagines seeing Liberace performing one last time with his traditional flamboyance, before being lifted to Heaven with a stage harness.

Captivated by Gretta's music, Dan offers her to sign her to his former record label, and although she initially refuses she reconsiders the offer and agrees.  Dan and Gretta meet with Saul, Dan's business partner and co-founder of their record label, but he does not see the same potential in Gretta and turns her away. Undeterred, Dan proposes that he and Gretta produce their own album together, to be recorded live during the summer at various public locations around New York City. Recruiting a team of talented musicians, including Steve, Dan sets out to make an album worthy of being published by his label. During this time, Dan and Gretta bond both personally and professionally, and Gretta takes Dan's teenage daughter Violet, a fledgling guitarist, under her wing and encourages her to play on the album.   When Gretta sees Dave accepting an award on television, she criticizes him for selling out to the music industry and, with the help of her best friend Steve, she expresses her grievances with him in a song which she records on his voice mail. A remorseful Dave, who is back in New York to promote his new album, returns her call and asks to see her. After some consideration, she decides to meet with him and they critique each other's albums. Gretta feels betrayed by Dave's heavily commercialized rendition of "[[Lost Stars]]," a love ballad she had once written and composed for him as a Christmas present, believing that the true meaning of the song has been lost. Dave tells her that the audiences love when he plays it in the new way, and that their energy fills the room. He believes that music is about sharing it with people, but Gretta tells him that's not what she intended for that song. Nevertheless, Dave invites her to come and hear him play the song at the [[Gramercy Theatre]] that weekend so that she can see the impact it has had on his fans.  When the album is finished, Dan and Gretta meet again with Saul, who is very impressed with their collaboration. Gretta demands that Saul give Dan his job back and give her a bigger share in the deal. They leave without reaching an agreement, but Dan feels confident that Saul will eventually sign Gretta to the label. Later, after receiving a text message from Dave reminding her of his concert and much consideration, Gretta arrives at the venue just in time to watch Dave play her original arrangement of the song, but as she watches him play and sees the reaction of the crowd to the song and how Dave responds to the fans' adoration by slipping into singing the commercialized arrangement of the song, she realizes that he is a lost cause. Gretta then leaves the concert and cycles through the city with newfound closure and a dawning smile on her face.  Afterwards, Gretta visits Dan at his apartment as he prepares to move back home, having made amends with his wife. She tells him that she does not want him to release her album, instead preferring to distribute it online for $1. Although Dan returns to work with Saul, he agrees to let Gretta release the album online and helps her to promote the release. The next day, Saul jokingly fires Dan for promoting Gretta's album and informs him that it sold 10,000 copies in its first day of release.

Being Ginger
  The film opens as filmmaker Scott P. Harris explains his unique experience as a redhead. He says he's had many female friends tell him they have a friend who just loves gingers, but he's never met one of them. He takes his camera to the local park to stop women and ask what they think of redheads.  The first woman he stops claims to really like redheads, which throws Scott for a loop. The film briefly turns into a romantic comedy as he tries to get a date with the woman, and seeks advice from his trusted friend, and co-editor, Ben. He eventually gets the date, but it doesn't go anywhere.  Throughout the film Scott's camerawoman tries to encourage him to date a redheaded woman, but he steadfastly refuses. First he states that redheads simply don't date each other, but he later opens up that he doesn't like redheads himself, which he thinks is just because of his own self-loathing that he's projecting on to every redhead he sees.  Unwilling to return to the park, Scott starts using an online dating site that claims to specifically cater to redheads and the people who like them. When that turns out to be a scam, he sinks to a new low and goes to a public square wearing a sandwich-board that reads, “Looking 4 a woman who likes gingers. Seriously.” While there he meets a particularly nasty woman who doesn't hold back in telling him that redheads are un-attractive. She recounts the first time she saw a redhead being bullied, when she was in kindergarten, and assumes the boy just accepted that as a redhead this is what his life was going to be like.  That run in prompts Scott to open up about his own bullying experiences, including a particular nasty reoccurring experience when he was eight. Every day of second grade all of the students in his class would stand up to tell him they hated him, and when he cried the teacher threatened to beat him. It is the scar of that experience that shades everything else in his life.  Scott then learns of [http://www.redheaddays.nl/ The Redhead Days], the world's largest redhead gathering which takes place every year in The Netherlands. Scott sends them a copy of the first act of the film, which was his graduation project from film school, and the festival asks to screen it.  Scott flies over to The Netherlands, and while at the festival, he becomes a bit of a local celebrity. It's the first time in his life he's been the center of attention and not had it accompanied with serious emotional pain, which causes a major breakthrough for him. He also meets and falls for a beautiful redheaded woman who has flown over from the US to attend the festival.  The film ends on the promise that the two redheads will soon go on their first proper date together.

When the two cousins reach adulthood, the Mansfields commission an oil portrait of their two great-nieces, but Dido is unhappy about sitting for it as she is worried that it will portray her as a subordinate, similar to other portraits she has seen depicting aristocrats with black servants. Dido's father dies and leaves her the generous sum of £2,000 a year, enough to make her an heiress. Lady Elizabeth, by contrast, will have no income from her father, whose son from his new wife has been named his sole heir. Arrangements are made for Elizabeth to have her coming-out to society, but Lord and Lady Mansfield believe no gentleman will agree to marry Dido because of her mixed-race status, so while she will travel to London with her cousin, she will not be "out" to society.  Lord Mansfield agrees to take a vicar's son, John Davinier, into an apprenticeship for law. In 1783, Mansfield hears the case of ''[[Gregson v. Gilbert]]'', regarding the payment of an insurance claim, for slaves killed when thrown overboard by the captain of a slave-ship &mdash; an event now known as the [[Zong Massacre|''Zong'' massacre]]. Dido helps her uncle with his correspondence and after John tells her about the ''Zong'' case, she begins sneaking correspondence to him which he believes will advance the cause of the [[Abolitionism|abolitionists]]. Lord Mansfield and John have a disagreement on the main issue of the case. John is told not to see Dido again, and his apprenticeship is at an end.  Dido’s aunts, Lady Mansfield and Lady Mary Murray, Lord Mansfield's sister, seek to steer Dido into an engagement with Oliver Ashford, son of a scheming grand dame and younger brother to the bigoted James Ashford. At first James is interested in Elizabeth but stops courting her once he discovers she will have no inheritance. Oliver, who is without fortune, proposes to Dido and she accepts, although she continues to see John. James takes Dido aside, tells her she will disgrace his family's name, then insults and manhandles her. Dido later tells Elizabeth of his true character and says she will give part of her inheritance to her for a dowry so she can find a different match. Lord Mansfield finds out about Dido's visits to John and confronts both of them. During the confrontation, John professes his love for Dido. Sometime later, Dido meets with Oliver and breaks off their engagement.  Dido is relieved when the painting is unveiled, showing her as Elizabeth's equal. She tells Lord Mansfield that the portrait commission proves that he can defy convention. Dido sneaks into the balcony of the Inn of Court, so that she can hear Lord Mansfield narrowly rule that the Gregson slave-trading syndicate, based in Liverpool, is not due insurance payments for the slaves the crew threw overboard during the voyage. The ship's officers claimed they ordered this action because they were out of potable water. Lord Mansfield discovers, however, that the ''Zong'' passed by many ports without stopping for more water, before killing the slaves. It appeared to Lord Mansfield that the slaves were over-crowded, making them sick and not likely to fetch a high price at auction, so the officers decided they would be worth more in insurance payments after their loss. Lord Mansfield sees John and Dido outside the Court after his ruling and says that Dido can only marry a gentleman. Therefore, he agrees to resume John's apprenticeship in law, so that he can become a lawyer. Dido and John share a kiss, both in full acknowledgement of their romantic feelings.  On-screen text informs the viewer that Dido and John married and had two sons (they actually had three), that Elizabeth also married and had children, and that the painting hung at Kenwood House until 1922, when it was moved to Scone Palace in Scotland, the birthplace of Lord Mansfield.

Beneath (2013 film)
 Six high school seniors head out to a secluded lake for a last day together. The seniors are: Johnny, a quiet type; Kitty, the aspiring actress who uses her looks to manipulate men; Deb, Kitty's friend; Zeke, an obnoxious camera wielding geek; Matt, Kitty's jock boyfriend, and Simon, Matt's wild brother.  While at the lake, Johnny meets an old man who knows his grandfather. The old man tells him that he should know better than to go on the lake but Johnny says they're just going to cross to the other shore and he'll show respect. The man agrees, but notes that Johnny's "friends" aren't the kind to respect the lake. The observation is proven correct when Johnny's friends ignore his pleas to stay in the boat and instead go swimming, thrashing about in the water, drinking, littering and playing with sparklers. They soon swim back to the boat after they feel a large object touching them underwater. They try to row back to shore but lose an oar in the water. As Deb reaches out to retrieve it, a giant fish bites her and she bleeds out and dies. The group tries to row to shore with one oar but the giant fish bites and destroys their remaining oar. In desperation, they throw Deb's body overboard to distract the fish and continue paddling using their hands; however, this is not successful and the group is left stranded on the lake, several hundred yards away from the shoreline.  As the group panics, Kitty accuses Johnny of knowing about the fish because he tried to give her a necklace for protection earlier which she refused, thinking it was a love token. Zeke attempts to persuade the group to throw Johnny overboard. Disgusted with them, Johnny jumps overboard and begins swimming to shore but is pursued by the fish, and disappears underwater.  Hysterical and desperate, Zeke is thrown overboard by an enraged Matt after accusing Kitty of sleeping with both brothers. His GoPro camera still recording, Zeke is seen being eaten by the fish, his arm with camera still attached is seen floating on the surface.   From the shore, Johnny sets off in a motor boat to rescue the group, but after observing the fate of Zeke, he tells them he'll use a rope to tow the boat to safety. As he throws the rope, the fish bumps the boat causing it to spin and the rope catches around Johnny's neck, strangling him. Kitty is presented with an opportunity to save him by cutting the rope but she hesitates, resulting in Johnny's death.  Kitty, Matt and Simon throw Johnny's body into the water as a distraction, but the fish refuses to eat him. The trio argue about Zeke's earlier insinuations regarding Kitty, and Matt angrily throws her into the lake. Kitty is denied entry on the boat, and she swims off.  In a fit of madness, the brothers fight, and both end up falling into the water. Simon suffers a head injury, leaving drops of blood that attracts the fish; Matt, having grown remorseful, sacrifices himself to the fish while Simon swims to shore.  Meanwhile, Kitty observes Johnny's body floating nearby as she sits on the overturned motorboat. She takes the necklace he had previously offered to her off his neck and puts it on. The fish immediately goes to Johnny's body and consumes it. Believing the necklace will protect her, Kitty swims to the shore where she is confronted by a psychotic Simon, who drowns her in the shallows despite her pleas.  As night descends, the bloodied Simon sees the old man in front of headlights. The man asks for Johnny and Simon replies that everyone is dead and he needs to get help. The old man states that Johnny was such a nice boy and that Simon needs to go back in the lake because it wasn't finished with him. Having seen Zeke's GoPro footage, and knowing what actually happened, the old man shoots at Simon several times until he goes back into the water. Simon tries to escape but is dragged underwater and devoured. Johnny's tooth necklace is seen washing ashore on the lake bed, covered with stains of blood.

Belle and Sebastian (film)
 In the [[French Alps]], during the year 1943, Sébastien is a seven year old orphan boy living with César, an adoptive "grandfather" and his niece, Angélina. The unusual little family lives in the small village of Saint-Martin, whose inhabitants, despite the [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]], secretly organize the passage of Jewish exiles into [[Switzerland]]. The village is also plagued by a mysterious "Beast" who preys on the flocks of the shepherds and the inhabitants, including César's animals.  Sébastien is a very lonely child who is suffering from the absence of his mother. He believes that she migrated "to [[United States|America]], just over the mountains", and spends all his days in the mountains. One day, on the way home, he meets a huge dog, wild and completely discredited: it is the so-called "Beast". Sébastien is not slow to make friends with the animal, a female [[livestock guardian dog]], and names her "Belle" because he is struck by her beauty after she is cleaned up from the mud that she was coated with. Sébastien decides to keep his friendship with Belle a secret to protect her.  Meanwhile, a German patrol, commanded by the ambiguous Lieutenant Peter Braun, arrives in Saint-Martin to put an end to the secret escape route of the Jews. Sébastien, during one of his trips along with Belle, collides with two of the soldiers; Belle responds by attacking and injuring one of the soldiers. Lieutenant Braun orders the mayor of Saint-Martin to arrange a hunt to track down and kill the "Beast".  Meanwhile, César discovers Sébastien's secret and is horrified. Knowing that Sébastien will try to prevent Belle from being shot, César gives the boy the wrong directions to the hunting area. But he is still able to interfere, at least for a while. Then César takes him out of the area, while the hunt goes on. César and the village men manage to find and hurt Belle. Sébastien escapes confinement, and finds the wounded dog and tries to help her. He is now furious with César, but asks for help from Dr. Guillaume, the village doctor and Angélina's boyfriend. After an initial hesitation, (and being prodded with a con from Sébastien) he agrees to treat Belle and saves her life.    Unbeknownst to Sébastien, Dr. Guillaume is also the one who is responsible for escorting the Jews to the Swiss border. One evening, the doctor hides a family in a cave prior to a trip to the border, when the sound of wolves is heard in the valley. The doctor goes out as the wolves start causing a ruckus in the sheepfold. Guillaume slips and falls into the sheepfold as Belle bounds down out of nowhere and drives off the wolves. The doctor sits up and moans: his ankle is broken, he cannot walk. He finds a sled, lies down on it, and starts pawing his way to town when Belle stops him, picks up the rope, and begins to tow him. She takes him to Angélina's house where everyone except Sébastien and Guillaume is surprised by the dog. César instantly apologizes to Sébastien for wanting to kill Belle.  Guillaume, who is now injured, can no longer lead the Jews, and his place is taken by Angélina and Sébastien, who followed her and sneaked into the cave behind her. The boy befriends Esther, the daughter of the two refugees that Guillaume was to escort, and by talking with her, he discovers that César lied to him about where America truly is. That evening, Sébastien creeps back into town and sneaks into the schoolhouse to look at a map. Later, César discovers him in the schoolhouse and reveals the truth: his mother died while giving birth to him. César was present by chance and agreed to take care of Sébastien; he has so far been silent or preferring to lie to protect him. Sébastien is sad, but now he knows he can always count on César and he makes peace with him. It is Christmas Eve, and César gives him a treasured gift: a pocket watch with a compass.  Meanwhile, the Germans realize that some Jews might try to escape on Christmas Day, and begin to scour the mountain passes. Angélina and the Jews leave the cave, but the trip is cut short by Lieutenant Braun. He shouts to her, and she herds the family faster up the mountain. He shouts to her again, but all of them are suddenly overwhelmed by an avalanche caused by his shouts. Lt. Braun, when dug out of the snow, surprisingly warns her to take another route to reach the border because his soldiers are patrolling the mountain. Angélina is moved, and kisses the man.  The only possible way now is dangerous and full of crevasses; Sébastien boasts that Belle, thanks to her sense of smell, will guide them. Not without difficulty, Belle, Sébastien and Angélina manage to escape from the Germans and to bring the Jews to Switzerland, where they are greeted by a local guide. Here, Angélina reveals that she will go on to [[England]] to help win the war. She promises Sébastien that she will return once it's all over, leaving Belle and Sébastien to walk back home alone. The Swiss guide questions her if she is sure that he is able to make such a long, difficult journey on his own, but Angélina, in tears, replies that Sébastien is not all alone.

 After a tense illegal arms deal in a [[Berlin]] hotel involving North Korean spy Pyo Jong-seong ([[Ha Jung-woo]]), a Russian broker, and a Middle Eastern terrorist goes wrong when disrupted by unknown assailants, Pyo narrowly escapes but encounters morass of conflicting evidence that may reveal why he was set up.  Also investigating the failed weapons sale, embattled South Korean intelligence agent Jung Jin-soo ([[Han Suk-kyu]]) goes after Pyo to uncover his identity, but is left trying to decode whether the North Korean "ghost" agent (whose information cannot be found on any intelligence database) is a [[double agent]] or taking the fall for a more insidious plot. Finding himself embroiled in a vast international conspiracy, Jung must determine the North's role in the deal, as well as the potential involvement of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], Israel's [[Mossad]], international terrorist organizations, and any other covert operatives lurking in Berlin's polyglot underworld.  Confronting the possibility of a double agent within Berlin's North Korean embassy where his wife Ryun Jung-hee ([[Jun Ji-hyun]]) is a translator, Pyo discovers that [[Pyongyang]] security authorities have dispatched ruthless fixer Dong Myung-soo ([[Ryoo Seung-bum]]) to sort out potentially conflicting loyalties at the consulate. Dong's investigation quickly implicates Ryun and he gives Pyo just 48 hours to incriminate his wife, who is suspected of leaking information on the arms deal to South Korean agents trying to gain access to a secret multibillion-dollar bank account controlled by Pyongyang authorities.  Despite an apparently loveless marriage, Pyo is reluctant to betray Ryun, particularly after she discloses she's pregnant. He senses that she was [[frameup|set up]] by Dong and his father to gain favor with North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-un]]. But when the North Korean ambassador makes an attempt to [[defection|defect]] to the West, Pyo becomes incriminated as well. Narrowly escaping an assassination squad dispatched by Dong, Ryun and Pyo go on the run, with the rival Korean intelligence agencies closing in fast.  Pyo winds up falling into the path of Agent Jung, and the two create a reluctant alliance to rescue Ryun after she was kidnapped following an attack by Dong and his affiliates. The conflict escalates and both Dong and Pyo face each other in an ultimate showdown that culminates in Pyo killing Dong with an injection. Unfortunately, his wife Ryun gets caught in the crossfire and dies from her wound.  Jung reports to headquarters, where he learns that Dong's father has covered up the scandal using Pyo as a scapegoat. Jung, although frustrated at the internal corruption, has his hands tied. He meets with Pyo and cautions him to go into hiding and live the rest of his life "looking over [his] shoulder", as both North and South Korean forces consider him a traitor and fugitive. In the last scene, Pyo can be seen inside an airport at an unspecified time later, having called Dong's father to tell him that he's coming. Pyo books a ticket to [[Vladivostok]], the site of a new gas line deal between North and South Korea.<ref name=thr /><ref></ref><ref></ref>

All the friends arrive at the house, the first time they've come together in 14 years, and the celebration begins. At dinner, the old friends catch up while tensions grow between Shelby and Candace.  Years after his debut novel, Harper is struggling with [[writer's block]], financial difficulties, and pressure from his publisher to come up with newer and better material for his next book. He has also been recently relieved of his faculty position at [[New York University]], further complicating the couple's financial position. He kept all this from Robyn, as she is finally pregnant with their first child after years of expensive fertility treatments and the baby is almost full-term. His agent suggests he write a biography on his estranged friend, Lance, who is set to retire from football. Harper reluctantly agrees, but keeps the biography a secret.  The Murch family, which now includes two daughters, seems to be doing well.  Julian opened the school he has worked hard to establish, with his wife, former stripper Candace, as his head of admissions. His main donor, however, abruptly ends his relationship with the school and Julian: he has been made aware of Candace's past and will not risk his reputation as a man of high morals. It is then that Julian finds a [[YouTube]] video of his wife stripping and accepting money for sex at a fraternity party. He confides in Q and shows him part of the video. Shelby is living the life she has always dreamed of: as a cast member of a popular ''[[The Real Housewives]]'' television show franchise, she is now a prominent and notorious [[reality television]] star and part of the social elite. Robyn is still insecure about Harper and Jordan's friendship. Q is now a successful [[brand]] manager and heavily connected to prominent celebrities.  After arriving at the Sullivan home, Harper notices Mia's dramatic weight loss, but brushes it off and focuses on the reunion and gathering information about Lance for the biography.  The next day, Brian says goodbye to Jordan and leaves for his family's annual [[Christmas]] gathering in [[Vermont]]. As he leaves, Jordan tells him that, while she loves him, she does not need him. After dinner that night, the men dance and lip-sync to "[[Can You Stand the Rain]]" for the ladies to great response. All the couples in the house have sex that night, while Lance gives Mia a back-rub and Q sends risque photographs of himself to Shelby. Harper goes down to the kitchen, and as he heads back to bed, he finds Mia throwing up blood.  Mia reveals to Harper that she was diagnosed with cancer more than a year ago and is dying. After Lance walks in on the two talking, Mia explains to Lance that Harper knows. They both ask Harper to keep the condition a secret. At breakfast the next morning, Q and Shelby accidentally switch phones and Shelby finds the Candace video on Q's phone. She tries to use it to coerce Julian to resume his previous relationship with her, but Julian rebuffs her advances. Not long afterwards, Candace loses patience with Shelby and confronts her, which leads to a physical altercation between the two in front of Shelby's daughter, after which Candace leaves the house with her and Julian's daughters. Lance drives the men to his football practice, with Julian and Q starting a fight in the backseat, but Harper intervenes before it degenerates further.  Back at the house, the ladies are preparing for a spa day when Mia collapses while trying to hang a Christmas ornament. Robyn and Jordan text Harper for Lance and the men quickly return to the house, forcing Harper to tell the rest of the friends about Mia's illness. As they leave, the friends all embrace Lance.  Back at the house, everyone spends time with Mia. While Harper is wrapping gifts, Lance approaches him and the two reminisce about their college days and seem to overcome their differences. The next day, the gang volunteer at a shelter, with Q as a grudging [[Santa Claus]]. Harper and Lance seem to be as close as they were in the old days. Afterwards, Lance stumbles across Harper's iPad and journal in Mia's purse, and a mock book cover for his unauthorized biography on the tablet. Lance angrily confronts Harper and tells him to stay away from him and his family. Mia tries to calm Lance down to no avail. He takes Mia home, leaving Q and Harper the last two to leave the shelter. The two talk and Harper finally breaks down and admits the truth of his situation.  Back at the Sullivan home, Robyn is going through Mia's old baby things when Candace returns with the kids. Candace tells Julian she regrets that one time she ever gave "extra favors" to a client and they reconcile. Lance is still heated over the biography when Mia confronts him. Mia challenges Lance to acknowledge the truth. She is to blame just as much as Harper is for the longtime feud between the two men. She reveals she slept with Harper (see [[The Best Man (1999 film)|The Best Man]]), even though she knew how much it would hurt Lance, because she was sick and tired of Lance cheating on her. Mia then takes off her wig, forcing Lance to also acknowledge the severity of her condition. The household gathers around the fireplace to listen to the children sing Christmas carols.  The next day is Christmas and Lance's big game. Brian returns to be with Jordan and the two reconcile. The women watch the game together as a family in Mia and Lance's bedroom, while the men attend the game. Lance starts a troublesome first half. Mia calls Harper to speak to Lance, inspiring him to ultimately break the all-time rushing record in a game-winning performance. After the game, the men rush home, so Lance can say goodbye to Mia before she dies.  At the funeral service, everyone but Lance is emotional. Shelby gives Julian a check for two million dollars, covering the funding gap created by the donor pull-out. All she asks for in return is a play date for their children. Inside the church, Harper gives a heartfelt eulogy. After everyone leaves, as Mia's casket is lowered into the grave, Lance finally breaks down. Harper witnesses this from a distance and rushes to Lance's aid, comforting him. Back at the house, everyone seems to have reconciled with one another after realizing what's really important in life. Outside, Harper and Lance make up and conclude a 14-year feud. Q and Shelby are shown in bed, with Q suggesting, before rolling out of bed, they may have a love connection. Meanwhile, Brian tells Julian that he knows some investors who can help with the school's funding. Robyn's water suddenly breaks, so Lance, Harper, and Candace all try to rush her to the hospital together. However, they get stuck in traffic and Lance delivers the baby in the backseat of his [[SUV]]. Robyn delivers a healthy baby girl and names her Mia, in honor of their deceased friend.  Ten months later, Harper and Lance are closer than ever and Harper has written Lance's biography. Lance is the baby's godfather, as he visits Harper and Robyn at their house in [[New York City]]. Harper gets a phone call from Q and puts it on speakerphone to share the call with Lance. Q reveals to both that he is getting married and wants Harper to be his best man, but not before telling Harper that he better not have had sex with his soon-to-be bride.

Meanwhile, a mortician is bitten by a rodent-sized spider that crawls out of a dead body which just arrived at the hospital. Learning of this, Alex offers to take care of the spider in exchange for clearing his hospital bill. José Ramos ([[Lombardo Boyar]]), a hospital security guard, offers to help Alex. Going to the morgue, Alex deduces the spider escaped into an air vent. He enters the vent and communicates with José via walkie-talkie. Meanwhile, a military task force led by Major Braxton Tanner ([[Ray Wise]]) and Lieutenant Karly Brant ([[Clare Kramer]]) show up at the hospital to examine the dead body the spider burst out of.  Meanwhile, the spider, growing exponentially, kills a paralyzed hospital patient. Back inside the vent, Alex stumbles upon a spiderweb and learns that it is highly flammable. Alex ventures into the hospital basement, where he has a confrontation with the spider. The spider is driven off by Karly and escapes into a grate down into the sewer, where it kills a homeless man. Alex, enamored with Karly, offers his assistance to Braxton, who declines, especially when Alex presses her for answers on where the spider came from. José convinces Alex to continue their pursuit as it could be the most important thing of their lives.  The duo tracks the still-growing spider at a public park, where it kills dozens of people. Alex and José get the spider to chase their truck and lure it to the military. A huge firefight ensues, but the spider escapes into the nearby woods. Karly and a group of soldiers pursue it, but the spider ambushes them, kills most of the soldiers, and captures Karly. After Alex and José demand answers, Braxton reveals that they discovered alien DNA and hoped to use it as a growth hormone. However, a spider's nest was hidden in some test fruit, thus exposing the spider to the alien DNA and triggering its rapid growth. It is also revealed that the spider will soon start reproducing based on its size and their studies of the alien DNA.  Alex and José head for the city, as the now-enormous spider sets up a nest at the [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|U.S. Bank Tower]]. As they enter the skyscraper, Braxton informs them that Karly is located directly inside the nest, and warns them of an impending airstrike. They get to Karly and free her and several other trapped citizens just before the hatching baby spiders can attack. The group makes it out of the building seconds before the airstrike hits, provoking the spider. Alex deduces from the spiderwebs' flammability that the spider could be killed by shooting its [[spinneret (spider)|spinneret]]. José grabs a [[rocket launcher]] from a military vehicle and tosses it to Alex, who shoots the spider in the spinneret. The spider explodes, finally killing it. Alex embraces Karly, and the two enjoy a passionate kiss.  In a mid-credits scene, Braxton calls Alex to tell him they have another problem. In the background, a giant cockroach can be seen climbing the Statue of Liberty in a video monitor.

A news report releases captured [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] footage from the robbery at Patridge's home. This concerns Marc, but Rebecca is undeterred and instigates a burglary at the home of [[Rachel Bilson]]. Word spreads amongst the group's social circles, and the girls boast of their accomplishments at parties, also posting photographs of the stolen items on social media sites. The group ultimately breaks into Lohan's house and robs it. Shortly after, Rebecca moves to Las Vegas with her father due to troubles at home, leaving some of her stolen items with Marc, who inadvertently helps Rebecca transfer stolen items across state lines.  News reports of the [[Hollywood Hills]] burglaries intensify, with the media labeling the group "The Bling Ring". CCTV from several robberies in addition to the evidence on social media allows authorities to identify the group. Police arrest Marc, Nicki, Chloe, Rebecca, Rob, and Ricky, but Sam is not identified in the footage and avoids arrest. Marc cooperates with the police, informing them on the details of the burglaries, much to the chagrin of Rebecca, who has been identified as the ringleader. A ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' journalist interviews Marc, who is remorseful, and Nicki, who vehemently suggests the others were at fault, and that she was simply involved with the wrong people. Rebecca also denies being at fault and tries to pass the blame for all of this to Marc and her other friends. The group is ultimately prosecuted, receiving varying amounts of jail time and is ordered to collectively pay millions of dollars in [[restitution]] for the stolen items.  The group serves their jail time, and Marc and Rebecca each go into seclusion and never see or speak to each other again, both of them steadfastly blaming each other for the robberies.  In the final scene, set a few months later, Nicki is on a talk show talking about her time in jail, and reveals that her cell was next to Lohan's. After digressing, she turns to the audience (and the viewers) as she finds a way to enhance her newfound notoriety, telling them to visit her now-popular website detailing her life after "The Bling Ring".

They watch a movie based on a real-life unsolved crime: A boy was kidnapped and the kidnapper demanded ransom from the parents, but the child was later found dead.

Teddy wrestles Dwight's rifle from him, but Ben shoots him dead from a concealed position. To keep Ben from further involvement, Dwight removes the battery from Ben's car.  Dwight goes to the Cleland house and finds it empty. He searches it for guns, dumps them in a lake, and waits to ambush the Clelands.

The Blue Umbrella (2013 film)
 A city scene is brought to life by a rainstorm. Many objects along the street – signs, lights, [[awnings]], mailboxes, buildings, houses, drains, drain pipes, rain gutters, windows, doors – appear to come to life and develop faces and expressions of their own, enjoying the shower. People pass on the street under their umbrellas, all of which are seemly black, except for a singular blue [[umbrella]]. As his owner stops at a street corner, the blue umbrella sees a pretty red umbrella next to him. The two exchange nervous glances, and soon become smitten with each other, but their owners' paths diverge.  Seeing this, the objects along the street begin to work with each other to bring the owners together. As the blue umbrella is about to be taken into the [[subway station]], a sign allows the wind to blow the umbrella from his owner's hands. The umbrella is floating through the air toward his destination when a sudden gust of wind caused by a passing bus veers him off course and he lands in the street. With the umbrella in danger from the traffic, the objects attempt to protect him from oncoming cars: a construction sign lights up to redirect an oncoming vehicle, a gurgling drain pipe spews water to push him out of the way, another construction sign falls on him to fling him away from another car, and a drain blasts him into the air, but he is hit by a truck, visibly upsetting the objects that have tried to help him.  Battered and bruised, the umbrella is found by his owner who straightens him out just as the owner of the red umbrella approaches, reuniting the two of them. The objects of the city silently celebrate their reunion as the umbrellas' owners sit down together at a local café, allowing the two umbrellas to be together after all.  ===Relationship to Disney Animation=== Though Saschka Unseld was inspired by a discarded umbrella, the story's plot arc is the same as a segment of Disney's compilation film ''[[Make Mine Music]]'', ''[[Johnny Fedora and Alice Blue Bonnet]]''. Two hats fall in love, are separated, and eventually reunited as decorative headwear for an ice man's horses. The complete segment can be viewed on [[YouTube]].  
Bombay Talkies (film)
  ===''Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh''=== ; Directed by [[Karan Johar]]  The short film begins with Avinash ([[Saqib Saleem]]), a young man, bursting into his house. He wakes his father and pushes him against the wall declaring that he is homosexual and not a transvestite that his parents are ashamed of. He leaves his parents' house, distraught and heartbroken but ready for a new start. He passes a girl at a train station singing "Ajeeb Dastan Hain Ye." Gayatri ([[Rani Mukerji]]) is married to Dev ([[Randeep Hooda]]). Gayatri, who works for a magazine meets Avinash, the new intern. Avinash informs her that he's gay and is shocked to see that it doesn't shock her. They gradually become very close. On his birthday, Gayatri invites Avinash home for dinner. That evening, Gayatri tells Dev that Avinash is gay. Dev seems shocked.  During dinner, Avinash and Dev find that they both share a love for old Hindi films and music. Avinash leans over Dev to look at something on the table and Dev visibly reacts. The next day, Gayatri leaves for some work. Avinash goes to her house to meet Dev. He gives him a CD and then invites him to come out (a funny play on "coming out of the closet"). Avinash takes Dev to meet the little girl who sings "Lag jaa gale." Dev is shocked. He pays the girl a lot of money and asks her what she plans on doing with it. She says she will buy food for her brothers and sisters. He asks her if she's lying. She curtly replies that she isn't, and telling lies is bad.  By this point, Avinash is sure that Dev is gay but hasn't come out of the closet. The next day he meets Gayatri who happily informs him that she and Dev had amazing sex the night before. Avinash is disappointed and angry, knowing fully well that he is the reason for Dev's good mood.  He goes to meet Dev at work. He admits that he took the one-hour journey between the offices just to meet him. Dev is embarrassed and asks him to leave. Avinash reaches over to hug him sensually, alarming Dev. Dev loses his temper and begins to beat Avinash up. Avinash leaves Dev, and goes back home. The beating he received from Dev triggers memories of his own father beating him up upon discovering his sexuality.  Dev visits him to apologize. He seems torn and after hitting Avinash again and throwing him against the cupboard, he kisses him. Again, Dev begins to hit Avinash. Avinash loses his temper and throws Dev out.  Avinash then goes and tells Gayatri that her husband kissed him. Gayatri is infuriated and doesn't listen to anything else Avinash has to say and goes home. Dev enters and tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away and begins to wipe her face. She tells him that she now knows that the there's nothing wrong with her but with him and that he is the reason their marriage failed. She says she's glad she's free now and informs him that their relationship is over.  In the final scene we see Avinash sitting on his bed, upset. We see Dev beside the young girl who is singing, Gayatri has kicked him out. And we see Gayatri putting on make up. The film ends on an ironical note. The young girl asks Dev for money and he says that he doesn't have any. She says that he's lying. He replies that he isn't, and lying is bad, mirroring her words from earlier. The irony being, that his whole marriage and life was a lie.  ===''Star''=== ; Directed by [[Dibakar Banerjee]] The story is an adaptation of [[Satyajit Ray]]'s short story "Patol Babu, Film Star".

Vicky is encouraged by Katrina's words. Meanwhile, Vicky's sister wants to go on a school trip but is refused Rs. 2000 by their father because he had already spent funds on the Vicky's football training.

Vicky realizes how unfair this is, and offers to perform to collect money for her trip. They then decide to organize a small ticketed event for the neighborhood at an old garage, where Vicky dances to his favorite tunes.  ===''Murabba (Fruit Preserve)''=== ; Directed by [[Anurag Kashyap]]  Vijay ([[Vineet Kumar Singh]]) is from Allahabad city in UP.

Satisfied and victorious Vijay now sets on his return journey by train. On his way back he is shown narrating his experiences to fellow passengers. Meanwhile, a co- passenger maliciously breaks the glass jar containing the murabba eaten by Mr. Bachchan while another co-passenger inadvertently squishes it. Disappointed and heartbroken, Vijay has no option but to replace the piece of murabba somehow. He decides to buy a new glass jar and some murabba. He reaches home with the murabba and offer it to his father. The father however is able to detect that something went wrong; he asks his son, "where he broke the glass jar?" In response, Vijay narrates the truth to him. It is then that the father narrates his own story to Vijay. Just as he had asked Vijay to meet Mr. Bachchan, his grandfather had asked his father to meet Mr. [[Dilip Kumar]], a Bollywood superstar of his times. His grandfather had handed over a jar of honey to his father and had asked that Mr. Dilip Kumar dip his finger into the jar. However, the jar of honey caught ants by the time it reached Mr. Dilip Kumar and the actor refused to dip his finger into it. Vijay's father had then replaced the jar of honey, dipped his own finger into it and taken it back to his father. Unsuspectingly, Vijay's grandfather ate honey from the jar for years to come and lived a long life. The movie ends with Vijay's father contemplating how life takes a full circle.

Liesel helps Max recover by reading to him books "borrowed" from the mayor's library with every spare moment.  One day while "borrowing" a book from the mayor's home, Liesel is followed by Rudy. He discovers the secret of Max, whose name he reads on a journal Max gave to Liesel for Christmas. Rudy guesses that her family is hiding someone, and he swears to never tell anyone. Franz overhears Rudy's last words of keeping it a secret and violently pushes Rudy to reveal the secret. Rudy throws the journal into the river to keep it away from Franz. After Franz leaves, Rudy plunges into the icy river to rescue the journal, and Liesel realizes that she can truly trust him. Soon, a local party member comes by to check the Hubermanns' basement, and they have to hide Max.  While working, Hans sees a neighbor and friend named Lehman being taken away by the police because he is a Jew. Hans tries to intervene, telling the officer that Lehman is a good man, but Hans's name is taken by the soldiers and he is thrown to the ground. Hans realizes what a mistake he has made, since this has made his family visible. He tells the family, and Max realises he must leave in order to protect them. Hans then receives a telegram that he has been conscripted into the army and must leave immediately.  On the way home from school, Liesel believes she has seen Max in a line of Jews being forcibly marched through town, and she begins screaming his name, running through the line. She is thrown to the sidewalk twice by German soldiers and finally gives up when Rosa picks her up and takes her home.  Hans returns home after being injured, and the family is reunited only for a short time. One night the city is bombed by accident, and the air raid sirens fail to go off. Hans, Rosa, and Rudy's family are killed in the blast. Liesel was spared from the bombing because she fell asleep in the basement while writing in the journal given to her by Max. She sees her foster family on the ground, dead, she cries and hugs them.  Neighbors bring Rudy out of his house, barely alive. He begins to tell Liesel that he loves her, but he dies before he can finish the sentence. During this scene, Death is heard speaking again about how he received the souls of the dead. Liesel passes out, and one of the soldiers carries her to a stretcher. When she wakes up, she sees a book among the rubble and picks it up. She then sees the mayor and Ilsa drive up. With Ilsa being the only friend she has left, Liesel runs up to her and hugs her.  Two years later, after Germany has fallen to the Allies, Liesel is working in the tailor shop owned by Rudy's father. Max enters. Overjoyed by his survival and return, she runs to hug him. The final scene is Death speaking again about Liesel's life and her death at the age of 90, mentioning her husband, children, and grandchildren, as we look over her modern day Manhattan Upper East Side apartment with pictures of her past and a portrait of her, upon which the camera lingers. The narrator does not state whom she married but implies that she became a writer.  
The Book of Esther (film)
 In Shushan, the capital of the Persian Empire, in the year 482 B.C. a Jew named Mordecai tells his young niece, Hadassah, about a strange dream he had. He tells her that she can no longer reveal to anyone that she is a Jew, and he tells her that her new name will be Esther. He also says that their being related must also be kept a secret, because his dream foretold of terrible things to come.   Approximately 20 years later, we see Esther as an adult in the Persian capital. There is an air of great excitement, as King Xerxes is passing through the marketplace, en route to the feast he is hosting in his palace. Esther goes to speak with Mordecai, who is also getting ready for the feast. She tells him that she's envious of Xerxes, not because he's rich and powerful, but because he's married. Mordecai assures her that her time will come, when God decides it the appropriate time. While at the feast, Haman, one of the kings advisers displays anger that Mordecai is there, saying that it would give him great pleasure to see all the Jews eradicated. During the feast, the attendees notice that Queen Vashti is not present. Xerxes' commander, Sardar, reports this to him, and he has Vashti summoned. However, she refuses to come, saying that she is too busy to come and dance for him, and tells Sardar that his army can dance for the king. She says that even if the king himself would summon her, she would not come. Xerxes does not allow this impertinence to stand, and has Vashti banished from the palace, and nullifies his marriage with her.  Judith, a friend of Esther, relates the news to her. Esther replies that if she were summoned to dance, she wouldn't come either. Haman, seeing an opportunity to become closer with the king, devises a plot in which his eunuch, Gasparif will speak up at the kings meeting, and suggest his daughter, Zara, to be the next queen. In a conversation with Mordecai, Esther expresses that she would have acted the same way that Vashti did, reminding him that even if the king commanded them to break the sabbath, they would disobey him. At the meeting, Gasparif suggests Haman's daughter to be the future queen. Mordecai then speaks up, and says that he has a worthy candidate as well. The king then decrees that there will be a contest to see who will be the next queen. Haman, in a private meeting with Gasparif declares outrage over the kings decision, and tells him that he will pay dearly for causing this situation.  Later that night, Mordecai tells Esther that she has been suggested as a possible future bride for Xerxes. Esther is initially hesitant, but Mordecai warns her that if Haman's daughter were to become queen, it would be a travesty for the Jewish people. Haman returns to his home, and speaks furiously to his wife, Zaresh, saying that Mordecai will ruin his plans. His wife assures him that despite their daughters horrid appearance, she will make her presentable to the king.   Esther beseeches God, saying that she has a great challenge ahead of her, and begs Him to give her answers. The voice of God is heard, and He tells her that there will be a time for her to keep quiet, and also a time for her to speak out. At the same time, Haman sees his daughter, and expresses disgust at seeing her. Zaresh assures him that she will cover her face with a veil, to obscure it. The next day at the palace, the candidates are presented to the king. Xerxes has Esther and Zara sent to his private chamber, to await his decision. Xerxes tells Sardar that he will go to eavesdrop on their conversations, in order to figure out their true intentions. Esther inquires as to why Zara has her face covered, and she tells her that it is to hide her ugliness. Esther asks that she remove the veil, and tells Zara that she is beautiful, and that her parents have been lying to her. Zara admits that her father only wants her to be queen in order to control the king, and that she will be banished if she doesn't become queen. Esther assure her that she will have a place in the palace, as her lady-in-waiting. The next morning, the king announces his decision that Esther shall be the new queen, making his decision based on what he heard the previous night. Haman returns to his house in a fury, and tells Zaresh that he will wage a war against Mordecai and his people.   Esther is summoned by Xerxes, and has her sit by his feet, explaining that since she's not of noble birth, she has to sit below him. Esther tells him that as the king, he is the one who makes the laws, and Xerxes comes to sit beside her to talk. Sardar is seen plotting with Xerxes' bodyguard, Teres, saying that they will assassinate Xerxes that night, saying that he is too incompetent to serve. Mordecai overhears their plot, and rushes to tell the king, who has just been pulled into a meeting with Haman. Haman complains to Xerxes that since his daughter wasn't made queen his honor has been diminished, and asks to be made prime minister. Xerxes acquiesces, but tells him that it is merely another title. Mordecai arrives immediately afterwards, and tells the king about the plot to end his life. Haman demands that Mordecai bow to him, as befitting his new title, but Mordecai refuses.  Haman returns home enraged, and tells his wife that he will find a way to show the Jews as treasonous, and have them and Mordecai eradicated. Zaresh suggests that they have a gallows built, in order to hang Mordecai on it.    Haman again calls Xerxes to another meeting, and says that there is a threat to his kingdom from within. He says that the Jews are plotting treason, and quotes Hebrew scriptures, which state that God is the true king of the Jews. Haman tells him that he has selected the 13th day of the 12th month to slaughter all the Jews, and Xerxes decrees that it shall be so. Judith goes to visit Esther, who asks why Mordecai isn't there. She tells here that Mordecai is at home, mourning because of the decree. Judith tells her that she must appear before the king, and beg him to reverse the decree. She initially is hesitant, but Judith says that Mordecai has said that there is a time to keep silent, and a time to speak, but if she is silent now, she and all the Jews will surely be killed. Esther tell Judith to ask all the Jews to fast on her behalf, for since the king did not summon her, she might be put to death upon her unannounced arrival.  Esther appears before the king, and finds favor in his eyes. She requests that the king and Haman come to a feast that she will be preparing the next day. Haman returns to his home, giddy that all of his plans are going well, and that he is the only other person who is invited to Esther's feast. While at the feast, Xerxes says he will grant Esther any request, even up to half his kingdom. Esther beseeches the king, telling him that there is a great enemy in his palace, because Haman has ordered the slaughter of her and her people. Esther reminds him that Mordecai once saved the king's life, and Xerxes declares that there will be a trial held to verify whether Mordecai is innocent or not. At the trial, Xerxes again asks Haman to show his proof, and he does so willingly. Mordecai replies that God also appoints kings, and that to disobey the king would be to disobey God. Haman asks Mordecai who he would obey in a situation where the word of God conflicted with the word of the king. Mordecai replies that long before Xerxes was even born, the Jews had worshiped the God of Israel. The people at the meeting are outraged, and call Mordecai a traitor. Esther then speaks up on behalf of Mordecai, reminding Xerxes that he once provided Mordecai with a royal horse and clothes for saving his life. She asks the same question to Xerxes that Haman asked to Mordecai, who declares that he would have the man follow his own conscience, for even a king can make a mistake.  The king absolves the Jews of all counts of treason, saying that none of them will be harmed. Xerxes then declares that Haman shall be hanged on a gallows, and Haman's Munich tells the king that Haman has already constructed a gallows. Xerxes states that that day shall be a day of happiness and great joy for the Jews for all of history, and that the events shall be recorded in writing. Mordecai is appointed as the new prime minister, and a feast is thrown for the Jews to celebrate their newfound freedom.

Bounty Killer (film)
  Two of the highest ranked bounty killers in the Thrice Burned Lands, Drifter ([[Matthew Marsden]]) and Mary Death ([[Christian Pitre]]) team up to exterminate a party full of yellow-tied corporate criminals.  Drifter’s explosive killing style is in stark contrast to Mary’s graceful way of delivering death to white collar scum.  Despite their difference in style, they exhibit level of comfort with one another that seems to indicate a long and dynamic history between these celebrity assassins.  After the fight moves to a skyscraper’s rooftop, Drifter disposes of his intended target and saves Mary from falling to her death.  The bounty killers ride into the bustling town of San Dalloosa, Drifter on his chopper, Mary in her signature cherry-topped death machine.  They arrive at Daft Willy’s Chop Shop and Bounty Supply, a converted jet fuselage from the Corporate Wars where bounty killers exchange the bodies of slain targets for cash.  A crowd has gathered at the entrance to welcome the heroes.  Drifter doesn’t attract the same amount of attention from the paparazzi as Mary Death—how could he?  She’s stunningly beautiful—a chiseled, unrepentant killer in thigh high boots.  She greets her fans and the press, telling them “I never pull out before the big kill.”  While Mary basks in her fans’ adoration, Drifter meets an exuberant gun caddy for hire named Jack LeMans ([[Barak Hardley]]).  Drifter is not in the mood to hear Jack’s very enthusiastic offer of service, so he leaves him at the gate and heads on into Willy’s.  Inside we meet the proprietor, Daft Willy ([[Kevin McNally]]).  He’s a cantankerous English thug in a blood-soaked apron who will log your kills for the Council of Nine while delivering you a healthy, filth-laden dose of sass.  Willy tells Drifter a new death warrant has been issued for their friend Snaggletooth Harry.  Drifter’s distress over this revelation attracts the attention of Mary, who enters with a cart full of dead executives.  She’s curious to know why he’d make such a big deal out of a small-time collar, telling him “He must be your snitch.”  Just then, Jack springs out of Mary’s cart.  Willy, Drifter and Mary all pull their guns.  Jack pleads for one chance to prove he’s the world’s greatest gun caddy.  Drifter decides to give him a shot, knowing he’ll probably be dead within a week anyway.  After the bounty killers leave, Daft Willy receives a new death warrant on his Council-Comm printer.  The look on his face tells us this isn’t your everyday warrant.  Jack and Drifter practice tossing guns back and forth from Drifter’s chopper to Jack’s scooter.  They’re on their way to Harry’s Whisky Saloon in Drip Rock to find out why he’s a wanted man.  Meanwhile, Mary works on her [[Ford Mustang Mach 1|Mustang]]’s rear differential which was overstressed by the massive pile of bodies she towed on her trailer.  She fixes the car, kicks the trailer away and vows to her car, “No more attachments, just like mama.”  At that moment, a tiny car approaches.  Out pops Greg Gunney ([[Jeff Meacham]]), a sleazy salesman in a sport coat/turtleneck combo.  He offers Mary a chance to “join the team” and use her celebrity to endorse his company, Wasteland Resorts—a subsidiary of Second Sun Enterprises, the mysterious company of yellow-ties Mary encountered at the loft party.  Mary sees through Greg’s scheme and executes him and his bodyguard with her signature go-go boot spur-kick-to-the-throat move.  Upon searching his car she finds a disturbing death warrant—it’s for Francis Gorman, aka “Drifter.”  Back in Drip Rock, Drifter finds that Harry is dead, his body surrounded by copies of the Francis Gorman death warrant.  It’s a trap.  Mary arrives in Drip Rock and confronts Drifter about the poster.  She’s furious that he lied to her.  Drifter assures her there is some sort of mistake and he’s going to the Council building to work it all out.  She won’t let him off that easy.  “I’m going with you, and that’s not a request.”  She fires her gun at Drifter which sends him flying out the second story window.  Upon landing he’s attacked by several yellow-tied goons.  He calls to Jack to grab the bikes.  Though grossly outnumbered, the bounty killers eliminate their attackers while arguing about whether or not Mary gets to tag along to see the Council.  Just as the last goon drops dead from his sniper post, Jack and Drifter haul ass out of town.  Mary puts her hair up and struts to her Mustang.  Outside the town, Mary fires at Drifter and Jack.  Jack tells Drifter she won’t be a problem because he modified the car’s boosters while they were in Harry’s Saloon.  Mary kicks on her boosters, sending the vehicle into a violent donut spin before bursting into flames.  Jack: “That’s not supposed to happen.”  Drifter looks back to a soot-covered Mary to make sure she’s alive.  She looks back to Drifter with deep anger in her eyes.  Back in Drip Rock, a slick Corvette stingray enters the town square, now littered with the bodies of several yellow ties.  Behind the wheel is Van Sterling ([[Gary Busey]]), a high ranking executive at Second Sun.  He questions one of the struggling henchmen and learns the bounty killers got away and are on their way to the Council.  Van then answers a call on his briefcase video phone.  He relays the information about the bounty killers to his boss, a severe business woman in yellow stilettos by the name of Catherine ([[Kristanna Loken]]).  She encourages him to “finish the job” or she will have no choice but to terminate him.  Van promises to track down the bounty killers and “keep the killing alive.”  Later that night, Drifter explains to Jack that he’s a wanted criminal and that he should take off.  Jack vows to stay.  Suddenly, out of the darkness, Drifter is approached by a skull-faced assassin who holds a knife to his throat.  This is a Gypsy.  Drifter and Jack are tied to a pole in the middle of a rambunctious celebration at a Gypsy camp.  Heavy drinking, fire dancing and other revelry surround the two prisoners.  From the largest tent enters the Gypsy Queen, Mocha Sujata ([[Eve (rapper)|Eve Jeffers]]).  Mocha interrogates Drifter, wanting to know the location of Nuri, a Gypsy girl who escaped their camp many years ago.  “She mentioned the name Drifter.”  Mocha, not happy with Drifter’s refusal to give up any information, orders another Gypsy to burn him with her fire wands.  Despite the extreme torture, Drifter keeps his mouth shut.  Mocha calls off the interrogation for the night, leaving the prisoners alone.  Drifter confesses to Jack that the Gypsies are looking for Mary.  Jack doesn’t understand why Drifter would risk their lives for a woman who tried to kill them, but then realizes that Drifter must be in love with Mary.  Drifter explains how he first met Mary many years ago when she lived her life as a Gypsy named Nuri.  Nuri approached him while he was in the company of a prostitute Estelle ([[Mindy Robinson]]) and demanded he teach her how to be a bounty killer.  While training her, they fell in love.  But the relationship ended when Drifter suggested they get a place together and settle down.  At daybreak, the Gypsies are all passed out from a hard night of knocking back pots of roach liquor.  Drifter and Jack have cut themselves free from the pole.  They climb atop a Gypsy coach (an [[Airstream]] trailer pulled by three motorcycles) and make their escape from the camp.  Upon hearing the engines’ roar, the Gypsies awake and chase after their prisoners.  A Western-style stagecoach scene unfolds when Jack and Drifter try to eliminate their pursuers.  A bazooka finishes them off and allows the guys to ride off into the desert.  Mary arrives at the Thirsty Beaver, the bounty killer training facility and tavern where she lived during her training with Drifter.  Inside she finds the Beaver’s owner, Lucille ([[Beverly D'Angelo|Beverly D’Angelo]]).  Lucille helps Mary get cleaned up and back on the road with her old Gypsy bike.  She makes sure Mary leaves with her chest-plate armor, telling her “Sometimes it pays for a girl to be practical.”  Jack and Drifter pull the Gypsy coach up to a small shack in the middle of what appears to be a junkyard.  Outside the shack is a [[Chevy Nova]] painted up in [[Pabst Blue Ribbon]] race car livery.  Drifter tells Jack they need the help of the car’s driver, a coyote named Jimbo ([[Abraham Benrubi]]), who will help them get across the Badlands and over to the Council building.  Jimbo tells the guys there’s too much risk and that he’s not willing to do the job no matter what price they’re willing to pay.  Drifter convinces Jimbo by offering him a six-pack of [[Pabst Blue Ribbon]], Jimbo’s favorite drink and a rarity in the post-apocalyptic world.  Mary is lost in the Badlands, a war-torn city engulfed by a violent nuclear storm.  She sees a beacon that leads her to Azimuth’s map shop.  Inside she meets the mapmaker and pleads with him to help her find her way out of the Badlands and over to the Council building.  He refuses to help her until he looks up and realizes she’s the famous Mary Death.  He then offers to help in exchange for an autograph.  Jimbo successfully makes his way through the Badlands in record time.  To celebrate, he cracks open a can of [[Pabst Blue Ribbon|Pabst]].  “Now I can die a happy man.”  Just then Jimbo is shot in the arm by an unseen assailant.  The car takes several more hits from a sniper in the hills while Drifter, Jack and Jimbo take cover.  Drifter soon realizes the shooter is Mary.  He convinces her to come down from the hill and talk it out.  Mary points a gun at Drifter and tells him he’s a dead man.  Jack has had enough.  He loses it, exclaiming that he’s sick of all the guns and the Badlands and Gypsies trying to eat them.  He tells Mary that Drifter was beaten to hell by the Gypsies but never gave her up because he loves her.  He also points out that Mary could have easily shot Drifter, but she didn’t because she loves him.  Mary drops her gun and agrees to let them use her map to get to the Council.  The group arrives at the Council building and finds the village destroyed by an army of yellow-ties.  Inside the Council chamber are the slain bodies of the Council judges.  Drifter explains how he knew there must be something wrong.  He knew the Council personally.  In fact, he was offered a position to be the tenth judge but refused in order to become the first bounty killer.  Mary is distraught by the Council’s death, but agrees they must go after those responsible—Second Sun.  Just then our heroes are captured and surrounded by another group of yellow-ties including Van and Catherine, who we learn was once married to Drifter.  Catherine explains her plan to pin the death of the Council on Mary Death so Second Sun can step in and promise a better life to the survivors of the Thrice Burned Lands.  Just when we think all is lost both groups are attacked by Gypsies!  During the fight, Jimbo is shot again but saved by Jack who hides him in the trunk of the [[Chevy Nova|Nova]].  Mary leaves Drifter to fight with Mocha.  Then Jack leaves Drifter to fight with Van.  Drifter is then knocked unconscious and taken aboard the Second Sun helicopter with Catherine.  They fly away as the battle rages on.  Mary kills Mocha, but is severely injured in the process.  Mary awakes in a Gypsy tent to find Jack at her bedside.  He tells her the Gypsies are now under her control because she killed their queen.  They make a plan to free Drifter from Second Sun with the help of Mary’s new Gypsy army. Inside Second Sun we find Drifter shaven and wearing a suit.  He’s tied to a chair in a glass office.  Catherine enters and tells him she’d like to reinstate his position as CEO of Gorman Enterprises, now owned by Second Sun.  She thinks his “Drifter” celebrity will inspire market confidence.  “Run this company with me, Francis.  It’s the only thing you’ve ever been good at.”  Just then Mary and Jack burst into the office bullpen with their Gypsy army.  They knock Catherine unconscious and rescue Drifter.  Jack, now a quick and precise gun caddy, assists Drifter and Mary as they unleash their fury upon the employees of Second Sun.  Just as they’re about to make their escape, Mary is shot down by Catherine.  Drifter kills Catherine and runs to Mary’s lifeless body.  He then realizes Mary is wearing a chest-plate.  Jack and Drifter carry Mary to safety.  Mary and Drifter spend two weeks naked in each other’s arms back at the Thirsty Beaver.  Jimbo gives Jack his last can of [[Pabst Blue Ribbon|Pabst]] to thank him for saving him from the Gypsies.  Mary, now in a new black leather get-up, comes down the stairs and hops into her new cherry-topped death machine, a gift from Jack to make up for blowing up her old one.  She tells Jack she’s off to do battle with another branch of Second Sun then hits the gas and takes off.  Drifter runs out, stabbed again in the spleen by Mary.  She looks to him in the rearview: “Come and get me, old man.”  
Boy and the World
 The entire film is told with very little dialogue and what dialogue there is, is actually Portuguese, but backwards.  Cuca lives a very simple and blissful life with his parents, playing in the forests and interacting with the animals and listening to sounds that are represented by glowing balls of light. One day Cuca's father leaves by train to find work saddening Cuca with the nostalgia of playing with his mom and dad. Feeling that he will never be happy again, Cuca leaves with a large suitcase that contains only a picture of him and his parents. While waiting for the train, a sudden gust of wind lifts him up carrying him far away to a world that appears to have two moons.  Cuca is rescued by an old man and his dog, who promptly take him along to work in the cotton fields. While there, Cuca hears the music of a traveling parade lead by a young man in a rainbow poncho. The foreman of the cotton fields begins going over his workers firing those who are unable to work or are sick which unfortunately includes the old man. Cuca, the old man, and the dog leave and stop under a large pink leaved tree where Cuca spots his father traveling in the back of a truck and leaves the old man and dog to continue his journey.  He arrives at a factory where the workers churn the cotton into fabric in robotic unison. At the end of the day, Cuca takes a bus into a grimy city and he ends up staying with a young factory worker who is later revealed to be the rainbow poncho-wearing parader. In the morning, Cuca and the young man arrive at the market where the young man works as a street musician on the side. While playing with a [[kaleidoscope]], Cuca ends up on a barge where he learns that the fabrics are taken to a futuristic utopian city where they are folded and repackaged to be sold back in the grimy city. He reunites with the young man who takes him back to the factory to reveal where he makes the rainbow [[poncho]]. They then witness the factory's manager making a deal with business men to replace the workers with a large automatic machine. The young man and the rest of the workers are fired and it is implied that they will continue to work in the cotton fields.  While making their way back to the city, Cuca and the young man are stopped in traffic by the parade. Cuca suddenly spots the train his father came on and, using the young man's bike, arrives at the station to greet his father. However, Cuca is shocked to see multiple fathers who all look the same and all came to the city for a similar purpose. The parade is suddenly stopped by the city's army which is represented by a giant rainbow bird being defeated in combat by a black bird and various army weapons. Cuca later witnesses young children living in the slums preparing to start a rebellion of some kind.  In haste, Cuca runs back home where he witnesses various machines taking over everything inter cut with [[Live action|live-action]] footage. He arrives back at the pink leaved tree where it is revealed that the old man is actually an older Cuca and that the tree is outside his now dilapidated childhood home. In flashback, the young man, who is also Cuca, is seen leaving home and saying goodbye to his mother while seeing a sapling of the tree. Old Cuca pins the photo of him and his family and dons the rainbow poncho where it is shown that his childhood home is surrounded by newer houses and farmers where their children continue to play. The movie ends with one final flashback of Cuca and his parents planting the seed that will become the pink leaved tree.  
Brazilian Western
 João do Santo Cristo ([[Fabrício Boliveira]]) was raised in the countryside of [[Bahia]] by his parents on a poor, small farm. His father was shot and killed by a police officer as a punishment for hurting the cop's brother, who was himself hurting João earlier for trying to steal candy. When João is older, his mother dies and he decides to leave home for [[Brasília]], to meet a relative he discovered by looking at some old pictures. Before leaving town, however, he executes his father’s killer and is caught by police at the bus stop. After doing time in prison, he is finally able to go to Brasília.  Upon arriving in Brasília, he meets his cousin Pablo ([[César Troncoso]]) and start doing small illegal tasks for him, such as delivering drugs. Pablo also gives him weapons (including the [[Winchester 22]] cited in the eponymous song). He also starts working at a local carpentry to earn some money. One of his drug delivery operations goes wrong and is stormed by the police. In order to escape, he manages to break into an apartment. There, he meets Maria Lúcia ([[Isis Valverde]]), a [[punk music]] enthusiast and daughter of a [[Federal Senate|senator]]. Despite the circumstances, they end up falling in love after João visits her one more time and asks her out.  When Maria Lúcia shows her friend the marijuana João can provide, they immediately like it and ask for more. This upsets Jeremias (Felipe Abib), the local drug dealer, and he tries to have João killed with the help of his partner and corrupt police officer Marco Aurélio ([[Antônio Calloni]]). Maria disapproves João’s criminal activities and demands him to stop. He promises Maria he will stop committing crimes, but he and Pablo start a new drug empire in Brasília taking advantage of the better marijuana they can offer.  In order to regain their respect and market around the city, Jeremias and his allies organize a "rockonha" (a portmanteau of “Rock” (the musical genre) and “Maconha” (marijuana), it refers to a party with rock’n’roll music and marijuana), and João is invited. Upon arriving, he is chased by Jeremias and his two henchman. The trio corners João at the edge of a hill, but Pablo and a friend were already waiting nearby. Jeremias turns the tables once again in his favor and reveals that he has several criminals and corrupt officers covering him. Pablo pushes João down the hill and sacrifices himself to buy João some time.  João ends up captured anyway and is taken to prison. There, he spends several days, and each day he is ordered to hold a newspaper in front of him so Marco can photograph both. One day, during this task, João manages to grab hold of Marco and sets himself and all other prisoners free. He then executes Marco and heads for a final assault on Jeremias and his drug empire. He starts by killing Jeremia’s right handman and stealing all his cocaine, leaving a message daring Jeremias to a duel.  At the assigned place, Jeremias finds three final bags of his cocaine hanging from a [[Football pitch#Goal|football goal]]. When he approaches the bags, João shoots them. They both stare at each other. Maria arrives with João’s Winchester .22 and aims it at Jeremias. While João looks at her, Jeremias takes the moment to shoot him. With João, shot and on the ground, Maria kneels by João’s side, and Jeremias shoots her as well. Jeremias then turns around to check on his wasted cocaine. João, still breathing, loads his Winchester and shoots Jeremias five times, killing him. The film ends with João and Maria laying dead beside each other and with scenes of them together and João’s narration.  In a post-credits scene, an alternate, more song-loyal ending is presented, with João and Jeremias about to duel in front of a crowd, as originally described in the song. It ends with both drawing out their guns and pointing them at each other, while Maria is shown having a brief spasm.

Broken City
 [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] detective Billy Taggart ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) is arrested for the murder of Mikey Tavarez, who was believed to have raped and murdered 16-year-old Yesenia Barea but "walked" on a technicality. Chief Carl Fairbanks ([[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]) goes to [[Mayor of New York City]] Nicholas Hostetler ([[Russell Crowe]]) with a witness and evidence incriminating the detective, but Hostetler buries the evidence. A judge clears Taggart as having shot Tavarez in self-defense. The mayor calls Taggart to his office for a private meeting and calls him "a hero", but still forces him to leave the police force.  Seven years later, Taggart is living with his girlfriend Natalie Barrow ([[Natalie Martinez]]), an aspiring actress. Taggart's private detective business is on the verge of bankruptcy when Mayor Hostetler hires him to investigate his wife, Cathleen Hostetler ([[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]), who he thinks is having an affair. Helped by his assistant, Katy Bradshaw ([[Alona Tal]]), Taggart learns that Cathleen is seeing Paul Andrews ([[Kyle Chandler]]), the campaign manager of Hostetler's rival in the upcoming elections, Jack Valliant ([[Barry Pepper]]).  At a fundraiser for Hostetler's campaign, Cathleen reveals to Taggart that she knows he has been following her and advises him not to trust her husband. Taggart delivers to Mayor Hostetler photos taken of Cathleen meeting with Andrews.  At a film debut party, Barrow reveals that her real name is Natalia Barea and that Yesenia was her sister. At the screening, Taggart is shocked at Natalie's sex scene and strongly disapproves; he had thought it would express poetic love but finds it akin to porn. Consumed with guilt over working for Hostetler, Taggart descends into regular drinking bouts. He argues with Natalie over the scene and about the people she is seeing during her work, and she breaks off the relationship.  Taggart gets drunk, brawling with strangers while walking the city streets. He receives a phone call from Katy telling him Chief Fairbanks wants him at a murder scene. When Taggart arrives, he learns that Andrews, Valliant's campaign manager, has been found murdered.  Taggart tells Fairbanks that he was hired by Mayor Hostetler to investigate his wife. They learn that the candidate Valliant was in Andrews' apartment, and the two men were lovers. Valliant reveals that Andrews was scheduled to meet Todd Lancaster ([[James Ransone]]), the son of Hostetler's wealthy benefactor, contractor Sam Lancaster ([[Griffin Dunne]]). A furious Cathleen tells Taggart that Andrews was a close friend of hers, not a lover, and that he had promised her information about Hostetler's plans for the Bolton Village Housing Project. The deal was expected to enrich both Sam Lancaster and the mayor. Hostetler wanted to find out Cathleen's source, so he manipulated Taggart into tracking her.   Taggart decides to investigate Mayor Hostetler for corruption. He goes to Lancaster's construction business and finds workers destroying loads of documents. Stealing some of the documents, he discovers that Bolton Village has been sold in order to build high-rise office buildings, rather than a new housing development. Hundreds of impoverished people will be left homeless while Hostetler and Lancaster make a profit. After leaving Lancaster's, Taggart is pursued in a car chase by Hostetler's men, who run him off the road and take back the documents.   Taggart visits Sam's son Todd Lancaster, who says he had intended to give Andrews a copy of the demolition contract as evidence against Hostetler on the night Andrews was murdered. He gives it to Taggart instead. Taggart confronts Mayor Hostetler, who is unfazed because he has kept a video showing that Taggart murdered Tavarez in cold blood. Since there is no statute of limitations on murder, Taggart can still be prosecuted and face prison time. Taggart records their conversation, as the Mayor admits to his own corrupt dealings.  Willing to make the recording public, although he would endanger his freedom, Taggart turns the recording over to Commissioner Fairbanks.  While Hostetler is at home celebrating a successful debate, Fairbanks arrives to arrest him. Fairbanks tells the mayor he was having an affair with Cathleen. In the film's final scene, Taggart meets Fairbanks at a bar, and they toast Valliant, who has won the election. Katy comes in to say goodbye before the two men leave the bar.

Nana returns home and inquires to Song Qian and Yang Zheng about the deceased Xiao Ai haunting her. Ten years ago, the six friends had included Xiao Ai in their clique, with Hongrui, who played [[tennis]] before he got his leg cast, falling in love with her, much to the chagrin of Nana, who was in love with Hongrui. She blamed Xiao Ai on the misfortunes that the six experienced lately and, following a reading using an [[ouija board]], singled her out as Yuki, a girl from Nana and Song Qian's past who was regarded as a freak for apparently causing misfortunes around her, including the death of Song Qian's father. Xiao Ai committed suicide by jumping from a building after Song Qian declared her refusal to talk to her again.  While having sex with a prostitute, Yang Zheng is killed when a machinery crushes him. Hongrui, who is struggling to make a living, blackmails You Feng into giving him money in exchange for not revealing a secret video that could potentially scandalize him and Yufei, with whom You Feng is maintaining relationship with despite his having married his boss' daughter. Hongrui is then killed through multiple cuts by an unknown figure. Seconds later, You Feng and Yufei sneak into Yang Zheng's residence to get the flash containing the video, but Nana has already got it.  Yufei is the next to be killed when she gets stabbed inside her house. Song Qian learns from You Feng that Nana came to the United States not to pursue her studies, but to attend a mental facility. Nana visits Song Qian several times afterward, restless because of Xiao Ai's terrors. Song Qian takes Hongrui's flash from Nana's grasp while she is sleeping and watches the video, learning that Xiao Ai died not because of suicide but because she accidentally fell while attempting to strangle Nana for making Song Qian reject her. The five then dispose of Xiao Ai by making it look like she had committed suicide.  You Feng chases Nana to the building where Xiao Ai was disposed years ago. He reveals to Song Qian that he is the one who murdered their friends, not Xiao Ai, as he fears that they will stream the video and scandalize him, since he suggested the method of Xiao Ai's disposal. However, Nana manages to kill him by impaling him with a metal rod.  Several months later, Song Qian meets Nana and tells her that everything is over. The camera turns to reveal that Xiao Ai is grasping Nana and about to slash her neck, saying that "once Nana is killed, they (Xiao Ai and Song Qian) can be together". Song Qian is shocked, but slowly gives a smile.

The Call (2013 film)
 [[Los Angeles Police Department]] veteran [[9-1-1]] operator, Jordan Turner, receives a call one night, from a teenage girl, Leah Templeton, fearing for her life as a man breaks into her home. Jordan calmly advises her to conceal herself upstairs. When the call is disconnected, Jordan calls Leah back, a decision that costs Leah her life. The ringing phone gives her location away to the intruder. Jordan attempts to dissuade him from going further over the phone. He responds "It's already done" and hangs up, leaving her distraught.   The next day, Jordan sees a television report confirming that Leah has been murdered. Emotionally affected by the incident, Jordan tells her boyfriend, Officer Paul Phillips, that she can no longer handle field calls.  Six months later, she is working as a trainer for 9-1-1 operators. Teenager Casey Welson is kidnapped from a mall parking garage by a man named Michael Foster after parting with her friend, Autumn, and forced into the trunk of his car. Casey had accidentally taken Autumn's [[TracFone|disposable phone]], and uses it to call 9-1-1. A rookie operator, Brooke, receives the call but is unable to handle it, prompting Jordan to take over. However, Casey's use of a disposable phone means that her location cannot be determined by GPS.    While Michael drives, Jordan guides Casey through knocking out a [[tail light]] and signaling people in nearby cars. One woman who sees Casey waving her arm out of the trunk of the car calls 9-1-1, allowing the police to narrow their search. When Casey tells Jordan that there are cans of paint in the trunk, Jordan has Casey pour the paint out of the taillight hole. This attracts the attention of another motorist, Alan Denado, but Michael knocks him out with a shovel, and assuming him to be dead and stuffs Alan in the trunk with Casey.    Alan reawakens in the trunk and begins screaming uncontrollably, and Michael stabs him. Michael stops at a gas station where Casey gets an idea to crawl out of the trunk and scream for help. A gas attendant attempts to bust the door open, but Michael sprays him with gasoline and throws a lighter at him.   Upon arriving at his destination, Michael removes Casey from the trunk and finds the phone in her pocket, with 9-1-1 listening on the line. Through the phone, Jordan informs him that his identity is uncovered and advises him to turn himself in and not hurt the girl. Before smashing the phone, Michael responds, "It's already done", leading Jordan to realize that Michael is the same culprit who killed Leah.   Meanwhile, Paul, accompanied by Officer Jake Devans and others in law enforcement, raid Michael's home, but find only his wife and children. Finding a photo of Michael and his sister, Melinda, they realize that Casey resembles her. Additionally, the house seen in the photo is eventually revealed by Michael's wife to have burned down, although a nearby cottage still remains. The police raid it, but find nobody there and leave.   Michael begins to wash and cut Casey's hair. Determined to rescue Casey, Jordan drives to the secondary home where she finds a number of photos of Michael with his [[leukemia]]-stricken sister. Stepping outside, she recognizes sounds from an outdoor [[flagpole]], reminiscent of sounds heard in the background in the final moments of the 9-1-1 call. She also finds a trap door amid dirt and scrub located where the primary house once stood. Jordan accidentally drops her cellphone down the cellar and climbs down in without calling the police.  Navigating the cellar, Jordan hides from an emerging Michael. The cellar itself pieces together Michael's backstory. Michael had [[incest]]uous feelings towards his sister and was distraught when she fell ill, lost all of her hair and died of leukemia. Michael has a prop head that he keeps in the cellar that he treats like his sister. He has also been scalping and killing young girls who have similar blond hair, trying to find scalps that match his sister's hair.   Jordan soon finds Casey strapped down to a dentist chair and attacks Michael, as he begins to lacerate Casey's scalp. She frees Casey and both make an attempt to escape the cellar, during which Casey stabs Michael in the back with a pair of scissors. Michael pursues them and they are able to injure and kick him back down into the cellar, rendering him unconscious. While he is knocked out, they tie him to a chair.   When he regains consciousness, they inform him that they plan to [[starvation|leave him to die]] and claim that Casey had escaped, that she was found by Jordan in the woods, and that Michael disappeared. Pleading with them that they cannot just leave him there, Jordan replies to Foster using his own words, "It's already done."

C.O.G.
  David ([[Jonathan Groff]]) travels by bus, enduring days of discomfort and annoying people. While reading ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', David is interrupted by a man who asks him if he has opened his heart to Jesus. David replies that he does not believe in religion. David arrives at his destination and calls home to leave a message for his mother, asking her not to bother apologizing to him. He tells her not to call him and that he'll be going off the radar for a while. He arrives at an apple farm for a job and speaks to elderly farm owner Hobbs ([[Dean Stockwell]]), and lies about his name being Samuel instead of David. He also states that a girl named Jennifer will be joining him the following week. Hobbs gives David a position in the orchard and then takes David to his living quarters, a barn with mostly Spanish speaking workers already living there. He is introduced to Pedro who will train him. Later, David tells Pedro that Jennifer did not travel with him because she wanted to travel with some guy she just met who did not have room for David in the car. Hobbs catches David slacking off and tells him take a tank and bring it into town to have it filled with gas. After carrying the tank to town on foot, he is approached by Jon ([[Denis O'Hare]]) who tries to give him a "C.O.G." brochure then asks if David has let Jesus into his heart. David responds, "I'm an atheist." Jon continuously offers to help him with the tank of gas, but David refuses and laboriously drags the tank back. At dinner that night, Pedro and David attempt to converse despite the language barrier. Pedro points to David's Yale sweater and asks if there are many "mujeres" (women) there, then asks if David has a girlfriend. David misunderstands, stating he does not have a daughter. Pedro tries to clarify using his hands to mime breasts and sex, which confuses and flusters David who adamantly says, "Definitely no mujeres."   While talking to Pedro the next day, he looks up and sees Jennifer ([[Troian Bellisario]]) standing in front of him. After a brief excited reunion, Jennifer questions why he is wearing a Yale sweater and why everyone thinks his name is Samuel. David is excited and can't wait to work with her, then notices her travel partner, Rob, standing by the car. At the local diner, Jennifer tells David she will not be staying to work with him on the farm. David is angry at her for abandoning him and then calls her a slut for having sex with Rob in his car. She tells David that the people in Oregon are trash and tries to convince him to go to San Francisco with them but David remains stubborn, telling her that he fits in just fine. Jennifer says she knows what this is really about, implying that something happened back home and saying, "Just because you avoid them, doesn't mean they are going to miss you." After she tells him to get over it, David tells her that her relationship with Rob will end, and she will come running to him in tears because she will never find anyone as good as him. "I know," she says. The two then hug and Jennifer leaves in Rob's car.  The next day, Pedro leaves for Los Angeles to find better work. Hobbs thinks that David won't stay much longer now that Jennifer has left. But he tells Hobbs that he wants to stay a bit longer, so Hobbs assigns him to the apple sorting factory down the road. David attempts to call his family again, leaving another message for his mom and makes it sound like he's having a great time. At the factory, his co-worker Debbie ([[Dale Dickey]]) refuses to chat with him. David and Curly ([[Corey Stoll]]), the forklift operator, notice each other from across the room. Eventually Curly befriends David after witnessing coworkers making fun of David at lunch. David and Curly grow closer, and David asks Curly to get a drink. Afterwards, Curly invites David over to his mother's house where David reveals that he is not on speaking terms with his own mother. The conversation becomes flirty and Curly brings David to his bedroom to reveal an extensive collection of anal sex toys. Curly tries to initiate sex but David panics and goes to the bathroom where he crawls out the window. The next day, he lies to Hobbs that he got a new job offer back in Connecticut and then discovers that the money he saved up has been stolen. He finds the C.O.G. brochure and calls Jon, who takes David under his wing, offering an apprenticeship. Jon makes him go to church and allows him to stay with him in the garage of Martha ([[Casey Wilson]]) and Paul, who allow Jon to live there. He trains David in the art of jade clock sculpting. After David accidentally breaks a clock, Jon has an aggressive outburst. Martha and Paul tell Jon that he and David need to find someplace else to live and they recommend an abandoned beauty salon where they can sleep and continue their clock work.  Jon continues to try converting David and tells him to ask God for happiness. They continue to go to church together. After leaving church one day, Martha tells David that his mother called and was worried about him. That evening, Jon goes to an A.A. meeting and leaves David to experiment with his tools. Later that night, Curly arrives and confronts him about running away. After David tries to apologize, Curly tries to sexually assault David. Staring at the crucifix and sobbing, David begs Jesus to help him. Curly stops his attempts and leaves, confused and angry. The next day, Jon takes an exhausted David and to church where David kneels in front of everyone and is told to ask God for happiness, as well as for children and a woman to marry. He cries and appears genuinely happy. Touched by this, Jon takes David outside and declares him a C.O.G., or "Child of God." Later, Jon and David pack up their jade clocks to sell at the fair. David shows Jon some small jade boxes he made to also sell at the fair. Jon dismisses it as a bad idea, ridiculing him and insulting his intelligence. When they go to the fair, they fail to sell the clocks. Jon is enraged after a customer dismisses the clocks and chooses to buy one of David's boxes instead, and he later insults a woman who does not seem interested in buying a clock.  On the way home, Jon pulls his truck over, angry that they only sold David's boxes. Jon tells David a story about his time in the war when a member of his squad was attacked and dying. Jon says that when he asked the dying man if he had any last requests, the man asked to be held. Rather than seeing this as a scared man asking for comfort during his final moments, Jon appears to think it was a homosexual come on, stating that instead of comforting the man he kicked him repeatedly. He  tells David that there are a lot of sick people in the world to watch out for. Jon then accuses him of being the same way, asking David if he is sick like that man. David replies, "I'm as sick as they come." Jon then disparages him and implies that David cannot be Christian because Christians "certainly aren't faggots." Jon makes David leave the vehicle right there. David asks Jon where he's supposed to go but Jon tells him that he doesn't care and that there's a bus station back the way they came. David walks off as Jon's truck fades away.

 [[Richard Phillips (merchant mariner)|Richard Phillips]] takes command of [[MV Maersk Alabama|MV ''Maersk Alabama'']], an unarmed [[container ship]] from the [[Port of Salalah]] in [[Oman]], with orders to sail through the [[Guardafui Channel]] to [[Mombasa, Kenya]]. Wary of pirate activity off the coast of the [[Horn of Africa]], he and First Officer [[Shane Murphy (captain)|Shane Murphy]] order strict security precautions on the vessel and carry out practice drills. During a drill, the vessel is chased by Somali pirates in two [[skiff]]s, and Phillips calls for help. Knowing that the pirates are listening to radio traffic, he pretends to call a warship, requesting immediate air support. One skiff turns around in response, and the other &ndash; manned by four heavily armed pirates led by [[Abduwali Muse]] &ndash; loses engine power trying to steer through ''Maersk Alabama''s wake.  The next day, Muses skiff, now fitted with two outboard engines, returns with the same four pirates aboard. Despite the best efforts of Phillips and his crew, the pirates secure their ladder to the ''Maersk Alabama''. As they board, Phillips tells the crew to hide in the engine room and allows himself to be captured. He offers Muse the $30,000 in the ship's safe, but Muse's  orders are to ransom the ship and crew in exchange for millions of dollars of insurance money from the shipping company. While they search the ship, Murphy sees that the youngest pirate Bilal does not have sandals and tells the crew to line the engine room hallway with broken glass. Chief Engineer Mike Perry cuts power to the ship, plunging the lower decks into darkness. Bilal cuts his feet when they reach the engine room, and Muse continues to search alone. The crew members ambush Muse, holding him at knifepoint, and arrange to release him and the other pirates into a lifeboat. However, Muse's right-hand man Nour Najee refuses to board the lifeboat with Muse unless Phillips goes with them. Once all are on the lifeboat, Najee attacks Phillips, forcing him into the vessel before launching the boat with all five of them on board.  As the lifeboat heads for Somalia, tensions flare between the pirates as they run low on the plant-based amphetamine [[khat]] and lose contact with their [[mother ship]]. Najee becomes agitated and tries to convince the others to kill Phillips. They are later intercepted by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[destroyer]] . ''Bainbridge''s captain [[Frank Castellano]] is ordered to prevent the pirates from reaching the Somali coast by any means necessary. Even when additional ships arrive, Muse asserts that he has come too far and will not surrender. The negotiators are unable to change his mind and a [[DEVGRU]] [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL team]] parachutes in to intervene, while Phillips makes an unsuccessful attempt to escape from the lifeboat before being quickly recaptured and repeatedly beaten by Najee.  While three SEAL marksmen get into positions, Castellano and the SEALs continue to try to find a peaceful solution, eventually taking the lifeboat under tow. Muse agrees to board ''Bainbridge'', where he is told that his clan elders have arrived to negotiate Phillips's ransom. In the lifeboat, Phillips prepares a goodbye letter to his wife in case he is killed, while Najee decides to take full control. Najee spots Phillips writing the letter and beats him further. Phillips retaliates by wrestling Najee until Bilal subdues Phillips by striking him in the back with his AK-47, injuring him. Najee convinces Bilal and Elmi that Phillips must be killed. The pirates tie up and blindfold Phillips, leaving him to say his final goodbyes. As the pirates prepare to shoot Phillips, ''Bainbridge''s crew stops the tow, causing Bilal and Najee to lose balance. This gives the marksmen three clear shots and they simultaneously kill all three pirates. Muse is arrested and taken into custody for piracy. Phillips is rescued from the lifeboat and treated. Although in shock and disoriented, he thanks the rescue team for saving his life.  Before the credits it is revealed [[Richard Phillips (merchant mariner)|Richard Phillips]] soon returned to sea after his recovery while [[Abduwali Muse]] was sentenced to 33 years in jail for orchestrating the hijacking of the ''Maersk Alabama'', and the kidnap and attempted murder of Richard Phillips.

A fire breaks out and, as the school burns to the ground, Carrie walks away, leaving a trail of fire and destruction in her wake. Chris and Billy attempt to flee in Billy's car.

The next day he asks the head stationmaster to provide him with a Springfield bolt-action rifle and carbolic acid as a day before he encounters another hazard in Africa: the poisonous [[black mamba]]. He miffs the black mamba with his torchlight. The next day he gets these things from another fellow Indian, Tirumal Appa, who is serving the British Army.  They quickly strike a rapport and Tirumal visits him often. One day Tirumal becomes victim of the same man-eating lion. This rages Shankar and he decides to end this peril. He poses as bait by pouring blood on himself and scatters meat chunks. He tempts the lion out of his cave and eventually shots him down.  He rescues and looks after the middle-age Portuguese explorer and [[gold prospector]], Diego Alvarez. The encounter with Alavarez influences him deeply. Alavarez tells him of his exploits and adventures, how he and his companion Jim Carter had braved deep jungles and mountains of [[Richtersveld]] to find the largest [[diamond mine]]. However, they were thwarted by the legendary [[Bunyip]], a mythical monster who guards the mines and killed Carter.  Shankar gives up his job and accompanies Alvarez as he decides to venture out once more and find the mines again. They meet with innumerable hardships. The first is a raging [[volcano]] which forces them to halt their expedition. One night they were attacked by the monster Bunyip. Eventually they get lost in the forests where Alvarez is killed by the monster, in an effort to save Shankar's life. Desolated Shankar mourns the death of Alvarez deeply. He buries him with all rites and sets sail towards the mountain of moon.  Shankar sets out to reach civilization. He finds the diamond mines by accident. He enters the cave and gets lost. With great difficulty, he gets out, marking his way with "pebbles" and taking some back with him as memento, not knowing each is an uncut diamond. He finds the remains of the Italian explorer, Attilio Gatti, and learns that the cave he found earlier was the diamond mine. Gatti, as Shankar learns from a note by him, had uncut diamonds in his boots. The note said that whoever reads the note can take the diamonds as long as he buries his skeleton, with Christian rites. Shankar does so and keeps the old diamonds.  While crossing the jungle, he comes in contact with the Bunyip's cave. Filled with revenge, he devises a plan to get rid of Bunyip. Shankar collects sticks from the jungle and sharpens their tips into spears. He fences the entrance with sharpened wood and waits for the Bunyip. The Bunyip turns up and, seeing its prey, jumps at it from height. Shankar moves out and the Bunyip gets pierced on the wood and dies.  Shankar tries to move out by following the compass. He becomes lost in the deserts of [[Kalahari]] and nearly dies of thirst. Fortunately, he is rescued by a survey team and taken to a hospital in [[Harare|Salisbury]], [[Rhodesia]]. When he recovers he sells four of his diamonds and gets lots of money. One diamond he sends to his parents with a note to sell it and help the villagers with its money. Next, he sells his sole diamond and buys a steamer boat to continue his exploration.  He ends the book saying that he will return to that cave one day with a large team and continue the legacy of Alvarez, Carter and Gatti.

Violet, who seems to have begun to develop feelings for him, is upset and becomes withdrawn, causing the game to end, as its purpose was to entertain her. Vince, desperate to win some more money, offers to perform anything asked of him. Colin suggests the amputation of his pinkie finger for $25,000. Just as Vince is about to accept, Craig returns to the game, stating that he only temporarily solves his problem with the $4,500 he has earned so far, and offers to the do the same dare for a smaller sum. Vince also goes lower, and they go back and forth until Craig settles for $15,000. Vince cuts Craig's pinkie off, resulting in Craig winning again, which only serves to anger Vince further.   The next challenge involves eating a cooked dead dog, which had died while trying to eat Craig's finger, with the winner who finishes his portion first receiving $50,000. The contest results in a draw, with the money being awarded to whoever eats Craig's finger. Craig wins but he then gets beaten up by an enraged Vince. After being taken outside to calm down by Colin, he suggests that Vince kill Craig for the remaining portion of the $250,000. Vince considers the offer but finds himself unable to kill his friend; he suggests he and Craig leave but is suddenly shot to death by Craig. Colin calls Craig a taxi and he leaves with his winnings in hand. After he has left, Colin pays Violet her money, as the two had made a bet on which friend would kill the other; Colin chose Vince with Violet choosing Craig. The film ends with Craig arriving home, comforting his child, suddenly the light turns on and his wife appears, staring at Craig covered in blood and at the money strewn all over the room.

Christmas Cruelty!
  A man brutalizes a family whose home he has broken into, raping the mother in front of her bound and gagged loved ones before murdering all of them, starting with the baby, who he eviscerates with a [[circular saw]]. Elsewhere, three friends named Eline, Magne and Per-Ingvar celebrate the holiday season by making decorations, pulling pranks and getting drunk. The next day, while the trio recover from their [[hangover]]s, the killer, revealed to be a loving family man and a [[Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration|NAV]] employee, begins stalking them after stumbling onto Eline and Per-Ingvar's case files, at one point telling his wife, "I can't stop thinking about a poor girl and a guy in a wheelchair. They are going to have a horrible Christmas. I have to contribute in my own way, so they don't have to worry about the new year at least."  Per-Ingvar holds a small Christmas party at his apartment and unintentionally injures one of his guests, who Magne escorts to the hospital, accidentally leaving the door open on his way out. The killer, disguised as [[Santa Claus]], barges in, fatally bludgeons one of the revelers, and sexually assaults Eline while Per-Ingvar is forced to watch. Before the killer can finish he is interrupted by a pair of late arrivals, one of whom he decapitates before incapacitating the other. Returning to Elise, the killer stabs her in the genitals and performs [[cunnilingus]] on her before he resumes raping her, knifing and smothering her when she begs him to stop. The killer cleans himself up afterward, makes dinner (which he eats while seated on Per-Ingvar) and spends the night at the apartment. In the morning, the killer uses Per-Ingvar's [[debit card]] to purchase a chainsaw, which he uses to dismember both Per-Ingvar and the remaining party guest. Answering a call from his daughter, the killer reassures her that he will be home soon as he writes "Merry Christmas" in blood on one of Per-Ingvar's walls.

Closed Curtain
 An unnamed screenwriter (Kambozia Partovi) arrives at a secluded three-story villa on the [[Caspian Sea]]. He secretly brings along his pet dog named "Boy". Dogs are considered unclean under Islamic rule and the writer intends to hide "Boy" from authorities as he tries to get some writing done. The writer shaves his head to disguise his identity and covers all the windows in the villa with black, opaque material.  One night during a thunderstorm Melika (Maryam Moqadam) and her brother Reza (Hadi Saeedi) break into the villa. They tell the writer that they have fled from an illegal beach party in which alcohol was consumed and are hiding from the police. The writer demands that they leave, but Reza states that his sister is suicidal and then leaves Melika there while he looks for a car.  The presence of Melika begins to unsettle the writer. Melika speaks to the writer cryptically and theatrically, often lying and demanding to know about personal details from the writer's life. The writer becomes increasingly paranoid and begins to suspect Melika of being a police spy. Melika wants to open the curtains against the writers protests. Melika suddenly vanishes and the writer is left alone. When he hears the back patio door smashed open, the writer and "Boy" hide and listen to the sounds of the house being ransacked by thieves.

Closed Circuit (2013 film)
 A bomb planted in a lorry detonates in [[London]]'s [[Borough Market]] killing 120 people. The [[Metropolitan Police Service|London police]] receive an anonymous tip and arrest Farroukh Erdogan, a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] immigrant, as the terror cell leader and mastermind of the attack. Two other members of the cell die in the bombing and the fourth is killed by police in a shoot-out during the raid to apprehend him. When Erdogan's [[Barristers in England and Wales|Defense Barrister]] commits suicide, Martin Rose is appointed by the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] to replace him, joining [[Special Advocate]] Claudia Simmons-Howe. Due to national security concerns, Erdogan's case follows [[Justice and Security Act 2013|closed material procedures]]; Claudia represents Erdogan during closed sessions with a judge ruling what evidence is permissible for Martin to use in the open public trial. [[MI5]] Agent Nazrul Sharma is assigned to provide Claudia with the closed material and monitor her activities.  Martin discovers that despite his extensive criminal record, Erdogan was somehow quickly approved for immigration from his previous residence in [[Germany]] to England and within six months was living well beyond his income. He finds proof that Farroukh Erdogan is really Mussi Kartal, a member of a terror cell responsible for bombing a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] base in [[Munich]] a few years prior. Kartal cut a deal with prosecutors to avoid prison, agreeing to work as an [[informant]] for MI5 by infiltrating the London terror cell and providing MI5 with information to make arrests. Martin suspects that after the Borough Market bombing, MI5 feared their botched operation would be publicly blamed as directly financing terrorism and sought to have Kartal take the fall and suppress any evidence of MI5 involvement. Martin and Claudia discussed the matters discreetly during [[England national football team]] match at the [[Wembley Stadium]].  In the first closed court session, MI5 Agent Melissa Fairbright reveals that Kartal's son Amir had hacked into his father's laptop and had provided valuable information to MI5. The judge orders Amir's testimony in court, deeming it relevant to the case. Amir, who is being monitored by MI5 agents at a [[safe house]] with his mother, manages to escape to his aunt's home. He meets with Martin and Claudia, giving them a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] detailing his father's involvement with the MI5 terror cell operation. Martin and Claudia realize MI5 will kill Amir to protect themselves and go on the run with him overnight, planning to have him testify in court the next day. Amir testifies in closed session, but Kartal is later murdered in prison and made to look like a suicide by hanging. With Kartal dead, the case collapses and all evidence of the MI5 operation is suppressed from public disclosure. Amir and his mother, however, are allowed to remain in England.   Three months later, as Martin and Claudia rekindle their romance that resulted in Martin's divorce from his wife, information of MI5's involvement in the Borough Market bombing is anonymously [[Leak (media)|leaked]] to the media.

 Climax tells the story of Supriya, a starlet. She meets RK who wins her heart and later becomes her mentor. The film takes a twist when RK's son Rahul is infatuated by Supriya.  
Clark: A Gonzomentary
 The story begins with b-roll of Clark with voice over of an interview with Clark talking about himself in the third person and his artistic creativity and integrity. This is refuted immediately with an interview with Clark's art manager, J.C. who states that he's not been able to get work out of Clark for months other than crude sketches of penises. J.C. reports that he supports the artist financially and expresses his frustration and that his plan is to feed Clark drugs so that he can control him and get him to produce. This is followed by the director of "Clark: The Webseries," Daniel, who explains how difficult it was to film the webseries.  The next scene shows J.C. introducing Daniel to Clark, who is sitting naked in a bathtub with empty bottles of beer and alcohol. Clark is resistant and belittling to Daniel's intrusiveness, while Daniel is obviously uncomfortable with the scene, J.C. insists that filming Clark in his current state is "where the real art is happening."  Clark begins to become agitated and has a rambling fit about his father. They move to another room where Clark is asked to explain his art but is shown that he can't, rambling incoherently and is interrupted by J.C. who gives him alcohol and [[oxycontin]]. This relationship between J.C. and Clark is reinforced consistently throughout the movie, while showing a mixture of the webseries' episodes in a linear timeline mixed with behind-the-scenes interviews in a non-linear timeline.  The story introduces the fictitious production company, Exodus Films' executive producer Jazmin, a fundamentalist Christian, who mentions that the material isn't family friendly enough. She quickly is led away from her current lifestyle by J.C. and Clark to follow her true dream of being a mime managed by J.C.. In a silent film style episode, J.C. tells Clark that he's quitting as his manager to focus on "Jazmime's" career and that he is kicking Clark out of the house. J.C. explains on camera that he wasn't sure what Daniel was doing with the silent film style with music from [[Vivaldi]]'s [[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]], claiming Daniel had become "artsy-fartsy," a claim that Daniel responds by saying he had no choice but to make a silent episode because Clark wouldn't read any lines anymore or speak in English for days, we then see footage of Clark speaking [[gibberish]]. Clark is shown struggling with homelessness while J.C. realizes that managing a mime isn't going to be profitable, so he gives her a newspaper classified article implying she should get a job in the porn industry. J.C. goes to search for Clark and finds him 5 feet outside of his door, where Clark shows J.C. his new creation, penis sculptures made out of trash.  Another character, Tito, is introduced as J.C.'s drug dealer, who he calls to get "fuel" to keep Clark awake all night to produce art for an art show that is scheduled for the next day.  Tito arrives with two large bags of cocaine and asks J.C. if he can inject heroin in their apartment.  J.C. complies and Tito overdoses. When discovered that he is dead Clark and J.C. go through his pockets to find his phone in a plan to call his dealer disguising themselves as Tito to get free cocaine.  Clark suggests that they cut off Tito's face and he'll wear it when he confronts the dealer. J.C. then explains in an interview that things turned really dark after that and that he is worried about Daniel.  Clark meets with Tito's dealer, a young kid, while wearing Tito's removed face.  He shoots the dealer and steals his drugs which introduces the third act of the movie, where it is revealed as Daniel's bad [[LSD]] trip that is causing confusion.  Clark, Daniel and J.C. cycle through a time loop in Daniel's mind which alters the original story each time. J.C.'s character gradually becomes similar to Hunter S. Thompson and Clark begins killing puppets in an imaginary world. This is inter-spliced with the reality that Clark and J.C. are trying to help Daniel from his bad trip. It is then revealed that they locked Daniel in a room in the basement that they call the "deprivation tank" for a few days. When they find Daniel he is still under the effects of multiple hallucinogens that J.C. and Clark had been secretly giving him for weeks, and they take him to the hospital. The last scene shows Clark being extremely pleased with himself until the interviewer asks him about his influence by his father. This causes Clark to freak out and destroy the four-foot penis sculpture he had been working on for the majority of the story.  
The Clerics

Clapping for the Wrong Reasons
 The film is devoid of any real plot and instead focuses on a mundane day in the life of Childish Gambino (who, in the short film, is heavily implied to be portraying "The Boy", the protagonist in the ''Because the Internet'' screenplay) as he wanders through his mansion which is filled with his friends he seems to casually acknowledge as being among his residential companions.  Gambino is awoken in bed when Abella Anderson (simply called "girl" in the script) knocks on his window telling him to answer the phone. He does so with the woman from the [[Debt collection#Third-party agencies|Callifax Collection Company]] on the other end asking for someone. Gambino asks her "what month it is". When she answers June, Gambino tells her that the person she is looking for is "probably somewhere in the northern hemisphere". He heads into the kitchen to make himself breakfast while his friends Misla T., Emily Carter and Stefan Ponce, loiter inside. As he leaves, Stefan vomits on the floor. Gambino heads out to speak with Fam Udeoji stating that "his girl" woke him up only for Fam to claim that he doesn't have "a girl" and that she "might be Swank's". They seep into an unfocused discussion about airplanes, ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' episode "Cliff's Nightmare" and the [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] movie ''[[Junior (1994 film)|Junior]]'' (though Fam misidentifies it as ''Baby Mama'').  Gambino continues wandering his cavernous mansion and begins working on mixing his music with [[Ludwig Göransson]]. Abella calls Gambino away because his brother, Stephen (credited as Steve G. Lover), wanted to speak to him. Gambino finds his room messy and him playing video games while conversing with Jo Swank and Misla about how many vaginas they have seen. While Gambino is amused by the conversation he learns that none of them sent for Abella to call him up and he leaves. Misla is then seen performing martial arts set to Ludwig playing the guitar section of "Flight of the Navigator". Gambino next speaks to Emily while she is swimming. She states that one of his tracks was "not scary enough" and the he "wasn't scary". He playfully pretends to drown her and she splashes water at him in retaliation. He then cannonballs into the pool. He emerges and then exclaims that he has his phone in his pocket.  Gambino is later hanging out with [[Trinidad James]] and [[Chance the Rapper]] by sampling music. Later, James and Chance play [[Connect Four]] and James wins. Outside, Gambino and Chance have a push-up contest with the former winning. Gambino is later seen playing "Fruit Snacks" by [[Kyle (musician)|Kyle]] on turntables, with Stefan dancing. Abella waves at Stefan who waves back, confusing Gambino as he does not know her either (he was just being "a gentleman"). Gambino is collecting lemons with [[Danielle Fishel]] who relays to him a dream where she is at her own wedding, wearing cargo pants, smoking and is three or four weeks pregnant. They head inside when the sound of an airplane is heard.  As the day begins to set, a group of dancers are seen in a room in the mansion with audio from [[Flying Lotus]] free styling over. Lotus is sitting in a viewing room with Gambino who also takes part in free styling when the former draws attention to the latter's nose which begins to bleed. He heads into the bathroom and while cleaning out his nose, discovers a long string. He pulls it out and discovers a gold tooth tied to the end of it and proceeds to take a shower. Gambino is next outside by a bonfire with Fam who relays a moment in his life when while in high school, a girl found his number and began making death threats forcing him to live on the street with a gun for a week. Gambino in turn revealed how as a child, a boy his age had to live with him and gave him his first kiss.  Gambino heads inside and encounters Abella again. He asks who she is, but she ignores him. He heads into his bedroom where the phone rings, he picks it up and upon hearing the woman's voice from the morning he abruptly hangs it up and goes to sleep. After the credits, the shot in the morning is identical to the beginning. Abella once again knocks on the window, implying that Gambino's everyday life is somewhat repetitive.   References 
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2
 Inventor Flint Lockwood and his friends have saved the world from the food storm created by the "Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator" (AKA the FLDSMDFR) but this has left their island home town of Swallow Falls covered in food. Super-inventor Chester V, the CEO of Live Corp and Flint's childhood idol, offers his company's services to clean the island and helps to relocate the population to nearby San Franjose, California. Chester also invites Flint to work at Live Corp.  Six months later, Chester shows Flint that the island is flourishing with sentient food created by the FLDSMDFR in the form of "foodimals", and that some are trying to swim from the island, potentially threatening the world. Chester tells Flint he needs to travel to the island, find the FLDSMDFR, and insert a special USB device into it to destroy it to end the threat. Though the mission is meant to be classified, Flint invites all of his friends to help. Along with him and Chester are his girlfriend, meteorologist Sam Sparks; her cameraman Manny; police officer Earl Devereaux; Steve, his pet monkey who communicates via a device on his chest; and "Chicken" Brent; the Mayor’s former assistant. He also grudgingly accepts the help of Tim, his father, who takes them to the island by his fishing boat. When Chester learns that Flint is not alone, he and his assistant Barb, a super-intelligent orangutan, soon follow along with several Live Corp employees.  While Tim stays with the boat, Flint and his friends work their way through the jungle-like environment that now covers Swallow Falls and encounter the numerous forms of foodimals, including a strawberry they call "Barry". Chester arrives shortly, offering to help Flint. Sam becomes suspicious of Chester's motives, as his claim that the foodimals are dangerous does not align with what they have observed already. Flint refuses to accept Sam's statement, and she and the rest of Flint's friends leave on their own, eventually getting captured by the Live Corp employees.  Flint, Barb and Chester track down and locate the FLDSMDFR. As Flint is about to insert the USB device, he recognizes that it is acting as a brain to all the foodimals on the island, and it is not dangerous to them in any way. He refuses to use the USB device, but Chester forces his hand, and with the device, is able to seize control of the FLDSMDFR. Chester announces his plan to use it to create more foodimals, and with those and the ones being captured on the island as they speak, he will make food bars out of them. Chester knocks Flint into a river, where he washes out and reunites with Tim. Without the FLDSMDFR, he and his father find the foodimals on the island are dying, and Flint vows to get it back with the help of Barry.  Tim helps Flint and Barry sneak into the Live Corp base. As Barry frees the foodimals, Flint challenges Chester to turn over the FLDSMDFR, but Chester threatens to use his friends in his food bar processing machine. Flint is able to use his inventions to beat Chester and free his friends, along with Barb's help after Chester shows how little respect he has for her. Chester tries to escape but is eaten by a cheeseburger spider. Flint recovers the FLDSMDFR, restores it to normal, and returns it to where they found it, allowing the foodimals to flourish naturally. He and his friends, including Barry and Barb, return home, and Flint reconciles with Tim, who lets him try out fishing for the first time.  In a mid-credits scene, Barb is trying to ask Steve on a date while he is distracted by a banana sandwich.

Closer to the Moon
 Post-war [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist Romania]]: In 1959 [[Bucharest]], members of Romania's high society Max Rosenthal ([[Mark Strong]]), Alice Bercovich ([[Vera Farmiga]]), Dumi Dorneanu ([[Tim Plester]]), Răzvan Orodel ([[Joe Armstrong (actor)|Joe Armstrong]]) and Iorgu Ristea ([[Christian McKay]]), known collectively as [[Ioanid Gang]], announce to a crowd that they are shooting a film. A young café worker, Virgil ([[Harry Lloyd]]), is among the witnesses. Under the guise of making this film, the Ioanid Gang perform a heist of the [[National Bank of Romania]]. The following day, Virgil loiters around a film set and encounters the director, Flaviu ([[Allan Corduner]]), who requests him to buy vodka and give it to him whenever he asks.  Eight months before the heist took place, Max, Dumi, Iorgu and Răzvan, heroes of the resistance during [[World War II]], celebrate New Year's Eve and the start of 1959. Max is divorcing his wife, Sonia ([[Monica Bîrlădeanu]]). Alice returns from Moscow with her and Max's son, Mirel (Marcin Walewski), in tow. She re-introduces Mirel to his father, and they begin to bond.  One night, the Gang celebrates Dumi's birthday and reminisce about their early lives as revolutionaries. For fun, they plot the heist in order to rile up anti-Communist Romania, but then realize that Max is talking their conversation seriously. He convinces Dumi, Iorgu and Răzvan to join him, but Alice says no as she has to raise Mirel. She changes her mind, however, when she learns that Mirel wants to join as the fifth person. Alice becomes enraged during the robbery when she seeing Mirel filming it. After a couple of months, Iorgu unintentionally implicates himself, and the group is individually located and arrested by Comrade Holban ([[Anton Lesser]]) and his police officers. Their arrests happen on the same day as the ''[[Luna 2]]'' landing on the [[Moon]].  One year later, Virgil is an experienced camera assistant. He is called in by his boss, who informs him of a short film about to start production. Virgil is assigned to record it. It is then revealed that the film is a propaganda piece about the Ioanid Gang's crime. The group, who have been convicted and are awaiting their execution, are ordered by the [[Securitate]] to star in the film. Later, Virgil informs Flaviu that he was present during the robbery and its danger has been greatly exaggerated by the authorities. When the Gang arrive for filming, Alice begins to bond with Virgil. When Flaviu gets drunk and passes out, Max takes over directing. While setting up a shot, he secretly gives Virgil contact details for the Gang's loved ones, requesting he contact them to let them know the group is alive and in prison. Later, Virgil makes an anonymous call to the first person on the list, and continues to do so with the help of his landlord Moritz ([[David de Keyser]]).  One night, Virgil is taken to Holban's house. Holban reveals that he knows Virgil has been doing favours for the Gang, and asks him to keep doing so in order to win their trust. He asks Virgil to find the sixth member of the group, Alice's son, as the Gang will be executed soon. During a commotion on set one day, Alice slips away. Virgil follows her to a house, where she says goodbye to her son. Afterwards, they have dinner at Virgil's house and sleep together. The next morning, Alice surrenders to the guards keeping surveillance outside, and leaves Virgil with sealed instructions. Virgil is approached by Holban and asked to write the address of Mirel, but he feigns unawareness.  Max's ex-brother-in-law ([[Darrell D'Silva]]) arrives and relieves Holban of duty due to negligence and exhaustion. Max asks him to send the Gang into space instead of executing them, but he angrily retorts that astronauts should be heroes and not traitors. Alice's letter asks Virgil to organize Mirel's [[Bar Mitzvah]], which he does. Iorgu, Dumi, Răzvan and Max are sent before the firing squad. In voiceover, Alice says that, at the last moment, her sentence was changed to life imprisonment because she had fallen [[pregnant]].

Cold Eyes
 A woman named Ha Yoon-joo joins a police division where the members are largely unarmed and don't wear uniforms. Led by a man named Hwang, the division avoids arresting criminals and focuses exclusively on following them around to gather information. One day a bank is robbed and only one of the seven criminals is caught on camera. In response, Hwang, Ha, and six other officers spend several weeks wandering around the city streets, tagging after people who match the criminal's physical description. When they finally find him, they put cameras outside his apartment.  Meanwhile, James, the leader of the criminals, wishes to quit his line of work, but his elderly mentor responds by sending a man to kill him, whom he successfully defends against. When James's subordinates confer to discuss the next mission, they are successfully tracked by Hwang's officers, who call in a [[SWAT team]] to subdue them. James, who was standing in a separate location, finds it necessary to murder one of Hwang's officers to escape. Later, after James is given criticism from the mentor, he attacks the mentor's hide-out, murdering the mentor and his body-guards. He then acquires a fake Thai pass-port and gets ready to leave South Korea.  Hwang and Ha both feel sad at the death of their colleague. As a result, Hwang announces his resignation while Ha takes a leave of absence. However, while Ha is doing her laundry, she suddenly remembers using her [[photographic memory]] that she has run into James in the past. Namely, on the day of her police interview, James had fleetingly walked past her inside a subway car, carrying a grocery store brochure. Ha runs to the grocery store and waits there, managing to catch sight of James again, and urgently notifies Hwang and his officers while staying on James's tail. When James walks into a tunnel, Hwang takes over the pursuit, but James recognizes Hwang and stabs him. Luckily, though, the wound isn't fatal. Ha continues the pursuit into the subway tunnels but is also recognized by James and held hostage. When the SWAT team comes, James lets go of Ha and runs deeper into the tunnels.  As the chase goes on, James finds himself trapped between an advancing SWAT team and the mouth of the tunnel, which is being guarded by Hwang, who ran the long way around. As James decides to charge at Hwang, the latter, finding himself at the juncture of an oncoming train, stands his ground to shoot at James, risking a 50/50 chance that the train will flatten him. Fortunately, the train takes the other branch and James is hit by Hwang's revolver and killed. Encouraged by the success, Hwang withdraws his resignation, and together with Ha, goes on to execute further such missions including the pursuit of international terrorists.

Two soldiers, Briggs ([[Laurence Fishburne]]) and Mason ([[Bill Paxton]]) are the leaders of one such bunker, Colony 7. Briggs, Sam ([[Kevin Zegers]]) and Graydon ([[Atticus Dean Mitchell]]) travel to nearby Colony 5 after receiving a distress signal. Briggs leaves Sam's lover Kai ([[Charlotte Sullivan]]) in charge of the colony while he's gone, much to Mason's chagrin.   Upon arrival, they find Colony 5 covered in blood. They eventually reach a locked door which Sam picks open. Inside they find Leland, who shows them a message they received from another group of people who fixed a weather machine and have caused the snow to thaw. The group offers aid to anyone and asks that they bring seeds so they can be planted in the newly thawed permafrost soil. Leland shows them where the signal came from, but informs them that an expedition failed to find the source of the transmission. Moreover, the expedition's tracks led a marauding group of [[Cannibalism|cannibals]] back to Colony 5, and the killing ensued. Briggs, Sam, and Graydon try to force Leland to return with them, but he locks himself back into his room.  The three then begin to explore Colony 5 and approach a room where a fire burns.  Here they see a human chopping up members of Colony 5, while others feast on human remains. As the three try to escape, Graydon is killed by the cannibals. Briggs and Sam are able to make it up the ladder out of the colony and destroy the shaft with a stick of dynamite. Taking shelter in an abandoned helicopter, they wake up in the morning to find that the cannibals have managed to escape from the entombed Colony 5 and have tracked their footprints in the snow. Briggs suggests that they lure the group over a decrepit bridge then use dynamite. When the dynamite fuse goes out, Briggs rushes back to light it, but is attacked by the cannibals. He relights the fuse and sacrifices himself to blow a large gap in the bridge.  Kai gets into a heated argument with Mason after learning that he intends to kill a colonist without testing her. Their argument is interrupted when Kai spots a returning, exhausted Sam and runs to him, but Mason promptly knocks her out. When Sam awakens, he finds Mason has taken over and has plans to make harsh changes. Sam explains that the cannibals are coming and that there is a thawed-out area they should flee to. Mason does not believe him, thinking he has become unhinged by his ordeal, and handcuffs him to a bed. Sam is able to get free and checks images from a functioning [[satellite]] to locate the thawed-out zone. Then the cannibals arrive. Many of the Colony 7 inhabitants are killed, including Sam's friend Viktor ([[John Tench]]). The survivors lock themselves in a room. Sam and Kai bang on the door, but Mason will not let them in. Briggs' daughter Nara ([[Lisa Berry]]) knocks Mason down and lets them in. Sam opens a vent for an escape route. The wounded Mason stays behind and, when the cannibals break in, shoots a gas container, causing an explosion that kills all but the leader. The cannibals' leader attacks Sam, but Sam is able to kill him. Then he, Kai, Nara and a few others begin their journey to the thawed-out site with the precious seeds.

Collider (film)
 The [[Large Hadron Collider]] research at [[CERN]] was on the verge of a breakthrough in regards to [[black holes]]. Scientists believed that they would be able to control the micro black holes once created but Peter Ansay, a young genius in quantum physics thought differently. His report brought up astounding conclusions that the current research on the radiation phenomenon was inaccurate and that if they were actually able to create these black holes, the level of radiation would be so significantly lower than anticipated that they would literally implode in on themselves, taking all surrounding matter with them.  Depending on the exact level of radiation it could be catastrophic. Peter's report was rejected by CERN and his credibility as a scientist was destroyed. On 23 September 2012, Peter breaks into the CERN laboratories to gain access to the Collider and sabotage it preventing any future experiments. But something goes wrong in a way that Peter couldn't have predicted, and he is transported to 2018 by a [[wormhole]] to a world destroyed by [[natural disasters]] and at war with the Unknown. He wakes up in a strangely familiar place, convinced he's somehow been there before. He is now in the future, 2018, and "trapped" inside what seems to be a hotel.  Outside, the atmosphere is unlivable and anyone who ventures out disappears in the shadows, taken by the Unknown. What Peter soon realises is that he is not alone. Five total strangers from different times and places are also in the hotel with him, but unlike him they know nothing about the future or how they got there. Peter keeps getting flashes of memory and a sense of [[déjà vu]] linked to the future. If he's right then he has just 36 hours to figure out a way to get to CERN, reverse the wormhole and prevent the apocalypse because when the clock runs out so does Earth's existence.<ref></ref>

Coherence (film)
 The film involves eight people at a dinner party.  During their dinner, there is a comet that is passing over them. This causes their house and the occupants to intertwine with multiple such houses and occupants from other realities. There is a dark zone in between the realities. When people pass through the dark zone, they leave their reality and enter another reality at random. The one person which the movie constantly follows is Emily (referred as Emily Prime hereafter).    A [[power outage]] occurs initially, and this marks the start of the intertwined realities. At a distance, outside, they see a house with lights on. At first, two of the guys exit the house to go make a phone call from the “other house” and cross over into another reality. Their doubles come in from another reality. No one realizes this switch. As the story unfolds, they begin to realize that the other house is actually another version of theirs. But the group initially assumes that there are only two houses from two realities. Later, they realize that there are multiple realities and that, once the comet passes, each reality will be stuck permanently with whoever stays in it.   As time passes, different groups of people leave the house and cross over the dark zone. This results in everyone getting jumbled across different realities. Due to past events between people in the group, there are various fights that break out. Emily Prime is frustrated and leaves on her own. She wanders from one reality to another. Each of the realities have gotten into fights of their own. In each reality, people have gotten mixed up from different realities, and there is chaos. Finally, she stumbles upon one reality where no one is fighting. In this reality, they have never had a powercut—the event that kick-starts the happenings of the Prime Reality. The group is intact and hence is having a normal evening.   Emily Prime wants to replace the Emily from this reality. Emily Prime sneaks up on her double and drugs her. First, she throws her in the trunk, but the double wakes up and drowsily crawls back into the house, forcing Emily Prime to attack her double again in the bathroom and put the unconscious body in the bathtub. Emily Prime then heads to the living room and faints. She wakes up the next morning on the sofa and does not see her double anywhere around.  Emily Prime leaves the house and meets Kevin outside. His phone rings, and he looks at his cell phone and states the call is from Emily.  Upon answering the call, he gives a suspicious look towards Emily Prime, and she stares back with guilt. The film ends with Emily Prime now permanently stuck in this reality, with the Emily she tried to kill and a Kevin who presumably now knows (or will soon learn) about her actions.

Commando: A One Man Army
 Karanveer Singh Dogra ([[Vidyut Jammwal]]) a.k.a. Karan is a commando with the Indian Army's 9 Para. During routine helicopter training their helicopter crashes on the Chinese side of the border. The lone survivor of the wreckage, Karan is captured by Chinese officials. As the crash happened on a river and wreckage of the chopper got washed away, Karan, as well as his seniors, are not able to convince the Chinese of his innocence. The Chinese feel they can use these circumstances to brand him as an Indian spy and use this political leverage to embarrass the Indian government and create an international fracas. The Indian government feels that under such politically unfavorable circumstances, the Chinese will not accept any proof of Karan having crashed during a routine training exercise so they order the Army to erase Karan's army record, identities and simply deny his existence. Due to this Karan has to suffer inhuman torture from the Chinese Army for one year in a bid to force a confession out of him.  However, as Karan still refuses to relent, he is transferred to be tried at the Chinese Military Court with the most probable and possible sentence being the death penalty. During his transfer, however, he escapes from his captors and crosses into Himachal Pradesh at the Lepcha border and travels through Kinnaur to reach his base at Pathankot. As Karan crosses the Himachal – Punjab border, he accidentally bumps into a girl, Simrit (Pooja Chopra) who is escaping from Amrit Kanwal Singh (Jaideep Ahlawat) and his goons, as well as Singh's brother, an MP. Amrit Kanwal Singh or as he is better-known AK-74, is a notorious cold-blooded criminal and murderer with such strong political ties that he gets away with anything and everything illegal he does even after he murdered a Forest Official, and wants to marry Simrit for political gains as it will lend him some respectability and political leverage in the upcoming electoral campaign. Karan warns the goons to let go of her but they don't listen and bear the brunt of his pent-up anger and after losing some men they retreat. Simrit plays him to escort her out of the town by telling Karan that he has created more trouble for her and now he must escort her till she feels safe. AK waylays them on the Andheria Bridge. Finding himself outnumbered and outgunned, Karan jumps off the bridge into the fast flowing river with Simrit after kicking AK on his face. After flowing along the river for some distance, they climb to the banks and end up inside the forest. AK's power, position, and respect from ordinary people of Dilerkot is largely attributed to fear-tactics efficiently used by him. After being publicly humiliated by Karan, AK senses that this act of Karan would affect his fear among people negatively, he declares that within one day he would track him down alive and hang him in the middle of the marketplace in Dilkerkot. In the meantime, AK kills a visibly frightened onlooker who laughs at AK's failure to capture Karan on the bridge. In the forest, Karan hears Simrit's story and promises to help her. He decides to stick to the jungle route and then get out on the highway once he feels that the heat from Amrit Kanwal Singh and his henchmen has died down. AK, on the other hand, decides to pursue them inside the jungle.  Now begins a cat and mouse game between AK, his men, and Karan in the forest. Karan at first successfully overpowers AK's henchmen by taking into effect his physical strength, Guerilla warfare tactics, cunning warfare skills, training as a commando and extreme knowledge of the area's flora and fauna and had an upper hand over AK's untrained and novice men. The next morning AK hires special trackers and sets out along hunting dogs. AK spots a torn piece of Simrit's shirt. The hunting dogs thus get a scent of the duo and tracks them down. Karan misleads the dogs and crosses a river and the dogs lose them. Karan and Simrit, however, get outnumbered and Karan is shot in his stomach. AK throws Karan into a shallow river with rock beds jutting out here and there. One hour later Karan survives and after recuperating fully heads back to the town. Meanwhile, AK kills Simrit's parents and stages it as an accident and threatens Simrit to marry him. Karan fights all of AK's goons and a hired assassin sent by the Chinese. He beats up AK badly, breaks his ankle and hangs AK on the town square and surrenders to his Commander Col. Akhilesh Sinha (Darshan Jariwala) who had timely arrived to save him from the local police who are mere puppets of AK.  The movie ends with Karan finally telling Simrit his full name, and promises to return after the court-martial.

The Congress (2013 film)
 [[Robin Wright]] is an aging actress with a reputation for being fickle and unreliable, so much so that nobody is willing to offer her roles. Her son, Aaron, suffers from [[Usher syndrome]] that is slowly destroying his sight and hearing. With the help of Dr. Barker ([[Paul Giamatti]]), Robin is barely able to stave off the worst effects of her son's decline. Robin agrees to sell the film rights to her digital image to Miramount Studios in exchange for a hefty sum of money and the promise to never act again. After her body is digitally scanned, the studio will be able to make films starring her, using only [[computer graphics|computer-generated characters]].  Twenty years later, as her contract is about to expire, Robin travels to Abrahama City where she will speak at Miramount's "Futurological Congress" and also renew her contract. By then, Robin's digital likeness has become the star of a popular science-fiction film franchise, "Rebel Robot Robin". Abrahama City is an animated zone, where individuals are required to use chemicals to become animated [[avatar (computing)|avatars]] of themselves, entering a mutable illusory state; they can become anything they want to be. While discussing the new contract with Miramount, Robin learns that the studio has developed a new technology that will allow anyone to transform themselves into her.  Robin agrees to the deal but has a crisis of conscience and does not believe she or anyone else should be turned into a product. Asked to speak at the Congress, Robin publicly voices her views, enraging the hosts of the Congress. Shortly afterwards, the Congress is attacked by rebels ideologically opposed to the technology. During the attack, Robin is protected by Dylan Truliner ([[Jon Hamm]]) but is soon captured by "Miramount Police". Still in the animated world, Robin is executed. Within the animated world, doctors decide that Robin has become so intoxicated by the hallucinogen that she must be frozen until a time when a treatment for her [[mental illness]] is found.  Many years later, Robin is revived in the animated world and reunites with Dylan. He reveals that technology has improved so that anything is possible, that people can take on whatever form they wish and the ego no longer exists. Dylan tells Robin that he had once been Miramount's lead animator for her films. The two fall in love, but Robin is still desperate to return to the real world and be with her son. The only way to do that is using a capsule that Dylan was given by Miramount, his reward for twenty years of service. The capsule is only powerful enough for one person and Dylan has no more. Dylan gives it to Robin, begging her not to look at the real him when she returns to the real world.   Re-entering the un-animated real world, Robin finds it in extreme disrepair and the inhabitants severely dysfunctional. Those who are still able to cope in the real world hover over its ruined cities in large [[airship]]s. On one of the ships, Robin finds Doctor Barker, who reveals the state of the world in which most people have changed to an existence in an animated, unreal world. Hoping to find Aaron, Robin's hopes are dashed when Barker reveals that Aaron "crossed over" into the animated world only six months earlier, when his condition had left him virtually blind and deaf. Because Aaron likely created a new identity for himself in the animated world, there is no way for anyone to find him. While Robin can return to an animated existence, she cannot return to the one she left behind, including Dylan, because that world was not real but created by her consciousness.  Dr. Barker gives Robin an inhalation ampule that will allow her to return to the animated world. Taking it, Robin experiences memories of her son's life, being born, seeing his mother for the first time, as an infant watching his mother act, as an older child being taken to Dr. Barker, as a young adult watching his mother leave for The Congress, finding his mother in [[suspended animation]], and finally taking the capsule that will take him away from the real world forever. Robin, having the same appearance as Aaron, discovers him in the middle of an animated desert.  
The Conjuring
 In 1971, Roger and Carolyn Perron move into a dilapidated farmhouse in [[Harrisville, Rhode Island]], with their five daughters Andrea, Nancy, Christine, Cindy, and April. Their dog Sadie refuses to enter the house and one of the children, while playing a game of "hide and clap", finds a boarded-up entrance to a cellar.  Paranormal events occur within the first few nights: all of the clocks stop at exactly 3:07 AM and Sadie is found dead in the backyard. One night in bed, Christine encounters a malevolent spirit only she can see, prompting her to claim that the spirit wants her family dead. Another night, Carolyn hears clapping in the hallway. When she goes to investigate, following the noises, she gets trapped in the basement by the spirit. At the same moment, Andrea and Cindy are attacked by the spirit on top of the wardrobe.  Carolyn decides to contact [[demonologist]]s [[Ed and Lorraine Warren]], who have recently investigated a possessed doll called [[Annabelle (doll)|Annabelle]]. The Warrens agree to take on the case, conduct an initial investigation and conclude that the house may require an exorcism, but they need authorization from the Catholic Church and further evidence before they can proceed. Ed and Lorraine discover that the house once belonged to an accused witch, Bathsheba (a relative of [[Mary Eastey|Mary Towne Eastey]]), who sacrificed her week-old child to the devil and killed herself in 1863 after cursing all who would take her land. They find reports of numerous murders and suicides in houses that had since been built on the property.  To gather evidence, Ed and Lorraine place cameras and bells around the house. They see Cindy sleepwalking into Andrea's room, and from the [[Electronic voice phenomenon|EVPs]] coming from the radio, they hear a spirit luring Cindy into the wardrobe, where she reveals a secret passage inside. Lorraine enters the passage and falls through the floorboards to the cellar, where she sees the spirit of a woman whom Bathsheba had long ago possessed and used to kill her child. The Perron family decides to take refuge at a motel while Ed and Lorraine take their evidence to the Church.

Determined to find his parents' murderer, Tam takes a photo with him as a clue and travels to [[Malaysia]] and looks for Brother Chai ([[Chen Kuan-tai]]). Chai reveals to Tam that his parents were drug traffickers and their death is also drug-related, telling him that he can obtain more clues from Uncle Bo (Leung Nga-ko) and Fai ([[Ah Niu]]). Tam was unable to accept the fact that his parents were drug traffickers. Later, Tam's house was burglarized, where an object sitting in a dark shelf went missing. Tam suspects the object to be an important piece of evidence that is related to the death of his parents. Being a complete stranger in a foreign country, Tam hires a local private detective, Cheng Fung-hei ([[Nick Cheung]]), to assist him in the investigation.  Subsequently, both Tam and Fung-hei encountered attacks, while Chai disappeared and Bo was killed.

Confusion Na Wa
 The film starts with a monologue by an unnamed narrator explaining the synopsis of the film with images from the end of the film. Emeka Nwosu ([[Ramsey Nouah]]) is stuck in a traffic jam caused by the death of a pedestrian, when his concubine, Isabella (Tunde Aladese), sends him a text reminding him to get home early so they can have fun together. City hustlers Charles ([[OC Ukeje]]) and Chichi (Gold Ikponmwosa) arrive at the scene, and as a fight breaks out on the crowded road Emeka is knocked down and his phone falls out of his pocket, and after Emeka walks away unknowingly, Charles steals it. Bello ([[Ali Nuhu]]) is a diligent and honest civil servant, whose only "crime" at the office has been his refusal to partake in any of the corrupt practice by his co-workers. His raucous boss uses every opportunity to disrespect him. During a workday, Bello is given more jobs to do by his colleagues after work hours. He reluctantly accepts and is subsequently abused by his boss for not finishing the job on time despite his explanations.  Charles and Chichi review the pictures on the stolen phone and try to reach an agreement on what to do with the phone. The two friends force their entry to the car of a publisher by breaking the wheel-screen, and steal the stereo. They buy some drinks with the money they got and begin discussing on their interpretation of ''The Lion King'' as seen by Africans. Emeka notices that his phone has been stolen and tries calling his number, but is told by Charlie that due to "The Circle of Life" in ''The Lion King'' ownership has been passed on to them from him. He furiously disengages from the conversation on the resistance of the friends to start a meaningful conversation. He is calmed by his concubine Isabella afterwards.  Babajide (Tony Goodman) is the head publisher of ''Righteous Trumpet Newspaper''. During a family dinner he explains the car robbery he faced and is surprised that both his wife and kids did not condemn the act by the thieves with complete disdain -- instead, a sociological debate starts between him and his son, Kola (Nathaniel Deme) who is shifting the blame from the thieves to the government. His mum introduces another topic to end the heated debate since neither side will let go.  Charles persuades Chichi to accompany him to a drug dealer, Muri (Toyin Oshinaike). Charles had previously had sex with Muri's sister but Chichi is negligent and wants to visit another dealer at "Abbatoir". He later retires then follows Charles. They buy drugs worth N200, and as Muri's sister walks outside and Muri notices Chichi facial expressions towards her, Muri tells them that his sister is about to get married . Charles and Chichi have a reflective discussion while having a cigar when Chichi informs Charles that he will be relocating to [[Bauchi State]] to start a new life with his uncle. Charles gives him the stolen phone as a farewell gift.  The two friends interrupt the sexual intercourse between a disturbed Emeka and Isabella with a call, and they start to negotiate a ransom for the recovery of the phone, while Emeka's wife waits for him at home. Kola's sister, Doyin (Yachat Sankey) sneaks out of the house to attend a party and persuades Kola to promise not to tell their parents. At the party, Charles drugs Doyin's friend, Fola (Lisa Pam-Tok) then the power goes out and he rapes her. Chichi refuses to use drugs on Doyin and opts to get her number instead. Police raid the party and arrest many including Charles. At home, Babajide tries motivating Kola with some fatherly advise and explains to him that he needs to start taking responsibility to become a man. He instructs Kola to join him at his office the next day.  At home we see that Bello's wife is Isabella, and he questions his wife on her whereabouts the previous day. She feels irritated in the course of their argument, especially at his mention of lack of money as the reason for them not wanting to have a child. On his way to work the next day, Babajide and Kola engage in a father-son conversation, and Babajide narrates his life-story on how he was able to overcome challenges during the civil war and establish his company. He gets distracted then splashes muddy water on Bello, who is walking along the road. Bello reacts angrily by throwing a stone at the car and regrettably breaking the back-screen. Babjide refuses to accept any compensation or apology from him and decides to take him to the Police Station explaining to him that as a good example to his son, whenever crimes are committed, it should always be a matter for the police. As he zooms off with Bello in his car, the sticker on his car reads "I am an Ideal Citizen, what about you?". Bello refuses to bribe his way out of jail at the request of the corrupt policemen and is placed in the same cell as Charles. Babajide introduces Kola to his staff at the office and tells him to write an article on the decline of the moral level in the society, using his ordeal (with the thieves and Bello) as a guide, even though he had previously told him to write on the power supply.  After some hours, the police release Bello, having encountered difficulty in extorting money from either him or Babajide; however they refuse to help him find his wallet, which is later revealed to have been stolen by Charles in the cell. Afterwards he is set free after his Parole Officer warns him that he will not be given a second chance if he breaks the law again. He sets out to his father's house, where the nagging of his mum about his way of life drove him out. Charles and Chichi meets on a hill, where they discuss the previous night and their encounter with the ladies. They call Emeka and threaten to blackmail him by telling his wife of his extra-marital affairs, if he does not yield to their demands. Doyin informs Kola that her friend is missing and he should come to her rescue. Kola leaves his dad's office to assist her in finding Fola. After searching for some time, they find Fola by the road then take her home to an apprehensive dad, Adekunle (Toyin Alabi) who swore to kill whoever was responsible for the rape. Isabella informs Emeka that she is pregnant, and he refuses the pregnancy and advises her to return to her husband. Babajide consults many of his colleagues to examine if his suspicion that Kola is gay is true. Bello angrily abandons his work after getting fed-up with the kind of treatment he has been subjected to by his boss and colleagues. Adekunle gets the address of Emeka through his phone number (from Chichi). He consults Bello's office and pays his way to get the personal details of the owner of the phone.    Emeka narrates his phone theft story to his wife, Irene (Yewande Iruemiobe) and she discourages him from paying the ransom. On his way out to meet Charles and Chichi, he is stopped by Adekunle, who slaps him severely thinking he is Chichi. After some explanations from Irene, Adekunle lets Emeka go but takes the ransom from him. Babajide questions Kola, and stylishly tries to get him to speak about his view of sexuality. Kola's responses suggest that he is unsure about what he feels about his sexual attractions, and so his dad immediately takes him to Muri in order to be cleansed of homosexuality. Bello's wife Isabella tries to impose her pregnancy on him, but he refuses citing "lack of sex" as a reason. He later sees messages that implicate Isabella on her phone.  Charles and Chichi are discussing with Muri on how they will extort money from Emeka at their meeting in Shayi's. Muri also tells them that he was paid N115,000 by Adekunle for a firearm. Kola and his dad arrive at Muri's bar explaining their ordeal to him. He responds, requesting that his "nurses" cleanse Kola of homosexuality. Bello arrives at Shayi's and suspiciously approaches a man, who he mistakenly thought was Emeka. Adekunle also arrives the scene then shoots Chichi (thinking he was Charles) who was seated with Charles close to the entrance of the restaurant.

The Cosmonaut
 In 1967, two young friends, Stas and Andrei, arrive to the newly built [[Star City, Russia|Star City]] (near [[Moscow]]) where the first [[cosmonauts]] trained to go into space, and where a [[Space Race|race]] against the clock to beat the Americans into space takes place.  Stas and Andrei will witness first-hand the political plots, the fights for power and the successes and failures of the [[Soviet Union]] in some of the greatest achievements of the 20th century. They will meet Yulia, a communications technician, with whom they will strike up a strong friendship, always close to love but never consummated.  ===Influences=== The main influences behind ''The Cosmonaut'''s conception and filmmaking approach are the works of some of the world's most renowned [[filmmakers]]. The project’s dossier<ref></ref> mentions specifically the names of [[Wong Kar-wai]] (and his main cinematographer, [[Christopher Doyle]]), [[Andrei Tarkovsky]], [[José Luis Guerín]], and [[Robert Bresson]], among others. There are many links especially to Andrei Tarkovsky’s body of work either thematically (the main themes of the films of memory, lost love, and reality), or plot-related (the film’s two main characters, Andrei and Stas Arsenievich, share Andrei Tarkovsky’s name and patronymic, respectively). These ties are more evident through a look in the collaborators’ list: among others, the names of [[Eduard Artemyev]], and Marina Tarkovskaya (Tarkovky’s sister).  The fictional Program K, whose [[hummingbird]] icon is one of the main images used in the project’s promotion, and which also gives its name to the virtual community of producers of the film, is based on the real Soviet projects that attempted to place a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon.

The Counselor
 A high-level cartel lawyer with [[dirty hands]] who is known only as "The Counselor" and his girlfriend Laura are talking sexily in bed. Meanwhile, somewhere in Mexico, cocaine is packaged in barrels and concealed in a sewage truck, driven across the border and stored at a sewage treatment plant. After the Counselor goes to Amsterdam to meet with a diamond dealer to purchase an engagement ring for Laura, he proposes and she accepts. At a party back in Texas thrown by Reiner and girlfriend Malkina, a former call-girl with a greedy lust for money, the Counselor discusses a nightclub he and Reiner intend to run, as well as an upcoming drug deal, which would be his first.  The Counselor meets with Westray, a business associate of Reiner's. He hears of the deal's 4000-percent return rate, but Westray warns the Counselor about becoming involved, saying that Mexican cartels are merciless. The Counselor remains outwardly confident and unconcerned. Malkina gains knowledge of the deal through her access to Reiner and by conveniently overhearing various intercoms in Reiner's home. Reiner describes an execution device called "the ''bolito''" which gradually strangles and decapitates the victim. Reiner also tells the Counselor how disturbed and oddly aroused he was from an incident where he witnessed Malkina masturbate with his [[Ferrari California]]'s<ref>2009 Ferrari California in The Counselor, Movie, 2013 http://www.imcdb.org/vehicle_644600-Ferrari-California-2009.html</ref> windshield.  The Counselor visits a client, a prison inmate named Ruth who is on trial for murder. Ruth's son is a biker and a valued drug cartel member known as "the Green Hornet", recently arrested for speeding. The Counselor agrees to bail him out of jail. Malkina senses an opportunity to undermine the Counselor's upcoming deal and to profit for herself. She employs "the Wireman" to steal the drugs. He decapitates the biker, Ruth's recently released son, with a wire stretched across the highway. Then the Wireman steals the truck containing the cocaine. Learning of the theft, Westray meets with the Counselor to notify him that the biker is dead and the cocaine stolen, bleakly intoning the Counselor's culpability. Westray says he is leaving town immediately and suggests the Counselor do the same. Westray explains that the cartel's ruthlessness extends to creating "[[snuff film]]s" where murder victims are filmed having necrophilia performed on them on camera. The Counselor makes an urgent call to Laura, arranging to meet her in another state, where he will explain.  The cartel has learned that the Counselor bailed out the Green Hornet, which appears as suspicious timing and fully blameworthy for the punitive purposes of the cartel. In Texas, two cartel members pretending to be police officers pull over the Wireman and his accomplice, killing both and also gunning down an innocent driver who comes upon the scene. Reiner is accidentally killed by cartel members while they are attempting to capture him. The cartel then kidnaps Laura. In a last-ditch effort, The Counselor contacts Jefe, a high-ranking cartel member, for suggestions on what to do next. Jefe darkly and mordantly advises the Counselor to resign himself irrevocably to the choices he made long beforehand, speaking philosophically, citing the life and poetry of [[Antonio Machado]] to underline his advice. The Counselor goes to Mexico, hoping to find and rescue Laura there. A package is slipped under the door of his hotel room and in it he finds a DVD with "''Hola!''" written on it, breaking down in heavy sobs at the awareness that the disc likely contains a snuff film of Laura sent by the cartel. In an unnamed location, Laura's body is dumped into a landfill.  Malkina's failed effort to steal the drugs does not deter her. She tracks Westray to London, where she hires a blonde woman to seduce him and steal his bank codes. She then has accomplices steal Westray's laptop, and he is killed with the "''bolito''" device that Reiner had previously described. Malkina then meets her banker at a restaurant, coolly explaining how she wants her profits and accounts to be handled.

The next day, the driver of the jeep reaches a nearby garage in a two-wheeler and picks up the mechanic to the jeep. On querying, the mechanic was told that toys were present in the jeep. The mechanic finds fault with the diesel pipe of the jeep. The driver goes in the two wheeler to get a new diesel pipe. During the course of time, the mechanic smells something fishy, when he notices the parts of broken indicator light of the two wheeler lying on the ground. He also finds that the registration number of the jeep was actually a fake one stickered on the numbered plate. When he enquires to the assistant, the assistant gets arrogant asking him to mind his own business. When the assistant moves into a short sleep, the mechanic checks the load within the jeep and finds swords and similar weapons concealed within vegetable boxes. On seeing this the assistant gets angry and he beats the mechanic. While the driver returns with a newly bought diesel pipe, the mechanic refuses to repair the jeep, and asks for the person who came in the two wheeler. The driver shows him with mouth and hands tied, hidden in a nearby area. The two wheeler guy pleads to free him as it is a borrowed bike, and his marriage is approaching and that he has to invite a few relatives that day. The driver tells that once the jeep gets repaired, they all can go. However the mechanic stays still. The assistant gets angry with mechanic as he stays stubborn without repairing the jeep, and hits him again. While they hear the sound of another two wheeler approaching, they hide the mechanic and two wheeler guy and somehow manages to handle the situation without any problem and sends them off. The driver asks the two wheeler guy to do something so that the mechanic repairs the jeep and that they all can leave. However the mechanic stays still, to which the driver gets annoyed and hits the mechanic. Ultimately the driver and assistant flee the scene in the two wheeler. The assistant guy of the mechanic arrives there with the lunch in a bicycle and he sets the two wheeler guy free. The mechanic then flattens the jeep tyres and they leave the scene, taking the two wheeler guy pledging to leave him at the nearest junction where he can get some form of vehicle.  A forest guy sees the jeep and he comes to check what is within it. He takes a sword and also takes tomatoes with him and leaves.

The Croods
  A [[Archaic humans|cave family]] called the Croods survives, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn, stern patriarch, father, Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home.  Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a [[torch]] of fire and she encounters an inventive [[anatomically modern human|modern human]] boy named Guy and his [[pet]] [[sloth]] Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are "different" and "new" they destroy her horn.  A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a "Macawnivore" a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs "Chunky," the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devoured a ground [[whale]]. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe.  Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired but Grug doesn't listen. Along the trip, there is chaos and complaints.  When Grug finds a bird, he decides to hunt its egg for dinner. Eep wants to hunt the egg, but even though she’s grounded, she gets replaced by Thunk, whose too lazy to hunt it. Grug and Thunk failed to capture the bird’s egg, so they get a scorpion instead. During a fight between Thunk and Gran, Eep notices Guy moving away and stops him. Guy wants Eep to stop so he made her hunt with him. Eep goes with Guy to hunt, while the others fight among themselves.  Eep and Guy made a trap in order to capture the bird, but failed when the two got tangled up and the bird didn’t step in the trap. The bird captured the puppet with Guy in it and threw him up in the sky until he lands on the log. Grug asked Guy where Eep is and he found her being chased by the bird. Grug got angry but didn’t notice that he was about to step on the trap, so Eep pushed him out to save her father. The bird stepped on the trap and was  flown up in the sky until it crash landed on the ground.  The Croods cooked the bird and Guy was tied up with a root chain on his right leg. After dinner, Grug tells them a story about a tiger who is similar to Eep, which is based on a true story and embarasses Eep. Guy also suggested that his stories never ended up like Grug’s stories so the Croods decides to listen to Guy’s story much to their interest. Guy told them about a tiger who flew into place with more suns in the sky called “Tomorrow”. Guy also tells them stories of "Tomorrow", a heaven of safety where he is headed and in which curiosity is not deadly as Grug has claimed.  Outrunning the destruction, Guy is trusted enough to be let out of the log and he gives the Croods rudimentary shoes to walk over the harsh landscape as he leads them to a mountain in which he says will be safe. After the family is split up in a labyrinth of tunnels, all but Grug, manage to escape by coming up with ideas of overcoming obstacles in their paths. At his treetop home, Grug sees the impression Guy is leaving on his family and he becomes jealous, especially when he realizes that Eep has fallen in love with Guy. Attempting to invent things like Guy, Grug only further embarrasses himself and drives his family further away from him.  Reaching the mountain, Grug tries to force his family to hide out in a cave, but they resist, telling him that they can't live in caves anymore, that they don't want to survive but to live. This enrages Grug, who attacks Guy and both of them end up in a [[tar]] flow where Grug learns that Guy's family had perished in one. Realizing that Guy's method of survival is better for his family, Grug works with him and they lure Chunky into a trap to free themselves. The family reunites, then flees a massive cataclysm as the land begins to violently rip apart.  The family is cut off from their destination by a continental split, but Grug, realizing the errors of his ways, decides to throw his family to safety. He shares an invention he calls a "hug" with Eep, briefly before sending her across as well. Cut off from his family, Grug finds a cave for safety, where he encounters Chunky; who is truly a frightened and sweet feline, and he comes up with an idea to getting them across the chasm. Using a ribcage and the Piranhakeets to fashion a simple airship, Grug manages to send themselves, and several animals the family had encountered during their journey, across the chasm, reuniting with his family once again. He apologizes to them all and promises to never be so overbearing again.  Later, the Croods now live on the land and have settled on a vast beach, where every day they can follow the light to "Tomorrow."

Curse of Chucky
 [[Seed of Chucky|Nine years after the events of ''Seed of Chucky'']], [[Chucky (Child's Play)|Chucky]] (voiced by [[Brad Dourif]]) mysteriously arrives in the mail at the home of [[paraplegic]] [[Nica Pierce]] ([[Fiona Dourif]]) and her mother Sarah ([[Chantal Quesnel]]). Later that night, Sarah is found dead from a stab wound, and her death is ruled as a [[suicide]]. Later, Nica is visited by her domineering older sister Barb ([[Danielle Bisutti]]), accompanied by her husband Ian ([[Brennan Elliott]]), their six-year-old daughter Alice (Summer H. Howell), live-in nanny Jill (Maitland McConnell), and Father Frank ([[A Martinez]]). Alice finds Chucky and is allowed to keep him.   Later that evening, while Alice and Nica are making soup, Chucky secretly pours rat poison into one of the dinner bowls. Father Frank eats the poison and, after leaving the house, is [[decapitation|decapitated]] in a car accident. That night, Nica investigates Chucky on the Internet and finds news articles about the murders tied to both the doll and Charles Lee Ray. Elsewhere, Chucky kicks a bucket of rainwater onto the floor's power outlets, electrocuting Jill and causing a [[Power outage|blackout]]. Barb gets up to check on Alice and is attacked by Chucky, who stabs her in the eye with a kitchen knife. Nica hears Barb's cries but has to crawl up the stairs. Once upstairs, Nica discovers that Barb is dead and Chucky is alive. When Chucky flees, Nica wakes Ian up in a panic.   Ian takes Nica to the garage but is unable to find Alice. He disarms Nica, believing her to be responsible for the murders. Nica tries to explain that Chucky is alive, but Chucky acts like a lifeless doll when Ian looks at him. Ian decides to review the footage from a hidden camera that he planted on Chucky earlier (to get evidence of Barb's affair with Jill) and learns that Alice is locked in a closet and that Chucky truly is alive. Exposed, Chucky kills Ian by chopping off his lower jaw with a [[hatchet]] before he can act. Nica manages to break out of her restraints and avoids an axe to the chest by blocking it with her numb legs. The axe gets stuck, allowing Nica to stun Chucky into dropping the axe, and she pulls it out of her legs and beheads him. Chucky reattaches his head as her attention lapses, and pushes her over a balcony onto the ground floor.  When Nica asks why Chucky is doing this, he explains through [[flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]] that as Charles Lee Ray, he was a friend of her family and in love with Sarah. Ray killed Nica's father and kidnapped Sarah while she was pregnant with Nica. When Sarah betrayed him, he stabbed her in the stomach (which resulted in Nica being born paraplegic) and escaped. Ray's flight from the police ultimately led to [[Child's Play (1988 film)|his death as a human]], which is why he came back to Sarah for revenge. Nica manages to retreat into her elevator and disarm Chucky and plunge the dagger into his torso. Officer Stanton (Adam Hurtig) arrives at the house but sees Nica holding the bloody knife after finding Barb's body. A motionless Chucky watches from a nearby chair.  Sometime later, Nica is sent to a mental asylum for the criminally insane. Chucky is retained by the police as an exhibit for her trial. The arresting officer gets in his car and sees Chucky breathing in the bag. Just before he opens the bag, [[Tiffany Valentine|Tiffany]], who had been hiding in the backseat and returned in her human form, slits his throat with a nail file, killing him. Tiffany collects Chucky and asks, "Who's next?" before closing the bag.  Meanwhile, Alice, now living with her grandmother, comes home from school to find Chucky waiting for her. Chucky persuades Alice to play "Hide The Soul", and starts the infamous [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] chant to transfer his soul into Alice's body. The grandmother, who Chucky has attacked but did not kill, sits up suddenly, suffocating in a plastic bag, shortly after Chucky begins the chant.  In a [[post-credits scene]] set six months later, Chucky, still in his doll body, is delivered to the now-adult [[Andy Barclay]] ([[Alex Vincent (actor)|Alex Vincent]]). When Andy turns his back to answer a phone call from his mother, Chucky cuts his way out of the package with a knife.

One day he notices Goldman talking about his son's wedding cards to people in the mosque where he prays and comes to know that his son is getting married and Goldman is breaking his security protocol to attend that. The same is confirmed by an [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] operative who works part-time as Goldman's bodyguard and is a neighbor and friend of Wali though he doesn't know the truth about Wali's connections to Indian Intelligence.

Wali goes home and stages his family's death in the hopes that the ISI will not put them in harm's way and he can join them after the mission is accomplished. However, all flights to [[Europe]] are cancelled, stranding Wali's wife and son at the airport. When Wali's wife calls up Wali his phone is switched off and she learns her house is on fire. Disturbed and upset about not being able to locate Wali, she informs the airport security about the same. The airport security personnel runs a check to see and discovers that three bodies have been recovered. Suspicious at the coverup he summons the ISI. The ISI, while questioning Zoya and her son Kabir, notices Kabir holding pencils that belong to the same hotel where Goldman's son is about to get married. When asked Kabir informs that the pencils were given to him by Wali a few days ago. Realizing that Wali is an operative out to get Goldman, ISI alerts their counterparts at the wedding. As a result, Wali, Rudra, Zoya, and Aslam's plan to capture Goldman is in jeopardy. Goldman escapes unscathed and the four agents have to go into hiding.

He is rescued by Rudra, who was trying to take revenge on Goldman's nephew for murdering Rudra's lover, Suraiya ([[Shruti Hassan]]), a Pakistani prostitute. Upon hearing that Wali's wife has died and that his son is in ISI custody, the four agents decide to find a way to complete their mission, despite the government having abandoned them.  The ISI decides that Goldman is too much of a liability to continue protecting further, so they decide to kill him. Before they can, the four RAW agents take out the ISI and take Goldman hostage. Wali notifies Ashwini, who works to find them a safe route out of Pakistan. Goldman taunts Wali by telling him that his wife and son are actually still alive, and that he can arrange their reunion. Wali is torn between accepting Goldman's help and completing his mission, to the point where he shoots Rudra to take control of the group. Ashwini asks them to be at Checkpost 35 before 6a.m. At the same time, Wali arranges a meeting with ISI, proposing an exchange of Goldman for his wife and child. After tying Rudra up and disarming Zoya, Wali leaves with Goldman. Zoya then frees Rudra and they follow Wali.  Wali drives to Checkpost 40 but is shot dead by Pakistani forces, who, unbeknownst to Wali, have poisoned and killed his wife and son. As Wali's car is examined, it is revealed that Wali did not actually bring Goldman with him; he had apparently anticipated the Pakistani betrayal, and had left Goldman in the car that Zoya and Rudra had taken. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that this was a plan hatched by Wali and Rudra in order to get Goldman to cooperate and give Rudra and Zoya time to get Goldman across the border to India. The Pakistani forces give Rudra and Zoya chase and barely miss them before they bring Goldman over the border, where Ashwini is waiting. Once across, Goldman taunts them by saying how nothing has changed in India and he will be released soon and is able to continue his criminal activities. Rudra shoots Goldman in the head, indicating that he is the face of the "New India."

Energized by his miraculous recovery, Jaime plans to assassinate the right-wing president [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]] (Bastian Bodenhofer). He agrees to work with another communist to assassinate Ibáñez at a dog show, but the gun fails and Jaime passes himself off as a hero when he jumps between Ibáñez and the gunman. To get close to Ibáñez, Jaime asks for a job as groom to the president's beloved horse [[Bucephalus]] as payment for his heroism. Jaime then poisons Bucephalus as part of his plot to kill Ibáñez, but when Jaime has Ibáñez at gunpoint, his hands become [[paralysed]].  The story returns to Alejandro and Sara, and Sara begins teaching Alejandro how not to be afraid of darkness and how to make sure people don't notice him. She tells him that she knows in her heart that Jaime is alive and loves both of them. They tie a stone to a balloon and release it in the belief it will find its way to him. The rock is then shown falling on the roof of a shack which Jaime is living in. Jaime awakes to discover that he has lost his memory, that he is living with a diminutive peasant woman, and that his arms have been painted the colors of the Chilean flag.   Jaime begins a long journey home, but is captured by [[Nazis]] and tortured. Rebels free Jaime and return him to his family in Tocopilla. Jaime's hands are healed when Sara tells him "You found in Ibáñez all you admired in Stalin. You are the same as they are! You have lived in the guise of a tyrant." Alejandro, Jaime, and Sara board a ship and leave [[Tocopilla]].

Dallas Buyers Club
 In July 1985, [[Dallas]] electrician and rodeo cowboy [[Ron Woodroof]] ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) is diagnosed with [[AIDS]] and given 30 days to live. He initially refuses to accept the diagnosis but remembers having unprotected sex with a woman who was an [[drug injection|intravenous drug]] user a couple years prior. He is soon ostracized by family and friends who mistakenly believe he contracted AIDS from homosexual relations, gets fired from his job, and is eventually evicted from his home. At the hospital, he is tended to by Dr. Eve Saks ([[Jennifer Garner]]), who tells him that they are testing a drug called [[zidovudine]] (AZT), an [[antiretroviral drug]] which is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients—and is the only drug approved by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for testing on humans. Saks informs him that in the [[clinical trial]]s, half the patients receive the drug and the other half are given a [[placebo]], as this is the only way they can determine if the drug is working.  Woodroof bribes a hospital worker to get him the AZT. As soon as he begins taking it, he finds his health deteriorating (exacerbated by his [[cocaine]] use). When he returns to the hospital, he meets Rayon ([[Jared Leto]]), a drug addicted, HIV-positive [[trans woman]], to whom he is initially hostile. As his health worsens, he drives to a makeshift Mexican hospital to get more AZT. The facility is run by a Dr. Vass, who has had his American medical license revoked because aspects of his work with AIDS patients had violated US regulations. Vass tells Woodroof that the AZT is "poisonous" and "kills every cell it comes into contact with". He instead prescribes a cocktail of drugs and nutritional supplements centered on [[Zalcitabine|ddC]] and the protein [[peptide T]], which are not yet approved in the US. Three months later, Woodroof finds his health much improved. It occurs to him that he could make money by importing the drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. Since the drugs are not illegal, he is able to get them over the border by masquerading as a priest and swearing that they are for personal use. Meanwhile, Saks also begins to notice the negative effects of AZT, but is told by her supervisor, Dr. Sevard, that it cannot be discontinued.  Over the next year, (1986) Woodroof begins selling the drugs on the street and at [[gay nightclub]]s. He comes back into contact with Rayon, with whom he reluctantly sets up business since she can bring many more customers. The pair establish the "Dallas Buyers Club", charging $400 per month for membership, and it becomes extremely popular. He gradually begins to respect Rayon and think of her as a friend. When Woodroof has a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] caused by a recently acquired dose of [[interferon]], Sevard learns of the club and the alternative medication. He is angry that it is interrupting his trial, while the FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Saks agrees that there are benefits to AIDS medicine [[buyers club]]s (of which there are several around the country) but feels powerless to change anything. The processes that the FDA uses to research, test and approve drugs are seen as flawed and a part of the problem for AIDS patients. Saks and Woodroof strike up a friendship.  The FDA gets a warrant to raid the Buyers Club, but can do nothing but fine Woodroof. In 1987, the FDA changes its regulations, making any unapproved drug illegal. As the Club runs out of funds, Rayon, who is addicted to cocaine, begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more of the peptide T. Upon return, Ron finds out that Rayon died after being taken to the hospital. Saks is also upset by her death, and is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she is linking patients with the Buyers Club, having learned that AZT trials previously conducted in France had proven the drug to be ineffective against HIV. She refuses, and insists that she will have to be fired instead.  As time passes, Woodroof shows compassion towards gay, lesbian, and transgender members of the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files a lawsuit against the FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the power to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.

The Damned (2013 film)
 American photographer David Reynolds and his British fiancee Lauren go to Colombia to persuade David's teenage daughter, Jill, to return to America so she can attend their wedding.  They find her with David's former sister-in-law, Gina, a television reporter, and Gina's cameraman Ramón, whom Jill is dating.  Annoyed that her father intends to get married after the death of her mother Marcela, Jill refuses to attend the wedding.  After David insists that she can not stay in Colombia, she replies that she has left her passport in a nearby city.  Jill invites Ramón to come along with them to retrieve her passport, much to David's annoyance.  On the way, they encounter Captain Morales, who warns them to turn back, as the roads ahead have become flooded.  After he leaves, Gina brushes off his concerns and advises them to continue, as she knows the roads well.  Once in the storm, however, they become lost and lose control of the car.  A wave pushes the car off the road, and, amid other minor injuries, Lauren breaks two of her ribs in the resulting accident.  Leaving the car, they encounter a remote inn whose owner, Felipe, tells them it is closed and to seek help in town.  Their injuries convince him to let them in, but he warns them to not leave the lobby.  David and Felipe go outside to get firewood. As Jill and Ramón wander around the inn to find a bathroom, Jill hears a girl calling out for help in Spanish.  They hide when they hear Felipe return and see him check a basement door before the others mollify him.  When Jill and Ramón check the basement, they find  Ana Maria, Felipe's daughter, locked in a box.  Felipe angrily confronts them with a rifle, but David saves them by knocking out Felipe.  David lets Ana Maria out of the box and ties up Felipe.  Ana Maria does not speak much, and, when Felipe regains consciousness, he only tells them that they will all die.  They gag him and look for a working car or phone, to no avail.  They soon become suspicious when they discover the inn has not had a customer since 1978, Felipe has a decades-old photograph of Ana Marie, and the box is carved with occult symbols.  Ana Marie taunts Felipe by telling him that she will kill everyone.  When he frees himself, he slashes his wrists and runs at her with a knife.  Ramón, who earlier took Felipe's rifle, shoots and kills him.  As Gina and Ana Marie separate from the others to talk, Captain Morales arrives and demands to see Felipe.  When they explain that they had to kill him in self-defense, Morales orders them at gunpoint to enter the box.  David briefly enters the box, but rushes Morales and disarms him.  Morales reveals that Ana Marie is a [[bruja]], a Spanish witch.  She can take over the body of anyone who kills her current host. Felipe locked her up nearly 40 years ago after his daughter was possessed.  The witch knows everyone's secrets and uses them to sow discord and encourage people to kill her, so she can inhabit the strongest person.  Gina kills Ana Marie after she threatens to reveal Gina's abortion, and Ramón kills the witch (Gina) when she reveals that he is a serial killer who preys on young women.  Morales encourages them to wound the witch (Ramón) rather than kill her, but Lauren accidentally kills Ramón.  The witch (Lauren) taunts them by revealing that David turned off Marcela's life support without telling Jill.  After they bring Lauren back to the house, David insists they find a way to cure her, but Morales says it is not possible.  The witch frees herself from Lauren, kills Morales, and promises to let Jill live if David will sacrifice himself, as the witch does not want to inhabit Lauren's injured body.  David initially refuses, but, after the witch appears to him as Marcela and disfigures herself, he agrees.  Before David can sacrifice himself, Jill kills the witch herself.  Overcome with grief, David locks Jill (now possessed) in the box.

Dark Skies (film)
 The Barrett family—mother Lacy, father Daniel, older son Jesse, and younger son Sammy—reside on a quiet suburban street in an unnamed American city. Daniel is currently unemployed, placing the burden of supporting the family on Lacy, who works as a real estate agent. Their two sons enjoy a happy relationship and communicate with each other from their beds via walkie-talkie.  A number of strange occurrences befall the family. During the night, the contents of the kitchen are rearranged in bizarre configurations. The house alarm is set off when it detects that all entry points were breached simultaneously. Sammy suffers a fit while playing soccer and Lacy is shocked when hundreds of birds suddenly crash into the house. One night, Lacy is awakened by a sound from Sammy's room. When she goes to check on him, through the darkness she sees a figure standing over his bed. She turns on the light to find an empty room. Sammy is found walking away from the house [[Alien abduction#Return|but cannot remember leaving]]. Lacy, Daniel and Jesse each suffer catatonic episodes and regain consciousness with no memory of their experiences. Strange symbols are found on Jesse and Sammy's bodies.  Greatly disturbed by the various phenomena afflicting the family and the house, Lacy begins to search online for answers and finds articles attributing some of what they have experienced to UFOs and reports of [[alien abduction]]. Daniel installs security cameras throughout the house. He reviews the night's footage and frame-by-frame analysis reveals three dark figures standing over their beds as they slept. Now believing that there is an extraterrestrial force at work, Lacy and Daniel seek the help of a specialist, Edwin Pollard, who calls the beings "[[Grey alien|the Greys]]." Pollard informs them that many others have suffered the same fate as the Barretts, with most cases ending in a child abduction. Edwin warns the Barretts that the person who the Greys first show interest in is usually the one who is abducted and that they should be highly protective of Sammy, who he believes has been "chosen."  Daniel buys a shotgun while Lacy buys an aggressive guard dog. The family spend July 4 boarding up the windows of the house, then eat dinner and reminisce about happier times. Suddenly, the house lights begin to flicker and the dog starts barking ferociously. Lacy sends the boys upstairs and stands guard outside the door. Lacy hears the TV in her bedroom turn on. She walks towards it, unaware of a being standing directly behind her, and becomes trapped in her room. Daniel gets Jesse and Sammy into his and Lacy's room where they barricade themselves in and huddle together on the bed. The TV begins to flicker again and the beings – now revealed to be Greys – materialize in the room. Jesse blacks out and experiences a hallucination in which his father commits suicide while standing over his mother's bloodied body. Seeing his brother, Jesse chases after Sammy before reawakening in the upstairs hallway of his house. The Greys appear in front of him and he disappears with them in a flash of light, the rest of the family powerless to help.  Three months later, Lacy and Daniel are suspects in Jesse's disappearance, and have moved into an apartment. Pollard balefully cuts out a newspaper article about Jesse's disappearance and hangs it on his wall with other pictures of missing children. As Lacy is going through old things, she finds pictures that Jesse drew as a child that show the Greys surrounding him. She belatedly realizes that it was Jesse, not Sammy, in whom the Greys first showed interest, and that he was the one who had been chosen. Feedback then emanates from a nearby walkie-talkie as Lacy and Sammy both hear Jesse's faint voice calling Sammy's name.

David is Ghani's protege who is poised to take over the empire one day as Ghani's son is a spoilt, playful brat. David is in love with Ghani's ward, Noor and promises to marry her. Things take a turn when two undercover RAW agents come to London to expose Ghani's ties to religious extremists in India. While trying to take David down, the agents reveal to him that his mother was Ghani's mistress and might have killed his father to be with him. David's loyalty towards his master is tested even more when Noor is forcefully married off to Ghani's son to hide the fact he is gay even though she is pregnant with David's son. When the RAW agents finally manage to get close to Ghani, they assassinate not only him but David as well to keep their mission a secret from the British authorities.  '''Mumbai, 1999:''' 19-year-old David ([[Vinay Virmani]]) is an amateur guitarist born into a family of lower-middle class Christians. He is a happy go lucky teenager who dreams of becoming a professional musician and sending his sisters off to Dubai to pursue their dreams.

A Hindu fanatic politician, Malati Tai, finds out about this and makes it appear as if David's father is converting poor people to Christianity in return for money. She attacks David's colony with the help of gangsters and humiliates Noel by blackening his face in front of the media. Traumatised by this, the priest starts to lose his mind. An angry David is then easily persuaded by a political activist to assassinate Malati at a rally to seek vengeance.

However, David comes to realise that his intentions might not be sincere as both his mother and the priest who tries to help him stop the wedding become involved in separate accidents and are hospitalised. On the day of the wedding, David plans to profess his love for Roma until Peter reveals that he actually sincerely loves her and was only lying that he was marrying her for the dowry out of fear he would be teased.

In 1999, the London David's son with Noor, Iqbal, comes to Mumbai to seek revenge for his father's murder from the two RAW agents. He kills one RAW agent who is retiring as a General.

His objective is to make Alphonse pay for the murder of his wife and young daughter (Accalia Quintana) two years earlier. Victor intends to exact revenge on Alphonse through physical and psychological torture before finally killing him.  Victor watches and is watched by Beatrice ([[Noomi Rapace]]), a mysterious young woman who lives in the apartment across from his. Beatrice begins to contact Victor and show interest in him. On their first date, Beatrice reveals her true motivation: she has a video of Victor killing a man, and will go to the police unless Victor kills the drunk driver who disfigured her face.  Meanwhile, Alphonse is receiving threats against his life by Victor. During a shoot-out with Jamaicans whom he believes responsible for the threats, Victor saves his life and thus gains his trust. As the threats intensify, a man within Alphonse's crew and a friend of Victor's, Darcy ([[Dominic Cooper]]), investigates their source. Victor has also kidnapped the brother of [[Albanians|Albanian]] kingpin Ilir Brozi ([[James Biberi]]), who was involved in helping Alphonse dispose of Victor's family. Victor plans to pool the Albanians and Alphonse's men together so he can eliminate them all at once.  Victor stages a deliberately failed sniper attack on Alphonse from a rooftop in continuing his plans of torture. However, he nearly is caught in the process and manages to escape thanks to Beatrice, who has been following Victor. Ilir's brother, who was kidnapped by Victor, has been held tied up and blindfolded in an abandoned ship (the ''[[S.S. United States]]'', which, although the film is set in New York City, was, during production, and as of 2017 still is, docked in Philadelphia). Victor makes a video in which Ilir's brother claims that he is being held in the basement of Alphonse's warehouse, in an effort to frame Alphonse, which would lure the Albanians to the warehouse in retaliation, thereby having them all rounded up in one place. He then kills Ilir's brother. Beatrice is given the memory card with the video to mail to Ilir in order to make it seem like Alphonse's crew was responsible for his brother's kidnapping. Alphonse, now knowing the threats are coming from someone within his crew, becomes suspicious but reluctant to believe that Victor is the traitor due to him previously saving his life. Victor later notifies Beatrice that he didn't kill the drunk driver so that they can spend more time together, knowing the psychological effect that the murder would have had on her. Victor sets up a trap for the Albanians and Alphonse, but Beatrice reveals through a call that she didn't mail the memory card because she didn't want to see Victor die. At that moment, Darcy, who has found Victor's true intentions while investigating his apartment, subdues Beatrice and informs Victor she is being held captive at Alphonse's house.  As Alphonse and the Albanians gather in the house, Victor crashes into the house with his truck. Victor spares Darcy's life in the ensuing gunfight and makes his way to the top floor where Beatrice is held by Alphonse and Ilir. Beatrice escapes their watch while they are distracted by Victor's successful advance, and she begins to play the video on a computer. As Ilir hears the video, he turns his gun on Alphonse who he believes has betrayed him. They both end up shooting each other dead.  As Victor escapes with Beatrice, Darcy confronts them with his gun raised. When asked if he spared Darcy because he has a wife and child ("Did you not kill me because I've got a wife and a kid?"), Victor replies, "No, because they've got you" before dropping his gun. Darcy also lowers his gun and allows the two to leave. Victor and Beatrice travel home on a subway and share a kiss.  
Dead in Tombstone
 In the Frontier of the [[Wild West]], Red Cavanaugh is to be [[hanged]] for his crimes. Calm, he says that every man at the gallows will be dead before sunrise. Moments later, the Blackwater Gang – Baptiste, Darko, Ramos, Snake, and Washington – arrive led by his half-brother Guerrero De La Cruz. After slaughtering everyone and freeing Red, they retreat. The next morning, Red tells them about Edendale, Colorado, where gold ore is being  stored in a bank until a mineral dispute can be settled. Guerrero agrees to steal it, so long as they avoid unnecessary deaths. After the seven rob the bank, Red betrays Guerrero, as he had acquired the deed to the mine and desires to take over the town. He shoots Guerrero, and despite Guerrero's orders, Red convinces the rest of the gang to turn on him; they all shoot Guerrero to death.  Finding himself in Hell, Guerrero meets Lucifer, whom he had seen recently in his dreams. Guerrero bargains with him, to allow him to return to Earth and to kill his former gang, so that the fires of Hell can grow hotter than he alone can stoke with his flesh. Intrigued by this, Lucifer grants Guerrero 24 hours to slay all six of his betrayers or his soul will remain damned to Hell; Satan tells him that only Guerrero can kill the six, dissuading him from asking for help. Guerrero wakens one year to the day of his death and makes his way back to town now called "Tombstone" in his memory.  Ramos, shaken by an omen earlier, returns to his home and witnesses two of his farmhands killed before confronting Guerrero, whom he does not immediately recognize. After Guerrero puts together his guns, a feat only he and Red could accomplish, Ramos recognizes him, and he is shot to death. Taking his clothes, Guerrero has the local pastor set up six pine boxes as coffins and stations Ramos in one of them. The following morning, Baptiste and Darko discover Ramos and invade a nearby [[slaughterhouse]]. After a stand-off with Baptiste and his men, Guerrero kills Baptiste but realizes that he still bleeds like a mortal. Darko tells Red about the stranger killing them off, and he sends Washington to the mine to insure that the man protecting them from the law is paid off in full. The gang goes to the [[Western saloon|saloon]] where Guerrero is and a firefight ensues. After defeating them, Guerrero sees the former sheriff's widow, Calathea, about to kill Red and stops her, but he is trampled by Red's horse as he flees town. Waking sometime later, he explains to her and Father Paul about his situation. Showing him Darko's dead body, whom he'd killed during the saloon brawl, Calathea agrees to help him, and the two make their way to the mine.  In the mine, it is revealed that Judah Clark, a Marshall, is aiding Red and protecting Red for access to the gold. They leave Washington and Snake to finish off Guerrero, but he turns the tables and kills Washington as he and Calathea escape back to town with his body. After an intense chase, they return to town. In a stand-off, Guerrero kills Snake with a gunshot to the eye, but he is quickly shot down and Calathea is captured.

Decoding Annie Parker
 11-year-old Annie Parker is living the perfect young life, loved by all, and especially by her mother, father, and older sister. But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking their perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins.  At UC Berkeley a brilliant research geneticist named [[Mary-Claire King]] is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of [[Science (journal)|Science]]—quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees.<ref></ref> But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at least some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough—the discovery of the location of the [[BRCA1]] hereditary breast cancer gene—considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.<ref></ref>  At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister, Joan Parker who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Joan contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she, too, is dead.  Annie is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister—breast cancer. It is severe, and surgery and chemotherapy, with all its accompanying difficulties, soon follows. She loses her hair, and if that wasn't enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne’s closest friend Louise, and leaves her. Paul is soon diagnosed with cancer and expires shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer.  With the help of a young doctor, Sean, and a new friend, Kim, Anne continues her fight. As each tragedy befalls her, she grows stronger.  While Annie struggles, King is pursuing her belief that some forms of breast and ovarian cancer have a hereditary basis. While she captures headlines for her work applying DNA fingerprinting to help reunite "the disappeared" with their families in Argentina, her priority is to map the breast cancer gene.  King focuses on collecting families with a particularly high incidence of breast cancer, suspecting that these cases are most likely to reveal any genetic predispositions. Advances in genetic mapping through the 1980s gradually allow her team to embark on studies to map the location of the BRCA1 gene. Finally, in 1990, King and her team find conclusive evidence linking DNA markers on chromosome 17 with an inherited flaw in a gene dubbed BRCA1. The work was presented at the American Society of Human Genetics conference in Cincinnati, and published in [[Science (journal)|Science magazine]] a short time later.<ref></ref>  Mary Claire King ended up on the cover of ''Time'' magazine, and Anne Parker finally had the answer she herself had long sought. Anne Parker happily remarried, and a few years later contracts cancer for a third time. And survives again. And she laughed while being treated, for reasons only she knew and understood.  
Death Race 3: Inferno
 Death Race owner R.H. Weyland has been forced to sell the rights to Niles York, a British billionaire who acquired the rights by [[hostile takeover]]. York reveals he intends to relocate the Death Race in [[South Africa]] as the Transcontinental Death Race. Before leaving, Weyland arranges Carl Lucas, also known as Frankenstein, to have surgery to heal the infected and deadly scars on his face sustained from [[Death Race 2|his gruesome crash]]. With Lucas one win away from gaining his freedom, York threatens to kill him if he wins.  Before his first race, Lucas engages in a fist fight with other racers and his mask is knocked off in the middle of the fight, revealing his identity to his crew, who believed him dead. Before the first race, all of the female [[Co-driver|navigators]] had to participate in a Death Race "Navigator Wars" and the Death Race itself is now hosted and produced by Satana. Contestants to be chosen are the top 10 survivors, with Katrina Banks among the survivors. Before the first race, all racers receive GPS locators surgically so the showrunners can locate where the racers are at all times and, if necessary, kill them if they attempt to escape.  During the first race, racing in the [[Kalahari Desert]] present a different set of difficulties compared to racing on the Terminal Island prison race course. Eleven racers take the start, but one, Jackal, jumps the start and is killed by the missile tracker. Joker, Pretty Boy, and the Tazmanian Devil also die in the first sector. Razor beats out Frankenstein by a hair to win the first race.  After the race, Katrina tells Lucas they cannot resume their previous relationship, as she is hearbroken over finding out that he kept his survival secret from her. A fight ensues after the first race and Goldberg is cut in the scuffle. The show's surgeon, Olivia, makes advances on Goldberg and the two establish a relationship. In order to make Katrina jealous, the producer Satana orders Psycho's navigator Amber to have sex with Lucas, who seems to refuse the offer. Satana and York grow suspicious that Lucas is up to something due to his non-rebellious attitude to being forced to lose. Lucas then explains his deal with York to his crew and says that, instead, he made a "new deal".  The second race then commences with the death of three more drivers. Fury is killed after being tricked by Olga Braun (Death Race's first-ever female driver) and she is in turn killed by Razor seconds later. Afterwards, Razor is struggling to handle both Lucas and Psycho before the three are joined by 14K, having disabled Nero's car before leaving him to get beaten to death by an angry mob of locals. The race ends with Lucas emerging victorious in the second race. But at that moment, Goldberg is caught in an explosion caused by stray bullets from local hostile [[war lord]]s, and is pronounced dead. Later on, York reminds Lucas he is to lose his next race to 14K or York will torture him and Katrina. Satana then discovers York wishes to replace her as producer and remove her from the Death Race so he can assume complete control. Before the next race, Katrina confesses her love to Lucas, and Lucas admits he did not have sex with the other navigator when he had the chance.  Before the final race, Psycho and Lucas have a chat about the identity of Frankenstein and if Lucas was the first. The final race begins with Razor disabling Psycho's car, and Psycho dies in the flames while his navigator Amber survives without taking any damage. Lucas takes the lead with York attempting to kill him with a [[Homing (missile guidance)|homing]] missile, but 14K shoots [[Flare (countermeasure)|flares]] to divert the missile and destroy it, saving his life and [[Death Race 2|returning the "life for a life" favor]].  Near the end of the race, Lucas holds a commanding lead and kills many of the Death Race guards along the way, vowing to kill York. However, Lucas allows 14K to pass him and then speeds to York. As York attempts to escape, Satana handcuffs him to a table for attempting to replace her. Lucas crashes his car into the control room and explodes, engulfing the room in flames. Initially, it is insinuated that everyone except Lucas perished in the crash. However, it is revealed that Lucas and Katrina escaped unharmed, and now the unrecognizable York is Lucas, a.k.a. Frankenstein. In order to assert York is Frankenstein, Lists confirms it is him, along with the show's surgeon who claims the implanted chip is that of Lucas's.  It is then revealed that Lucas's "new deal" that he made during the meeting with Weyland was to fake Goldberg's death; the surgeon falsely pronounced him dead, and after the crash, she pronounced York and Katrina dead and Lucas as the only survivor. Since York is now "dead", Weyland regains control of the Death Race and grants Lucas, Katrina, Lists, and Goldberg their freedom, but Lists refuses the offer and returns to Terminal Island. Weyland pays Lucas a substantial amount of money for his help regaining control of the Death Race, and he and Katrina relocate with Goldberg elsewhere. York is punished for his crimes and [[Death Race (film)|imprisoned in Terminal Island]], forcing him to become the second [[Frankenstein (Death Race)|Frankenstein]].

Despicable Me 2
  A mysterious vehicle using a huge [[magnet]] steals a highly potent mutagen known as PX-41 from a secret laboratory in the [[Arctic Circle]]. The Anti-Villain League (AVL), headed by Silas Ramsbottom, tries to recruit former [[supervillain]] Gru to track down those responsible and recover the mutagen, but Gru refuses, claiming that he is now a legitimate businessman and devoted father to Margo, Edith, and Agnes. Dr. Nefario, Gru's friend and assistant, longs to go back to villainy and leaves Gru for new employment. Gru reluctantly agrees to investigate the theft, and is partnered with undercover AVL agent Lucy Wilde.  The pair begin their search in the Paradise Shopping Mall, disguised as bakery employees. Gru immediately suspects Mexican restaurant owner, Eduardo Pérez, of being the infamous "El Macho", a legendary supervillain who supposedly died by riding a shark into the mouth of an active [[volcano]] with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest. Gru and Lucy break into Eduardo's restaurant at night, but find no proof. Meanwhile Agnes, who dreams of one day having a mother, believes that Gru will fall in love with Lucy; Gru denies it, saying his relationship with Lucy is only professional.  Although holding Eduardo as his chief suspect, Gru agrees to pursue others, including wig merchant Floyd Eagle-san. After witnessing Eduardo's two-timing son, Antonio, woo Margo and invite everyone to his [[Cinco de Mayo]] party, Gru renews his focus on Eduardo. His neighbor, Jillian, sets him up on a dinner date with her vacuous friend Shannon. The date goes horribly, but Lucy arrives and rescues Gru from being humiliated by Shannon by shooting her with a [[tranquilizer gun]]. While they take Shannon home, Gru and Lucy spend personal time together, and Gru falls in love with her.  The next day, the AVL arrest Eagle-san after finding an almost-empty jar of the mutagen in his shop, and the investigation is closed by Ramsbottom. Lucy is reassigned to [[Australia]], but gives Gru her lipstick [[Taser]] as a gift before leaving. A heartbroken Gru, having lacked the courage to ask Lucy out on a date, instead takes the girls to the Cinco de Mayo party. While there, he follows Eduardo and discovers a secret musical steps-activated elevator, where he finally finds proof that Eduardo is El Macho.  On her flight, Lucy, realizing that she has also fallen in love with Gru, jumps out of the plane and [[Hang gliding|hang glides]] down to the party. Gru discovers that Macho, who is revealed to have hired Nefario as a partner, has been abducting Gru's [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]] and using the stolen PX-41 serum to make them rabid and indestructible. Macho plans to launch rockets full of the mutated Minions into major cities in order to achieve world domination. He gives Gru the chance to team up with him, but Gru walks away.  Lucy later arrives at the party, but Macho captures Lucy after Pollito, Macho's pet chicken, retrieves her AVL [[ID badge]] from her purse. Nefario rejoins Gru, who fakes being captured with two other minions to help him enter Macho's fortress. Nefario creates an [[antidote]] to the serum; Gru, Nefario, and the girls use it as a weapon to return the Minions to their normal state.  Macho then takes the mutagen himself and turns into a monster, but Gru and Nefario defeat him using Lucy's lipstick Taser and a fart gun.  Gru finds Lucy strapped to a [[TNT]]-loaded shark rocket and starts to untie her, but Pollito launches the rocket, sending it flying towards the same volcano where Macho previously faked his death. Lucy accepts Gru's invitation for a date, and the pair dive into the ocean seconds before the rocket enters the volcano and violently explodes. Gru rejoins the AVL, and he and Lucy eventually get married, giving Margo, Edith and Agnes a mother.  
Detective Conan: Private Eye in the Distant Sea
 ===Introduction=== At Maizuru Bay, on the dawn of April 20, a coast guard named Masaki Kurata finds a suspicious boat during his patrol. Upon examining the inside of the boat, he discovers some explosives and immediately reports this to the Wakasa Coast Guard. The discovery quickly hits the news reports, where is it revealed that the boat contains data and components not found in Japan. It's also believed to have entered Japan illegally.  ===The military exercises=== On the same morning, Conan Edogawa, Ran and Kogoro Mori, Sonoko Suzuki and the Detective Boys board an Aegis/Arleigh Burke-Class destroyer warship, JDS Hotaka, to experience public military exercises after winning the tickets. Before going aboard, Conan receives a call from Professor Agasa, who's currently in Osaka together with Ai Haibara for a conference, via the newly added satellite-phone on his Stun-Gun Wristwatch. The professor wants to test if the new gadget is working properly, but doesn't forget to leave a quiz for the children before hanging up.  After boarding the ship, the participants are gathered in a meeting room. While the Chief Navigator Fumitada Inoue is explaining about the exercise schedule, Ran mentions that her watch was broken and sent to be repaired. Mitsuhiko then lends her his waterproof radio-controlled watch, which sets itself at 5 AM and 5 PM every day according to radio transmitters. Suddenly, they hear a strange loud sound. Fumitada explains that it was just the sound of the pumping system operating, however, Conan wonders whether that was really the case.  ===Meeting Yuuki and Nanami=== The participants are guided into the ship's Combat Information Center (CIC), where they are to witness a simulated anti-air combat. However, after having "shot down" the two set-up targets, the guards continue to detect a sonar response. An unidentified target of unknown nationality is slowly approaching the ship. The tactical action officer quickly reports this to their captain, Yukio Tateishi, who orders them to search for the target with all radars, before heading to the CIC himself. Following him is a female Self-Defense Force (SDF) member, Nanami Fuji. The civilian participants are generally impressed by the realistic and tense atmosphere of the training; only Conan realizes that they're truly under attack. Yukio instructs the crews to prepare for anti-submarine combat. They decide to fire a torpedo towards the unknown object. The ship is slightly hit with the shockwave caused by the impact. Conan then notices a sick boy with no accompanying adult. The crews are relieved that their target is nothing but a shipwreck. Fumitada announces to the participants that the "exercises" are now over.  The participants arrive at the deck during free time. Conan sees the boy from before, who is called "Yuki-kun" by a man nearby. Conan wonders if the man is Yuki's father, and finds it suspicious that he didn't notice the shock, and wouldn't show himself until after the free time had started. He decides to follow the two, only to be stopped by Kogoro. Conan then notices the female SDF member, Nanami Fuji, who's also on the deck at the time. Conan borrows Mitsuhiko's camera and begs Nanami to take a group photo with them, attempting to get a close-up shot of her. When asked about her specific work on the ship, Nanami answers that she only cooks everyone's meal, a lie that Conan can easily perceive due to her captain-ranked insignia. Before Nanami leaves, Kogoro reaches for one of his flashy business cards as he wants to hand it to her himself. Unfortunately, the detective's clumsiness causes the cards to fly all around them. They have to pick the cards up and give them to Ran.  Conan borrows Mitsuhiko's camera again and runs off to a corner. He gives Agasa a call via the satellite-phone and asks him to investigate Nanami basing on the picture that he sent to Haibara's phone, specifically from which department does the SDF member come from. The ship crews detect a satellite transmission from the right side of the deck, where Conan was calling Agasa. They suspect that "X" is among the civilians. When one of the guides is introducing the ship's radar which can cover over 450&nbsp;km, Conan sees some crew members checking his previous hiding spot. He wonders whether they have found out about the call, or it was actually something else.  ===Discovering the arm and its owner=== Conan plans to chase after the crew members with the excuse of "going to the toilet", but Ran doesn't trust him and suggests that the two go together. On the way, Ran mentions that she almost got lost earlier, which reminds Conan that Ran isn't always good with directions. He remembers the time when Ran also got lost at Tropical Land. However, she wasn't afraid of getting lost again, because she knew that Shinichi would always find her, as he's a great detective; to which Shinichi replied: "Don't you worry! I'll always find you, wherever you are."  Unsurprising to Conan, Ran gets lost again as their path was blocked with a forbidden sign. Suddenly, they hear a scream coming from a room beyond the limit. Upon arriving, they see a human arm wearing a SDF's lieutenant uniform on the table. They advise the crew members to consult Kogoro.  In Osaka, Heiji Hattori gets a call from Conan, who informs him of the situation. He, together with Kazuha Toyama, heads off to Maizuru. The ship crews detect Conan's satellite signal again but don't find any transmitter. It is then that he learns of the person with the codename "X". Unfortunately, Conan's phone rings again as he receives a call from Agasa, who's about to inform him that their search for Nanami didn't find any match. However, he manages to hide before the crew members discover him. Conan then looks for a different method of communication, and he comes across a room with a strong magnetic field.  Meanwhile, inside the bridge, Hotaka's Captain Yukio Tateishi and Captain Makoto Sekiguchi from the Wakasa Military Police discuss the case with Kogoro and Ran. Kogoro deduces that the arm wasn't cut off by a sharp blade and was removed post-mortem. As it was found inside the pumping system's filter, they conclude that the arm was sucked in by the pumping system and got stuck in the filter, making the loud sound from earlier. Yukio hesitantly reveals that the arm probably belongs to Lt. Sasaura from the Wakasa base, whose whereabouts is currently unknown. Kogoro agrees with this assumption after seeing that his clock stopped at 5:30 AM that morning. According to Yukio, Sasaura wasn't in that day's shift. As the pumping system was started when they left Maizuru Harbor, Sasaura's body must have already drifted at the time. Fearing that it would be too late for an autopsy when they get back, Conan hints that they use the helicopter to transport the arm, pretending that it's only a demonstration. Kogoro then informs Inspector Megure of the case, not knowing that Nanami is watching nearby.  Conan and Ran encounter Yuki when they come to watch the "demonstration", and notice that his father is missing again. Yuki doesn't want to let Ran tell the crews about his situation and attempts to run away before dropping some medicines. He reveals that they are for food allergies. Just as he's about to leave, Yuki's father appears. Conan comes to the magnetic room and contacts Agasa, in order to avoid being discovered. Haibara tells him about her discovery. Meanwhile, at a shipyard in Wakasa Bay, Heiji and Kazuha find Sasaura's body. Heiji notices a red stain on Sasaura's neck and secretly retrieves it.  ===Initial investigation=== Inspector Megure, Miwako Sato, Wataru Takagi and two officers from Wakasa Coast Guard, Masaki Kurata and Tsutomu Munekawa, arrive at the ship in a helicopter. Heiji informs Conan that he's found the body at Wakasa Bay. He surmises that Sasaura drifted there after having his arm swallowed at Maizuru Harbor. After hearing about the red stain, Conan asks Heiji to meet up with Agasa. While the civilians are having lunch, the police suggest an investigation on the ship, considering that the victim might have been sucked into the pump before the ship departed. Conan follows them to the deck, where they find Sasaura's phone. The last email was after 9 PM and the last call was at 5:30 AM. According to the autopsy, his death was between 4 AM and 6 AM and the cause of death is drowning, which means that he was on the ship before falling into the sea at 5:30 AM. Kogoro deduces that Sasaura had a fight with someone on the deck and was eventually pushed down. This also confirms that his body was stuck in the filter before the departure, and the arm was severed when they left Maizuru Harbor. Sato finds an empty microSD slot on the phone. Kogoro thinks that the card was the culprit's target. Conan then sees Nanami spying on the investigation and gives chase.  ===Nanami's mission and spy "X"=== Nanami enters the captain's office and checks the content of the microSD card stolen from Sasaura's phone. Conan imitates the captain's voice to trick her out of the room. Conan finds out that she hasn't completely deleted the extracted data and attempts to copy them into the new USB flash drive on his watch. However, Nanami realizes that she was tricked and quickly makes her way back to the office, Conan is thus unable to retrieve all of the data. She wonders why X is interested in the data. To uncover her true identity, Conan deliberately sends the data to Agasa from within the room, creating a detectable satellite signal.  The police arrive at the captain's office. They demand that Nanami explain herself, but Yukio and Makoto refuse to cooperate. Conan then comes out and innocently points out all of the contradictory facts about Nanami, forcing her to reveal herself as a member of the Intelligence Security Command. Due to the incident with the foreign boat, they suspect that the spy X, whose target is believed to be classified intel on Aegis Destroyers, might be on board. It's also revealed that the victim was the Director of Intelligence for the Wakasa SDF base. His duty was to guard information on Aegis Destroyers. Because of this, they suspect that X was the killer. Conan wonders why Nanami doesn't talk about the card. He plants a bug on Kogoro before running off.  ===Investigation on the victim=== Conan asks Heiji, who's now inside Agasa's car, about the red stain. They learn that it's anti-fouling paint, a special paint used for ships. Conan asks them to check if the paint was from Hotaka. Heiji says that there is no current that could've sent the victim's body from Maizuru Harbor to Wakasa Bay. Conan then asks about the data from earlier, about which Agasa reveals that it's indeed a data of Aegis Destroyers, and was copied from a cloud service. If they have the ID and password, they can get the original data from the cloud. Conan wonders why would Sasaura store such important data on a public cloud service. He instructs Agasa to access the cloud data and send it to the captain's office.  Back in the captain's office, Kogoro asks Inspector Fumimaro Ayanokoji, who's just arrived, to share the result of his investigation. Having investigated the victim's actions before his death, Fumimaro reveals that at 5:30 AM, Sasaura was waving a Japanese flag on a cliff at Maizuru Harbor, as witnessed by a crew member of a sightseeing cruise nearby. He then asks Makoto about the interrogation of Sasaura, but Nanami doesn't let the latter answer. Luckily, Agasa sends the data as instructed, forcing Makoto to reveal that data about the ships have been leaked by Sasaura, and sent to a shell company of a spy called Takekawa. This, together with the suspicious boat, indicates that a spy from the same country as Takekawa attempted to board this ship with the victim's help. It also explains Nanami's motive for taking the memory card. Nanami contacts her superior, and learns that Takekawa has been spotted in Kyoto. His plan is to meet up with X, who's currently on board. They then work together to track down Takekawa.  ===Takekawa's whereabouts and the truth behind the shipwreck=== Components from the same country as the ones in the foreign boat was found on the shipwreck. As the sailing route of the ship was changed from right to left that morning and only people from the Wakasa base knew about this, X wouldn't have known the true direction to send out the shipwreck. However, the flag that Sasaura waved turns out to be a signal flag, the purpose of which was to inform X of the change. Nanami becomes suspicious of Conan's knowledge.  Takekawa was spotted at 12:03 PM in Ponto Town Park (Kyoto), where he's shown dropping something into a trash can. Conan asks Heiji to go to the park before the police do. At 12:10 PM, Takekawa got on an express train to Osaka. They then ask the Osaka Police to cooperate.  Heiji manages to catch up before the police arrive and takes a photo of Takekawa's burned memo.  Back at the cafeteria, Conan revises the whole case and realizes X's motive for sending the shipwreck. Unexpectedly, Nanami approaches him and questions about his identity. Without telling her the truth, Conan drops his façade and directly asks Nanami whether there is any kind of data that can only be obtained on the ship. Nanami confirms his theory and says that the only two places where such data can be found are the CIC and captain's office. Conan deduces that during the emergency, the captain had to come to the CIC; that's when X made his move in the captain's office. He now realizes who X is and quickly runs off, with Nanami and Ran chasing behind. Makoto then informs Nanami that they spotted Takekawa at Yodoyabashi Station (Osaka). Conan tells Heiji to go after him, while he confronts X himself.  ===X's true identity=== The man who claims to be Yuki Amemiya's father is spy X. Conan tells Yuki to hide away before exposing that the man's not his real father. X attempts to silence Conan, but then flees because there are two many civilians on the deck. Conan gives chase, but Yuki, fearing about his real father's safety, intervenes. Meanwhile, after examining the picture of Takekawa's burned memo, Heiji concludes that Takekawa will come to Senshu Airport (now known as Kansai International Airport). He reports this to Inspector Goro Otaki.  Conan tells the police that Yuki's father vanished at Maizuru Harbor, where Yuki was forced to board with a strange man. Because Conan also remembers X's face, they invite him to check the camera footage. The Osaka police head to Kansai Airport in chase of Takekawa.  X destroys the footage before Conan can locate him. Yuki wants to help them catch X, so Fumitada goes together with him, only to be assaulted by the spy. X takes Yuuki to the deck and are spotted by Ran, who's looking for Conan. Yuki tells Ran about X's true identity. Ran fights X, but is eventually defeated and thrown into the sea.  At Kansai Airport, Kazuha finds Takekawa and tries to catch him. She chases him to a dead end. Takekawa shoots Kazuha, but Heiji jumps in and takes the bullet for her. Luckily, Otaki arrives just in time to stop Takekawa. Kazuha cries even though Heiji's not fatally wounded.  Meanwhile, Yuki leads the police to X. While Miwako and the others chase X, Conan instructs Nanami to ambush on the deck. X takes a crew member hostage. Conan tells Nanami to rotate the cannon counter clockwise. Before X manages to escape, Conan uses the setting to kick a ball at him and knocks out the spy.  After the two spies are captured, they discover a suspicious voice-mail sent by Sasaura to Takekawa, which was recorded at 5:30 AM. Conan hears sounds of waves, some metallic clicking sounds and a man's voice in the record. Agasa calls him to inform that the paint wasn't from Hotaka, but from a sightseeing cruise, which left Maizuru Harbor and passed by Wakasa Shipyard. Conan deduces that the victim's body was dragged along the cruise from Maizuru Harbor to Wakasa Harbor. After revising all of the evidence he has gathered, Conan realizes he has been misled.  ===The deduction===  Conan races back to the CIC bridge, where the military and police believe that the case has been solved. Conan knocks out Mori with his stun gun wristwatch and using Mori, explains the truth about who murdered Sasaura. He points out that Sasaura's phone that Nanami had found earlier was a fake piece of evidence designed to throw off the investigators. That means that the killer boarded the Aegis destroyer midway through the investigation to plant the evidence. He reveals Kurata to be the person that killed Sasaura, using evidence from an audio file of a conversation made by Sasaura of the metallic clinking sounds to be the sound when Kurata's expandable baton struck his gun when he walked.  Realizing he's been caught, Kurata turns in his baton and gun, and reveals the whole reason why he's been covering up the death of Sasaura. In reality, Kurata first stumbled upon Sasaura when he was making his phone call to X, and after a foot chase and struggle, Sasaura accidentally fell into the sea when the rock he had been running on gave way. Later, he discovered the suspicious ship and then reported it to the JSMDF. After learning of Sasaura's arm being found, he realized Sasaura was the one that had died. He decided to request to be part of the investigation team in order to try to cover up his crime. He then planted Sasaura's phone to try to throw off the investigators. He is then arrested by the police for interfering with the investigation.  ===Rescuing Ran===  The Detective Boys, Yuki, and Sonoko suddenly rush into the CIC bridge, frantically shouting that Ran has been missing for a while. The police also reveal an important piece of news they had learned from the interrogation of X, in that X admitted he had thrown a high school aged girl proficient in karate overboard during a struggle. Realizing that it's Ran, the destroyer makes an 180 degree turn back to where they think Ran is located. But with the waves getting stronger and the sun going down, chances are slim they will be able to locate Ran. They try their best by sending out a helicopter to go investigate, but they are unable to locate Ran and everyone starts losing hope that they'll find Ran, with some breaking into tears.  Conan, who initially was shocked at Ran's disappearance, suddenly remembers that she is wearing a radio waterproof watch. Using Conan's advice, they use the destroyer's radar to try to track the location of Ran. However, even that appears to be not working. Conan has a flashback to the day he was last with Ran in Tropical Land and screams out her name in anguish.   Suddenly, the destroyer's radar manages to pick up Ran's signal, and the helicopter races over to her location. But with it being nearly dark, the helicopter has difficulty locating her. Conan remembers that Ran was carrying all of Mori's business cards, which are reflective, and tells the helicopter to follow the glittering business cards scattered in the sea. Eventually they manage to locate her, and pull her out of the sea in near shock but alive.  With Ran rescued, the destroyer finally heads back to the port. As Conan begins to leave, Nanami asks him who he really is. Conan innocently states that he's just a typical elementary school aged student, and runs off, leaving Nanami to ponder.

The Den (2013 film)
 The movie begins with Elizabeth logging into a webcam-based social media site known as ''The Den'', which allows users to chat with random strangers across the world, similar to [[Chatroulette]]. For her graduate project in sociology, she proposes to chat with as many strangers as possible and calculate how many meaningful conversations she can accumulate. The graduate board reluctantly gives her a grant, with the help of Sally, one of her friends on the graduate board pushing for her approval. She spends the next few months continuously chatting with strangers, much to the chagrin of her boyfriend, Damien, and friends Jenni and Max. Though most of her chats are quickly ended due to sexual content or scams, she accumulates plenty of data and is optimistic about the outcome of the project.  While chatting with strangers with Jenni, Elizabeth encounters a woman whose webcam appears to be broken. The stranger reacts aggressively to Jenni when Elizabeth is away from the webcam, and Jenni logs off. Afterwards, Elizabeth's account is hacked, and her webcam is repeatedly turned on without her permission. The stranger attempts to chat with Elizabeth again the next day while she is in a coffee shop, but logs off quickly when another customer approaches the webcam. That night, Damien surprises Elizabeth by showing up to her home in the middle of the night, and Elizabeth's hacked webcam records the couple having sex before the hacker sends the video to Elizabeth's graduate board. Later, Elizabeth is prompted to chat with the stranger again; the stranger reveals that they witnessed Elizabeth having sex, and later their webcam turns on and reveals the account holder bound and gagged before being murdered by a masked man. Elizabeth is shaken and immediately takes the video of the murder to the police, who acknowledge that it appears genuine but advise her that such snuff films are usually faked, and there is little they can do about it. Though Elizabeth later stumbles upon a disturbingly realistic depiction of a death during a game of [[Russian roulette]] that turns out to be faked, and her friends (including Max, who is a computer scientist) insist that it is a hoax, she remains unconvinced and is determined to solve the murder. However, both the police and other users of The Den turn out to be unhelpful. When she enlists Max to hack the account to see where it originated, he finds that it has been routed through countless proxies, and is untraceable.   Damien is abducted while chatting with Elizabeth, who has her back turned at the moment of his kidnapping and does not realize he is missing until she receives a bizarre call from his computer, showing his house completely empty. Though Elizabeth implores the police to investigate, they tell her that there is nothing that they can do. Meanwhile, Jenni is lured to Elizabeth's house by the hacker, who pretends to be Elizabeth and abducts her when she arrives. While harried from trying to find a way to reach Damien, Elizabeth receives an angry call from Sally, informing her that the video of her and Damien having sex was sent to the entire graduate board. Sally does not believe Elizabeth when the latter insists she was hacked, and informs her that her grant is suspended until further notice. Later, while trying to reach Jenni, Elizabeth is lured to her house, where she finds the power cut. Seeing water flooding from the bathroom, Elizabeth enters to find Jenni in the bathtub, her wrists slashed in an apparent suicide attempt. Though Jenni is alive when Elizabeth finds her, she dies soon after, and Elizabeth finds a suicide note emailed to her, ostensibly from the hacker posing as Jenni.   Elizabeth is further shaken when she receives a message showing the attackers stalking and entering a home owned by Lynn, Elizabeth's pregnant sister. Though Elizabeth notifies the police and calls Lynn to warn her, the message is garbled. The attackers bind Lynn and prepares to cut open her stomach, but abruptly leave, hiding the camera as they do so. Later, when the house is surrounded by police, one of the attackers returns and picks up the camera, revealing that they are either part of law enforcement or posing as a police officer. The attacker fixates on the father of Lynn's child, who she is separated from, irritating her. The attacker leaves and gets into a car and follows Elizabeth back to her home, where she is packing in preparation to keep her sister company. She receives a chat request from Max, which shows the lead detective entering Max's house, only to be murdered. Elizabeth calls for help from the officer guarding her, but she finds him murdered as well. She is attacked by a hooded figure hidden in her closet, but she stabs him repeatedly and flees, only to be apprehended by another hooded attacker outside.  Elizabeth awakens in a room of a nightmarish, abandoned complex, chained to a wall with a [[GoPro]] stapled to her forehead. A computer is in the room, forcing her to chat with the abducted Damien, who informs her that there are many other attackers. She is also shown a recorded video of Max being strangled with plastic wrap by the killers. Damien is then beaten and taken away to presumably be killed off-screen. Afterwards, another hooded man enters the room with Elizabeth, preparing to kill her, but she overpowers him and strangles him with her chain. Unlocking her shackles with his keys, she attempts to escape the dark complex, armed with a discarded hammer. She is chased by a number of killers, one of whom is a young man who she attacks, demanding to know where Damien is; he tells her that he is not there. She manages to escape to aboveground, bludgeoning other attackers before hijacking one of their cars, but crashes when blindsided by another member's car; she is removed from the wreck by the killers and dragged back to the complex.  The film cuts to another woman, Brianne, on ''The Den'' who chatted with Elizabeth at the start of the project. Much like Elizabeth's first interaction with the killers, she is lured to chat when one of the attackers pretends Elizabeth's webcam is broken. Brianne then views a recording of Elizabeth being hanged almost to death and then shot in the head by the killers. It is then revealed that the video of Elizabeth's death is also being viewed by a man surfing a website that features [[snuff film]] "narratives" of victims lured by killers exploiting ''The Den,'' and is preparing to pay for Brianne's "narrative" before being interrupted by his young son.

Dhoom 3
 In the year 1990, "The Great Indian Circus" owned by Iqbal Haroon Khan ([[Jackie Shroff]]) in [[Chicago]] gets closed when he is unable to repay his loan. Young Sahir ([[Siddharth Nigam]]), his little son, pleads that the two would soon turn the corner. But Iqbal's rejected and commits suicide in front of the heartless bank leader Anderson. Twenty-three years later, Sahir ([[Aamir Khan]]) robs various branches of Western Bank of Chicago. Despite all efforts of law enforcement, the robbery isn't foiled and he successfully gets away. Officer Victoria ([[Tabrett Bethell]]) calls ACP Jay Dixit ([[Abhishek Bachchan]]) and his partner, Ali ([[Uday Chopra]]), for help in solving the case. Jay baits Sahir into robbing again by making it known he's on the case and that the thief's an amateur. Sahir poses as an informant for Jay, and manages to gather information on the bank while giving Jay a lead to follow. Eventually, Sahir robs the bank and escapes, but Jay and Ali follow him. Jay, while hanging on a helicopter ladder, manages to shoot Sahir on the left shoulder before he disappears.  Sahir has a big premiere of a revamped version of The Great Indian Circus, with his female lead acrobat, Aaliya ([[Katrina Kaif]]), involving a trick with him disappearing in one place and showing up in another. The show is a success, but afterwards, Jay, Ali, and the police surround him, knowing he's the thief. Jai says the proof will be the gunshot wound, but when Sahir is examined, there is no evidence anywhere on his body. It is then revealed that Sahir has an autistic twin brother, Samar (also [[Aamir Khan]]), who helps him pull off his trick, helps him in planning and pulling of the robberies and he also shows it was Samar who sustained the wound.  Jay is fired from the case, but is encouraged by Ali to prove Sahir's guilt by going rogue. Jay eventually finds out about Samar, and sets about finding a way to corner Sahir. Samar, being mentally challenged, is kept in seclusion by Sahir. However, he allows Samar outdoors once a week, and Jay manages to befriend him during this time in order to perform his plan. Samar has fallen in love with Aaliya after performing with her in the circus, but cannot express it. This leads to a rift between the brothers. Jay tries to take advantage of this, but Sahir finds out and thwarts Jay's plan to stop them. When Sahir comes in the disguise of Samar, Jay reveals his true identity and assuming him to be Samar, tells him to surrender since he can give them justice. When Sahir reveals himself, he ties Jay to the track of a roller coaster and tells him that he used Samar for his own benefit. He switches the roller coaster on but Ali arrives in time to save him from being crushed. He decides the only way to catch the brothers is in the act of robbing. Sahir and Samar pull off their final bank heist, and escape. However, the following day, Jay manages to corner them as they're making their way out of town. They rob on 22 May. Samar is hesitant to run when Aaliya shows up, begging him to stop. Sahir surrenders to Jay, asking him to spare Samar. Jai agrees, but right after, Sahir attempts to jump off the dam. Samar grabs Sahir's hand, refusing to let him go. Sahir begs Samar otherwise, saying he can live freely with Aaliya. But Samar says that both of them are born together and should die together. Eventually, the two of them jump off the dam together. Western Bank of Chicago is shut down as a result of the heists, while Aaliya is shown having taken over The Great Indian Circus and still performing for it.

After an extensive search, their bound and beaten bodies are found the next day. The community and the police department are convinced that the murders are the work of a [[satanic cult]], due to the violent and sexual natures of the crime.

The Devil's in the Details
 Thomas Conrad (Joel Mathews), a supermarket manager and military ex-soldier, has trouble re-adjusting to a normal life in [[Nogales, Arizona]]. For over 6 months, he has been tormented by [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] from a terrifying experience serving his country overseas. Enduring issues with his family, he has also separated himself from his wife Selina ([[Jenna Lyng]]) and daughter Chloe ([[Ava Acres]]). Recommended to undergo rehab, he visits ex-[[Navy Seal]] and psychiatrist, Dr. Robert Michaels ([[Ray Liotta]]), who helps him identify the moments leading up to his condition.  One evening after work, Thomas accidentally rear-ends a vehicle. For the incident, he reimburses a Mexican named Bill Duffy ([[Emilio Rivera]]), financing several glasses of [[Alcohol beverage|booze]] between them at a local bar. After becoming drunk, spilling family information and submitting his car keys in for his safety, he passes out. Thomas awakes restrained in a torture room and finds he had been kidnapped. Working for a Mexican cartel, Bill reveals himself to be the culprit and along with Corbin ([[Jake Jacobson]]) working with him, forces Thomas through an ultimatum to cooperate with a cross-border [[Illegal drug trade|drug smuggling operation]], holding his wife and daughter captive at their home and threatening to kill them. With his father Richard Conrad ([[Raymond J. Barry]]) a [[judge]], his sister Claire (Nikki Deloach) a [[police officer]] and brother Kyle Conrad (Wes McGee) a [[Border guard|border patrol officer]], Thomas must have his estranged family commit the crime in a timely manner.  During a series of phone calls that detail the action sequences, Thomas succeeds to get his family into action. He comes close to becoming fatally wounded on many occasions where his time nearly expires to complete a task and is also threatened with being injected by a deadly chemical compound. Many of Bill's associates check in to keep watch, making Thomas believe he had been taken to Mexico. On one instance, he pleads help from a young man named Trevor ([[Lane Garrison]]) who enters the room, but he is revealed to be working with the others, soon bringing in Thomas's employee Olivia (Shi Ne Nielson) to shoot and kill her which infuriates Thomas. Eventually Thomas's sister Claire secures a large amount of drugs and money from a designated house, but when she transports it to the drop-off spot, she is apparently shot and killed. Soon, his father Richard calls Dr. Robert Michaels for help. Around this time, it’s revealed in a flashback that during his military duty with his comrade Hutchens (Albert Thakur), who was shot, Thomas inadvertently cornered and gunned down several armed kids in a home, causing his mental anguish. Robert arrives at Thomas's wife's house pretending to be looking for a plumber. Taking action, an armed Robert sneaks to the back and enters the house, ultimately killing two men to free the house of captivity.  Released from restraint and left weakened on the floor, Thomas finds the chance to stab and kill an armed Trevor with a sharp object. Taking his gun, he also shoots Corbin in the head. Escaping the torture room after killing them both, Thomas walks down a corridor noticing audio equipment on a table. Exiting out, he realizes he was kept behind the same bar the entire time. He approaches Bill at the counter and shoots dead the provoking bartender Frank (Arturo del Puerto). Bill reveals there was no cartel and everything was his elaborate plan – they spied on him, set up the minor car accident, got him drunk in the bar, held him against his will and used certain audio clips to play tricks on him, all to goad Thomas into getting his family to commit the robbery of a drug dealer, something Bill admittedly did to other victims previously. Also Thomas's sister Claire was killed because his father involved the police. Exacting revenge, Thomas injects a lethal chemical compound into Bill, who dies as a result. Leaving the bar and relieved to see outside again, Thomas drives home to see his wife and daughter waiting to greet him at the door.

Devil's Pass
 Five [[Oregon]] college students set off to find out what happened to the nine skiers who mysteriously died in the [[Dyatlov Pass incident]]. Holly and Jensen are co-directors, J.P. and Andy are expert climbers, and Denise is the sound engineer. After the film introduces the characters, Russian-language news discusses the students' disappearance. The Russian government recovers video footage but refuses to release it to the public; hackers release the footage, which forms the rest of the film.  In Russia, the students first try to contact a member of the initial 1959 expedition who turned back after the first day. However, the man has been hospitalised following a nervous breakdown. The administrators at the hospital claim that he is dead and attempt to turn away the filmmakers. In an upstairs window, the students see a man they assume to be the survivor; he holds up a sign in Russian and is dragged away by orderlies. At a bar, the students recruit Sergei, who translates the sign as a warning to turn back. Undeterred, Sergei introduces them to his aunt, Alya, who was part of the first rescue team. She tells them that a machine and eleven bodies were found at the site, not nine, as is commonly reported. The final two bodies had something wrong with them.   At their camp site, Holly hears howling. The next morning, the group notices barefoot prints in the snow that start and stop suddenly. Jensen claims the footprints are from [[yeti]], but the others claim that Holly is messing with them. After hiking further, they again hear howling and find footprints that lead to a weather tower. Inside the weather tower, they find a human tongue. Denise wants to leave, but the others convince her to continue. Jensen reveals that as a teenager he had heard the howling during a bad acid trip that ended with his yelling incoherently about demons. Holly attempts to comfort Jensen by relating that she has had recurring dreams about Dyatlov Pass, which she interprets as fate. Unnoticed by the group two mysterious creatures move through the snow in the distance.  The group arrives at Dyatlov Pass unsettlingly ahead of schedule. J.P. and Andy are further spooked when their navigational equipment malfunctions. Using a Geiger counter, Holly and Jensen are led to a bunker that locks from the outside. The door is already unlocked but frozen shut; they manage to open the door. They return to the camp without telling anyone about the bunker. The next morning, the group wakes to explosions that cause an avalanche. Denise is killed, and Andy suffers a bad fracture. After they fire a flare, Russian soldiers arrive, kill Andy, and chase the survivors to the bunker. J.P. is shot and wounded as they enter. Moving into a tunnel system a mysterious creature moves through one tunnel while the three enter another. Holly and Jensen leave the wounded J.P. as they explore the bunker. Inside, they discover evidence of teleportation experiments, a dead soldier who is missing his tongue, a camcorder that has footage of their present conversation, dead bodies stacked in a pile and files relating to the [[Philadelphia Experiment]].  J.P. screams, and Jensen and Holly find him under attack by teleporting mutants. The mutants kill J.P. and chase Jensen and Holly into a sealed room. There, Jensen theorises the tunnel that leads further into a natural cave is a [[wormhole]]. Unwilling to starve to death or face the mutants, Jensen and Holly choose to step into the wormhole. Since there are no controls, Jensen suggests that they visualise a nearby destination. Holly suggests the bunker entrance, and they enter the wormhole.    In 1959, Russian military personnel discover two bodies. Soldiers chase away Sergei's aunt Alya, who had just stumbled across the bodies, and recover a video camera. They drag the bodies inside the bunker, which is fully operational and manned. The commanding officer orders the bodies to be stripped and hung on meat hooks. As the soldiers leave, the mutated bodies of Jensen and Holly, identified by Holly's neck tattoo, begin to revive.

Ever resourceful, he sees an opportunity to free himself from debt and achieve the American dream in an unorthodox way.  When the house that he is living in goes into foreclosure, he meets with his friend, Ray Knight, a local drug dealer.  The two strike up a bargain:  Edmonds wants to get out of debt and Knight wants to "go legit."  Knight gives Edmonds the money to buy the house from the bank.  Edmonds then rents rooms at the property out at high prices, using the proceeds not only to pay back Knight, but purchase a number of other properties as well.  He buys a number of buildings and rents them out to immigrants, drug dealers and prostitutes, allowing them to operate there not only in exchange for rent, but for a cut of the proceeds from their illegal activities.  Knight uses Edmonds' real estate interests as a means of laundering drug money and hired thugs are used to ensure that the tenants pay up; Edmonds becomes very rich off of his ill-gotten investments.  During this time, he rekindles his romance with a former high-school sweet-heart, Donna Mitchell.  Gradually, he lets her into his criminal empire.

Dick Figures: The Movie
  A meteor speeds towards Earth while the characters are dropped off for school. After Blue accidentally walks onto the 5th graders' playground, Broseph has them beat up Blue. They are interrupted when the meteor crashes into Broseph, killing him. In the crater, Red emerges and beats up all the fifth graders. A grateful Blue promises to be Red's best friend no matter what happens. The movie goes through a montage of Red and Blue's time through school until the two graduate from university; Blue tries to be a conscientious student while Red lives a largely hedonistic, irresponsible lifestyle.  In the present day, Red and Blue are living together as roommates. Blue is in a relationship with Pink. When her birthday is approaching, Blue lies to Pink about getting her the best birthday gift ever, but he hasn't gotten her anything. Red suggests that they go see the Raccoon (Papa-san) at his pawn shop for a gift to get Pink.  The Raccoon tells them a story of when he lived in ancient [[Japan]]. His village fell under attack by Lord Takagami and his demon army. Raccoon, armed with the [[Sword]] of Destiny, singlehandedly fights the army, but falls into rage when he sees his wife get swallowed by Ocho Muerte, a large octopus. In his anger, he slaughtered the army and as he was about to deliver the death blow, Lord Takagami cursed him and split the Sword into three pieces. After the battle, Papa-san realized that he destroyed all of Japan while in a rage; for this he was banished by his kinsmen, never to return. If Blue finds the Sword and returns it to him, he will give Blue the perfect gift for Pink. Blue reluctantly accepts the quest after being called a bad name by Red and the Raccoon.  Hitching a ride on a booze cruise, Red and Blue arrive in Japan, meeting with the Raccoon's son, Son-san. They are directed towards a mountain, discovering the hilt of the Sword and a large map with the locations of the other pieces, the blade and a jewel. Their retrieval of the hilt awakens Takagami and his ninjas, who give chase. The duo escapes out to sea on a rowboat, and they eventually end up in the middle of nowhere during an approaching storm. Red questions Blue's reason for doing the quest for Pink who explains to Red that he loves Pink. Red reveals that the reason for beating up the 5th graders back when they first met was to impress Pink and the girls, inadvertently admitting that he's never thought of Blue as his friend. Betrayed by this revelation, Blue fights with him, angrily stating that their friendship is over. Lightning strikes their boat and a large wave sweeps them away. Meanwhile, Pink becomes increasingly worried about Blue's disappearance after calling him several times (his phone having been lost in the ocean).  Blue wakes up to discover that he and Red have been shipwrecked on a paradise island.They are rescued in a plane by alcoholic British pilot Captain Crookygrin, who has been sent to stop them from finding the Sword of Destiny. Luckily, Crookygrin has alcohol blindness, and cannot recognize them from pictures. They fly to [[Paris]], but are suddenly attacked by Takagami's ninjas. Blue fends them off with the plane's machine gun, however they crash, with Crookygrin being mortally injured. They are told to find the blade of the Sword at the [[Eiffel Tower]], and head into a restaurant where they find their friend Lord Tourettes. Outside, Mr. Dingleberry directs the police to follow them, who is revealed to have been taking orders from Takagami under promise of a reward, but is killed instead. The French police chase Red, Blue and Tourettes to the Eiffel Tower, where Blue unites the hilt with the blade while Lord Tourettes distracts the police. Red and Blue return to their hometown to find the jewel that goes with the blade.  Pink's birthday party has started, and Red abandons Blue to go partying, much to Blue's frustration. Blue decides to finish the quest alone, only to be captured by Takagami and taken to a nearby mountain/volcano where the jewel rests. Takagami reunites the jewel with the Sword, and has Blue thrown into the lava. Red and Raccoon arrive in the nick of time to save Blue and seize the Sword; a battle ensues with Red and Blue fighting the ninjas while the Raccoon fights Takagami with the Sword of Destiny. Cutting off his mask, Raccoon discovers that Takagami is really his father, Father-san. When asked by his son why he became evil and started killing people, Father-san replies that it was to avenge every person that ever died. Raccoon beheads him, and his remains fall into the lava, but his head morphes into Ocho Muerte, who heads off to attack their town.  Blue, Red, and Raccoon arrive at Pink's party before Ocho Muerte can hurt Pink. Ocho Muerte devours the Raccoon and is about to eat Pink too, but not before Blue rescues her with the Sword. Blue hangs over a ledge with Red holding him and the Sword, and Red pulls Blue up to safety. The Sword falls into Ocho Muerte's mouth and kills him in an explosion of light.  As the dust settles, Red apologizes to Blue for being a bad friend. After that, they find Raccoon alive, as well as his wife Mama-san. He reveals that he sent Blue and Red on the quest ultimately to rescue his wife, but as a result of the experience Red and Blue have reaffirmed their friendship. In return for Blue's bravery, Mama-san gives Blue and Pink the lotus flower that Papa-san once gave to her, blessing their love for each other.

The Dirties
 The film opens with the main characters, Matt and Owen, making a movie about a gang of bullies and the revenge that two victimized students take on them. This project, “The Dirties”, contains references to a score of other movies such as ''[[Being John Malkovich]]'', ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'', and ''[[The Usual Suspects]]''. Matt is shown being bullied.  Afterwards, Matt asks some members of the student body, as well as faculty about what someone should do if they are getting bullied. The students see that getting help is much more difficult than the faculty members perceive it to be. Matt and Owen are then shown editing clips together for their film, during the course of which it is revealed that a popular girl, Chrissy, had a crush on Owen in grade three. Matt and Owen shoot more scenes for their film project, and Matt has Owen attempt to look cool in front of Chrissy to see if she still likes him.  After finishing filming, the rough cut of the project is brought to the film teacher, Mr. Muldoon. The movie is revealed to contain Matt and Owen shooting and killing other students, as well as their teacher, in addition to containing a large amount of expletives. Muldoon demands the film be changed.  The edited version of the film is shown in class, and Matt leaves the room in humiliation, while Owen puts his head down while the rest of the class talks and laughs through the entire movie. On their walk home from school, Owen has a rock thrown at his head. As Owen is icing his head back at Matt’s, Matt suggests that the movie would have been better if the two had actually shot the Dirties within their movie with real guns.  Matt erases the script for The Dirties from his whiteboard, and proceeds to begin working on The Dirties II. Owen begins to practice the guitar more in attempts to win over Chrissy, and the boys are shown being bullied some more. Matt then acquires blueprints of his high school from the library for the school project he told them he was doing, which Matt points out was concerningly easy to do, and that his school ID was never even checked. Owen is then shown having a lunch dumped on him and being slapped across the face by another student.  The boys go out at night and create a bonfire, where they reflect on being bullied. Matt measures the lockers and takes photos, which Owen sees as suspicious. Matt says that it is entirely inconspicuous, and goes as far to tell Chrissy that they were planning a school shooting and gets Chrissy’s number for Owen. Owen calls Chrissy and says he is at a party, at Matt’s suggestion. The two go to a cottage and fire guns together with Matt's cousin, shooting targets consisting of milk jugs, melons, and a propane tank bomb. They bake a cake for Chrissy, and Matt gets upset with Owen for sharing it with the Dirties.  Matt is seen reading [[Columbine (book)|''Columbine'']], and checks out six copies of ''[[Catcher in the Rye]]'' “to seem crazy.” Owen gets concerned that Matt’s basement has plans and pictures of people he plans to shoot in the movie. Owen tells Matt that he is “always acting” and that he is not always in a movie.  Matt self-diagnoses himself as a psychopath, which he glorifies as he reads  [[Columbine (book)|''Columbine'']]. Owen, having had enough of Matt's attitude, berates him for his attitude towards things, leading to an argument between the two. Matt indignantly responds that Chrissy doesn't care about him and that she exists in Owen's life because of "his plans", but Owen takes a firm stand and asserts that Matt is jealous of him because he has no other friends. Owen then takes off his wireless microphone and leaves, much to the dismay of Matt.  Matt has a conversation with his mother where he asks if she thinks he is crazy. His mom says that crazy technically means that someone loses their ability to tell their thoughts from reality and the real world. Matt goes, alone, to the place where he and Owen had the bonfire and burns all of his notebooks. Owen tries calling Matt, who ignores it. Matt goes to the school with a duffel bag full of his cousins firearms entering through a stairwell. He then sets up cameras, shoots Josh and Jackman, and chases Owen. Matt enters a dark classroom where Owen is cornered trying to open a locked door, Matt simply asks, “What are you doing? It’s me!”

They run away from Lestor's club and Dom goes back to the local club where Evelyn was performing. There, Evelyn tells Dom he would only have spent three years in prison if he had ratted on Fontaine; because he didn't, he missed out on her childhood and her mother dying. Evelyn tells Dom that all she wanted was a real father. She turns her back on him and leaves. The next day, Dom sees Melody on her scooter and says he hasn't received good luck. She says it will come soon.  Dom visits the grave of his wife Katherine and apologises. He turns and sees his grandson Jawara sitting next to him. He walks Jawara out of the cemetery and takes him back to Evelyn. He asks if he can walk with them in silence, but she says they have to hurry home. She says Dom can take Jawara to school on Monday if he doesn't get drunk on Sunday night. As they walk away, Jawara waves to Dom, who waves back. He walks in the opposite direction and sees Paolina enter a restaurant with an older man. He enters the restaurant and grips Paolina's hand.

However being shrunk in small size, Gian and Suneo manage to slip into the door and recover the Magnificent Light which restored them back to their normal form. Even though the team reached, it was late as Dr. Pepura has already begun the process. However the process failed as the FullMetal when converted into PepuraMetal started to deteriorate. This resulted in releasing the monstrous protector which escaped from the prison and attack the group who were trying to control the man-made solar sun after the machine failed to stabilize the sun.

Don Jon
 Jon Martello is a young [[Italian American]] and modern-day [[Don Juan]] living in New Jersey, with a short list of things he cares about: "my body, my pad, my ride, my family, my church, my boys, my girls, my porn." Though he has a very active sex life, he is more sexually satisfied by viewing pornography and masturbating, which he claims allows him to “lose himself” in.  On a night out with his two best friends, Bobby and Danny, Jon sees Barbara Sugarman, a young [[Jewish]] woman from a more affluent background. Although she finds him interesting, she declines his offer for a one-night stand. He tracks her down on [[Facebook]] and invites her to lunch. There is mutual attraction, but Barbara insists on a long-term courtship, which proceeds for over a month without sex. She encourages Jon to take night classes to get an office job outside the service industry, and Jon indulges her love for romance movies, which he usually dismisses as unrealistic fantasy. They meet each other's families and Jon's parents love her.  The two have sex, but Jon is still dissatisfied. He loves Barbara and considers her body perfect, but still finds pornography more satisfying. While she sleeps, Jon watches pornography. Barbara catches him and is shocked. She prepares to leave Jon, but he denies that he watches pornography and claims it was a joke emailed to him by a friend.  Their relationship resumes, with Jon watching pornography primarily outside his apartment, concealing his habit from Barbara. He is caught watching a video on his cell phone before a college class by Esther, a middle-aged woman Jon earlier encountered weeping by herself. Jon politely brushes her off. Barbara continues asserting control, insisting that cleaning his own apartment, a task Jon finds satisfying, is not something she is comfortable with him doing. Barbara checks the browser history on Jon's computer, confronts him with proof that he has continued viewing pornography, then ends their relationship.  Jon tries to return to his old lifestyle, but ends up in a downward spiral. Esther continues reaching out, offering Jon the benefit of her experience. She lends him an erotic video that she believes has a more realistic depiction of sexual relations. He responds by initiating a sexual encounter in her parked car. She persuades Jon to try masturbating without pornography, but he is unable to. She feels the reason he is more satisfied with watching than having sex is that pornography is a one-sided affair. If Jon wants to lose himself, it must be to another person, a mutual experience. Esther reveals that her husband and son died in a car accident. With her, Jon forms an emotional sexual connection.  Jon tells his family about the break-up with Barbara: while they are displeased, his sister Monica states that Barbara was just dating Jon because she knew she could manipulate him. Jon meets with Barbara and apologizes for lying to her about the pornography. Barbara says she asked one thing of him and he failed. Jon replies that she asked many things of him and he could not meet her expectations. As she tells him to never contact her again, he sees how shallow she is and realizes he is better off without her.  Jon begins dating Esther. Even though she is considerably older and neither has any interest in getting married, Jon believes he really understands Esther and that they can get emotionally lost in each other.

In the story, four players of the "Rabbit Doubt" game Yū Aikawa, Eiji Hoshi, Haruka Akechi, Rei Hazama and a non-player Mitsuki Hōyama meet to relax together. They are knocked unconscious and awaken in an abandoned [[psychiatric hospital]] to meet Hajime Komaba and discover Rei hanged. The group finds Rei's cell phone and realize that they're playing a real-life game of "Rabbit Doubt". To survive, the wolf, described as the liar, must die.  Further into the story, the groups tries to find an exit and the wolf using [[bar codes]] found imprinted on their bodies. However, their chances are limited as each bar code will open only one door. As the story progresses, the "rabbits" are killed off one-by-one, until Yū discovers that it is Mitsuki who has been killing everyone. Mitsuki's father had agreed to be the guarantor on a friend's loan, but he was betrayed and saddled with an enormous debt, and he attempted suicide. For this Mitsuki explains that she wants to punish all liars to achieve her father's revenge, and thus she no longer trusts Yū, because he lied to her about not being able to hang out with her after school a week ago. He had been out with a female classmate to secretly buy Mitsuki a birthday present, but Mitsuki saw them together and assumed that they were a couple, even killing the classmate.   When Mitsuki leaves, Hajime reveals his real identity as a detective investigating teenage disappearances and hands him a [[scalpel]] to use as a weapon. Yū and Hajime successfully knock her out.  When Yū tries to open the exit with Mitsuki's bar code, Rei is revealed to be alive and she identifies herself as the actual wolf. Rei is seeking revenge because the media believed her [[hypnosis]] was a sham, causing her parents who supported her to commit suicide. In order to achieve revenge, she manipulated Mitsuki, using hypnosis to pretend to be her father, who actually died in the hospital, and giving her orders as 'him'. However, the love Mitsuki has for Yū occasionally overpowers the hypnosis. Rei releases the surviving players and calls the police. Mitsuki, who has fallen into a coma, is accused of the murders as there is no evidence of Rei being there. At the hospital, Yū receives a call from Rei. She reveals that the reason there was no evidence of her presence at the game site is because one of the forensics agents working the scene is one of her Wolves, and although Yū tries to contact Hajime, who is at the scene to find evidence, about it, he is too late to save him from being strangled. Rei also tricks him into saying a phrase that causes Mitsuki to awaken in her "wolf mode": 'For the ones I love'. In the last scene, she approaches Yū with a knife.  * '''Yū Aikawa''': a kind and caring student, he knows how to be cold-blooded but also takes action if necessary.

The Double (2013 film)
 Downtrodden Simon James ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]) has worked at his office for seven years, but he is ignored by his boss and colleagues. From his apartment he spies on a beautiful co-worker he admires, Hannah ([[Mia Wasikowska]]), who lives in the apartment opposite him. He sees her throwing away art and secretly retrieves and admires it. One night, Simon sees a man jump to his death from the floor above Hannah's apartment. He talks to detectives, who explain that if the man had jumped a few feet to the right, he would have been badly hurt but would have survived.  Simon's boss ([[Wallace Shawn]]) announces the arrival of a new employee, James Simon (also played by Eisenberg), who looks identical to Simon, which causes Simon to faint upon first glance. Assertive and charming, James is Simon's polar opposite. Much to Simon's annoyance, James not only gets respect from their co-workers but no one seems to notice that they are identical in appearance. James, on the other hand, does notice this and sees Simon's pain. Out of pity, he decides to buddy-up with Simon and give him advice about how to seduce Hannah. Hannah then asks James on a date through Simon. On the date, Simon pretends to be James, with the real James giving him instructions via earpiece. When Simon becomes nervous, the two swap places and James kisses Hannah, angering Simon. James asks Simon to take an aptitude test in his place and seduces their boss's surly, rebellious daughter, Melanie (Yasmin Paige), whom Simon was reluctantly hired to tutor.  Simon gets his revenge on James by revealing to Hannah that James is cheating on her with Melanie. Furious, James blackmails Simon for his apartment keys using explicit photos he took of himself with Melanie, knowing their boss will believe it is Simon in the photos. At work, Simon accuses James of being an imposter and is fired after going on a maniacal tirade. As he is about to kill himself, he sees Hannah lying unconscious in her apartment. He calls an ambulance and accompanies her to the hospital, where it is revealed that she not only overdosed but also miscarried (she had become pregnant after a sexual encounter with James). Simon then takes Hannah back home, relieved that she has survived. Still upset, however, Hannah states that she wanted to die and she suggests that Simon kill himself. She goes through Simon's jacket pockets and discovers earrings he had bought for her and her salvaged art.  Simon learns his mother has died and finds James at her funeral. Simon punches him and discovers that they share injuries; as James's nose bleeds, so does Simon's. He finds Hannah and tells her he wants to be noticed. He goes to his apartment and handcuffs the sleeping James to his bed, then goes to the ledge above Hannah's apartment, steps to the right, and jumps. He is badly hurt. Hannah runs to him and an ambulance arrives. Lacking medical attention, the handcuffed James appears to be on the brink of death as he lies motionless on the apartment floor.  Inside the ambulance, The Colonel ([[James Fox]]) and Hannah watch over Simon. The Colonel tells Simon that he is "special", to which the latter responds with a half-smile, "I'd like to think I'm pretty unique".

  [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Whis|Whis]] wakes [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Beerus|Beerus]], the [[God (male deity)|God]] of Destruction, from his long slumber and tells him that [[Frieza]] was defeated by a Saiyan.

Beerus, with Whis, then tracks down the Saiyan warrior [[Goku]], who defeated Freeza. On [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Kaiō-sama|Kaiō-sama]]'s planet, Goku proceeds to challenge Beerus. Despite having powered up to Super Saiyan 3, Goku is ultimately overwhelmed and defeated in two strikes. Disappointed by the subsequent lack of challenge, Beerus departs in order to seek out more powerful adversaries on Earth.  Beerus' arrival interrupts [[Bulma]]'s  birthday party. [[Vegeta]], who already knew about Beerus, because of a warning from Kaiō-sama, casts his pride aside in order to put Beerus in a good mood. Meanwhile, [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Pilaf|Pilaf]], [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Pilaf|Mai]], and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Pilaf|Shu]] sneak into the party in order to steal the Dragon Balls, but are not recognized as they have been turned into children; before the events of the film, they gathered all the Dragon Balls themselves and wished for youth, but [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Shenlong|Shenlong]] made them a little too young. Discovering the three of them, [[Trunks (Dragon Ball)|Trunks]] mistakes Pilaf for a monkey and fibs to Goten that Mai is his girlfriend, which leads to the trio being brought in front of the party-goers. When Mai accidentally drops the Dragon Ball she stole, she takes Trunks hostage, but no one seems concerned. A drunk [[Gohan (Dragon Ball)|Gohan]] dares Mai to shoot him; he deflects the bullets with one finger, but one of them hits [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Videl|Videl]]'s leg and another one hits Beerus' forehead. [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Dende|Dende]] heals Videl and discovers that she is pregnant with Gohan's child. Videl has been hiding the fact to surprise Gohan later and they do not reveal it to the others yet. When Beerus asks [[Majin Buu|Mr. Buu]] for one or two of the puddings he has, Buu eats all of them, angering the God of Destruction, who decides to destroy the Earth. Buu, [[Android 18]], [[Tenshinhan]], and [[Piccolo (Dragon Ball)|Piccolo]] attempt to fight Beerus, but are easily defeated. Gohan powers up and attacks Beerus, only to be taken down by a heavy kick. Vegeta tries his hand at defeating Beerus, but he is also taken down. [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Son Goten|Goten]] and Trunks fuse into Gotenks and attempt to fight Beerus but are quickly defeated as well.  Bulma becomes annoyed at the fighting ruining her birthday party, and yells at Beerus, before slapping him. When Beerus slaps her back, it sends Vegeta into a fit of rage, becoming even stronger than Goku; however, he is still defeated. Goku appears, having been watching Vegeta's fight and summons Shenlong to ask what a Super Saiyan God is. A Super Saiyan God once appeared on planet Vegeta to stop evil Saiyans, but failed because of the form's time limit. The dragon also reveals that they need the power of six pure-hearted Saiyans for one of them to reach the Super Saiyan God form. Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan God, a form far stronger than even the Super Saiyan 3, thanks to the power of himself, Vegeta, Gohan, Trunks, Goten, and [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Pan|Pan]] (from inside her mother Videl), fulfilling the prophecy once stated by the Oracle Fish. Goku confronts Beerus again and they wage an intense battle in space, right above planet Earth. The form gives Goku the power to resist Beerus, but he reverts to his regular Super Saiyan form due to its time limit. However, he learns the form's godlike feeling, which allows him to use some amount of Super Saiyan God power against Beerus. The two seem to be equally strong, but Beerus eventually decides to use his strongest attack. Goku stops the energy sphere, barely holding it back, but after [[List of Dragon Ball characters#Chi-Chi|Chi-Chi]] and Goku's friends appear in Goku's mind, he is able to absorb the energy sphere and briefly transform into a Super Saiyan God once again. However, Goku is overwhelmed with exhaustion, and at Beerus' suggestion, finally admits defeat. Beerus recognizes Goku's effort and reveals that he was the second strongest person he had ever fought, after Whis, who is also his martial arts master and is even stronger than he is. Goku also learns from Beerus and Whis that there are actually other universes with other Gods of Destruction. Back on Earth, Beerus decides to spare the planet and takes his leave with Whis after bidding farewell to Goku and his friends, who return to Bulma's birthday party. It is revealed by Whis that Beerus used only 70% of his power while fighting Goku.

The East (film)
   Jane, an operative for the private intelligence firm Hiller Brood, is assigned by her boss Sharon to infiltrate The East, an underground [[activist]], [[anarchist]] and [[ecologist]] organization that has launched several [[Eco-terrorism|attacks against corporations]] in an attempt to expose their corruption. Calling herself Sarah, she joins local drifters in hitching rides on trains, and when one drifter, Luca, helps her escape from the police, she identifies the symbol of The East hanging from Luca's car mirror. Sarah self-inflicts an arm injury that she tells Luca was caused in the escape so he can get medical attention for her. He takes her to an abandoned house in the woods where members of The East live and one of the members, Doc, treats her cut.  Sarah is given two nights to recover before she must leave the squat. At an elaborate dinner involving straitjackets, Sarah is tested and fails, exposing how selfishly she and many others live their lives. Sarah is caught one night when spying by the deaf Eve and has a conversation in sign language with her. Sarah tells Eve that she is an undercover agent and threatens Eve with jail if she stays with the group; Eve leaves the next morning.<ref></ref> Sarah is recruited to fill the missing member's role on a "jam", which is an old fashioned term for a direct action. After seeing the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical jam, compounded by her growing attraction to charismatic Benji ([[Alexander Skarsgård]]), Sarah gradually questions the moral underpinnings of her undercover duty.<ref name="aapress"></ref> Sarah reluctantly participates in The East's next jam and comes to learn that each member of The East has been personally damaged by corporate activities. For example, Doc has been poisoned by a [[fluoroquinolone antibiotic]] and his neurosystem is degenerating. The East infiltrates a fancy party for the senior executives of the pharmaceutical company responsible for Doc's poisoning and puts a strong dose of the risky antibiotic into everyone's champagne. The East announce this action via YouTube and over time one executive's mind and body begin to degenerate as a side effect of the antibiotic, revealing publicly the extreme risks of the drug.  Another East member, Izzy ([[Ellen Page]]), is the daughter of a petrochemical CEO. The group uses the father/daughter connection to gain intimate access to the CEO and forces him to bathe in the waterway he has been using as a toxic dumping ground. This jam goes wrong when security guards arrive and shoot Izzy in the back as she and the others flee. Back at the squat, because of his poisoning, Doc's hands tremble too much for him to perform surgery on Izzy. Sarah offers to do it for him and he tells her what to do. She manages to remove the bullet from Izzy's abdomen, but the effort is in vain and Izzy dies moments later. Izzy's death, however, is the emotional catalyst that allows the romance between Sarah and Benji to blossom. They make love passionately in the hours before Izzy is buried near The East's house. At the burial ceremony, Izzy's body lies nude in the earthen grave, decorated with blossoms in a symbolic nod to the burgeoning romance and the sea change it portends for The East.  Even though Sarah and Benji have grown close and Sarah implores him to just disappear, he insists that they go together to complete the final jam. Sarah refuses at first but finally gives in and the two begin a long drive, during which Sarah falls asleep. When she awakens, she realizes that Benji is driving her to the Hiller Brood headquarters outside Washington, D.C. He reveals that he has always suspected her of being a Hiller Brood operative, and that Luca also thought this, but brought her in as a test. Benji wants Sarah to obtain a [[Non-official cover|NOC]] list of Hiller Brood agents all over the world, which will be The East's third and final jam, to "watch" them. Having successfully obtained the NOC list using her cell phone's memory card, Sarah runs into Sharon in the hall. She confronts Sharon about the firm's activities, thus revealing her new allegiances. Sharon has Sarah's cellphone confiscated as she leaves the building. As Hiller Brood was sharing information about their activities with the FBI, The East's hideout is raided and Doc is arrested. He sacrifices himself to ensure the getaway of the remaining members. Sarah tells Benji she has failed to get the NOC list. Benji reveals he means to use the list to expose publicly all the Hiller Brood agents. Since they are undercover, however, it is likely they could be killed. Sarah chooses not to go on the run with Benji. She and Benji part at a truck-stop as Benji heads out of the country. In truth, Sarah has the NOC list (because it was not on her phone, she had swallowed the memory card instead). It is clear that her time undercover with The East has changed her. The film ends with an epilogue of her personally contacting her former coworkers (those undercover) and attempting to demonstrate what nefarious corporate crimes Hiller Brood clients want to protect. She hopes to change each operative's mind about their undercover activities and perhaps join her in ecological activism. She is paying tribute to the things in which The East believes and attempting to make a difference in her own way, without causing harm to anyone.  
Ek Thi Daayan
  Bejoy Charan Mathur also known as Bobo ([[Emraan Hashmi]]) is India's top magician, a star. But unknown to even his beautiful girlfriend Tamara ([[Huma Qureshi (actress)|Huma Qureshi]]), his life is falling apart. Hallucinations about his dead little sister Misha are casting a dark shadow on his life, threatening his very sanity. He is shown to be frequently drawn to his old vacant family apartment, where in the latest visit, he opens the lid of a treasure chest in one of the rooms, only to see a vision of his little sister Misha dead inside with a lizard crawling over the body. Tamara tracks him down to the apartment at the same time, taking him back to the room and opening the chest, only to find Misha's old doll inside. This latest hallucination proves to be too much, and Bobo is left with no option but to seek psychiatric help in the form of the rather odd Dr. Palit, who puts him under regression hypnosis to go back to the distant past, when Bobo was 11 and Misha 6.  A terrifying childhood story surfaces in which a dark supernatural power, in the form of a [[Daayan]] (witch) enters the lives of the two children and their father. Bobo and Misha are shown to live with their Dad in the family apartment with their mother having died some time earlier. Bobo is seen reading a book of Witchcraft from which he discovers the number 666 and uses it to travel on the apartment elevator to some unlisted floor at the bottom of the building, which he confides to Misha as being the entry to hell. According to Bobo, each building has its own hell, where the "bad people" of the building are consigned for eternity once they are dead. Soon after Bobo and Misha's trip on the elevator, a woman named Diana ([[Konkona Sen Sharma]]) moves into the building. Bobo is convinced that she is a witch and that she has surfaced from down under following his and Misha's trip on the elevator.  Diana immediately charms Bobo's single father and agrees to babysit the kids. She soon becomes a part of the family by marrying Bobo's father, although the paranoid Bobo still believes she's a witch. Meanwhile, Bobo learns from the book that the source of a Daayan's power is her plait, while that of a Pishacha is his neck. On Diana's birthday during the night of the red moon she convinces the kids to a game of hide and seek in an attempt to sacrifice Misha in order to restore her dark powers. As she begins to look for the kids, Bobo peeks through his hideout to see what she's doing. Bobo's father returns claiming to have forgotten his files and goes to look for them while Bobo goes to check on his sister. Finding the door locked Bobo begins to panic which brings his father to the door. Bobo's father knocks down the door only to find Misha lifeless in the trunk and a now undisguised Diana hovering over her body. Enraged, Bobo's father attempts to choke Diana but in vain as the now rejuvenated Diana kills him with her ear-piercing screams. Diana moves to the window to perform the rest of her ritual. But the distraught Bobo finds his father's dagger and cuts off Diana's plait, destroying her source of power. A shocked Diana begins to crumble into dust but not before she reveals that everything she did, she did for him and promises to return for Bobo.   Dr. Palit ([[Rajatava Dutta]]) dismisses Bobo's visions as just fantasy and convinces Bobo to do the same. After a brief outburst at the restaurant Bobo is knocked unconscious and taken to the hospital, where Tamara learns about his hallucinations. He then asks Tamara to marry him and they adopt the ten-year-old Zubin.  Everything goes well till the irresistible Lisa Dutt ([[Kalki Koechlin]]) enters their life during a magic show. Bobo suspects that the Daayan is back, but nobody believes him. In fact everybody loves Lisa. She even buys his old house, adding to his suspicion. Even Bobo starts thinking that it is all his imagination and that he is losing his mind.  But his suspicion turns to belief when during Lisa's house warming party, Tamara falls off the balcony. A critical Tamara is taken to the hospital. A few days later Lisa comes to visit Tamara. As she tries to unhook Tamara's IV bag, Bobo walks in and questions her in a fury. She claims that all she was trying to do is unhook the IV bag as it's empty. But the now aggressive Bobo tells her to get out. Afraid for his family, he calls Dr. Palit and who agrees to help investigate further.  Dr. Palit finds a very disturbing truth and calls Bobo telling him that he was right all along. But in the meantime, the Daayan appears as Diana in Dr. Palit's clinic and kills him. As Bobo reaches Dr. Palit's clinic he finds Dr. Palit dead and sees the eerie lizard lurking about. He finds a paper clutched in Dr. Palit's hand, on which Zubin's name is scribbled. He rushes to the exhibition where Zubin is supposed to be, only to find him missing. He then rushes back to his old home too look for Zubin but finds it empty as well. So he jumps into the elevator and descends into hell.  There, he finds Zubin lying on a sacrificial altar and the Daayan ready to sacrifice his son's life to sustain her powers. Bobo tries to save Zubin, when he encounters Tamara. To his surprise, Tamara is the Daayan, not Lisa. Then, Diana appears and tells him that he himself is a [[Pishacha]]. Tamara explains further by saying that no one could merely push buttons in an elevator and find hell. The fact that he is present with them, is the evidence of him being a Pishacha. He tries to fight her, but she is enraged and tells Bobo that it took her 20 years to be reborn and she won't let him kill her again. She knocks Bobo unconscious.  When he regains consciousness, he recalls the book about black magic and realizes that a Pishacha, good or bad can regain his strength as it is the night of the red moon. With his acquired powers, he fights Tamara and supposedly kills her. Soon after that, he returns his powers back to Satan. As he picks up Zubin, the Daayan now appearing as Diana reveals that only the pure and innocent can kill a Daayan and since Bobo killed her once before as a kid he is no longer innocent. Angry that Bobo denied Satan's gift Diana attacks him with her hair since it is the origin of her strength. Diana wraps her hair tightly around Bobo's neck to destroy his life force. Powerless, he tries to fight with her only to be flung around. Bobo grabs on to a pillar and an amused Diana once again immobilizes him with her high-pitched screeches but Bobo kicks the sacrificial dagger to the now conscious Zubin, and Bobo twists Diana and wraps her own hair on her mouth to stop the sound reaching Zubin's ears. Zubin eventually cuts off Diana's plait, but the crumbling Diana once again promises that she will come back.  In the end Zubin asks him whether everything that happened was magic or witchcraft. Bobo tells him that everyone has a little of both good and bad, but they themselves have to choose which side they're on. Bobo meets Lisa at the cafe and she asks him why he was so aggressive towards her initially. The screen fades to black as Bobo says, "I thought you were a Daayan".

Duniyadari
 ''Duniyadari'' opens with grandma Shirin ([[Sai Tamhankar]]) with a streak of grey accompanying grandpa Pritam (Sushant Shelar) to Pune, grandchildren in tow. The story traces itself back to presumably the late 1970s (seen through the bell-bottom pants on the gentlemen and the polka-dot dresses and '[[Asha Parekh]]' salwar kameezes on the ladies). Nothing is spelt out, but each character and its relevance in the plot is unveiled through the narrative that revolves around Shreyas Talwalkar ([[Swapnil Joshi]]). He is thrown into college in Pune on his mother's insistence. Under circumstances which are reminiscent of college life in the Hindi cinema of the 80s, Shreyas makes friends with DSP aka Digya ([[Ankush Choudhary]]) and his Katta gang. A do-gooder standing tall for friendships in the face of a creepy Saai ([[Jitendra Joshi]]), Shreyas becomes the voice of reason for the rustic gang.  He finds himself attracted to Shirin, but Meenu ([[Urmila Kanetkar]]) get attracted to Shreyas which creates a love triangle. Shirin is a student of Medical college and sister of Pritam. They are children of an MLA from Kolhapur, who hates Shirin, his own daughter. Shreyas accepts Meenu's proposal out of spite for Shirin (as she repeatedly turns down his advances) but is not sure about their future. Saai fixes his marriage with Shirin against her wish. Meenu later understands that Shreyas is deeply in love with Shirin. On Saai and Shirin's wedding day, Shreyas and his friends fight with Saai's gang. Finally Shirin gets married to Shreyas. She is aware that Shreyas is a patient of a deadly disease [probably cancer?] and has only few months of life in his hands. They are about to enter parenthood.  The film ends with a touching scene where all the friends, now in their early 50s, meet at the same katta of their college on Shreyas's birthday and express their feelings for him.<ref name="Duniyadari Plot"></ref>  
Eastern Boys
  Marek, a young Ukrainian immigrant in Paris, works the street in front of the Gare du Nord with his friends, other Eastern European 'toughs'. He is approached by Daniel, a French businessman in his 50s, self-consciously cruising at the station, and agrees to visit him at his home at 6pm the following day.  The next evening, Daniel is unnerved to find a 14-year-old boy at his door, declaring himself to be 'Marek'. The boy pushes past him into the apartment and proceeds to chide him for allegedly inviting him, a minor, to his home for sex. A while later the door knocks again and the boy lets in two other Eastern European young men. Soon, to Daniel's horror, they are joined by the rest of the gang, including 'Boss', their Russian leader. Daniel stands by helplessly as the men mount a full-fledged invasion. As they disperse around his well-appointed apartment, helping themselves to its facilities, Boss taunts Daniel about his helplessness and repressed homosexuality, before suggesting to him that it was he who invited them over. He soon launches a raucous party in Daniel's living room, as the other young men strip the apartment of his belongings.  Later in the evening the real Marek arrives, and joins in the dancing, seemingly unclouded by guilt. The next day, Daniel wakes to a trashed and emptied apartment.  As Daniel slowly begins refurbishing his home, and life seems to be returning to normal, Marek visits again. After Daniel yields to his repeated entreats for entry, and opens the door, the young man bluntly offers sex. Daniel agrees after some hesitation. They move to the bedroom, where Marek coldly lies on his side, as Daniel thrusts into him before quickly finishing. Daniel hands Marek a 50 euro note before he hurriedly leaves.  To his surprise, Marek returns a few days later. This time, after they undress, Daniel brings Marek to climax, before he silently climbs under the covers, and goes off to sleep. Daniel wakes to find Marek no longer beside him, but finds him in the kitchen, eating leftovers. Wordlessly, Daniel gathers items from the refrigerator, and they end up sharing a meal.  Over the following weeks, Marek becomes a regular fixture in Daniel's life, and gradually learns to speak French. While grocery shopping one evening, Marek tells Daniel that he grew up in Chechnya, that both of his parents were casualties in the war, and reveals that his name is actually Rouslan. Back at the apartment, Rouslan tells Daniel that he trusts him, before accusing him of not caring enough to trust him in return. That night, Daniel refuses Rouslan's advances for the first time. When that makes him upset, he tells him that he's 'such a kid'.  Shortly after, Daniel suggests that Rouslan look for a job, saying that he can't live only on his 50&nbsp;euros. He asks Rouslan to begin sleeping in a bed in the office, rather than in his own. Rouslan grudgingly complies but has a nightmare triggered by fireworks going off nearby. He wakes fearfully, and Daniel finds him dazed, in the living area. Rouslan breaks down, demanding to know why Daniel no longer wants him and afraid that he will make him leave. Daniel assures him that he will not, that he merely wants them to stop sleeping together. He reveals that he wants Rouslan to begin a new life, one that he can help establish. He invites Rouslan to move into his apartment and tells him to break ties with the gang.  Rouslan's passport (along with other gang member's papers) is held by Boss at a cheap, city-limits hotel that serves as the gang's base. Rouslan ventures to the hotel to retrieve it. Although he steals Boss' key to the locker that holds the documents, he is discovered by Boss while trying to find the locker. He is muscled back up to their floor, where Boss assaults Rouslan, smashes his cell phone, and has the other boys tie him up — leaving him restrained in a private storage room.  Daniel becomes worried when he can't reach Rouslan by his cell phone, and drives out to the hotel. When the concierge is unable to confirm Rouslan's whereabouts, Daniel takes a room, at her suggestion, on the second floor, where the immigrants are housed. As she escorts him to the room, they both hear a faint groaning coming from the storage room. Although the concierge brushes this off at first, when Daniel calls down to the front desk shortly after, she explains that the immigrants are managed by Social Services and, as such, are out of her jurisdiction. As Daniel becomes increasingly concerned, she suggests that they call the police. Daniel explains that he must find another way that will not result in Rouslan being arrested and deported.  Daniel ventures back into the hotel corridor and calls out to Rouslan at the door to the storage room. Rouslan, bound and gagged, responds with muffled cries. Realising he must act swiftly, Daniel moves his car into the underground parking lot, then uses the stair access to return to the front desk. With a sense of unspoken agreement, he and the concierge return to the second floor, where she uses her pass key to unlock the storage room. Having played her vital role, the concierge quickly returns to her work, as Daniel moves Rouslan, still tied-up, to his hotel room before the gang members can discover them.  When Boss discovers that someone has unlocked the storage room door and allowed Rouslan to escape, he accuses a junior hotel staff member, before punching him. Hearing the commotion, Daniel sees an opportunity and calls the police to the hotel. As the concierge confronts the immigrants, Daniel uses a fire extinguisher to break into the locker and retrieve Rouslan's papers.  The police arrive and swarm the hotel, while Daniel carries a badly beaten Rouslan down the stairwell to his car in the underground parking lot. As he is lowering Rouslan into the rear of his hatchback, Boss attacks the two of them, pushing Daniel aside and pummeling Rouslan with his fists. Daniel scrambles back to his feet before launching at Boss and choking him up against a concrete pillar.  As the police round up the last of the immigrants, Daniel and Rouslan drive away to seeming safety. Boss avoids arrest and discovers Rouslan's apartment key in the pocket of a leather jacket. Seeing an opportunity to exact revenge, Boss travels to Daniel's apartment, only to discover that just the shell of the rooms remain — Daniel and Rouslan have left the apartment behind.  Months later, Daniel seeks to adopt Rouslan. They are told that because of the unconventional circumstances of their association, they'll receive a decision in the fall. As they leave the courthouse, their solicitor encourages them to be patient, telling them that it is a routine adoption and that there is no reason for their plea to be denied.

Elysium (film)
  In 2154, [[Earth]] is overpopulated and polluted. Most of Earth's citizens live in [[poverty]], on the edge of starvation, and with little technology and medical care. The rich and powerful live on [[Elysium]]  a gigantic space habitat located in Earth's [[orbit]]. Elysium is technologically advanced, including medical machines known as Med-Bays that can cure all diseases, reverse the aging process, and regenerate new body parts. A long-running feud exists between the wealthy residents of Elysium and the citizens of Earth, who demand Elysian technology to cure their medical ailments.  Max Da Costa, a former car thief on parole, lives in the ruins of [[Los Angeles]], and works at an assembly line for ArmadyneCorp, a company run by its CEO John Carlyle, who had originally designed Elysium, and now supplies its weaponry, as well as the robots that police Earth. During an industrial accident at the factory, Max is trapped in a microwave kiln, and is hit by a lethal dose of [[radiation]]. After being rescued, he is informed that he has five days to live before succumbing to [[radiation poisoning]]. Desperate for a cure, he and his friend Julio seek help from a [[people smuggler|human smuggler]] named Spider to get him to Elysium; his only chance for survival is using a Med-Bay.  Meanwhile, when a trio of ships full of illegal immigrants from Earth attempts to reach Elysium and its Med-Bays, Elysian [[Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] Delacourt, an intense, cold, ruthless Frenchwoman, orders a [[sleeper agent]], Kruger, to destroy the shuttles. While two of the shuttles are shot down in space, killing everyone on board, the third shuttle makes it; but, once on Elysium, everyone on board is either killed or arrested and [[deported]]. Elysian President Patel reprimands Delacourt for her immoral and unsubtle methods and threatens to fire her unless she tones down her actions. Regarded as a loose cannon, Kruger is dismissed from service. Delacourt, vowing to protect Elysium and her own power, bargains with Carlyle to create a program that can override Elysium's computer core to give her the Presidency. Carlyle stores the [[Reboot (computing)|reboot]] program in his brain for transport to Elysium and encrypts it with a lethal protection program.  Spider agrees to get Max to Elysium if he can steal financial information from Carlyle. To assist him, Spider's men surgically attach a [[powered exoskeleton]] to Max. With Julio and a team of Spider's men, Max shoots down Carlyle's ship, and in the ensuing firefight with Carlyle's security droids, Carlyle internally bleeds to death after being shot. Max downloads the program to his suit's neural implant but realizes that the encryption makes it unusable. Alerted to the data theft by Carlyle's medical implant, Delacourt secretly reinstates Kruger and deploys him to recover the program. In the ensuing shootout, Julio is killed and Max is wounded. He contacts his childhood friend Frey, now a nurse, whose daughter Matilda has [[leukemia]]. Frey begs Max to take Matilda to Elysium to be cured, but Max refuses in order to protect them. Soon after Max leaves, Kruger, alongside two more mercenaries, Drake and Crowe, arrive and brutally interrogate Frey; and, when Kruger realizes Matilda is sick, they take Frey and Matilda prisoner aboard his ship while his drones hunt for Max. Delacourt orders an airspace lockdown over Los Angeles to buy enough time to recover Carlyle's program.  Max delivers the program to Spider, who discovers that the program can be used to make all Earth residents Elysian citizens. However, because the lockdown makes it impossible to leave Earth, Max bargains with Kruger to be taken to Elysium, unaware that Kruger has already found out that Frey assisted Max and is holding her and Matilda hostage on the ship. As Kruger's ship leaves Earth, Spider and his men take advantage of the lifting of the lockdown and also board a ship towards Elysium. Meanwhile, in Kruger's ship, a fight ensues and Kruger is grievously wounded by a grenade blast, which also disables the ship's engines. After Kruger's ship crashes on Elysium, Max is knocked out by Drake after a struggle while Frey runs to a house with an unconscious Matilda and puts her on a Med-Bay, only to find that it only works on Elysian citizens. At that moment, Crowe arrives and subdues Frey with a taser. Afterwards, Max, Frey and Matilda are taken to Delacourt, who orders the download of the program despite the fact that it will kill Max. She then orders Frey and Matilda to be taken away by Crowe, who locks them in a supply room.  After being restored in a Med-Bay by Drake and Crowe, a defiant Kruger kills Delacourt after she chastises him for his recklessness. On Kruger's orders, Drake and Crowe exterminate the Elysian political officers in order to seize control for themselves. Meanwhile, having escaped his confinement, Max, knowing that Med-Bays only work for Elysian citizens, resolves to use Carlyle's program to give everyone on Earth Elysian citizenship. After being ordered by Kruger to kill Frey and Matilda, Crowe enters the supply room and prepares to rape Frey first, but is killed by Max, who also kills Drake before freeing Frey and Matilda. Max then meets up with Spider, who has one of his members escort Frey and Matilda to a nearby Med-Bay. They then head for Elysium's core but are ambushed by Kruger, now equipped with a military-grade exoskeleton far superior to Max's. In the ensuing fight, Max manages to rip out Kruger's neural implant, rendering his suit immobile. However, Kruger tethers himself to Max's suit and arms a grenade with the intent of killing them both. Max rips off the tether and hurls Kruger over a ledge to his death.  Spider and Max reach Elysium's computer core, where Spider realizes that the program's activation will kill Max. Max personally activates the program, having spoken the last time with Frey via radio. As Max dies, Elysium's computer core reboots and registers every Earth resident as an Elysian citizen and revokes the citizenship of all the residents of Elysium. President Patel arrives with security guards but the robots refuse to arrest Spider, whom they now recognize as a citizen. Matilda is cured by a Med-Bay and Elysium's computer dispatches a huge fleet of medical ships to begin treatment of the citizens of Earth.

Bonzo, believing that Ender is inept due to his size and fearing Ender will cause the squad to fail, prevents him from training with the rest of the squad. Another cadet, [[Petra Arkanian]], takes Ender under her wing and trains him privately.   Bonzo becomes aware of this but does not take any action against Petra; he instead orders Ender not to train with her. Ender secretly persuades Bonzo to let him train, arguing this will increase Ender's chance of being accepted into another squad.    In the next match, Bonzo orders Ender to do nothing during the match, while the rest of the Salamander Army fights another team. However, seeing the team losing and Petra in trouble, Ender comes to her aid and helps the Salamander Army win. After the match, Bonzo is humiliated by the other students and threatens to kill Ender if he embarrasses him again.  Meanwhile, Ender plays a computerized "mind game" set in a fantasy world, which aims to present difficult choices to the player. In one situation, Ender creates an [[outside the box]] solution to overcome a seemingly unsolvable problem. Later, he encounters a Formic in the game, and then a simulated image of Valentine entering the ruins of a castle. Inside, he finds another image of Valentine, but as he nears, it turns into an image of Peter before the game ends.  These are noted as unusual additions to the game, which is seemingly being altered by Ender's interaction with the computer.  Graff promotes Ender to leader of his own squad, made from other students who have gained Ender's trust. They are put in increasingly difficult battles. In a surprise match against two other teams, including Bonzo's squad the Salamander Army, Ender devises a novel strategy of sacrificing part of his team to achieve a goal, impressing Graff.   Bonzo attacks Ender in the bathroom after the match, but Ender fights back, and Bonzo falls during the struggle, seriously injured. Distraught over this, Ender prepares to quit Battle School, but Graff has Valentine speak to him and convince him to continue.  Graff takes Ender to humanity's forward base on a former Formic planet near their homeworld. There, Ender meets Mazer Rackham, who explains how he spotted the shared-mind nature of the Formics to stop the attack 50 years prior. Ender finds that his former squad members are also here to help him train in computerized simulations of large fleet combat; Rackham puts special emphasis on the fleet's Molecular Detachment (MD) Device that is capable of disintegrating matter.<ref group="note">In the film, the MD Device stands for Molecular Detachment Device, whereas in the book, it has also been called the Molecular Disruption Device. In both instances, they are nicknamed the Little Doctor. </ref> Ender's training is rigorous, and Anderson expresses concern they are pushing Ender too fast, but Graff notes they have run out of time to replace Ender.  Ender's final test is monitored by several of the fleet commanders. As the [[Military simulation|simulation]] starts, Ender finds his fleet over the Formic homeworld and vastly outnumbered. He orders most of his fleet to sacrifice themselves to protect the MD long enough to fire on the homeworld. The resulting chain reaction burns over the surface of the planet, killing the entire population. The simulation ends, and Ender believes the test is over.  Then the commanders restart the video screens, showing that the destruction of the Formic homeworld was real, and Ender had been controlling the real fleet this time. Despite Graff's assurance he will be known as a hero, Ender is furious, as he feels responsible for the annihilation and believes everyone will remember him as a killer.  As Ender struggles with his emotions during sleep, he recognizes one of the Formic structures nearby that is similar to the ruined castle from the game. Believing it is trying to communicate with him, Ender races out towards it. He follows the path shown by the game and encounters a dying Formic queen. The Queen acknowledges Ender's role in the genocide of her race, and that he simply wanted peace in the long term and forgives him. The Queen gives Ender a Queen egg that it had been protecting.  With the war ended, Ender is promoted to Admiral, given a small ship, and left to his own devices. In a letter to Valentine, he confides that he is going into deep space, determined to form a new Formic colony with the queen egg.

Enemy (2013 film)
   A man attends an erotic show featuring a man and a woman, at an underground club, which culminates with the woman naked and on the verge of crushing a live [[tarantula]] under her platform high-heel.   Adam Bell, a single college history professor, is living a quiet mundane and repetitive life. He rents a movie, ''Where There's a Will There's a Way'', on the recommendation of a colleague, and spots an actor — who looks strikingly like himself — briefly in the film as a [[bellhop]]. Searching online, Adam identifies the actor as Daniel Saint Claire, the stage name of Anthony Claire. Adam rents the other two films in which Anthony has appeared and becomes obsessed with the man, who appears to be his physical [[doppelgänger]]. Immediately after this, Adam searches some boxes in his own house and finds a photo of someone who looks like himself, with some woman's hand over his shoulder. However, part of the photo is torn out, making the woman impossible to identify.  Adam stalks Anthony, visiting his agency and even calling him at home. They eventually agree to meet in a hotel room and discover they are perfectly identical, even having the same identical scar. Adam is taken aback by Anthony's direct personality and how exactly alike they are in appearance; feeling uneasy and uncomfortable by this he leaves abruptly. The next day, Anthony follows Adam and sees Adam's girlfriend Mary, whom he finds attractive. He starts following her to work without being noticed. Anthony plots to accuse Adam of having sexual relations with Anthony's wife Helen so that he, Anthony, can take his place with Mary over the weekend and sleep with her. Anthony demands Adam's clothes and car keys in order to get things even by taking out Mary for a romantic weekend getaway, promising to disappear forever afterward. Adam complies, and Anthony takes Mary to the hotel after work. Meanwhile, Adam in retaliation goes to Anthony's apartment and is immediately recognized by the apartment security guy who lets him in without the keys but also desperately asks if 'Anthony' could take him back to the underground sex club again.  Inside the apartment, Adam finds a framed photo on a shelf, which looks like the one he had found earlier in his own house, but now the photo is intact, and the woman is revealed to be Helen. Adam is trying to adjust as Anthony in front of Helen but she doesn't appear to notice the subtle differences or his shy behavior and asks him to join her in bed. She cuddles up to him and to his surprise asks, "did you have a good day at school". Later that night, Helen finds Adam in the living room crying and apologizing to her; she asks him to stay and they make love.  Back at the hotel, Mary panics during sex when she notices Anthony's marriage-ring mark and asks who he really is. She forces Anthony to drive her home; the two get into a fight in the car which results in a high-speed crash and the car being totaled, the passengers presumably both dead.  The next day, Adam dresses in Anthony's clothes and opens the confidential letter received earlier from the agency and finds the underground-club key, given only to select members. Helen gets out of the shower and tells him to call his mother, then enters the bedroom. Adam asks Helen if she is doing anything that night and tells her that he's going out, but she doesn't respond. As he enters the bedroom,  he beholds instead of Helen the now room-sized tarantula cowered against the rear wall. Adam, with a resigned look, sighs.  
Enemies Closer
 A plane carrying a mysterious cargo crashes into a lake near the [[Canada–United States border|US-Canada border]]. A group of American [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) officers and Canadian [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|Mounties]] prepare for a search of the plane and its cargo, but are attacked and killed by a man named Xander ([[Jean-Claude Van Damme]]). The Mounties are actually working for Xander, and they must complete their task within four hours before the next shift of agents arrives.  Ex-[[United States Navy SEALs|Navy SEAL]] Henry Taylor ([[Tom Everett Scott]]) is a forest ranger on King's Island near the border, where he runs the Ranger station/visitor's center. The sole other resident Sanderson ([[Christopher Robbie]]) is a resentful elderly man whom Henry infrequently checks on. While checking the nearby trails, Henry finds an injured woman named Kayla ([[Linzey Cocker]]). He takes her back to his cabin, and she starts flirting with him. He escorts her to her canoe, and she invites him to dinner later that night across the lake. Meanwhile, Xander and his men steal a boat, killing the owner and dumping the body.  While Henry is changing, Clay ([[Orlando Jones]]) knocks on the door, claiming that he had beached his boat on the island and is looking for help. Henry lets him in, but notices his odd behavior and a tattoo on his right arm. Clay pulls a gun on Henry, and tells him that his younger brother Decker was a SEAL under Henry's command who had been killed in the line of duty. Clay had heard that Decker was abandoned by his commanding officer, and wants Henry to pay for his death. Henry responds by explaining they had been ambushed, and he pulled out early to prevent risking the lives of more men. Just then, Kayla calls Henry's phone, telling him that she is running late. Clay shoots the phone and Henry takes the opportunity to attack Clay, who proves to be a skilled fighter and after a sustained fight, eventually knocks Henry unconscious. He drags him out into a nearby field and gives him a gun, ordering him to shoot himself. Henry refuses and says Decker's death wasn't his fault. Just as Clay is about to shoot Henry himself, Xander and his men show up on their boat, claiming to be ICE agents and questioning their presence. Henry sees through the ruse and runs. Xander's men fire at him, but Clay shoots back and manages to disable the diver. The gunfire is heard by two real ICE agents who are investigating the death of the others and head in its direction. Xander determines that his driver won't survive and smothers him to death. He recognizes Henry as ex-military, and resolves to force him to act as their diver so they can retrieve the plane's contents, a large shipment of [[heroin]].  Two of Xander's men arrive at Henry's cabin and find no one. On Xander's orders, they sink his boat. Henry, meanwhile, goes to find his stashed kayak, but is intercepted by another one of Xander's men, who shoots the kayak. The assailant, however, is later beaten and loses consciousness. While walking, Henry explains to Clay that the Mounties who pursue them are drug dealers who had military training, yet Clay chides him into not talking about his brother again. Xander later kills the ICE agents one by one while they search. As Xander's other men search for Henry and Clay, the two men seek refuge by breaking into Sanderson's house. Sanderson initially resists their plea for help but later gives in when they tell him that he and they are the dealers' targets while his house is shot at. In desperation, he tells them to escape through the back door while staying behind.  Later Sanderson is wounded while he tries to drive Xander and his men away, then he is captured. Xander questions him about Henry and Clay's whereabouts, but when Sanderson fails to answer their questions correctly, he stabs him dead. He reminds Henry to give him the stash of heroin or his family will die. In the forest, Henry lights a giant bonfire as a diversion then goes away. The assailant who has shot Henry's kayak later awakens and attacks Clay, who then kills him with a rock. As Xander's man Saul finds Henry, they engage in combat. Henry appears to be losing the fight, but is helped by Clay who stabs Saul in the neck. The two men then try to find Xander after pulling another henchman from a booby trap and questioning him, then Clay punches him to sleep.  Meanwhile, Kayla returns after Henry fails to meet with her for dinner. Xander captures her and calls for Henry to hand over the drugs. Henry is also captured and he pleads with him not to harm her while he is being led to the boat. Kayla is tied up and her mouth is gagged with a strip of duct tape. Unknown to both Henry and Clay, Kayla secretly has been on Xander's side all along and tries to hide her involvement by pretending to be Henry's girlfriend and using her capture as a ploy to reach Henry. Xander reveals he was a soldier like Henry aboard the boat, only that he has gone bad. When Clay finds Kayla to rescue her, he assaults and eventually subdues her captor. As Clay unties Kayla and removes the strip of duct tape which was used to gag her mouth, she displays her treachery when she points the gun at Clay, saying Xander paid her to keep anyone out of his activities. Feeling confounded, he dares her to shoot him, so he jumps into the water to save himself when she opens fire at him, then looks for him. As forest police come to ask Kayla about where Henry is and what really happened, she says she has just arrived and wants to fish in the morning, only for her to shoot them dead when Clay yells to warn them. Clay and Kayla struggle, but he knocks her out with a gun. Henry manages to find the heroin. Kayla later awakens and while Clay holds her at gunpoint, Xander tells her on the transceiver to meet him and retrieve the drugs, and in return, she falsely convinces him that Clay has been dealt with.  While Henry accompanies Xander on land, Kayla cries for help, still at gunpoint; Clay relays her betrayal to Henry by yelling at him to drop the gun, to no avail. The villains fight back as Kayla and Clay grapple, yet he lets her go to face Xander. Next, Kayla attempts to strangle Henry, but he manages to overpower her. Xander subdues Clay by stabbing him in the leg. Henry challenges Xander to run after him and catch the drugs. When Xander realizes Kayla is unable to take Henry out, he snaps her neck. The two men engage in a struggle in the forest. They fall from a tree and later they continue fighting on Xander's boat. Xander tries to hit Henry, who is hanging on to the boat, with an anchor but it hits the fuel tank, leaking fuel. Henry catches a flare and lights it, then throws it at the path of the boat. The boat explodes, killing Xander and burning the stash. Clay then pulls Henry, who forgets that Kayla is dead, from the shore.

However, in December 21, 2010, Saku, who has a weak heart, succumbs to his illness while he is about to send off Michiru, who will go to [[England]] and only tells him the fact through a letter, which might be indirectly caused by Shuta since he is the one who gives the letter and takes Saku's bike to attend a basketball match he does not win. Since then, Shuta and Michiru drift apart and has been not seeing each other. In December 20, 2012, Shuta attends Saku's death anniversary and takes Saku's "You're a Time Traveler" watch, supposedly capable of rewinding time, as a memento. Shuta takes a train home while wearing the watch and is surprised when he finds out that he has returned in time to December 20, 2010, the day before Saku's death.  Shuta and Saku are called by Michiru to clean off the school. To appease Michiru, Shuta agrees to put up [[prism]]s in the lab's windows to create a [[rainbow]] effect. However, when a fellow basketball player hits him with a ball, Shuta is suddenly sent back to the morning of December 20, 2012. He gets to the school to meet with Prof. Matsudo, his eccentric former science teacher, and discovers that the future has been altered slightly thanks to him agreeing on Michiru's request.  On the third time he goes back in time, Shuta is forced into a shamanistic ritual by Matsudo to meet with Kyoko, the spirit of a girl who committed suicide in the school. He learns that Kyoko is not dead in the strictest sense; she is merely stuck as a "time prisoner" since [[World War II]] and cannot be seen by anyone. Kyoko warns Shuta not to mess with the flow of time, or he will face consequences. However, she agrees to help him through "Jack Fin" technique: by keeping up to date with the current trend and not forcing himself too much. After learning that Kyoko has never seen fireworks in the school before, Shuta decides to set off fireworks in the school yard that night and invites Saku and Michiru to attend. During the celebration, he tries to make Michiru confess her plans to move overseas, but she refuses to admit.  At midnight, Shuta comes back to the future but discovers that by letting time flow to December 21, he is also thrown into December 21, 2012. He is also shocked to find Saku's mother, Yoshie collapse at her home, which he realizes are what Kyoko's words mean. Kyoko, who has taken the watch, begs him not to interfere with time again, or else he will be like her: a time traveler who has changed something to an extent that she is forgotten by everyone because the memories of herself and everyone connected to her were replaced by a new one. Nevertheless, Shuta chooses to save Saku and Kyoko agrees to give the watch back to him.  Going back in time for the fourth time, Shuta is thrown into the afternoon of December 21, 2010, right before his basketball match. He is able to score perfectly, but is anonymously confronted by another self of him (seemingly the one stuck at the school like Kyoko), who wishes him a better future. Shuta subsequently races towards the train station with Saku in tow and is able to meet with Michiru. There, Shuta reads Michiru's letter and is surprised when he learns that Michiru does not love Saku, as he previously thought, but ''him''. Thanks to being able to send off Michiru, Saku is saved, but everyone's memories of Shuta, except that of Kyoko's, are erased  Years later, Shuta is shown at the beach picking a prism when he stumbles upon Saku and Michiru.

Escape from Planet Earth
  Scorch Supernova ([[Brendan Fraser]]) is a heroic alien on a mission to rescue captured babies from the Gnarlachs. He rescues them just in time before the Gnarlachs wake up. Scorch returns to Planet Baab where he is known as a famous hero and works at BASA with his older brother Gary ([[Rob Corddry]]). Gary's son Kip ([[Jonathan Morgan Heit]]) is a big fan of his uncle Scorch. Soon, Gary receives a message from Lena Thackleman ([[Jessica Alba]]), the head of BASA, that Scorch will be sent to the "Dark Planet" (the Baabians' name for [[Earth]]) due to a SOS call. Scorch decides to go to the Dark Planet, as he already made a press conference and contacted his sponsors. However, Gary opposes as Scorch is not serious and no alien has ever returned from the Dark Planet. After further arguing, Gary finally says that he won't be helping Scorch and quits BASA before Scorch himself fires him. Gary then goes home to his wife Kira ([[Sarah Jessica Parker]]) and Kip only to find out that Scorch has already gone to the Dark Planet, while Kip is watching it on live TV in excitement.  Scorch arrives on Earth and lands in the desert and finds a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store but mistakes an [[airdancer]] for a dying being. Scorch is then tranquilized and captured by Shanker Saunderson ([[William Shatner]]), the malevolent general of the US Army, and is taken to "[[Area 51]]" where aliens from other planets are held. Knowing that this has happened, Kip wants to go rescue Scorch but Gary discourages him. Kip is angry and goes to his room. Gary goes to Kip's room to apologize only to find him going to try and save Scorch. He rushes to BASA with Kira wearing his rocket boots. They arrive to find Kip is about to take off in a ship.  Gary manages to cancel the launch sequence at the last minute, but re-activates the sequence so he himself can rescue Scorch. As soon as he arrives, his ship immediately activates a self-destruct sequence, but Gary manages to escape. He arrives at the same store that Scorch arrived at earlier. Gary enters the store, but is spotted by its two owners Hawk ([[Steve Zahn]]) and Hammer ([[Chris Parnell]]). Although both feared Gary, the two men realize that Gary isn't hostile and offer him a [[Slurpee]] giving Gary a [[brain freeze]]. Afterwards, Shanker's men break into the store, tranquilzes Hawk and Hammer, and capture Gary, taking him to Area 51.  Gary is taken to Shanker's office where he is quickly removed after Shanker receives an incoming call from Lena who's revealed to be an ally of Shanker's as she has sent him a powerful source known as "blubonium". Gary is placed in a cell hall with other alien geniuses including Doc ([[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]]), Io ([[Jane Lynch]]), and Thurman ([[George Lopez]]) who tell Gary that various human technology has been invented by them for Shanker to rip off and sell to all of Earth so he will release them from Area 51. With these technologies, Shanker had made deals with companies like [[Apple Inc.]], [[Facebook]], [[Google]], and [[Pixar]]. Gary reunites with Scorch, but is again annoyed by his conceited behavior. After a food fight in the cafeteria, the aliens make their way to "the peace shield." Meanwhile, Lena captures Kira, who stayed at BASA and tried contacting Gary on his rescue mission. Lena then reveals her plan to give a lifetime supply of blubonium to Shanker.  After Shanker reveals the blubonium, Gary unintentionally provokes Scorch into stealing it after stating its dangerous power. While being chased, Scorch destroys the blubonium, causing Shanker to freeze him and orders Gary to fix the blubonium and reveals that he's going to destroy all alien planets in the universe with a laser ray using the blubonium. Shanker thinks that all aliens are hostile just because a trio of [[grey alien|grey aliens']] spaceship (accidentally) killed his father ([[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) in 1947. Gary fixes the ray with help from his new friends, but Shanker goes back on his promise and freezes him instead. The other aliens discover Shanker's true intentions when he tries to destroy Baab with the laser ray and [[mutiny]], knocking out Shanker's henchmen. It is revealed that Gary did not put the machine together completely and it malfunctions, destroying itself before it can destroy Baab. With Gary and Scorch released from their icy prisons by the machine alongside the other frozen aliens, the brothers, Doc, Thurman, and Io escape Area 51. With help from Hawk and Hammer, Gary and company locate Scorch's spaceship in a [[trailer park]].  Meanwhile, back on Baab, Kip frees his mother Kira, who stops and subdues Lena after the latter took off with the blubonium shipment. [[US Air Force]] jets chase Gary's saucer, but Kip guides him through and manages to evade and destroy the jets. However, Shanker, wearing Scorch's robotic suit, uses a tractor beam to stop the ship in midair.

Epic (2013 film)
 17 year old Mary Katherine, or M.K., moves in with her eccentric [[scientist]] father Professor Bomba, who has been searching for tiny humanoid soldiers called Leafmen. They protect the forest that Bomba lives near from wicked creatures called Boggans and their malevolent leader Mandrake. An independent young soldier named Nod decides to quit, much to the ire of the no-nonsense Leafmen leader Ronin.  The queen of the forest, Queen Tara, must choose an heir to her throne and goes out to a field of leaf pods, guarded by a laid-back [[slug]] named Mub and a wannabe Leafman [[snail]] named Grub. Immediately after she chooses a pod, the Boggans attack. Tara flees the area with the pod, and though her bodyguards do their best to protect her, they are soon overwhelmed by the sheer number of Boggans. Eventually, Ronin arrives for her and the pair fly off on his [[hummingbird]] mount. They are then attacked by Mandrake and his son Dagda. Dagda is killed by Ronin, but the former shoots Tara beforehand.  Meanwhile, M.K. decides to leave after having an argument with Bomba about his research. Before she can leave, Bomba's dog Ozzy runs into the woods. While looking for Ozzy, M.K. sees Tara falling. Dying, Tara gives her the pod and uses her magic to shrink her. She tells M.K. to take the pod to a [[Glowworm]] named Nim Galuu before she dies, and M.K. joins Ronin and the Leafmen, along with Mub and Grub. Ronin discovers that Nod has entered a race against other creatures and bugs on birds. Nod goes back on a deal with a tough [[American toad|toad]] named Bufo to [[Match fixing|throw the race]]. Before Bufo and his two henchmen can feed Nod to a snake, Ronin intervenes and orders them to leave. A reluctant Nod joins him, M.K., Mub, and Grub after hearing about Queen Tara's death, which Bufo overhears.  Ronin, Nod, M.K., Mub, and Grub eventually track Nim Galuu down. He then leads them down to the scroll library, where M.K. discovers Tara's brief message before shrinking her, and a message that will get her back to normal size. When Ronin leaves, Nod takes M.K. on a [[deer]] ride and they begin to fall in love. Meanwhile, Mandrake has had the Boggans bring Bufo to him, finding out the location of the pod. Mandrake goes to Nim Galuu's place to steal the pod, which, if it blooms in darkness, will help Mandrake destroy the forest. He takes the pod and kidnaps Mub and Grub. Ronin scolds Nod for not being there to protect the pod. To get into Boggan territory undiscovered, M.K., Nod, and Ronin set out to Bomba's house to get some disguises, where M.K. learns that the Leafmen have deliberately been leading Bomba off their trail. Bomba sees that he has visitors and captures M.K., fainting when he sees her. M.K. marks the location of Moonhaven on a map Bomba has made of the forest before rejoining Nod and Ronin.  When they reach the Boggan land Ronin distracts the Boggans while M.K. and Nod rescue Mub, Grub, and the pod. Mandrake discovers them and orders the Boggans to stop them. M.K., Nod, Mub, and Grub escape alive, but Ronin sacrifices himself to ensure their escape. Before the [[full moon]] can sprout the pod at Moonhaven, Mandrake's [[bat]]s block the light, causing the pod to begin sprouting in darkness. The Leafmen set out to fight the Boggans; M.K. tries to get help from her father by visiting his various cameras he had set in the forest. However, upon regaining consciousness, Bomba believes that he didn't really see M.K. and that he has been insane all these years, and shuts down all his cameras. He changes his mind when he sees the red push-pin that M.K. had put on his map.  Bomba is overjoyed to see that he has been right and he follows M.K. to Moonhaven. M.K. uses Bomba's [[iPod]] to make bat sounds, luring Mandrake's bats away. Meanwhile, Mub and Nim Galuu try to stop Mandrake from reaching the pod, but are unsuccessful. Just then, Ronin appears, bearing scars and bruises from the Boggans. Mandrake manages to outdo him, but is defended by Nod, who finally realizes the importance of teamwork. Before Mandrake can obtain his victory, the pod blooms in moonlight, defeating the Boggans, and sealing Mandrake into the burl of a nearby tree.  The chosen heir is the flower child who helped save Tara earlier in the film. Grub becomes a Leafman, Nod and Ronin reconcile, and Nod and M.K. kiss before M.K. is returned to her original size. After reuniting with Bomba and becoming his assistant, the human family still keeps regular contact with their small friends as they continue the research of their world.

Escape from Tomorrow
 A montage shows visitors on the rides at [[Walt Disney World Resort]] and the many visuals and [[animatronics]] that accompany the rides. It ends with a man losing his head while riding [[Big Thunder Mountain Railroad]]. On the last day of a family vacation at Walt Disney World, Jim White gets fired by his boss during a phone call on the balcony of the [[Disney's Contemporary Resort|Contemporary Resort Hotel]] with his family. He keeps the news to himself to avoid spoiling their vacation. The family leaves their room and takes the monorail to the park, alongside two French teenagers, Isabelle and Sophie.  The chance encounter with the girls piques Jim's interest, and he makes subtle efforts to pursue them unbeknownst to the rest of his family. He has disturbing hallucinations during the rides, such as the evil faces of [[Audio-Animatronics|audio-animatronic]] characters and his family verbally abusing him. After fighting with his wife Emily, Jim decides not to take his son Elliot to [[Space Mountain]] (which gives Elliot [[motion sickness]]) in order to keep chasing after the French girls. He then takes his daughter Sara to the [[Magic Kingdom]] so he can stalk Isabelle and Sophie while Emily and Elliot return to the hotel. Later, the son of a wheelchair-bound man, whom Jim spotted earlier, shoves Sara, who scrapes her knee. Jim takes her to the park nurse to have Sara's knee treated. Jim and Sara meet a mysterious woman with a glimmering amulet necklace which hypnotizes Jim. He blacks out and regains consciousness mid-coitus with the woman in her room. Afterwards, she claims that the parks' wholesome, costumed princesses are actually part of a secret prostitution ring that services rich Asian businessmen. Increasingly unnerved, Jim and Sara join his wife and son at the pool, where Jim sees the French girls. He swims closer to converse with them, but Emily sees and berates him.  His family returns to [[Epcot]], where the tension between Jim and Emily comes to a head after a drunk Jim vomits while on the [[Gran Fiesta Tour Starring The Three Caballeros|Gran Fiesta Tour]]. Spotting the French girls, Emily argues with Jim about his obvious interest in them and slaps Sara. Embarrassed, she returns to the hotel with Elliot, leaving Jim and Sara to ride on the [[Soarin' Over California|Soarin']] attraction at Epcot, where Jim imagines a beautiful topless woman superimposed over the ride's video footage of landscapes, who promises they will be together soon. After the ride, Sophie approaches and invites Jim to come with them. When Jim refuses, Sophie spits on his face and she walks off, Jim notices that Sara disappeared and searches frantically for her, but the park guards use a [[taser]] to knock him unconscious.  Jim awakes in a secret detention facility under Epcot's Spaceship Earth, where he sees video screens displaying pictures of the woman he imagined on the Soarin' ride and other images of events that happened earlier. A scientist enters and activates a Spaceship Earth resembling helmet, which covers Jim's head and scans him while images of what the scientist refers to as "the real Jim" appear on the screens, being himself dressed differently and apparently part of another family. The scientist discusses Jim's flights of fantasy and imagination and reveals that he is part of the experiment by the [[Siemens]] Corporation ever since he first went to the theme park as a child with his father. His boss is in on the conspiracy and his firing was all part of the plan, and so was the closure of the [[Buzz Lightyear attractions|Buzz Lightyear ride]] just as he and Elliot approached the boarding area, much to Elliot's distress. The scientist also tells Jim that he had turned in Elliot to them, like Jim's father had done to him as a child.  After damaging the instrument panel with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who turns out to be an [[android (robot)|android]], Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a [[Snow White (Disney character)|Snow White]] costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and [[hairballs]], which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but he closes the door on him.  The next morning, Emily finds Jim's corpse, which now has cat eyes and a grinning face. Disney cleaning staff arrive to remove proof of death and fill Elliot's head with false memories of riding the Buzz Lightyear attraction. They take Jim's body to the unmarked white van from the opening. Meanwhile, the valet from the video screens greets the "real Jim", accompanied by the fantasy woman and a young girl, before they check into the hotel as the valet watches the van drive away.

Ephraim's Rescue
 In 1891, at Salina, Utah Territory, an elderly Ephraim Hanks (Richard Benedict) comes to bring Sister Johnson (Liz Christensen) back from the dead and gives her a blessing, saying that she will bear and raise seven daughters, and that there will be a time when they will all stand together and be a great joy to her. She tells this to her husband (Joshua Cooper), who is amazed at both her story and the fact that she is revived.  50 years earlier, Ephraim (Darin Southam), as a rebellious young man in Ohio, goes on a ride on his father's carriage and puts the horse, Lindy, out wet. When his father, Benjamin (Ken Eklof), discovers this, he is not happy and knocks Ephraim off his bed and yells at him and breaks stuff in his rage. One Sunday, while his family goes to church, Ephraim decides to venture off on his own and sort out what life is really about.  Three years later, Ephraim is back where he started his journey, at the port in Boston. There, he meets a man in a grey tweed suit ([[Rick Macy]]), who questions where he is from and how long it has been since he left. When Ephraim replies he is from Ohio and has been gone for three years, the man tells him three years is a long time from those he cherishes. After he leaves, the man mysteriously disappears. Ephraim finally sees the error of his ways and decides to forgo the navy and return home to make amends with his parents. However, when he gets there, he learns that his father has passed away, and that his brother Sidney (Daniel Sappenfield) has joined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. Believing Sidney to be in trouble, his mother, Martha (Nancy Peterson), sends Ephraim to go and "save" him.  When Ephraim goes to look for Sidney, he lays on the ground while a rattlesnake crawls over him, but fortunately, he is unharmed. As he takes his horse, Acorn, into the forest, he comes to a fork in the path and wonders which way he should go. As he took the path on the right, a stupor enters his mind and he decides he should have taken the path on the left. As he reaches the end, he comes to a river and prays for the first time in years. The Lord tells him he should return home, and Ephraim is very happy to do so; Sidney had also been told by the Lord (in a dream) that he needed to return home.  With both Ephraim and Sidney home, their mother demands Ephraim invite Pastors Reed and Robbins Thursday next, wanting no more "Mormon rubbish". When the two reverends arrive at their home, Sidney bears to them a strong testimony that [[Joseph Smith]] is indeed a prophet of God, but they reject it and insult him about it, which angers Ephraim, and he sends them out of their house. Sidney tells Ephraim that what he said to the preachers is true - God has returned to Earth and called a prophet to restore His Church. Sidney himself was about to die of a serious rupture, but by the laying on of hands, he was healed - the same way Jesus Christ healed others. Sidney hands Ephraim the Book of Mormon, and Ephraim accepts the teachings of the Mormon faith and decides to join them and Sidney.  However, in his mother's eyes, Ephraim has once again failed to be good, so she sends him and Sidney away. They eventually come to Illinois, where Sidney baptizes Ephraim. At the same time, an 8-year-old boy in [[Preston, Lancashire]] named Thomas Dobson (Koleman Stinger) is also baptized, and his mother, Alice (Katherine Nelson), tells him that he has gifts, before being attacked by an angry mob. One of the men throws a rock that hits Thomas on the head, but fortunately, he is relatively unharmed. Meanwhile, Ephraim experiences many of the joys of the LDS faith, including the Mormon Battalion, and he shows the prophet, [[Brigham Young]], that he will give strict obedience regardless the nature of his requests. One day, Ephraim heals an injured Indian boy.  In 1856, a man announces that the Dobsons are departing for Zion, which infuriates Thomas, now a young man (James Gaisford), as he has no desire to travel to an uncivilized area miles away from home. His mother encourages him to lose himself and go, for the prophet of God has commanded them to go with the Martin Handcart Company. Meanwhile, Ephraim is informed that the Handcart people are in trouble, and he is wanted, so he agrees to go and help.  
Europa Report
 Dr. Unger ([[Embeth Davidtz]]), CEO of Europa Ventures, narrates the story of the Europa One mission. Six astronauts embark on a privately funded mission to [[Jupiter]]'s [[moon]] [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] to find potential sources of life.<ref name="comingsoon"></ref>  The crew members are Captain William Xu ([[Daniel Wu]]), pilot Rosa Dasque ([[Anamaria Marinca]]), chief science officer Daniel Luxembourg ([[Christian Camargo]]), marine biology science officer Katya Petrovna ([[Karolina Wydra]]), junior engineer James Corrigan ([[Sharlto Copley]]) and chief engineer Andrei Blok ([[Michael Nyqvist]]).  After six months of mission time, a [[Coronal mass ejection|solar storm]] hits the ship, knocking out communication with mission control. Blok and Corrigan perform an [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]] to repair the system from outside but an accident rips Blok's suit. While he is being guided back into the airlock, Blok notices that Corrigan's suit has been coated with [[hydrazine]] and he cannot enter the airlock or else he would contaminate the rest of the ship. Blok attempts to save Corrigan by taking him out of his suit, but he blacks out from a lack of oxygen. Knowing there is no hope for himself, Corrigan pushes Blok into the airlock, thus [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|propelling himself away from the ship]] as it continues its journey to Europa. Stranded, he dies in space; the crew continue with the mission, demoralized by Corrigan's death.  After twenty months, the ship lands safely on Europa but misses its target zone. The crew drills through the ice and releases a probe into the underlying sea. Blok, who is sleep-deprived and eliciting concern in the rest of the crew, sees a light outside the ship but he is unable to record it or otherwise convince the crew of its occurrence. The probe is struck by an unknown lighted object and contact with it is lost.  Petrovna insists on collecting samples on Europa's surface; the crew votes and she is allowed to go. Analyzing the samples, Luxembourg discovers traces of a [[Unicellular organism|single-celled organism]]. Petrovna sees a blue light in the distance and decides to investigate it. As she approaches the light the ice below her breaks and she falls through. Her head-mounted camera continues to broadcast, displaying her terrified face as the blue [[bioluminescence]] is reflected in her eyes, before cutting out.  The crew agrees to leave to report their discovery to Earth but the engines malfunction. As the ship hurtles back to Europa's surface, Xu unbuckles from his seat to dump water shielding to reduce the impact speed. Remarkably, the ship crashes at the originally-targeted landing site. On impact, Xu is killed and the ship is damaged, leaking oxygen and losing heat. It begins to sink into the ice.  Blok and Luxembourg suit up to make repairs outside the ship. Luxembourg tries to descend but falls through the ice. Blok knows that there is no chance that he alone will be able to repair the ship before it sinks. Instead, he manages to fix the communication system, at the expense of turning off the life support systems, just before the same blue light Petrovna saw approaches and he appears to fall through the ice as well.  Dasque re-establishes communication with Earth. All the collected images and data that have been saved since the solar storm are sent, just as the ice cracks and the ship begins to sink. Alone and anticipating her death, Dasque opens the airlock to flood the ship in hopes of revealing the source of the light. As the water rises to the cockpit, she sees a tentacled, bioluminescent creature<ref name=fxguide></ref> rising toward her, before the camera cuts out.  In the epilogue, Unger confirms that the crew of Europa had discovered life and exceeded every expectation, as the footage plays from an earlier scene of the crew posing in front of the camera.  
Escape Plan (film)
 Ray Breslin is a former prosecutor who co-owns Breslin-Clark, a [[Los Angeles]]–based security firm specializing in testing the reliability of [[Supermax prison|maximum security]] prisons. He spends his life getting into prisons to study their designs and the guards' habits to find and exploit their weaknesses, thus enabling him to escape without a hitch or a victim. His goal is to ensure that criminals sent to prison stay inside by eliminating the weakness of every prison; Breslin's wife and child were murdered by an escaped convict he had successfully prosecuted.  Breslin and his business partner Lester Clark are offered a multimillion-dollar deal by [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] lawyer Jessica Mayer to test a top-secret, off-grid prison housing [[Forced disappearance|disappeared person]]s and see if it is escape-proof. However, this time around, he and his colleagues are not allowed to know where the prison is, as this helps minimize the risk of outside help when escaping. Breslin goes against all his own rules and agrees to the deal, allowing himself to be captured in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], under the guise of a Spanish terrorist named "Anthony Portos." However, the plan goes awry when his captors remove a tracking microchip from his arm and drug him on the way to the prison, which stops his colleagues from knowing where he has been taken.  Breslin wakes up in a complex of glass cells with no outside windows to indicate the prison's location. He discovers that he has been played when he realizes the warden is not the one he is supposed to meet. He meets fellow inmate Emil Rottmayer, who works for a man named Victor Mannheim who is portrayed as a modern-day [[Robin Hood]]. The duo stage a fight for Breslin to study the [[solitary confinement]] cell, which uses high-powered halogen lights to disorient and dehydrate prisoners. Seeing that the cell floors have [[rivet]]s that are made of steel instead of moisture-resistant aluminium, Breslin has Rottmayer acquire a metal plate from Warden Hobbes's office floor, before the two of them and Muslim inmate Javed are once again thrown into confinement. Using the metal plate, Breslin focuses the reflection from the lights to heat the steel around the rivets, shearing the rivets when the steel expands, and pops open the floor panel to reveal a passageway below. He discovers that the prison is inside a super freighter [[cargo ship]] in the middle of the ocean, making a simple escape impossible. Breslin and Rottmayer continue to study the complex by learning the guards' daily routines. However, Hobbes reveals to Breslin that he is aware of his identity, and with chief security officer Drake watching him, he wants to ensure that Breslin spends the rest of his life in prison. Breslin offers Hobbes information on Mannheim from Rottmayer in exchange for being released; Hobbes agrees.  Breslin feeds Hobbes false information about Mannheim. Meanwhile, Breslin's colleagues Abigail Ross and Hush grow suspicious of Clark when Breslin's paycheck for the job is frozen. They discover from hacked documents that the prison, codenamed "The Tomb," is owned by a for-profit organization linked to a privately owned security provider. Meanwhile, Clark is in contact with Hobbes about keeping Breslin imprisoned. Rottmayer has Javed convince Hobbes that he is double crossing them, and as payment he only wants to be allowed up on deck to do his nightly prayer. While on deck, Javed uses a makeshift [[sextant]] to determine the ship's latitude. Using the latitude and weather, Breslin and Rottmayer deduce that they are in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] near [[Morocco]]. Breslin visits the infirmary of Dr. Kyrie and convinces him to help him and Rottmayer escape by sending an email to Mannheim. Breslin then transmits a false [[tap code]] message from his cell, giving Hobbes the impression that a riot will occur in cell block C. With the majority of the security stationed at cell block C, Javed instigates a riot at cell block A, giving him, Breslin, and Rottmayer time to run toward the deck while a lockdown is initiated. Breslin kills Drake, but Javed is shot dead by Hobbes and his men during their escape. Breslin goes to the [[engine room]] to shut down the electrical systems, giving Rottmayer time to open the deck hatch before the backup generators come online while a helicopter sent by Mannheim engages in a gunfight with the ship's crew. Rottmayer boards the helicopter while Breslin is flushed to the bottom of the ship by the automated water system when Hobbes has the main electrical system rebooted. The helicopter picks up Breslin, but when Hobbes starts shooting at them, Breslin kills the warden by shooting and blowing up a group of oil barrels.  They land on a beach in Morocco, where Rottmayer reveals that he is actually Mannheim, Mayer is his daughter, "Portos" was a codeword used to alert Mannheim that Breslin was an ally, and Hobbes was originally unaware that Breslin's cover story was fake. Later, Ross informs Breslin that they discovered Clark was offered a $5 million annual salary to become CEO of the security company, should Breslin's imprisonment prove that the ship is escape-proof. Clark had fled, but Hush tracked him in [[Miami]], and locked him in a container aboard an [[Mediterranean Shipping Company|MSC]] cargo ship bound for an unknown destination.

The Eternal Zero
 [[File:A6M3 Zero N712Z.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Zero fighter plane]] In 2004, twenty-six-year-old Kentaro Saeki is repeatedly failing the [[Attorneys in Japan#Qualification|national bar examination]] and is uncertain about his future. One day, after the [[funeral]] of his grandmother, Matsuno, he is startled to learn from his mother and older sister Keiko that his maternal grandfather Kenichiro was not his blood-relation. Keiko and Kentaro start hearing stories about their real grandfather, Kyuzo Miyabe and visit many of his former comrades all of whom begin by criticizing his "timidity" in battle. During conversation with an old comrade of his grandfather, Izaki, who is in hospital dying of cancer, Kentaro finally learns the reason why Miyabe became a [[Kamikaze|Kamikaze pilot]]. Izaki talks about his relationship with their grandfather to Keiko and Kentaro, claiming that only the "timid" Miyabe gave him the hope to save his own life after he was shot down over the ocean.  The film begins with an unspecified attack near the end of the [[Pacific War]], a [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Zero fighter plane]] threatens the [[United States Pacific Fleet]] by cutting through its defensive anti-aircraft fire. Kyuzo Miyabe, the pilot of the Zero fighter is regarded by his comrades as a coward, though an exceptionally skilled fighter pilot, for consistently returning alive from missions, openly explaining "I don't want to die," the result of a promise made to his wife Matsuno and daughter Kiyoko: to return from the war alive.  After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] advances steadily, only to be steadily beaten hollow in the battles from [[Battle of Midway]] and [[Bombing of Rabaul (November 1943)|Bombing on Rabaul]] onwards. Despite the rising desperation and hopelessness of their situation, all of Miyabe's men say they wish to die gloriously in battle. However, he persuades them, by his simple and honest example, that to survive is worthwhile. Miyabe accepts severe beatings by outraged senior officers several times for speaking these opinions, but refuses to retract them.  Both Keiko and Kentaro still are puzzled as to why their grandfather - eventually - volunteers for [[Kamikaze|Kamikaze Attack]]. Kentaro, now obsessed with finding the answer, spends much time researching the war.  At a blind dinner date with several friends, he becomes incensed when one compares the Kamikaze pilots to suicide bombers and storms off.

Evil Dead (2013 film)
 David and his girlfriend Natalie arrive at a cabin in the woods, where the pair meet up with his younger sister Mia and his friends Eric and Olivia. The group plans to stay in the cabin while Mia overcomes her addiction to [[heroin]]. The group discover the cellar, littered with rotting animal corpses, a shotgun, and a book called the ''[[Necronomicon|Naturom Demonto]]''.  Eric, despite written warnings, reads aloud an [[incantation]] and awakens a malevolent force. Mia begins seeing a bloody girl in the woods, and begs the group to leave because she is scared. They refuse, believing that she is simply experiencing the effects of [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]]. Mia steals the car keys and drives away from the cabin, but the demonic girl causes her to crash in a swamp. Emerging from the mud, the demon chases Mia through the woods. Mia stumbles into a circular opening to a thorn bush and becomes entangled by possessed vines. The girl, a demonic form of Mia, emits a black tar-like thorn vine from her mouth that slithers into Mia, and possesses her. David and Olivia find Mia and take her back to the cabin.  Later, David finds his murdered dog along with a bloodied hammer, and goes to confront Mia, who is in the shower. In the bathroom, he sees her [[scalding]] herself in the shower. David tries to drive her to a hospital, but heavy rains flood the only road back. Meanwhile, Eric becomes more and more convinced that the book is the cause of all that.  That night, the possessed Mia comes into the living room with a shotgun and shoots David in the arm as a strong wind blows through the cabin, Mia warning the others that they are all going to die tonight, after which she passes out. David instructs Olivia to get the gun away from Mia, but before she can, Mia wakes up and overpowers her, then projectile [[vomits]] blood all over her face. Olivia manages to shove Mia off, sending her tumbling down into the cellar where she is locked in by Eric. Olivia goes to the bathroom to wash the blood off her face and get a sedative for Mia, but is terrified when she sees her own disfigured reflection in the mirror. Olivia tries to rush back to the others, but becomes frozen and possessed before she could get out of the room. Hearing a door slam, Eric goes to the room and finds her cutting into her cheek with a mirror shard behind the shower curtain. Olivia attacks and stabs Eric in the chest, who grabs a broken piece of the sink and bludgeons her to death. In the shed, David nurses Eric's wounds, and Eric confides that he believes that when he read the book, it released "something evil". Meanwhile, Mia lures Natalie into the cellar, where she bites her hand. Natalie tries to attack Mia with a box cutter, but Mia takes it from her and uses the blade to split her own tongue in half, before planting a bloodied kiss on Natalie's mouth. David opens the trapdoor, interrupting the assault and allowing Natalie to escape. After the demon tells him that Mia no longer exists, he chains it up and locks the cellar door.  Eric explains to David that, according to the ''Naturom Demonto'', the Taker of Souls must claim five [[soul]]s in order to unleash the Abomination. In the kitchen, while cleaning the bite wound, Natalie becomes convinced that her arm is infected and proceeds to amputate it with an electric knife. David does his best to patch up her wounded arm, while Eric continues to explain that Mia must be "purified" either by live burial, bodily dismemberment, or burning. As they debate, the possessed Natalie attacks the pair with a nail gun, but David manages to shoot off her remaining arm with the shotgun, snapping her out of her possession but ends up [[Exsanguination|bleeding her to death]] in David's arms.  Eric convinces David to kill Mia and David plans to burn down the cabin with Mia in it. However, as Mia starts singing a song from their childhood, he has a change of mind and decides to bury her instead. He digs a grave, then enters the cellar to subdue Mia, who attempts to drown him. Eric intervenes and clubs Mia with a hammer, but not before being fatally stabbed and succumbing to his wounds. David proceeds to sedate and bury Mia, unearthing and [[Defibrillation|defibrillating]] her afterwards, which causes the demon to be [[Exorcism|exorcized]] and heals her. The siblings reconcile. As David enters the cabin to retrieve the car keys, a possessed Eric's corpse stabs him in the neck with barb wire cutters. David locks Mia outside and shoots a [[gasoline]] can, destroying Eric's body and killing himself.  With five souls now claimed, the Abomination arises and blood rains from the sky. As Mia battles the Abomination, she is forced to tear her own hand off after it is trapped under a car. She then halves the Abomination with a [[chainsaw]]. Its corpse sinks into the ground and the blood-rain stops. Mia escapes into the woods and wanders off into the distance. Unknown to her, the ''Naturom Demonto'' is still intact.  In a [[post-credits scene]], a silhouetted [[Ash Williams]] says "Groovy" and [[Fourth wall|looks at the camera]] before it cuts to black.  
Everyone's Going to Die
 We first see Melanie ([[Nora Tschirner]]), a young German woman who's moved to an English seaside town to be with her fiancé, dressed as Charlie Chaplin, the morning after a party. Her fiancé has left her there, which is where she meets Ali ([[Kellie Shirley]]) who offers to find her a job waitressing. She seems to be drifting, with no job, money or friends - her aimless existence broken up by supervising her fiancé's niece – a task that she doesn't appear to relish.  She meets 50-something Ray ([[Rob Knighton]]), when he offers to pay for the coffee that she can't afford. Ray looks and sounds like a clichéd East End hitman, and we soon learn that it's not far from the truth... but it's not the whole truth. Ray has returned to the town he grew up in to pay his respects to his recently deceased brother's family.  Their relationship grows slowly, as they reveal confidences, share awkward, darkly funny situations (meeting Ray's eccentric relatives) and enjoy being together.  When Ray & Melanie meet Ray's niece Laura ([[Madeline Duggan]]) it sparks a new effort in Ray to deal with his family past.  For Laura, it’s her chance to find a confidante in her uncle. After a long day together, where they are closer than ever, Melanie gets a call from Ali saying there is a job going at the restaurant she works at, Beavers. Reluctantly, Melanie says yes and leaves Ray to start work as a roller skating waitress.  It’s rock bottom for her, and later that night she leaves and wanders to ‘their spot’, on the harbour. Only to find Ray there, in a similar state of mind. This is the turning point for both of them. Melanie jumps into the harbour to challenge Ray’s fear of water. He jumps in after her and together they agree now is the time to stop looking back and start looking forward. Melanie goes home and packs her things – not a lot admittedly – while Ray attends to his own unfinished business. As Melanie takes the train out of town she looks out at the landscape speeding past, whilst a familiar figure walks through the carriage.  
Every Everything: The Music, Life & Times of Grant Hart
 Told in the style of the [[Errol Morris]] film ''[[The Fog of War]]'', Hart is the film's only interview subject taking us through his life, from birth right up to the recording of his new album ''[[The Argument (Grant Hart album)|The Argument]]''.  "Between discussions of his love of the art form of collage (his love of art coming from his father, a man that taught drafting), his fascination with [[Studebaker]] cars (especially the 1955 [[Studebaker Champion]] he rebuilt), the kind of drumsticks he uses and his drum set up, he speaks candidly.  Everything is fair game.".<ref>Phillips, Danny R. [http://blurtonline.com/feature/flexible-flyer-grant-hart/ Blurt Magazine].  September, 2013.</ref>  
Evidence (2013 film)
   The film begins by showing the aftermath of the massacre in Kidwell, [[Nevada]].  Police are first seen going over the crime scene, showing the aftermath of everything that has happened. The story then moves to a press conference with reporters asking questions about the massacre to the lead Detective Burquez, who states that the police are looking into the matter. After the conference, a disheveled Detective Reese asks to be put on the case, to which Detective Burquez assents. They move to a situation room with a TV and multiple computers going over information from the case. Here we learn that there were four video cameras found at the crime scene and two survivors. They load up the first video camera and begin to watch.  We see a woman practicing lines for a play, then the video jumps to a man playing guitar and a surprise party for the woman celebrating getting a part in a play. This is Leann, and her friend Rachel behind the camera. The video shows Leann and her boyfriend Tyler at Leann's play, where he proposes; she declines and he walks off stage angry. The video shows the girls making a video to Tyler to apologize for the proposal and to continue with a trip that was previously planned. The three are shown getting onto a shuttle bus heading to Las Vegas, driven by Ben. Along the way we see people being picked up and we meet Vicki, a dancer, and Steven, a 16-year-old runaway.  While watching the video the detectives notice another person on the bus, a woman. Zooming in, they notice that she is carrying a military duffle bag full of money. Focusing on the bag, they get the name Fleishman.  While en route to Las Vegas, some of the passengers notice that they're not on any main roads, but dirt roads. Rachel is asking where they are going when the bus hits something and flips; they find that what they hit was barbed wire. Ben mentions he saw a truck repair shop a few miles back, and the group begin to walk back to the repair shop. At the shop where Ben looks around for a phone, and locates a damaged service phone. Back with the group, he asks Rachel if her camera has a light, since the sun will be going down, and Vicki opens a gift box with a small hand held camera, also with a light. Ben tells the women to gather everyone together. As Rachel goes looking for Leann in one of the buildings, the lights flicker on and Steven stumbles out of a room covered in blood. Chasing after him, the others find Steven and Rachel. Leann believes she sees someone and they all run into one of the buildings.  The video pauses and we watch as the detectives contemplate Steven as the first victim. We also find out about the mystery woman on the bus, Katrina Fleishman. Katrina is the wife of a military man hospitalized with [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]. Katrina withdrew her husband's savings worth $90,000 in cash and left town.  The detectives begin looking at camera number two, from Ben's perspective. He locates a fuse box and is able to get the electricity turned on; the camera shifts to another person in the group. A woman walks towards a bundle of debris, looking for a flare gun, but she is not able to reach it as she is grabbed from behind, and her face is smashed into the debris as she screams and fights; she has her arm burned off by a cutting torch and set on fire.  Detective Reese sees a reflection in a pane of glass when the woman is grabbed. Using a computer to focus, a welding mask can be seen. Detective Burquez makes a connection to Katrina Fleishman's husband, a machinist in the military, and wants his picture publicised. Detective Reese continues to watch the remaining video.  Back to camera one: Rachel is heard crying and everyone is frightened after Steven's death. Moving to one of the empty buildings they calm down, and discuss how to get out of the area. The video jumps to Rachel and Ben going to the bus for tools with Leann and Tyler looking out. Ben looks for tools to help fix the phone they found earlier and finds a flare gun. They hear a noise outside and Ben gets out and is presumably murdered by the killer, who tries to get to Rachel with his welding tool, but she runs back to the repair shop.  Here she learns from Vicki that Leann and Tyler went looking for her and have not returned. Katrina tells the other women "He's here" and Rachel uses her camera's night vision to look outside. They see a person in a welding mask, who shoots the flare gun at them. hitting Katrina in the stomach. All the women run to a nearby building, where they find Leann, she explains that Tyler was taken and she doesn't know what happened to him. Rachel uses her camera's night vision again and sees the flare gun out in the yard. Vicki decides to make a run for the gun, Leann gives Vicki her ring for luck and Vicki leaves to get the gun. They watch as Vicki goes towards the gun but once there they watch as the killer murders Vicki. Leann and Rachel huddle together after watching Vicki die when they hear someone outside the building and Ben stumbles in. Ben was left to die but was able to make it back to the repair shop with the wires needed to fix the phone.  The frame pauses and the technician tells Detective Reese he was able to find footage on Katrina's phone camera, Detective Burquez comes in with the news that Katrina's husband has been located in a Hollywood hotel and is going to be arrested. We then see what is on Katrina's camera.  Katrina, looking in the camera,  begins talking about how the police will be scrambling over the scene to find out what is happening. She makes a dying request to be with the one she loves, Gerry Fleishman, her husband, and asks to be buried in the plot next to his. She goes over some of her husband's mental and physical disabilities after he came back from war, about celebrities being famous for no reason, and she speaks of God; the camera then stalls and flickers to a new image of the killer, we watch as Katrina's neck is sliced and she is killed while her camera records.  The detectives receive a call from a police officer in Hollywood, who explains to Detective Burquez that Gerald Fleishman has been dead for approximately a week, having shot himself and left only a note telling Katrina to withdraw their savings and go to Las Vegas to enjoy life.  Now without a suspect, they attempt to figure out who the killer might be.  On Katrina's phone footage they read something the killer wrote on a mirror, "Fear me like you fear God," and realize that the crime was planned and staged for them to figure out, and that the murderer had killed before. They begin to focus on Ben, the bus driver, since the trip was non-stop and Ben had mentioned a stop while driving down the gravel road. The detectives begin watching Rachel's video again.  We see Ben, Leann and Rachel move to another building, where Katrina is found dead. They move to a barn where Ben barricades the door, but while the women aren't looking, he disappears. Leann is grabbed and pulled from behind by someone unknown, and the camera goes dark as Rachel hides, turns the night vision on and sees Ben come towards her and fall. Taking the wire from him she attempts to re-connect the phone, but the killer appears with the welding torch. As she escapes from the barn it explodes, knocking her down; the killer catches her and sets her on fire with the cutting torch.  The video freezes, as  no more footage is left from this camera. Finally, Steven's cell phone camera shows the truck stopping.  Steven begins talking to his mom about running away and scanning the scene in front of him, as he turns he sees Leann turn down  Tyler's proposal; as Steven becomes angry and walks out, the video flickers out.  The detectives turn to the technician, who tells them that the memory card in the phone is missing, Detective Reese notices the news on one of the screens and asks for the volume to be raised. The media has gotten the footage from the crime scene and released it to the public. Now they attempt to figure out how the footage was leaked and Burquez is called to her superior's office. Officer Jenson comes in with the background requested on the bus driver Ben, whose real name is William Gentry. It shows he had been convicted of attempting to rob a bank in the past. Reese has an idea while looking at the case photos and leaves to speak with one of the survivors.  We watch through the interrogation room camera as Detective Reese begins speaking to Leann.  Detective Reese begins to explain to Leann that Tyler is in the hospital and doctors are caring for him. They begin to discuss grief and Reese tells Leann his history with grief, how his daughter had been abducted and later found murdered. He explains that a serial killer kills for attention and sport; they like to play god. He begs Leann to try to remember the events from the crime. Reese begins to ask about Ben and Leann explains what happened just after Rachel, Ben and herself entered the barn to fix the damaged phone. She tells of being grabbed and later coming to and watching Rachel fight the killer, she was able to crawl out of the building before the explosion, and saw Steven choking on something and covered in his blood. Detective Reese realizes that the time line is mixed up, and tells Leann to go home and rest.  At the morgue, Reese asks about the autopsies on the bodies, and specifically about Steven. Steven was still alive before the building exploded and had been dragged to the building to be burned when it exploded. Leann had mentioned him choking on something, and Reese finds the missing memory card lodged in his throat.  The memory cards resolution is degraded but Reese clears the few frames they have and reveals Tyler wearing the welders mask. Detective Burquez releases his identity to the press as the killer.  In the office, Detective Reese continues to watch the video from Rachel's camera, here he notices glitches in the video.  While Burquez is speaking at the conference, the reporters begin receiving messages and Burquez is told of a new development. Reese realizes that the videos have been edited for the police to view, with the edits being released to the media. The video now shows Rachel and Leann carefully planning the massacre and framing Tyler for everything. We watch as both women murder each person and stage fake evidence for what they call their "first movie together". The police realize they have been duped and manipulated. In the last scene both women come on screen and tell the camera and audience "Remember the next time someone's filming you, you could be in the sequel."

During Zeki's time in prison, the construction project was completed and his money is now buried beneath the new gymnasium at the Goethe [[Gesamtschule]]. In order to obtain the money, Zeki applies for the vacant position of a deceased janitor. However, due to a misunderstanding, he is given a job as a substitute teacher.  Elisabeth "Lisi" Schnabelstedt is a student teacher at the Goethe Gesamtschule, her former high school, because she has guardianship over her younger sister, Laura. Lisi does not impose the necessary authority to manage the students successfully.  When Ingrid Leimbach-Knorr, homeroom teacher of class 10B, attempts suicide, the management of the difficult class goes to Lisi Schnabelstedt, although the class's brutal pranks upon the new teacher quickly reduces her to tears. Zeki takes over as the substitute homeroom teacher for Lisi's former seventh grade class. In order to regain his money, Zeki works during the night in the cellar of the school on a tunnel leading to the buried money. He also copies Lisi's diploma because he does not have a high school or college education, which eventually becomes known to Lisi. She then [[blackmail]]s Zeki, allowing her to get her old seventh grade class back while Zeki assumes responsibility over class 10B.  Zeki is thrown out of his living situation at a strip club, and tries to sleep in Lisi's garage. When discovered, Lisi allows Zeki to live in her basement as long as he properly teaches class 10B instead of watching films every class period.  Through unconventional methods and Lisi's soft leadership, Zeki gains the respect of the class. Although Zeki begins his time as a teacher with draconian methods including shooting students with a paintball gun and holding a student underwater, he eventually takes a softer approach and convinces the students that they do not want to become drug dealers and dependent on welfare by taking them on a field trip to visit Zeki's acquaintances who live this lifestyle. He also becomes more involved in the school by taking over the leadership of the Drama Club, which performs a modern version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and helping out with the [[Jugend forscht]] group. Zeki, concerned about Lisi's image amongst the class, leads the class on an excursion to paint graffiti on a train, during which a student paints the title ‘Fack ju Göhte’. As a result of this increased respect, Lisi passes her practical teaching exam with class 10B. In addition, Zeki arranges an affair for Lisi's little sister Laura with her crush Danger, as well as ensuring Lisi's continued legal guardianship of Laura by pretending to be Lisi's serious boyfriend when Laura's social worker comes to visit. Eventually Zeki finds the money in the tunnel, but the tunnel beneath the gymnasium causes the floor to break and allows Lisi to discover Zeki filling in the tunnel. When Lisi learns about Zeki's past as a criminal, she threatens to call the police if he does not leave his job and her home at once. Zeki, out of options, agrees to drive the get away car for a bank heist. As Zeki's class is about to take their final exam in German, they all take out their motivation photos. A student informs Lisi that Zeki's motivation photo is in his desk. When Lisi opens the desk, she discovers that his motivation for becoming a better person is her. A friend of Zeki's is able to convince Lisi that Zeki wants to change his ways for her.  Zeki doesn't follow through with the heist because three students stop him to ask if he will be their homeroom teacher next year and he sees the train with the ‘Fack ju Göthe’ graffiti. He sends Lisi a dress and an invitation to the prom and reports himself to the school principal. The principal wants to keep him and even hands him a falsified high school diploma with a 2.0 GPA. She informs Zeki that the class 10B has drastically improved and if they continue to work towards their high school diplomas, the school will become the best in the city. Their marks in German, previously 5's and 6's (equivalent to E's and F's), have now become better than 3's (C's).

The Fall of the Essex Boys
 On a boat in the [[North Sea]], three men are importing drugs into Essex: Mickey Steele, Darren Nicholls and Jack Whomes. Unbeknownst to the other two, Nicholls is a [[police informant]] who has told D.I. Stone, a police officer, about the drugs. The drugs, however, still reach Essex because Steele anticipates trouble and sends Whomes away on a boat with the contraband.  It is revealed by Nicholls, who serves as the film's [[narrator]], that the three men are suppliers to an Essex-based drug dealer named Tony Tucker. Tucker, his right-hand man Craig Rolfe and the psychotic Patrick "Pat" Tate serve as the three core members of the Essex boys. The gang grows progressively in stature until a girl falls into a coma and later dies after taking a "pure" [[MDMA|ecstasy]] pill.  Enraged, Tucker and Tate visit Steele and threaten him. To repay them, Steele tells them of a job in [[Amsterdam]], which Nicholls, Tate, Rolfe and Steele successfully complete. Nicholls, however, is wracked with guilt after killing three men.  Meanwhile, Tate sees himself as "unstoppable" and cheats on his partner Karen, only for her to leave him for Steele. He also brutally assaults a pizza restaurant employee because the employee refuses to make a bespoke pizza for Tate's new partner, giving the police solid charges against a member for the first time. Despite this, Stone tells the employee to drop the charges as he knows a longer-term conviction is needed. Nevertheless, he comes under scrutiny from his superiors for this decision.  The now wealthy gang approach veteran criminal Billy Carmichael and, despite Tucker arguing with Carmichael, they secure a share of a lucrative shipment of guns and drugs going into [[Rettendon]]. They then recruit former associate of Carmichael, Ronnie Walsh, who is described as psychopathic and "would eat your face for a [[Bank of England £5 note|fiver]] and a gram of [[Cocaine|coke]]".  Nicholls, knowing the power and influence they would hold if the job was successful and fearing for his life, informs Steele of the shipment and Steele duly puts into motion a plan to kill Rolfe, Tucker and Tate.  One night, Tate, Tucker, Rolfe and Walsh drive to a farm track in Rettendon. On the way they snort cocaine and joke about why Walsh ended his association with Carmichael. They meet a gate, and Walsh exits the car to open it. As he approaches it, two masked gunmen approach the dealers' [[Range Rover]] and [[Rettendon murders|shoot dead Rolfe, Tucker and Tate]]. The next morning, the bodies are found and Stone acknowledges that it was the result he wanted.  Steele and Whomes (who are the two gunmen) return to Steele's home with Nicholls, who drove the shooters to the location. Steele is suspicious of Nicholls and persuades him to come in, only for Nicholls to call the police and report the crimes. Whomes discovers this and approaches Nicholls with a [[shotgun]], but Nicholls surprises the two and escapes to a nearby field. Steele orders Whomes to return to the house and follows Nicholls to a farm, where he assures Nicholls "you're dying today". After a brief chase, Steele corners Nicholls and as he is about to kill him, the police arrive to apprehend him. Nicholls ends the film, saying that after the events of the film "[he] just vanished".  
Family Weekend
 Emily ([[Olesya Rulin]]) is a speed rope-jumping champion of her school and general overachiever. She is praised by one love-lorn boy at school (though she is mocked by other students) for her achievements, but her family does not care about her jump roping success. On Friday, Emily wins the regional championship in speed rope-jumping and moves on to the state championship to be held the coming weekend. She looks at the audience only to find nobody from her family cheering for her. She confronts her family at home during a family dinner, but her mother Samantha ([[Kristin Chenoweth]]), father Duncan ([[Matthew Modine]]), brother Jackson (Eddie Hassell), and sister Lucinda ([[Joey King]]) all continue to be wrapped up in themselves and ignore her plea to take her jump-roping seriously.  Inspired by an [[Animal Planet]] segment her semi-autistic younger brother Mickey (Robbie Tucker) is watching on treating [[Tasmanian devil]]s for a kind of cancer by sedating the creatures so treatment can be administered and in a desperate attempt to bring the family back together, Emily secretly drugs her parents' drinks with her mother's sedatives, then binds each of them to a chair. She manages to hold them until Sunday morning with help from her siblings, grandmother GG ([[Shirley Jones]]), and her school friend Kat ([[Chloe Bridges]]) who is her neighbor. During the weekend, she attempts to teach her parents how to parent. While her father soon succumbs to [[Stockholm syndrome]] and wrongly praises her, her mother still unconvinced scolds her often. After an emotional one-to-one with her mother that brings tears from Emily, she ultimately succeeds in both bringing her parents back together and causing all the members of the family to realize that everyone in the family is important and needs support.  By the time Deputy Tucker and Officer Reyes show up Sunday morning due to videos Kat had put online about the kidnapping, her parents and the neighbor have changed their attitudes and help Emily escape to get to the state finals. During her jump competition, all her family finally appear at the championship to cheer her. She momentarily stops jumping when she sees her family, but still wins second place. Deputy Tucker and Officer Reyes also show up and arrest her for having attacked her mother's co-worker/faux-boyfriend at her home who had inadvertently interrupted her kidnapping plot.  Emily is later seen at a youth correctional camp with her jump-rope keeping her company as her family comes to bring her back home upon her sentence there expiring.  
The Family (2013 film)
 [[Mafia]] [[Boss (crime)|boss]] Giovanni Manzoni, who offended Don Luchese, a rival mafia boss, survives an attempted hit on him and his family at a barbecue. He snitches on Luchese, which sends Luchese to prison; Manzoni and his family enter an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[witness protection]] program under the supervision of Agent Robert Stansfield, and are relocated to a small town in [[Normandy]].  In adjusting to life in the village, each family member runs into trouble. Giovanni is being observed by two FBI agents to ensure he doesn't leave his house. Giovanni claims to be an author writing a historical novel on the [[Normandy landings]], which is problematic as many citizens in the area are much more familiar with the event than he is. Giovanni finds ways to slip away and begins a quest to discover why the water in his house is brown. He beats a plumber who tries to shake him down for money to unnecessarily change all the pipes in his house, and a local fertilizer factory owner who interrupts him while he is talking.  Daughter Belle falls in love with Henri, a college student working as a substitute math teacher. She pretends to need private math lessons so she can get time alone with him and she eventually seduces him. Giovanni's wife, Maggie, blows up a small grocery store when its owner spews [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]] comments in French to the other customers and often visits the undercover FBI agents. She spends a lot of time at the church, where she and the local priest have an amicable relationship. Their friendship ends when she [[confession|confesses]] the numerous crimes her family has committed and he tells her never to come back.  On the first day of class at the local school, Warren, Giovanni's son, is beaten up by a small gang, but he digs up information and uses it to gain favor with the most influential students, creating a mini-mafia within the school. This sway allows him to beat up the gang. He inadvertently alerts Don Luchese to their location when he quotes one of the kingpin's sayings in a school paper, which makes its way back to Luchese through a series of chance events.  Giovanni is asked to attend an American film event due to his supposed historical expertise and he brings Agent Stansfield along, claiming to want to bond with him, but it's an alibi for a timed explosive he has rigged to destroy the structure causing his brown water. The film screening takes an unexpected turn when instead of ''[[Some Came Running (1958 film)|Some Came Running]]'', the scheduled film, they watch ''[[Goodfellas]]''. Throughout the film, Giovanni expresses a desire to talk about his life as a mobster, seemingly expressing some guilt. The debate after the film prompts him to tell his story to the audience. Feeling his cover has been compromised, Agent Stansfield gives an order to relocate the family again.  Meanwhile, the school detects Warren's activities so he decides to leave town with a fake passport, afraid that the FBI will drop the family's protection. At the train station, he sees seven hitmen arrive and head for the town. He returns home to warn the family. Henri breaks up with Belle, which causes her to contemplate suicide, but she stops when she sees the hitmen enter the police station and kill several officers. As Giovanni returns home, Maggie arrives outside and notices the team of hitmen, who have already killed firemen and who have proceeded to kill their neighbours. She takes cover in the FBI safe-house across the street.  The hitmen blow up the family's house and soon an intense gunfight ensues which involves all family members. Giovanni and Maggie strangle and stab a hitman after he raids the safe-house and tries to sexually assault Maggie. Belle kills a hitman who went to look for weapons in his car's trunk. Using weapons she found in the trunk, she shoots one of the five hitmen near the burning house. Warren also takes guns from the trunk of the car and shoots two of the hitmen while being given cover fire by Belle. One hitman is killed by the family dog. While chasing Belle, the lead hitman is killed by Stansfield's car.  The family relocates again. Despite numerous innocent townspeople being slaughtered, Giovanni expresses his happiness at having had the chance to tell his story, saying that it brought the family closer.  
The Fake (2013 film)
 With their municipality scheduled to be flooded to make way for the construction of a new [[dam]], the devout denizens of a rural village have placed their faith in Choi Gyeong-seok, a church elder who promises to relocate the flock. Choi tells the villagers they will build a church and a new housing development where they will all be able to live together after the town is completely submerged. He also says that only 144,000 people can go to heaven, and that church offerings are mandatory if one wants to "secure their spot." Even the town's much-revered Reverend Sung, a young and good-looking minister who seemingly has the ability to heal the sick, approves of Choi's plans. Behind his guise of devotion, however, Choi is a practiced [[con man]] posing as a representative of a fake religion; his true aim is to defraud the villagers of their resettlement compensation. The only obstacle to the scheme is Kim Min-chul, a skeptical outcast who accidentally discovers evidence of Choi's past misdeeds and suddenly finds himself becoming the center of resistance against the church institution.  But Min-chul himself is hardly a saint. One of the village's most vile and untrustworthy characters, Min-chul is a low-life neighborhood thug who gambles and drinks too much. He regularly beats his wife and daughter Young-sun, a young factory worker who's been saving up for her lifelong dream of going to college in [[Seoul]].  No one in the village believes Min-chul and his attempts to expose Choi to the authorities fall on deaf ears. But after Young-sun is forced into [[prostitution]] by Choi, Min-chul becomes obsessed with revenge and makes a fateful decision to take matters into his own hands.

Fast & Furious 6
  Following their successful heist in Brazil, Dominic "Dom" Toretto and his professional criminal crew have fled around the world: Dom lives with Elena; his sister Mia lives with Brian O'Conner and their son, Jack; Gisele and Han live together; and Roman and Tej live in luxury. Meanwhile, [[Diplomatic Security Service|DSS]] agent Luke Hobbs and Riley Hicks investigate the destruction of a Russian military convoy by a crew led by former British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] Major and special ops soldier Owen Shaw. Hobbs persuades Dom to help capture Shaw by showing him a photo of the supposedly long-dead Letty Ortiz, Dom's former lover. Dom and his crew accept the mission in exchange for their amnesty, allowing them to return to the United States.  In London, Shaw's hideout is found, but this is revealed to be a trap, distracting them and the police while Shaw's crew performs a heist at an Interpol building. Shaw flees by car, detonating his hideout and disabling most of the police, leaving Dom, Brian, Tej, Han, Gisele, Hobbs, and Riley to pursue him. Letty arrives to help Shaw, shooting Dom without hesitation before escaping. Back at their headquarters, Hobbs tells Dom's crew that Shaw is stealing components to create a deadly device, intending to sell it to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, Shaw's investigation into the opposing crew reveals Letty's relationship with Dom, but she is revealed to be suffering from amnesia. Dominic's crew learns that Shaw is connected to a drug lord [[Fast & Furious (2009 film)|who was imprisoned by Brian]], Arturo Braga. Brian returns to Los Angeles as a prisoner to question Braga, who says Letty survived the explosion that seemingly killed her; Shaw took her in after discovering her amnesia. With FBI help, Brian is released from prison, regrouping with the team in London.  Dom challenges Letty in a street racing competition; afterwards, he returns her cross necklace he had kept. After Letty leaves, Shaw offers Dom a chance to walk away, threatening to otherwise hurt his family, but Dom refuses. Tej tracks Shaw's next attack to a Spanish NATO base. Shaw's crew assaults a highway military convoy carrying a computer chip to complete his deadly device. Dom's crew interferes while Shaw, accompanied by Letty, commandeers a tank, destroying cars en route. Brian and Roman manage to flip the tank before it causes further damage, resulting in Letty being thrown from the vehicle and Dom risking his life to save her. Shaw and his crew are captured, but reveal Mia has been kidnapped by Shaw. Hobbs is forced to release Shaw, and Riley, revealed to be Shaw's covert accomplice, leaves with him; Letty chooses to remain with Dom.  Shaw's group board a large moving aircraft on a runway as Dom's crew gives chase. Dom, Letty, and Brian board the craft; Brian rescues Mia, escaping in an onboard car. The plane attempts to take-off, but is held down by excess weight as the rest of the team tether the plane to their vehicles. Gisele sacrifices herself to save Han from Shaw's henchman, who Han kills, Letty kills Riley and escapes to safety, but Dom pursues Shaw and the computer chip. As the plane crashes into the ground, Shaw is thrown from it, seriously injuring him, and Dom drives a car out of the exploding plane. Dom reunites with his crew, and gives the chip to Hobbs to secure their pardons. Dom and the others return to his old family home in Los Angeles. Hobbs and Elena, now working together, arrive to confirm the crew's freedom; Elena accepts that Dom loves Letty. As Roman says grace over the crew's meal, Dom asks Letty if the gathering feels familiar; she answers "no, but it feels like home."  In a [[mid-credits scene]], [[The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift|which takes place in Tokyo]], Han is involved in a car chase when he is suddenly broadsided by an oncoming car. The driver walks away from the scene after leaving Letty's cross necklace by the crash, and calls Dom as Han's car fatally explodes, saying, "[[Furious 7|You don't know me. You're about to]]."

Fasten Your Seatbelt (film)

Fandry
  Fandry is a story set in the background of caste discrimination depicting the love of a 13-year-old boy.  Jambhuvant Kachru Mane (nickname: Jabya) (Somnath Awghade), a pre-teen lives in a makeshift house on the outskirts of a caste segregated village with his parents and 2 sisters (one a widow with a toddler). The family belongs to a low-caste community (Kaikadi) and earns its living by doing menial jobs. Owing to the caste-ridden power structure of the village society, the boy's father has a fearful and submissive personality which is exploited by the upper-caste villagers.  Jabya is disillusioned by the predicament of his family and shows interest in school where he has also fallen in one-sided love with a forward caste girl named Shalini (nickname: Shalu) (Rajeshwari Kharat) who he has never talked to but tries desperately to get her to notice him.  The plot opens with Jabya and his school friend Pirya (Suraj Pawar) armed with a slingshot trying to catch a bird (the Black Sparrow) in the wilderness. However, the bird call that punctuates the film is that of the Red Wattled Lapwing (Titawi), which is supposed to bring bad luck. The black sparrow, with its distinctive forked tail, and the call of the red wattled lapwing occur repeatedly throughout the film. The duo keep trying to catch the bird in the entire film for an unknown reason which is later explained in the film. According to a local legend, it is believed that when the ash obtained by burning the black sparrow is sprinkled on someone, it hypnotizes them to fall in love with the person sprinkling it.  Jabya also befriends a bicycle mechanic named Chankya (Nagraj Manjule) who sees his young self in the boy. Chankya had once gotten married to a girl but she was soon forcefully taken away by her brother and left him beaten very badly. Since then he has renounced family life and taken up refuge in spirituality, mysticism and liquor. Jabya seeks support from Chankya in his quest to obtain his love, which Chankya readily extends. Perhaps the idea of sprinkling the ash of black sparrow on Shalu is suggested to Jabya by Chankya himself. The idea, however, is executed only in Jabya's dream.  Back in the village, a face of social politics is displayed over and over again as members of the segregated village exploit and ruthlessly dehumanize Jabya and his family who co-operate in the act due to poverty, fear and social hierarchies. The film reaches its climax in one such exploitation where Jabya finally reaches his tipping point and explodes in an impulse driven intense backlash against the oppressors. He hurls a stone at one of the high-caste boys, who were teasing Jabya and his family by calling them "Fandry" (pig). The stone is seen fast approaching towards the audience and the film ends. The closing scene deliberately aims the stone at the audience, which is not only a victim but also a carrier of the exploitative caste-based social system.

The Fifth Estate (film)
 The story opens in 2010, with the release of the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan War Logs]]. It then flashes back to 2007, where journalist [[Daniel Domscheit-Berg]] meets [[Australia]]n computer hacker [[Julian Assange]] for the first time, at the [[Chaos Communication Congress]] in [[Berlin]]. Daniel's interest in online activism has led him to Assange, with whom he has corresponded by email. They begin working together on [[WikiLeaks]], a website devoted to releasing information being withheld from the public while retaining anonymity for its sources. Their first major target is a private Swiss bank, [[Julius Baer]], whose [[Cayman Islands]] branch has been engaged in illegal activities. Despite Baer's [[Bank Julius Baer vs. WikiLeaks|filing of a lawsuit]] and obtaining an injunction, the judge dissolves the injunction, allowing Julian and Daniel to reclaim the domain name. As their confidence increases, the two push forward in publishing information over the next three years, including secrets on [[Scientology]], [[Sarah Palin email hack|revealing Sarah Palin's email account]], and the membership list of the [[British National Party]].  At first Daniel enjoys changing the world, viewing WikiLeaks as a noble enterprise and Assange as a mentor.  However, the relationship between the two becomes strained over time.  Daniel loses his job and problems arise in his relationship, particularly concerning the BNP membership leak, which also revealed the addresses of the people involved, and caused several to lose their jobs. Assange openly mocks Daniel's concerns about these issues, implying his own life has been more troubling. Assange's abrasive manner and actions, such as abandoning Daniel at his parents' house after having accepted their dinner invitation, only deepen the strain further.  Interspersed throughout the film are flashbacks hinting at Assange's troubled childhood and involvement in a suspicious [[cult]], and that Assange's obsession with WikiLeaks has more to do with childhood trauma than wanting to improve the world.  Daniel begins to fear that Assange may be closer to a con-man than a mentor.  He also notices that Assange constantly gives different stories about why his hair is white.  Assange at first tells Daniel that WikiLeaks has hundreds of workers, but Daniel later finds out that Daniel and Assange are the only members.  Most importantly to Daniel, Assange frequently claims that protecting sources is the website's number one goal.  However, Daniel begins to suspect that Assange only cares about protecting sources so people will come forward and that Assange does not actually care who gets hurt by the website, though Assange claims that the harm the website may cause is outweighed by good the leaks create.  Daniel's girlfriend tells him that she believes in his cause, but that it's his job to prevent Assange from going too far.  The tensions come to a head when Bradley Manning (later known as [[Chelsea Manning]]) leaks hundreds of thousands of documents to WikiLeaks, including a [[July 12, 2007 Baghdad airstrike|video of an airstrike in Baghdad]], the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan]] and [[Iraq War documents leak|Iraq]] War Logs, and 250,000 [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US Diplomatic Cables]]. Assange wants to leak the documents immediately, but Daniel insists that they review the documents first. Later, several major newspapers agree to cooperate with WikiLeaks in releasing the documents while spinning WikiLeaks positively. However, both Daniel and the newspapers require the names in the documents be redacted both to protect sources and to assist in the media spin, to which Assange reluctantly agrees. Daniel realizes that Assange has no intention of following through on this promise and is grooming a right-hand man to replace Daniel. The newspapers release the redacted documents. The resulting media and public uproar forces informants to flee from their countries of residence and many U.S. diplomats to resign. Before Assange can go further, however, Daniel and the other members of the original WikiLeaks team delete the site and block Assange's access to the server.  Daniel later talks with a reporter from ''[[The Guardian]]'', and the two fear that giving Assange such a large platform was a mistake. The reporter tells Daniel that while Assange may be untrustworthy, he had done a good thing by uncovering secret dealing in the government and business world and attempting to protect sources. Daniel also reveals the real reason for Assange's hair colour—that it had been a custom of the cult he had been part of in Australia—and reports that he once accidentally discovered Assange dyeing it that colour.  As the film ends, it is revealed that WikiLeaks is continuing to leak information (with Assange implied to have either regained the site or rebuilt it), and the Manning documents were released with no redactions. Daniel has written a book on his involvement with the organization on which this film was based, and Assange has threatened to sue in retaliation. Assange is shown to be living in the [[Embassy of Ecuador, London|Ecuadorian embassy]] in [[London]] to avoid arrest on an outstanding warrant for alleged sex crimes. In an interview, he denounces the two upcoming WikiLeaks films, stating that they will be factually inaccurate (having been partly based on Daniel's book). He informs the viewer that individuals are what the government is afraid of and claims that hiring Daniel was the one mistake he made.

A Field in England
 During a battle of the [[English Civil War]], an alchemist's assistant named Whitehead flees from the strict Commander Trower. Whitehead is saved by a rough soldier named Cutler, who kills Trower before he can apprehend Whitehead. Whitehead then meets two army deserters, the alcoholic Jacob and the witless Friend. The four leave the battleground in search of a promised ale house that Cutler knows of. Cutler instead leads them to a field encircled by mushrooms, where he cooks the mushrooms and forces the others to eat, to make them more obedient; save for Whitehead. There, they haul the Irishman O'Neill seemingly out of the ground from a wooden pike buried in the ground. O'Neill is a rival alchemist for whom Cutler works; and who stole documents from Whitehead's master. He quickly asserts authority over the group and tells them of a treasure hidden somewhere in a nearby field.<ref name="dalton" />  The group finds a deserted army camp, where O'Neill tortures Whitehead into a gleeful and hypnotised human [[divining rod]]. After using Whitehead to locate the treasure, which is near the camp, O'Neill orders Jacob and Friend to dig for it while he leaves Cutler to supervise, and goes to sleep in a tent. Jacob soon succumbs to the influence of the hallucinogenic mushrooms, and after several hours of digging he attacks Friend. Cutler laughs and urinates on them, and when Jacob attempts to attack him, Cutler accidentally shoots Friend. Whitehead is unable to save him, and Friend dies, telling Jacob to deliver a message to his wife, telling that he hates her. Cutler is forced to finish digging by himself, while Jacob slips away from the camp to deliver Friend's message, and Whitehead deposits Friend's corpse in a thicket.  Cutler eventually nears reaching the treasure, attracting the attention of O'Neill, who discovers Jacob and Whitehead gone. Reaching where Friend's corpse is, O'Neill pursues Whitehead, who ingests a part of the circle of mushrooms, heightening his awareness but suffering a hallucinatory experience, wherein he conjures a violent wind to blow away the camp's tent. Cutler discovers that the "treasure" is just a skull, which he shoots in anger. Jacob comes back to join Whitehead in fighting O'Neill.  Cutler angrily berates O'Neill, blaming him for trusting Whitehead and lying to him about the alehouse, which was to simply entice Jacob and Friend. O'Neill promptly kills him and then pursues Whitehead and Jacob, who scavenge Cutler's weapons and return to the overturned army camp. As they are preparing for an attack, Friend appears alive and reveals their location to O'Neill. As Jacob throws Friend to the ground to stop him, O'Neill shoots Jacob in the gut, but Jacob returns fire and ruins O'Neill's leg.

Felony (film)
 While chasing an escaping suspect during a raid on a drug lab, Detective Mal Toohey ([[Joel Edgerton]]) is shot and saved by his protective vest. After celebrating, Mal drives home drunk and hits a young boy on a bike with his side-view mirror. He calls an ambulance, but denies any involvement in the accident. When honest young cop Jim Mellic ([[Jai Courtney]]) and his cynical older partner Carl Summer ([[Tom Wilkinson]]) arrive on the scene, Carl recognises Mal and sends Jim off to secure the perimeter. He questions Mal privately and sends him home, making Jim suspicious.  The boy is identified as William Sarduka and Jim falls in love with the boy's mother, Ankhila ([[Sarah Roberts (actress)|Sarah Roberts]]). Meanwhile, Carl has become obsessed with proving that a pedophile named Victor is responsible for the abduction and rape of a young girl. During a court hearing, Victor is released on bail. Afterwards, Carl cynically criticizes and questions the legal system. At a secret meeting with Carl, Mal says he wants to come clean and reveal his responsibility for the accident, unlike his witness statement in which claimed to have seen the person responsible drive away. Carl insists that Mal keep it secret, for both their sakes, but he cannot get Mal to agree.  Mal and his family visit Ankhila and William in the hospital. At home, Mal tells his wife Julie ([[Melissa George]]) that he hit William and she tells Mal that William has brain damage and will likely die. Their relationship becomes distant. Carl finds Jim in the hospital parking lot, but cannot convince Jim to back off, and appears to make him even more resolute in his investigation of Mal. Jim offers to take Ankhila to the hospital and she accepts his offer. At her apartment, he tries to kiss her, but she rejects him. They drive to the hospital in silence and arrive to find William has just died. Jim stands alone in the corridor outside the hospital room, dejected.  Mal arranges a meeting with Carl and Jim, in which he tells Jim he hit William and is going to come clean. Carl belittles Mal for being weak. Turning to Jim, Carl accuses him of sleeping with Ankhila. He begins taunting him, claiming he is as imperfect as his colleagues, and sneeringly suggesting Jim might get [[AIDS]]. Jim grapples Carl onto the ground in a headlock. Mal separates the two, but Carl lies on the ground, unconscious. Jim calls an ambulance as Mal tries to help Carl.  Mal goes to visit Carl in the hospital, but slack-mouthed, and apparently having had a stroke, he can only say the words "yeah" and "good". Out in the corridor, Mal tells Jim that the doctors said it was going to happen to Carl  soon, regardless, to comfort him. Mal also informs Jim that there are no cameras in the back of Tamberine's, the building in which the trio had met; implying that Mal now knew Jim's secret, just as Jim knew his, and that the younger man was just as morally conflicted as he was. He drives past William's school and hears some kids calling William's name. Mal looks at them and crashes into the back of a truck, causing him to bleed heavily from his scalp. Bleeding, Mal sits at a nearby bench and then walks to Ankhila's residence. He knocks on the door, but she ignores it. He stumbles in the hallway, and his body sagging, falls unconscious.  Mal wakes up to paramedics treating him. The police arrive and talk to Ankhila. They ask Mal what happened, and he tells them she did not do anything to him. As he continues repeating those words, he tells her "I did it", and that he was sorry, tears welling in his eyes. Ankhila appears to realize Mal is responsible for her son's death, but chooses to tell the police only that Mal had helped her son. The movie ends with Mal and Julie taking their children to school. They look across the street and see Jim leaning against his car with two cups of coffee, implying that Mal is going to be Jim's new partner.  
Fateful Findings

Filth (film)
 Bruce Robertson is a [[Detective Sergeant]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] who is a scheming, manipulative, misanthropic bully who spends his free time indulging in drugs, alcohol, abusive sexual relationships, and "the games" — his euphemism for the vindictive plots he hatches to cause trouble for people he dislikes, including many of his colleagues. Robertson also delights in bullying and taking advantage of his mild-mannered friend Clifford Blades, a member of Robertson's [[Freemasonry|masonic]] lodge whose wife, Bunty, he repeatedly prank calls and asks for phone sex. The only people he shows any genuine warmth to are Mary and her young son, the widowed wife and child of a man whom Robertson tries and fails to resuscitate after he suffers a heart attack in the street.   As the story begins, Robertson's main goal is to gain a promotion to become [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Detective Inspector]], the path to which appears to open when he is assigned to oversee the investigation into the murder of a [[Japan]]ese exchange student. However, he slowly loses his grip on reality as he works the case and has a series of increasingly vivid hallucinations. It is ultimately revealed through dream-like exchanges with Dr. Rossi, his psychiatrist, that he is on medication for [[bipolar disorder]] and has repressed immense feelings of guilt over a childhood accident that led to the death of his younger brother. It also becomes clear that Carole, his wife, has left him and is denying him access to his daughter, Stacey, developments which sparked his desperate bid for promotion, played a part in his unusual displays of kindness toward Mary and her son, and have also led him to start cross-dressing as his wife when off duty in order to "keep her close" to him.  While wandering the streets on such an occasion, Robertson is kidnapped by a street gang led by the thuggish Gorman — who are responsible for the murder — and badly beaten. However, he manages to kill Gorman by throwing him through a window and is found by his colleagues. Robertson not only misses out on the promotion as a result of the events, but is in fact demoted to [[Constable#United Kingdom|Constable]] and is reassigned to uniform, while rookie Ray Lennox is promoted to [[Inspector#United Kingdom|Detective Inspector]]. Afterwards, Blades receives a tape of Robertson apologising. Robertson then prepares to commit suicide by hanging himself, but is interrupted at the last moment by Mary and her son knocking at his front door. He then breaks the [[fourth wall]] and addresses the audience repeating his catchphrase — "Same rules apply" — and laughs as the chair slips from under him.

Flu (film)
  The opening scene shows a group of [[illegal immigrant]]s that are being prepared to be smuggled to South Korea inside a shipping container. As they are about to be sent overseas, one of the [[Smuggling|traffickers]] notices people coughing. After the immigrants deny any illness, he seals the container which is then sent to Korea. 9 days later, on May 1, the container reaches [[Pyeongtaek|Pyongtaek]] harbor, and is transported inland.  The movie then cuts to a rescue operation conducted by the Budang ERT (Emergency Response Team), who are attempting to rescue a woman who drove her car into an open shaft. One of the members, Kang Ji-goo rappels into the shaft and manages to rescue the woman, Dr. Kim In-hae, moments before the car falls to the bottom of the shaft. Despite having saved her life, In-hae was ungrateful towards Ji-goo, claiming that he was bragging when it was simply his job to rescue her. He later admits to his co-worker Bae Kyung-ub that he found In-hae attractive. He is then told by the station chief that In-hae has called him. Later on that night, Ji-goo met with In-hae, who tries to persuade him to go back into the hole to retrieve her handbag, as it contained a substantial amount of data. After Ji-goo pointed out that the hole had been sealed, and refusing to do the job for money, In-hae attempts to go down into the hole, but scrapes her knee tripping over a barrier. After Ji-goo attempted to comfort her, she stormed off.  Later that night, two traffickers locate the container carrying the illegal immigrants in the outskirts of Seoul. When they open the doors, they find the immigrants lying dead and covered with [[rash]]es and blackened blood. The traffickers, a pair of brothers named Ju Byung-woo and Ju Byung-ki, film the grisly and unbelievable scene on Byung-ki's phone as evidence to show to their boss. Byung-ki accidentally drops his phone on a corpse and as he reached for it, the sole survivor (Andrada) in the container revealed himself. After being unable to ascertain what had happened inside the container, the traffickers contained the immigrant inside of their van. On the way to deliver the man to their boss, the brothers stopped at a rest stop near Budang, with Byung-woo beginning to show signs of illness. When Byung-ki is distracted, the immigrant escapes from the van, and flees towards Budang itself.  Unable to catch the immigrant, Byung-ki takes Byung-woo to a clinic in Budang, believing his brother's illness to simply be an onset of the common cold. As he's receiving his medication, Byung-woo begins coughing more frequently, infecting several people including the clinic doctor, a small child and a high-school student. All of the affected people continue their daily routines, unaware that they had all been infected.  At the Contagion Center in Budang, In-hae is reprimanded for losing the data, but is covered by her co-worker, who claimed to their superior that others had not finished their work. The scene then cuts to Ji-goo, who ends up going into the shaft with the help of Kyung-ub. After retrieving the bag, In-hae's phone begins to ring. Ji-goo answers the phone to hear a child's voice, asking why he was answering her mother's phone. They arrange a meeting spot so that Ji-goo can give the bag to In-hae's daughter, Mi-reu. During the exchange Mi-reu demands Ji-goo's business card, so they could contact him if he had stolen anything, much to Ji-goo's amusement. As she left, Ji-goo noted that Mi-reu was definitely In-hae's daughter, with both having arrogant personalities.  As the day goes on, the virus begins to spread rapidly, with the clinic doctor infecting a bus, the high-school student infecting her class and the small child infecting his daycare. Meanwhile, as Byung-ki is searching for the missing immigrant, Byung-woo's condition deteriorates, becoming feverish, having rashes on his face as well as [[Hemoptysis|vomiting blackened blood.]] Byung-ki immediately takes him to the hospital. After being sent to the emergency room, and determining that Byung-woo has a flu of unknown origin (FUO) the medical staff put him into an isolation room and called In-hae in to the hospital to help identify and treat his disease. Despite the staff treating him with dopamine and standard flu treatments, Byung-woo's condition got even worse. In-hae went through his belongings and located his cell-phone, finding the video he had taken earlier of the immigrants. They realize that the container had served as a culture-room, mutating the virus. In-hae asks Byung-ki about the container, hoping to find the source of the virus, but the trafficker refused to tell her anything, possibly fearing retribution from the authorities. As the situation between Byung-ki and the hospital staff became violent, Byung-woo's condition deteriorated dramatically, forcing the hospital staff to call a [[code-blue]]. By the time Byung-ki reached the isolation room, Byung-woo had already died, now fully showing symptoms identical to the dead illegal immigrants. During his struggle to reach Byung-woo, Byung-ki exposed several of the hospital staff to the disease by knocking off their masks and accidentally smearing Byung-woo's blood on their faces.  The next day, Mi-reu went looking for a stray cat she had been feeding. It is then that she encounters the illegal immigrant, who initially avoids her, but intervenes when she is about to be hit by a car. After taking sympathy on him, Mi-reu feeds the immigrant, named Monssai, the food meant for the cat. Monssai is aware that he is somehow spreading the illness, and tries to prevent her from coming close to him. Unbeknownst to both of them however, Mi-reu is infected anyway. When Monssai begins coughing, Mi-reu goes to find help for Monssai, by calling Ji-goo. The two spend some time looking around the area for Monssai.  The doctors at the hospital begin to identify the nature of the flu, by drawing comparisons to the [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|Vietnamese avian flu]], which had identical symptoms. However, they noted that no avian flu had ever acted this quickly before. As they consider waiting for KCDC'<nowiki/>s results, they are alerted to the presence of even more patients arriving at the hospital, showing similar symptoms to Byung-woo. The virus is seen spreading rapidly throughout the city, with many of its citizens showing pronounced symptoms and exacerbating the spread of the flu. The effects are now seen in multiple people at [[Bundang Central Park|Budang Central Park]], at a wedding and even in civil servants, such as a police officer and a bus driver.  When the hospital staff locate the container with the help of KCDC, they accidentally release rats that had been feeding off the corpses and thus were infected with the disease. Despite attempts to sterilize the container with incendiary devices, several rats escape into the city. The doctors are able to determine that the flu being passed around the city is a mutated variation of the H5N1 strain, being able to infect humans rapidly and cause death within 36 hours. They note that traditional flu treatments had no effect whatsoever against this new, aggressive strain. Bundang's congressman, Choi Dong-chi as well as many other city administrators are unconvinced that the flu could reach epidemic proportions, refusing the head-doctor's idea to shut down and quarantine the city.  At the same time, Ji-goo and Mi-reu are at a diner eating lunch. Ji-goo is exhausted by what he believes is a wild goose chase, telling Mi-reu to call her father. Mi-reu responds that her father left her mother and herself and had moved to America many years ago, after Ji-goo leaves to get her a slushee, Mi-reu begins to show signs of light-headedness, one of the first symptoms of the flu. Ji-goo dotes over Mi-reu, slowly becoming more accustomed to the little girl.  Back at the meeting between the medical staff and the city administrators, the congressman showed resistance to locking down the city, claiming that over half a million people lived there and that it was practically a part of Seoul, due to its proximity. The head-doctor responded by saying that if it was genuinely a mutated avian flu, the consequences for not taking action would be catastrophic. However, the congressman brushed it off, holding up the example of the swine flu panic and its relatively low mortality rate. As the meeting temporarily convened for a lunch break, In-hae informed the head-doctor of the presence of a survivor from the container.  As Ji-goo is walking around the mall carrying Mi-reu, people begin showing signs of panic, with frantic phone-calls being made and people hurrying to get out of the city. Ji-goo receives a call from Kyung-ub, stating that all the members of the ERT had been called in to deal with the situation. At this point, the people previously showing symptoms begin exhibiting full blown effects of the flu, vomiting blood and passing out at their stations. Ji-goo puts down Mi-reu at a bench and saves a woman from falling off an escalator, only to have her begin coughing blood. Unbeknownst to him, Mi-reu wakes up and wanders off into the mall.  At the meeting, the administrators are about to dismiss the meeting, claiming that there was no reason to continue any further with such limited evidence. However, a commotion is heard outside, and the members of the meeting rush to the meeting, just in time to witness carnage unfold below on the streets. With many people vomiting blood and passing out in the middle of the day, especially when driving, directing traffic or performing hazardous tasks, the situation has deteriorated to multiple car-crashes, a bus running into a plaza full of people, and even a gas station exploding, all in front of the meeting hall. Staff then begin to report to the minister that the emergency lines were overwhelmed, with hospitals all over Budang receiving calls confirming positive cases of the flu. Scenes shown of the general hospital show the area overwhelmed with patients, and even staff showing second-stage symptoms of the flu (vomiting blood and passing out). Due to the evidence presented in front of them, Budang's administration agrees to locking down the city. In-hae is told to leave with the medical staff to go to Seoul, but stays in order to find Mi-reu first.  The police use buses to block off the highway entrance to Budang, with people neither able to enter nor leave the city. Public transportation is also shut down. The Budang administration and most of the research staff at the hospital evacuate to Seoul, where the Prime Minister and President are briefed on the situation in Budang. The minister is adamant to keep the situation as low-key as possible to the rest of the populace, fearing that the resulting fear and panic would cause even more problems. After consulting with the head-doctor and the Bundang congressman however, the minister makes an announcement on national television, describing the events in Bundang, as well as the virus itself, raising the infection warning level to 'critical'.  Upon hearing the news, the citizens of Budang begin panicking, with the notable example of mass looting in a supermarket. Unfortunately, this is the same supermarket that Mi-reu wandered into, and she is surrounded by people fighting and grabbing everything they can carry. Ji-goo and In-hae meet at the supermarket, the former having tracked Mi-reu's movements through the mall's CCTV system. The two split up in order to find Mi-reu, with In-hae suggesting to Ji-goo that he cover his face to prevent becoming infected. The situation in the supermarket becomes even worse when several people begin vomiting blood in the middle of the store, causing the police to lock down the market, utilizing riot troops and the supermarket's steel shutters. Ji-goo manages to find Mi-reu, and the trio attempt to escape from the store. Though they manage to successfully do so, many people are still trapped behind the shutters. In-hae manages to secure a seat on a helicopter to Seoul for the three of them, but Ji-goo refused, stating that he had an obligation to help people. In-hae and Mi-reu leave for the town-hall, while Ji-goo stayed behind, attempting to break apart a steel gate. His attempts appear to be in vain until Kyung-ub arrives with ERT equipment, allowing for the people inside to escape.  In-hae and Mi-reu manage to reach the town-hall in time for the last helicopter to Seoul. Unfortunately, right after they pass the inspection, Mi-reu begins coughing, with the KCDC officials stating that symptomatic people would not be allowed to leave the city. In-hae tried to pass the coughing off as a previous flu infection, but the officials are unconvinced and force her to remain in Budang. During the rest of the day and night, military forces from both the [[Republic of Korea Army|ROK Army]] and [[Republic of Korea Reserve Forces|Reserve Forces]] as well as troops from the [[United States Forces Korea]] and additional KCDC forces are deployed to Budang, reinforcing the perimeter and establishing a quarantine zone. The soldiers are instructed to keep their gas-masks on at all times, lest they risk being infected by the virus. The military forces begin herding the population of Budang into the Tancheon quarantine zone, a holding camp constructed outside of a sports stadium, using breaching tools and heat-sensors to locate civilians that were hiding. An [[All-points bulletin|APB]] bulletin is put out for Monssai, with the hopes of harvesting his blood for the antibodies needed to create a vaccine. Despite this, he manages to remain hidden and is sent to the camp. Ultimately, Ji-goo, Kyung-ub, In-hae, Mi-reu, and Byung-ki the trafficker are sent to the camp.  In the camp the people of Bundang are given a number, in order for KCDC to effectively track individuals in the camp, then are forced to strip to their underwear and undergo a physical examination, in order to determine if they have any of the visible symptoms such as rashes on their bodies. Next, they were given a PCR test, which would serve to determine if the individual was infected, but not showing physical symptoms yet. It was also promised that individuals not showing any symptoms of the disease would be allowed to leave the camp after 48 hours. The head-doctor expressed his reservation about keeping the healthy and infected in such close proximity to each other, worrying about the infected spreading the virus to the unaffected. However, his concerns are overruled by the politicians and [[World Health Organization|WHO]] official. Cell towers and internet services are shut down in Bundang, to prevent people from spreading false rumors. This however, has the effect of isolating the people in the camps from the rest of their country, resulting in unease in the camp populace.  During the physical examinations, In-hae notices that Mi-reu is beginning to form rashes on her face (luckily covered by her hair). When Byung-ki attempts to escape the physical check-up line, In-hae manages to smuggle Mi-reu through the checkpoint during the commotion, but not without Ji-goo noticing. In-hae urges Mi-reu to hide her illness and avoid coughing. They are housed in the uninfected zone without any complications.  The relatively affluent citizens of Budang do not react well to being housed in quarantine camps, complaining about the living conditions. An incident occurs where a rather mouthy uninfected civilian complains to the military troops about their poor living standards, resulting in their commander aiming his sidearm at the civilian and then assaulting an elderly man that tries to defend the first civilian. Ji-goo questions the commander's actions, resulting in the officer to point his sidearm at Ji-goo as well, threatening to shoot him. This set of incidents begins causing tension between the residents of the camp and their guards. Jeon Gook-hwan, a former operations officer for the ERT defuses the situation, as the commander and he were acquaintances. Civil servants such as Ji-goo, Kyung-ub, and Gook-hwan are then drafted to perform camp-duties.  In-hae checks up on Mi-reu's condition in their tent, realizing that the rashes were getting even worse. People that tested positive during the PCR test are forcefully moved into the Infected Quarantine Zone of the camp, located in and underneath the stadium itself. It is stated by the officials to the rest of the camp that the people in the IQ Section are receiving medical treatment. It is revealed that Gook-hwan is collaborating with the soldier from before, bribing his way into the safe-zone. He also spreads rumors that the infected are shot and killed rather than treated, causing even more tension and panic within the camp. Ji-goo confronts In-hae about Mi-reu's current condition, with In-hae certain that Mi-reu would not infect anyone else, as she had her mask on. In-hae does not want to send her daughter to the IQ Section, as she knows there is no cure for the flu. In-hae expresses guilt about not properly looking after Mi-reu, and Ji-goo promises to keep Mi-reu's situation a secret from the rest of the camp.  The next day, the citizens are awoken by gunshots, fired by the soldiers to scare away birds, in order to prevent the disease from spreading. Supplies are distributed adequately to the civilians, and the situation is calmed for the time being. Meanwhile, at the Infected Quarantine Zone, Monssai is discovered by members of KCDC, and is recognized due to the APB put out on him. Byung-ki, who is also in the IQZ, recognizes Monssai as the soldiers take him to the medical treatment center of the camp. In-hae is informed by her colleagues that Monssai has been discovered, and she is hopeful that a vaccine can be made from his anti-bodies. She entrusts Mi-reu to Ji-goo's care, and gives her a [[walkie-talkie]] to communicate with her in case anything goes wrong. Mi-reu's rashes are already quite visible, so she is wrapped in a blanket in order to hide the physical symptoms. At the medical center, In-hae suggests injecting antibodies directly into a patient, but is overruled, with WHO staff and her colleagues stating that it would be far too dangerous. Mi-reu is almost exhibiting secondary symptoms, and out of desperation, In-hae retrieves Mi-reu in order to take her to the medical center to attempt the antibody transfusion. However, as the trio were leaving the tent, KCDC officials come looking for Mi-reu as the PCR test had returned positive for her number. Ji-goo masquerades as Mi-reu by using her card and claiming it is his own. When he is transferred to the IQZ, Byung-ki attempts to escape, knocking off the mask of a ROKRF soldier, Sang-myung.  Meanwhile, in Seoul, the president learns that the uninfected are kept, even after 48 hours. The WHO doctors explain that the virus was so infectious, that they would not risk letting anybody out of the camp. The Bundang congressman, Dong-chi, and the Prime Minister both suggest further fortifying the camp. The President expresses resistance to the idea, but is ultimately overridden by Leo Snyder, a WHO official. Back at the camp, Gook-hwan bribes the camp commander to transport him into a safe-zone. In-hae manages to get the survivor to herself, then begins a blood transfusion between her daughter, and Monssai when the latter agrees to it after recognizing Mi-reu. Unfortunately, Gook-hwan is able to see what is happening through a gap in the tent and alerts the camp authorities, who tranquilize In-hae and takes Mi-reu away to the IQZ. Meanwhile, in the camp, the uninfected citizens of Bundang are getting extremely agitated as they have been held for nearly a week inside the camp, despite being told they would be released in two days. Fights break out in the camp, which escalates to a near riot. Gook-hwan attempts to escape in a USFK truck masquerading as an American soldier, but the soldiers refuse to transport him when they see the rashes on his face, fleeing the vehicle.  After Ji-goo is released from the IQZ, after being vouched for by Kyung-ub and testing negative on the PCR test, he notices Mi-reu's hairband on the floor, and realizes he has been taken towards the "treatment" section of the IQZ. After running into this area, he realizes that it is merely a parking garage turned into a place where second-stage victims are brought to die, with no medical treatment being provided for them whatsoever. The bodies are wrapped in plastic, with some of them still (barely) alive, then are dumped into a mass grave in the stadium itself, where the bodies are being burned by the KCDC. The grave is already filled with thousands of bodies, by the time Ji-goo witnesses the horrific scene. He plunges into the gravesite itself, looking for Mi-reu, he is able to find her, still barely alive, when he hears her phone playing the theme song from a cartoon she watched with Ji-goo. In-hae regains consciousness and also heads for the IQZ, seeing the parking garage full of dying citizens.  Sang-myung, the ROKRF soldier that had his masked knocked off by Byung-ki, is now showing signs of the virus, by rashes appearing on his face. He heads to the IQZ to turn himself in, but is followed by his worried friend, Chul-gyo. When Chul-gyo tries to persuade Sang-myung to hide his infection, he sees his mother being transferred to the IQZ by KCDC troops, as she had been infected when she came to Budang to visit a friend. Out of grief, Chul-gyo takes off his mask and embraces his mother, intentionally infecting himself. When KCDC troops try to stop them from leaving the IQZ, Sang-myung and Chul-gyo mutiny against them, fleeing the IQZ with Chul-gyo's mother. They are stopped at the entrance by ROKRF and ROK Army forces, but incite unrest in the camp when they announce that the people taken to the IQZ are being left to die, that there is no treatment, and that the bodies are being burned. The situation becomes a full-blown uprising when a ROKA captain shoots and kills Sang-myung, with the enraged people attacking and overwhelming the military forces and KCDC units at the IQZ. The mob breaks through the barricades, and gain entry into the stadium, where they realize that what the two mutineers were telling them was true. They see Ji-goo and Mi-reu trying to escape from the grave, and they believe that the infected are being burned alive, further angering the people of the camp who overrun the rest of the camp, forcing all the military personnel, KCDC units and medical research staff to flee.  A van filled with medical research staff and Monssai are ambushed in the IQZ garage by a mob led by Byung-ki, when they stop to pick up In-hae. Byung-ki stabs In-hae's colleague and Monssai to death, believing him to have killed his brother. In-hae and the staff in the van manage to escape, due to USFK soldiers killing Byung-ki and threatening lethal action on the others, however, they are unable to rendezvous with Mi-rae, and Ji-goo.  At this point, Mi-reu is beginning to recover, with the fever going down and having stopped vomiting blood. When Ji-goo reports this to In-hae, she realizes that Mi-reu developed the antibody, and that there is still hope despite Monssai's death. She instructs Ji-goo to head towards the highway exit to Budang. However, Gook-hwan kills several of the remaining USKF forces in the command truck, and commandeers it, taking control of the mob. Gook-hwan also realizes that Mi-reu is carrying antibodies for the disease, but Ji-goo manages to escape with her after a confrontation with Gook-hwan.  The next day sees the mob led by Gook-hwan heading for the highway exit, overwhelming the police and ROKRF forces in the first line of defense with weaponry they had looted from the camp's military forces, as well as sheer numbers. Gook-hwan convinces the mob to head to Seoul and infect its citizens, as only then would the government take true action against the disease. Upon hearing that the antibody carrier had been killed, and being faced with the quarantine zone being breached, the Prime Minister authorizes the second-line of forces consisting of soldiers and tanks from the ROK Army, Reserve Forces and Special Forces, to use lethal force to prevent the civilians from escaping Budang. Though the citizens are initially halted from threats of being fired upon by the soldiers, Gook-hwan escalates the situation when he attempts to shoot Ji-goo, but misses and kills an ROK Army soldier when Kyung-ub prevents him from doing so. The soldiers then open fire on the crowd, killing dozens of civilians. Kyung-ub, Ji-goo, and Mi-reu survive unscathed, with Gook-hwan being shot in the leg and Chul-gyo being killed while protecting his mother. The President is outraged when he hears that the Prime Minister ordered the troops to use lethal force, but the Prime Minister reveals that the rest of Korea supported the quarantine at Budang, and that they had to think about the nation as a whole, rather than one small part of it.  Mi-reu and Ji-goo take shelter in a nearby supply tent, with Mi-reu having made a full recovery. In-hae reaches the quarantine defense lines, but is unable to make it past the soldiers. Gook-hwan discovers Mi-reu when Ji-goo goes to help the citizens who had been shot by the soldiers. Though he tries to forcefully transfuse Mi-reu's blood he is discovered by Kyung-ub, who attacks Gook-hwan out of rage. Ji-goo returns when he hears Mi-reu's screaming, but is unable to prevent Kyung-ub from being shot by Gook-hwan. After a lengthy brawl, he manages to kill Gook-hwan by impaling him on a tank trap. During the brawl, Mi-reu escapes from the tent, and accidentally wanders into the mob, having reorganized and regained the courage to approach the defensive line. Snyder orders the troops at the defensive line to shoot anyone that crosses a line drawn in the highway. Ji-goo goes searching for Mi-reu after stabilizing Kyung-ub, but is unable to find her before she is pushed to the front of the crowd. In-hae rushes past the soldiers and stands in front of the defensive line, looking for Mi-reu. When Mi-reu sees her mother, she instinctively runs towards her. In-hae and Ji-goo run towards Mi-reu, attempting to prevent her from crossing the line. The ROKA defensive line commander forces one of the soldiers, at gunpoint, to fire on the Mi-reu as she crossed the line. The soldier fires, but hits In-hae in the shoulder instead, having closed his eyes at the prospect of shooting a child. Mi-reu is distraught at her mother's wounds, and shields her mother from the soldiers, pleading with them not to shoot her mother. Moved by the sight, the soldiers do not fire at her. The crowd, also moved, surges forwards and shields Mi-reu from the soldiers. The president, watching the entire thing in the command office, orders the commander to stand down. However, Snyder orders a secondary strike, using fighter-bombers launched from [[Osan Air Base]] to bomb the crowd in case of the ROK Army losing control of the situation. The president, upon being told that Mi-reu contains the antibodies to fight the flu, threatens to shoot down the incoming fighters using Seoul Capital Defense's SAM installations. After a tense confrontation between the President, and Snyder, the latter aborts the bombing run. The President then makes a speech to the citizens of Budang, promising that the government would not fail them, as well as halting all attacks on the civilians and dispatching medical teams to Budang. Mi-reu is sent to Seoul with the head-doctor, in order to create a vaccine and cure from her blood.  An after credits clip shows life at Budang returning to normal, with the people having been completely cured and services restored. It is revealed that Ji-goo married In-hae, and Mi-reu is back with her family. Kyung-ub also makes an appearance, attempting to free a woman's skirt from a bus door but ripping it in the process, much to the anger of the woman. The movie ends with Mi-reu sneezing.

Alex, on the other hand, is having a hard time with her film making gig as well as her relationship with Bobbie's ex - Chad ([[Bernard Palanca]]). Meanwhile, Teddie has not earned enough to buy a plane ticket so she asked help from her housekeeping colleague, Frodo ([[Janus del Prado]]) and convinced him that they go back to Manila together for the wedding and pretend that they are a couple.  When the family reunites, the sisters expressed their opinion on CJ's abrupt decision of getting married over family dinner. Offended by their remarks, CJ walks out on his family. The sisters go after him to apologize and explain to him that they are just concerned. CJ accepts their apology but tells them to behave themselves for when they meet his fiancée, Princess ([[Angeline Quinto]]), and her family, The Bayags.  During the gathering at the Bayags' villa, the sisters were taken aback when Princess' father asks him to sign a prenuptial agreement. It was also explained that the wedding should take place as soon as possible because Princess’ grandfather wants to have grandchildren before he dies. Appalled by the Bayags, the sisters decide to formulate a plan to stop the wedding from happening. When Bobbie suggests that  maybe  CJ is only marrying Princess because she was "the best candidate in a diminishing pool of options", Teddie asks their lesbian housekeeper, Toti Marie (Cecil Paz), to introduce CJ to a lot of girls. Toti Marie then came up with a boys’ night out with hookers that ended up in them getting drunk; and the plan to change CJ's mind about the wedding failed.  While the boys were getting sober, Princess arrived at the Salazars to surprise the family for breakfast. Alex invited Chad over, which made the whole moment awkward, especially for Bobbie. The following day, as Tristan was about to leave overseas for business, he tells Bobbie that by the time he gets back, she should now be willing to marry him. Alex, who overheard the incident, gave a comment with which Bobbie dismissed. Later on, Alex went to see Chad and asked him to marry her. Chad disagreed with the idea.  Meanwhile, Teddie and Frodo spent their day scrutinizing any filthy secrets that has to do with the Bayags. They went on to one of the Bayags’ family businesses - a spa which has an obscene tag line and offers a “happy ending” to their customers. Thinking that they’d be able to find anomalies, Teddie advised Frodo to avail one of the services, and that he should call her when the “happy ending” is about to happen. As Frodo was moaning in one of the massage areas, Teddie immediately called the police to have the area inspected. They found out that the “happy ending” was in fact, thinking of happy thoughts after a massage.  Jeanette ([[Carmi Martin]]) arrives at the scene she confronts Teddie and threatens her that she’ll also have the Salazars investigated on whatever dirty secrets that they are keeping. On the way home, Teddie, troubled that her secrets might surface, had an argument with Frodo because he was suggesting that she should just admit it that she is not really working as a teacher in Spain.  CJ confronted his sisters because of the spa incident and assured them that the wedding will take place no matter what. The sisters also squabbled with one another on a personal level but they were interrupted by the arrival of their mother. Later on that evening, Bobbie saw Chad flirting with another woman while buying condoms at a convenience store.  The following morning, Bobbie initiated to talk to Alex about what she saw but they ended up arguing with each other because of it. On the other hand, Teddie went to see Frodo and asked for forgiveness for what happened the other day. When she returned home, she was welcomed by the Bayags who came over to show the gowns that they are going to wear for the wedding. The Salazars did not like the gown designs so Honey Boy ([[Boboy Garovillo]]) decided that they play charades - wherein the family who wins gets to decide what gown designs to wear on the wedding day.  During the game, the Bayags kept on pointing hints that Teddie is a maid. Noticing this, Grace immediately disrupted them and had the Bayags leave for insulting her daughter inside their own home. Jeanette mentioned before leaving that Teddie is a “maid in Spain”. Grace confronted Teddie about it, who admitted that when Spain was in crisis, she was one of the teachers who was laid off. The confrontation also opened the opportunity to discuss their family’s problems and the envy that the sisters feel with one another. In the end, they all hugged each other and found peace.  The following day, Alex and Bobbie spoke to one another sincerely and they’ve decided that Alex should confront Chad and end things. They went to see him and caught him with another woman. Alex ended her relationship with him and also warned Chad’s other woman. Later that day, the sisters surprised Grace with piled crackers as a gift for her when suddenly, CJ called in to inform that Princess’ grandfather died. The family went to express their condolences to the Bayags and they apologized to one another for all the troubles that they have brought in their respective families.  Due to a Filipino cultural superstition called ''Sukob'' (prohibiting nuptials within a year following an immediate family member’s death), CJ and Princess’ wedding did not push through. In order for the preparations and expenses not to go to waste, Bobbie used it as a chance to fulfill Tristan’s dream of marrying her.

The Four II
 Cold Blood chances upon the scent of blood while Department Six and the Divine Constabulary are setting up camp in a foggy forest. Running ahead of the others, Cold Blood, Life Snatcher, Iron Hands and Ji Yaohua arrive in front of a locked and seemingly abandoned house. In attempt to break the lock, Cold Blood is attacked by a cannon and barely escapes. He notices the person behind the cannon - Zhuge Zhengwo. Keeping the information to himself, the rest of Department Six and the Divine Constabulary rush into the house to discover the bloodshed of many and there is only one survivor, a man Zhuge Zhengwo identifies as Ouyang Da, someone whose face had disappeared off the pugilist world twelve years ago. Every one else have died of similar wounds, all caused by the same weapon that Cold Blood was attacked with. Zhuge Zhengwo shows keen interest in the incident and promptly asks Sheriff King to turn over the case to the Divine Constabulary. Sheriff King agrees, and Ji Yaohua along with the others in Department Six protest; there have been similar cases of massacres that they have been investigating, each with a death of a man that was supposed to have died twelve years ago. The deaths are all tied to Zhuge Zhengwo, as these men were part of the Gang of Twelve supposedly executed by him when they massacred Sheng Yayu's, now Heartless, family. Department Six strongly believe it is likely that Zhuge Zhengwo had lied about executing the Gang of Twelve and rose to fame, only to silence those that were supposed to have been dead for twelve years now so that his secret would not be found out. Sheriff King believes in his friend but instructs Department Six to continue investigate quietly.  Meanwhile, An Shigeng has not died from causing himself explode into flames. His father, Lord An, has him being restored to life with the use of a certain tree-like organism and is planning to usurp the throne at all costs. An Shigeng questions his father's actions and Lord An only replies that everything he does is for the good of his son.  Ji Yaohua has nightmares about being attacked in her sleep. Restless and convinced someone is out to get her, she is finally kidnapped by Lady Fog, her senior who is working for Lord An, one night. Lady Fog brings her to An Shigeng and Ji Yaohua is shocked to find him alive. However, she begins to work for Lord An after she's given a poisonous pill. In order for her to remain alive she'll need a monthly antidote that only Lord An possesses.   Her loyalties are divided and she asks Cold Blood to meet her at a teahouse.  The purpose of the rendezvous is to reveal all of the investigations done by Department Six.  Cold Blood has Heartless accompany him to the meeting. Heartless is unable to cope with the fact that Zhuge Zhengwo is the prime suspect in the murders.  In addition, she intimates that Zhuge Zhengwo may have been lying to her about executing the Gang of Twelve. She hurriedly leaves.  Cold Blood quickly follows her.  Ji Yaohua is disappointed over the fact that this liaison was not one between herself and Cold Blood.  Back at the Divine Constabulary, Cold Blood questions Zhuge Zhengwo and reveals he saw him behind the cannon that day he tried to break the lock of the abandoned house. Zhuge Zhengwo admits that he recognised the weapon used, for it was the very same weapon he was gifted by the Emperor when he served as the chief bodyguard, but he had turned them in to the imperial archives long ago as he did not want to use such weapons of great destruction. He is perplexed by Cold Blood's incessant questions about being the assailant that day at the abandoned house as well as refused answer anything regarding Heartless's family massacre. He asks Cold Blood to give him two days to solve the mystery and Cold Blood agrees. However, before the two days are up, Sheriff King is found dead and all evidence seemingly point to Zhuge Zhengwo as the murderer. Cold Blood's animalistic side gets the better of him and he attacks Zhuge Zhengwo, blaming his acquiesce to the two-day request as the reason behind the death of the man who brought him up. Meanwhile, another member of the Gang of Twelve claims to be meeting up with Zhuge Zhengwo at the very place Sheriff King was found dead, but before any questions can be asked, Heartless kills him to exact her revenge. She is furious that she had been deceived for more than a decade but before she can get any answers from Zhuge Zhengwo, they are promptly arrested by Ji Yaohua who has taken over Department Six; one for the murder of Sheriff King and one for the murder of a key witness.  With their chief in command and a quarter of their team locked up for murder, Cold Blood, Iron Hands and Life Snatcher are at a loss, leaving the Divine Constabulary hanging by a thin thread.  
Forward, Comrades

Fourth Partition (film)
 At the Dawn of the 20th century, [[Chicago]] was the second largest city in the [[United States]] with over 2,000,000 residents. It was also the center of [[Polish culture]] and [[political activism]] in America. With [[partitions of Poland|Poland partitioned]] between [[Russia]], [[Austria]], and [[Germany]], over 4,000,000 Poles immigrated to the United States between 1870 and 1920 in search of a better life. In [[Poles in Chicago|Chicago]], they worked in some of the most dangerous factories and mills in the United States. In their [[Neighborhoods of Chicago|neighborhoods]], they built communities, [[Polish Cathedral Style|churches]], and most of all, aided their beloved [[Poland]] in her fight for independence. Their story is known as the "[[Fourth Partition]]".  Experienced historians (Donald Pienkos - University of Wisconsin-Madison, James Pula - Purdue University, and Dominic Pacyga - Columbia College, Chicago) discuss places and events from the early 20th century that had historical significance in Polish-American History. They provide a picture of struggling immigrants who didn’t speak the English language, or were aware of the reality in the “New World”. They were hired in steel mills and packing houses to do some of the most difficult and often lowest paying manual labor.  Historians discuss neighborhoods where Poles lived, built churches, and created their communities.  Poles not only named their neighborhoods after Polish parishes (Stanislawowo, Trójcowo, Helenowo) and tried to keep their culture, but also aided Poland in its fight for independence.  The film’s creators present economical and historical reasons for the Polish migration to the United States.  The film starts in 1608, at the [[Jamestown colony]], when the first Poles arrive. From there, it talks about the first large Polish settlement in [[Panna Maria, Texas]], and Chicago, as the center for Polish culture in America.   Historians and Polish journalists debate about social and political strengths of Polish community in Chicago, which resulted not only as an active participation in local authorities, but also in fraternal organizations. Poles also created their military structure – “[[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]]” led by [[Józef Haller|General Józef Haller]].  
The Frankenstein Theory
 Professor Jonathan Venkenheim, interviewed by a film crew, reveals that Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' is a fictionalized account of his ancestor Johann's scientific and medical accomplishments. Interviewed separately, Venkenheim's girlfriend Anne reveals that he's been suspended and scoffs at his theory. This view is shared by the film crew, though Vicky, the director, stands up for her friend. In their next interview with Venkenheim, he discusses how the [[Illuminati]] were trying to discover the secret of life when Johann secretly founded genetics. However, because Johann destroyed his notes, Venkenheim has no proof.  Venkenheim and the film crew leave for Canada, stopping along the way to meet Clarence, who survived an encounter with the monster. Clarence identifies his attacker using a sketch of what Venkenheim claims is a nineteenth century murderer. Clarence, a meth dealer, reacts erratically to this claim. Shaken and scared, the crew quickly leaves and berates Venkenheim while picking up their guide, Karl. Citing his obsession, Anne breaks up with Venkenheim, but he remains undeterred despite Karl's reluctance. Along the way, Venkenheim reveals the monster is an experiment in longevity and argues that the monster can unlock many scientific mysteries. The group eventually abandons their car in favor of snowmobiles. Eric ([[Eric Zuckerman]]), the producer, shoots footage of a mysterious figure, while Venkenheim claims to feel the monster's presence. The group hears wolves howling, though Karl mocks their concerns.  At their destination, they find an old [[yurt]] and some bones, seemingly validating Venkenheim's theories. Luke, the camera man, briefly sees something moving in the distance. Venkenheim produces a map, theorizing the monster follows a large herd of caribou and kills in self-defense when he approaches civilization. The crew reacts with fear and anger, and Brian almost gets into a fight with Venkenheim; Vicky defuses the situation. Karl disputes the existence of a monster and instead suggests a bear, telling them a story about a friend who was terrorized by a polar bear. Karl concludes by warning them not to mess with the forces of nature. At night, they hear wolves howling again, but a monstrous growling cuts them off. Venkenheim thinks it's the monster, but Brian disagrees.  In the morning, they find a snowmobile vandalized and another stolen. Karl leaves to hunt down the vandal, despite Venkenheim's protests. Brian and Eric eventually discover Karl's body and freak out, insisting that they all leave immediately. Venkenheim refuses and argues that the creature killed Karl because he felt threatened. Luke leaves on the remaining snowmobile, seeking help. A day later, Vicky reports that Luke has not returned, a storm has arrived, and no help will come. They discuss the possibility that the monster is responsible for Luke's disappearance; Venkenheim suggests they appeal to the monster's humanity, as the monster is intelligent and seeking companionship, which Vicky doubts. At night, they hear the monster growling again, which Venkenheim interprets as a warning to leave – something they can't do.  In the morning, the group sets out on foot, following Luke's tracks, and finally spots his abandoned snowmobile. They split up, looking for Luke, but, when Brian discovers Luke's body, the monster attacks and kills him. Venkenheim insists that they go back to the yurt and wait for help, but the monster is in the yurt, enraged. Despite Venkenheim's warning not to run, Eric panics and is killed by the monster. Attempting to reason with the monster, Venkenheim pushes his luck by insisting on touching it. Venkenheim is ripped apart off-camera as Vicky cowers in the yurt. The monster breaks down the door, throws her around, and stomps off with her body as well as carrying the red-headed female doll earlier found in the yurt.  
Free Birds
 Reggie the [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] has always been afraid of [[Thanksgiving]] because turkeys have always been on the menu, but his attempts to warn his farm-based flock constantly fall on deaf ears and has made him an [[outcast (person)|outcast]]. When the other turkeys finally realize what is going on, they thoughtlessly throw Reggie outside in an attempt to save themselves, instead of listening to his escape plan. In a surprise twist of fate, he winds up being named the "[[National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation|pardoned]] turkey" by the [[President of the United States]] and is subsequently taken to [[Camp David]]. Although initially hesitant, Reggie soon eases into a routine of doing nothing but enjoying [[pizza]] delivered to him by the "Pizza Dude" and watching Mexican [[telenovela]]s.  He gets bag-kidnapped by Jake, a member of the Turkey Freedom Front who tells him that a "Great Turkey" told him to find Reggie and take him back to the first Thanksgiving with him to take turkeys off the menu once and for all. They then infiltrate the base where a time machine is located. Despite interference by federal officials and an attempt by Reggie to trick him back to the surface, Jake manages to commandeer an egg-shaped [[Time travel|time machine]] with an [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] software named S.T.E.V.E (Space Time Exploration Vehicle Envoy). Jake instructs S.T.E.V.E. to time-travel back to the same day in 1621, three days before the first Thanksgiving. Once there, they are ambushed by colonial [[Hunting|hunters]] led by [[Myles Standish]], but they are quickly rescued by [[Indigenous peoples|native]] [[Wild turkey|turkeys]] led by Chief Broadbeak and his two children, Ranger and Jenny.  Broadbeak explains that the turkeys in the area have been forced underground since the settlers came and that they cannot risk fighting back without the settlers taking them. The next day, Broadbeak orders Jake with Ranger to spy on the settlers and Reggie with Jenny to spring all the hunting traps the humans set up. Despite initial hostility, Ranger and Jake find out that the settlers have already begun preparations for Thanksgiving and where they keep their weapons. Meanwhile, Jenny believes in Reggie for lying about being from the future and is impressed with his accidental unorthodox way of springing the traps. However, they are soon intercepted by Standish and Reggie is forced to get her in orbit over the planet aboard S.T.E.V.E., validating everything he said in the process. Reggie asks Jenny to go back to the future with him once everything blows over, but she refuses to leave the flock no matter how much she likes him. Jake then drags Reggie away and tells him he has a plan to attack the settlers. However, Reggie has gotten sick of all his improbable stories and threatens to leave.  Desperate, Jake tells him that this trip was more about him making up for his failure to save turkey eggs while escaping a turkey-fattening facility when he was young, maintaining that the Great Turkey convinced him to go through with this. While still reluctant to believe what he said, Reggie still goes along with the plan. They manage to use gunpowder to destroy the weapons shack, but Jake inadvertently leaves a gunpowder trail back to the tree the turkeys are hiding under. Standish and his men flush the turkeys out from underground, capturing enough for the feast. Broadbeak sacrifices his life to get the remaining turkeys into the tide pool. Afterward, Reggie returns home, where he discovers from S.T.E.V.E. that he is the Great Turkey. Jenny is sworn in as the new chief and orders the remaining turkeys to prepare an attack on the settlers.  Jenny, Jake and Ranger lead the turkeys in an attack on the settlement just as Chief [[Massasoit]] and his tribe of [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]]s arrive. Inspired, Reggie goes back in time to stop the attack, inadvertently trapping Standish in the time stream. Through S.T.E.V.E. and the Pizza Dude, Reggie convinces the settlers and the Indians that pizza is a more acceptable food than turkeys, taking them off the Thanksgiving menu entirely. Reggie stays with Jenny while Jake takes S.T.E.V.E. in order to look for new adventures.  In the mid-credits, Jake returns moments after leaving Reggie and Jenny. With a [[chicken]] and [[duck]] in his wings, Jake starts to tell every turkey present about the [[turducken]].  
Frankenstein's Army
 During the final stages of World War II, a Soviet reconnaissance party receives a distress call that would lead them further into Germany. The message seems to repeat without any response to their queries, and at the same time that they begin to receive the message, they lose radio contact with their command. Although the others are dubious about the existence of other Soviet forces in the area, their commander Novikov orders them to investigate. Dmitri, a Soviet propagandist who is filming the mission, interviews the soldiers and documents the proceedings.  As they draw closer to the designated coordinates, Dmitri takes an interest in and films several odd occurrences, such as unexplained dead Nazis, a burnt convent full of massacred nuns, and strange machinery. When the soldiers arrive at their destination, they find an abandoned church guarded by a 'zombot' - an undead with metal implants. The zombot kills Novikov and Sergei takes charge. The hotheaded Vassili challenges his authority, but the others back Sergei.  When a caretaker enters the church, Dmitri interrogates him, but Vassili becomes impatient and tortures the man for information. The caretaker leads them into a zombot trap and escapes. Overwhelmed, the surviving soldiers flee deeper into the catacombs, along the way encountering some Nazi survivors. In the midst of the carnage, Sergei discovers that Dmitri has deceived them: the distress call was just a ruse by Dmitri, who was also responsible for jamming their signal. Dmitri demands the others join him on his secret mission to capture or kill the Nazi scientist who created the zombots. Furious that they were deceived and led unprepared into this mission, they threaten to kill Dmitri, but he takes command after threatening their families with retribution. As Dmitri leads them deeper into the catacombs and they encounter increasingly bizarre aberrations, the troops mutiny and abandon Dmitri after throwing him down a chute.  Dmitri explores the main laboratory, only to be discovered and knocked unconscious by the zombots. When Dmitri wakes, he is a prisoner of the caretaker, who reveals himself to be Dr. Viktor Frankenstein, a descendent of the original [[Victor Frankenstein]], who went rogue and turned against his Nazi masters. Dmitri attempts to recruit Frankenstein, who seems noncommittal about defection. Instead, Frankenstein proposes an experiment he says will end the war: fusing together the brains from the captured Sergei and a Nazi officer into one whole. Dmitri does nothing to save Sergei, who swears his revenge. When the composite being shows little sign of life, Frankenstein abandons it and moves on to experimenting on Dmitri. But the arriving Soviet main forces bomb the laboratory, and Sacha, the lone surviving member of the scout group, shoots Frankenstein dead. Sacha takes the camera from Dmitri and flees, just as the composite being made of Sergei's body comes to life and kills Dmitri.  
Free Fall (2013 film)
 Marc Borgmann (Koffler), a young police officer, is on a training course for the riot control unit. He is struggling at the police academy, being somewhat behind his peers in his physical training. Cocky and self-assured, Marc does not initially get along with his roommate at the academy, Kay Engel (Riemelt). They have a physical confrontation during a training exercise, but afterwards Marc apologizes for his aggressive behavior and they become friends. The two begin jogging together regularly, and during one jog, Kay kisses Marc as they share a cigarette, indicating after that it was a joke. A surprised Marc is reluctant to jog again, but on Kay's insistence he goes on a run alone; Kay catches up to him, and, despite Marc's initial rebuffs, Kay kisses him and gives him a handjob. Marc initially accepts the advances, but then runs away in confusion.  Kay is later transferred into Marc's police unit to fill a vacancy, where Marc finds it difficult to ignore him. Eventually Kay shows up with a colleague to a bowling alley where Marc and his family are having a game, and is introduced to Bettina, Marc's pregnant longtime girlfriend. Marc attempts to stay committed to Bettina and forget about Kay, but he is unable to ignore his feelings and goes back to the jogging trail, where Kay is waiting. The two have sex in the rain. The encounter makes Marc late for a maternity exercise with Bettina, who grows suspicious of Marc's activities. Meanwhile, Marc continues to have intimate encounters with Kay, spending nights with him under the guise of having night shifts, and Kay gives him a key to his apartment. Marc finds himself less able to sexually perform with Bettina, which he explains is only due to her pregnancy.  Marc and Kay later go to a gay bar, where Marc takes [[MDMA|ecstasy]]. The next morning, Bettina rebuffs his advances and asks him if he's seeing another woman, to which Marc responds that he's not. Bettina goes through Marc's phone while Marc is shaving and finds nothing suspicious other than recent calls from Kay. Eventually Bettina gives birth to their son, and Marc tries to cut Kay out his life; however, Kay attempts to contact Marc, leading to a physical altercation with Marc demanding to be left alone.  Marc finds his unit being lectured on acceptance, and that discrimination will not be tolerated; he finds out that Kay was discovered at a gay bar that the unit raided. He then shows up at Kay's apartment and tells him that he didn't ask for Kay to come in and screw up his life, accusing him of going to the bar to find other men to sleep with. Kay calls Marc selfish, only thinking of himself and never of his lover. Kay tells Marc that he loves him, and that he isn't sleeping with anyone else. Marc tries to leave but breaks down in Kay's arms.  Later, Kay attacks his fellow officer Limpinski, following a [[homophobia|homophobic]] incident. Marc gets hit in an attempt to separate the two. Kay visits Marc in the hospital, and though Marc tells him to leave before his mother arrives, the two end up sharing a passionate kiss that Marc's mother ends up witnessing.

Later, Kay arrives at a party after Bettina's invite, where Marc's parents tell him to stay away from Marc due to his new family. Marc, overhearing the conversation, tells him to leave.  Marc visits Kay at his apartment to find Kay's face bruised following an altercation with Limpinski. Marc advises him to transfer to another unit to protect himself, and Kay asks about the future of their relationship. Marc returns the key to his apartment and departs. He returns home to find Bettina packing to leave with their son; she has learned that he has been lying about working night shifts and wants him gone by the time she has returned, questioning Marc's friendship with Kay. Marc does not admit to his romantic relationship with Kay. Marc tries to see her at Frank's house, and admits to her his affair with Kay.  She eventually returns to the house with their son, but there is emotional distance between them. Marc tries to visit Kay at his apartment to find it empty; Kay has moved, also departing from the unit without notice. When Limpinski tries to goad Marc about his relationship with Kay, taunts him, leading Limpinski to assault him. Frank witnesses this and implies that Limpinski will be let go for this. Marc, unhappy, visits the gay bar alone, and though he seeks a sexual encounter with another man, he ends up rebuffing him. Back at the house, Marc and Bettina admit to each other that they can't see their relationship going on as before. The film concludes with Marc at the academy, on a jog with his peers as in the first scene of the film; he outpaces them and runs ahead, alone.

That said, coming up with the right words for the constantly changing world situation and the constantly changing reactions of the Minister proves no easy task. He gets hastily written drafts past Maupas, and past other senior advisers who rubbish them, only to find that the Minister's needs have changed. The film ends in February 2003 with a re-enactment of the actual speech by Dominique de Villepin to the [[UN Security Council]], at which he contradicted claims by [[Colin Powell]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and argued passionately for disarmament of Iraq but not invasion.

In order to complete the ritual that she performed with the prostitute, any witnesses must be killed; Gerri therefore must force Amy to kill Charley.

Peter arrives and stakes Gerri, but he misses her heart and she pursues him through the castle. Charley emits a high-powered screech that shatters all of the windows, allowing the sunlight to penetrate and kill Gerri.  With the vampire overlord destroyed, Charley and Amy revert to their human forms. Reconciling, they share a kiss.  
Frequencies (film)
  The plot develops in a world where every person emits a specific frequency which determines his or her luck, further determining his or her success in life. Higher frequency means better luck and thus less ''feelings''.<ref></ref>  In this world where relationship, connections, and life worth is determined by predestined "frequencies", Isaac-Newton Midgeley, known as Zak, is a Low Born who wants to change his fate and start a relationship with High Born [[Savant syndrome|savant]], Marie-Curie Fortune.  Despite his teachers and his parents who tell Zak that Marie and he are opposites which will never attract, Zak attempts throughout his youth to court Marie, with no success. Marie, being of high frequency, is unable to feel emotion; however, her goal is to feel love. Zak's friend, Theo, attempts to help Zak raise his frequency, a feat claimed to be impossible. During his teenage years, Zak uses magnets and other methods to no avail.  Upon returning, as a young adult to Marie's birthday, he claims to be able to raise his frequency and eventually manages a kiss from Marie. The two end up spending the night together. Zak discovers with Theo that sound waves, when combined with gibberish two-syllable words, are able to temporarily raise one's frequency. They create a cell phone device which, based on the environment, is able to determine which words can raise one's frequency.  However, Zak and Marie discover that the words actually have mind-controlling properties, which may have caused their love. A secret government organization detains Zak and his associates, revealing that this phenomenon had been known throughout history and was slowly forgotten. By 1760, this phenomenon had lost much of its power. Unable to contact Theo, Zak uses a word to paralyze his captor and escapes.  He escapes to Theo's house, where Theo's father reveals that music, specifically that of [[Mozart]], was able to balance everyone's frequencies and nullify the mind-controlling properties of these words. Theo is able to calculate an [[equation]] based on music and discover that fate exists. He is able to predict the future and the destinies of others. Zak and Marie realize their love was caused by fate, not choice. Finding this irrelevant, the two hold hands while Theo realizes the perfect philosophical equation.

Roadblock, Flint, and Lady Jaye return to the [[United States]] where they set up a base of operations in a rundown gym. After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as the premier U.S. special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to [[General Joseph Colton]] ([[Bruce Willis]]), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that the President will be attending.

The Frozen Ground
 In an [[Anchorage]] motel room in 1983, 17-year-old Cindy Paulson ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]) is handcuffed and screaming for help. She is rescued by an [[Anchorage Police Department]] patrol officer. He takes Paulson to the hospital, and her clothes are kept for a [[rape kit]]. At an APD station, she explains to detectives that she was abducted and raped. Because she is a [[prostitute]] and lying about her age, the detectives do not believe her story, refusing to even look into the man whom she named as her abductor, [[Robert Hansen]] ([[John Cusack]]). They claim Hansen is an upstanding member of society, a family man who owns his own restaurant, and has alibis from three people.  The APD patrol officer who rescued Paulson is outraged that the detectives refuse to pursue Hansen. He surreptitiously photocopies information about the case and sends it to the [[Alaska State Troopers]]. Meanwhile, state trooper Jack Halcombe ([[Nicolas Cage]]) has been called to investigate a female body that was found in the bush, half eaten by bears. The police connect the case to other missing girls, who have disappeared after going to what they thought were legitimate photo shoots. With secret information from the APD officer, Halcombe connects the other cases to Paulson's and starts to put together a portrait of Hansen. Paulson details how Hansen kept her captive, and that she escaped from his car when he tried to transfer her to his [[bush plane]].  Meanwhile, in Anchorage, Debbie Peters gets picked up by a man in an [[RV]] for a photo shoot. Later, Hansen eats a quiet dinner at home. His wife and children are away, and Hansen relaxes in his trophy room, casually ignoring Debbie who is chained to a post. She has urinated on the floor, and as she cleans up the mess with a towel, Hansen's neighbor enters the house to deliver a plate of food. Hansen warns Debbie not to scream and leaves the trophy room to greet his neighbor. Hansen then takes Debbie to the airport, where he orders her into his plane. After landing in a remote spot in the bush, Hansen frees Debbie, letting her run in a panic through the woods before he shoots her with a [[.223 caliber]] [[Ruger Mini-14|rifle]]. He steals her necklace before finishing her off with a handgun.  Halcombe has a very difficult time assembling a case against Hansen. Because the evidence is circumstantial and Paulson is afraid to testify, the [[district attorney]] refuses to issue a search warrant. Paulson keeps falling back into the world of stripping and prostitution, despite Halcombe's efforts to keep her safe. At a [[strip club]], while she is trying to sell lap dances, she notices Hansen trolling for a new victim. Their eyes meet, a chase ensues, and Paulson barely escapes. The encounter makes Hansen nervous, and he hires Carl Galenski to find and kill Paulson. Carl approaches Paulson's erstwhile pimp Clate Johnson ([[50 Cent]]) and offers to forgive his sizable debt if Clate turns Paulson over to him.  Halcombe stakes out Hansen's house, causing Hansen to panic. Hansen gathers the evidence of his crimes, including the keepsakes from his victims, and flees with his son to the airport. He flies his plane to the bush and hides his keepsakes. Feeling that the chance to catch Hansen is slipping away, and with the victim count now at 17 girls, Halcombe forces the DA to issue a warrant. The search of Hansen's house yields no evidence, not even in his trophy room. Hansen agrees to be interrogated without a lawyer, but he is not yielding any new evidence. Halcombe arrests Hansen, but unless the police find new evidence, they will be unable to hold him.  Halcombe orders a second search of Hansen's house, which turns up a hidden cache of guns, including the .223 caliber rifle used in many of the murders. Under police watch at a safe location, Paulson slips away and returns to her life of prostitution. Clate picks her up and delivers her to Carl. When Clate attempts to rob Carl, Paulson uses the opportunity to escape, with Carl in pursuit. After making a call to Halcombe, Paulson is almost killed by Carl, but Halcombe rescues her just in time.  Halcombe uses a bracelet identical to one worn by one of the victims in order to trick Hansen into thinking the police have found where he hid the evidence in the bush. The bracelet, combined with the sight of Paulson in the interrogation room, enrages Hansen to the point that he incriminates himself. The epilogue states that Hansen confessed to the murder of 17 women and the kidnap and rape of another 30. He was charged with the abduction and rape of Cindy Paulson and the murders of Joanna Messina, Sherry Morrow, Paula Goulding and "Eklutna Annie". He was sentenced to 461 years plus life without parole. Robert Hansen died in 2014 at the age of 75. Only 11 of his victim's bodies were recovered. Jack Halcombe remained with the Alaska State Troopers and was promoted. He is now retired. Cindy Paulson now lives in the lower 48 and married with 3 children.  The film ends with a dedication and actual pictures of Hansen's victims.  
Fukrey
 The film is set in Delhi, where four "Fukrey" (a colloquial [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] term for slackers) boys,<ref></ref> come together to make easy money.  The group includes two school backbenchers, Hunny ([[Pulkit Samrat]]) and Choocha ([[Varun Sharma]]), who are perpetually dreaming of making it big. They want to get into the local college but don't have the grades. The college guard Pandit ([[Pankaj Tripathi]]) tells them that he can leak to them the class XII papers at a rate of  50,000 per subject. Through Pandit they meet Zafar ([[Ali Fazal]]), a former student of the college and a struggling musician. The fourth character is Lali ([[Manjot Singh]]), whose father runs a sweet shop. Lali is currently pursuing his degree through correspondence and like Hunny and Choocha also wants to get into the same college but doesn't have the marks. Pandit tells Lali to donate  250,000 in the college development fund to get a seat in return. Zafar's girlfriend, Neetu ([[Vishakha Singh]]), has broken up with him and his father is critically ill and needs money for his treatment.  The four meet up at Pandit's office where Hunny explains his scheme. Each night Choocha has a dream, which Hunny later interprets as a lottery number, which they buy and win. And for every rupee invested, they get ten rupees (basically ten times) back. However, since now they all together need a lot of money, they need someone to invest lakhs. So, on Zafar's insistence, Pandit takes them to meet a local gangster, Bholi Punjaban ([[Richa Chadda]]) where Hunny tells them their scheme. Bholi is ready to invest and Lali also gives his shop papers as mortgage. Bholi tells them to come the next day with the number. However, the same night everyone except Choocha falls asleep.  The next morning, Choocha narrates a fake dream which Hunny interprets and gets a number. They go to Bholi and tell the number. But it backfires and Bholi loses her money. Now to recover her money, she gives them a packet containing drug pills which Zafar, Hunny and Lali have to sell at a rave party the same night. She keeps Choocha as security with her. At the party, Police and Narcotics teams conduct a raid and Lali escapes with packet with the police chasing him. Lali manages to fool the police and reaches Neetu's place. He also sees Zafar there. Neetu throws the drugs down the drain just as the police are about to search her home. The police leave her place warning Lali. Zafar in the meanwhile tells the whole story to Neetu. Lali also calls Choocha telling him to run from Bholi's house which he succeeds in doing.  The next morning, all the five land up at Bholi's place. She gives them 24 hours to pay all the money due otherwise she would take the money by selling Lali's shop. The four are fighting at Zafar's place where Choocha tells them the truth about not seeing the dream. However, he tells them that he slept last night and he saw a dream. Zafar is not interested while Lali, Hunny and Neetu are. Hunny interprets the dream but they are short of cash even after Neetu is ready to give her savings. However, next morning Lali is able to borrow cash from a homeless man who used to remove parts from Lali's motorbike. They invest and win a huge amount.   They go to Bholi's house and give her the money. Then Hunny tells Bholi that he wants to sell those drug pills again and gives her an advance. Impressed Bholi goes inside and returns with the pills only to be caught red handed by the police and Narcotics who have raided her home. In a flashback, it is shown that while Hunny, Choocha, Lali and Neetu were investing the money, Zafar met the Narcotics division and made a plan to catch Bholi and also calls Neetu, Lali, Choocha and Hunny where they confess to the police. Now with Bholi behind bars, the police pardon the four and they are free.  Three months later, it is shown that Hunny and Choocha are entering the same college on horses as they had planned in the beginning of the film while Pandit is shocked and Lali, Zafar and Neetu are having a good laugh.

That afternoon, Takao meets Yukari at the park and greets her by reciting the 2,514th poem from the [[Man'yōshū]] Japanese poetry collection, the correct response to her tanka, which he found in a classic Japanese literature textbook. After getting soaked by a sudden thunderstorm, both head to Yukari's apartment and spend the afternoon together. When Takao confesses his love following dinner, Yukari is visibly moved, but then reminds him that she is a teacher and tells him that she is moving back to her home town on [[Shikoku]]. After Takao abruptly excuses himself, Yukari realizes her mistake and runs after him, finding him in the stairwell. Still upset, Takao angrily takes back what he had said and criticizes her for being so secretive and never opening up to him. Yukari embraces him and the two cry while she explains that their time together in the park had saved her. {{Quote box  |quote = <br> [A faint clap of thunder,<br>Even if rain comes or not,<br>I will stay here,<br>Together with you.]  |source = Takao in ''The Garden of Words''<br>from Man'yōshū, Book 11, verse 2,514  |align = right  |width = 250px  |salign = right }} The credits show Takao barely passing his final exams, but still working towards his goals, while Yukari moves back to Shikoku and resumes her teaching career. In a post-credits scene, Takao revisits the park that winter, reads a letter from Yukari, places her finished shoes on the bench and then vows that he will find her after he has made progress with his career.  In the manga illustrated by Midori Motohashi, scenes were either added or slightly modified from the anime version. For example, after the conclusion of the rainy season, Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the footwear college he wanted to attend, disappointing Yukari who had hoped to see him in the park. Also, at the conclusion of the story, Yukari is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her.

The Garden of Sinners: Future Gospel
 ===Möbius Ring=== ''Ring'' takes place in August 1998. After saving the life of a bystander who she happened to "see" the death of, Shizune Seo speaks to Mikiya Kokutou in a cafe over her own ability to foresee the future. Possessing the "Prediction" type of [[precognition]], she has to suffer the pain of seeing the death of loved ones twice, as well as the guilt of getting better grades than her peers even with no knowledge of the subject materials. Kokutou explains to her that her ability is not as extraordinary as she thinks, and that it is more like an extension of the kind of prediction that ordinary humans can do based on current information. Seo leaves on a happy note after warning Kokutou of the misfortune that he would encounter with Shiki.  Mitsuru Kamekura, under the name of Meruka Kuramitsu, performs bombings-for-hire, which always have a 100% rate of success. This is because he has the "Calculation" type of precognition, where he takes specific actions to ensure a specific future comes true. His right eye is able to foresee the future and his left eye shows the "path" that should be taken to achieve that future. Due to this ability, he falls under the impression that he is a slave to his own future. He performs bombings in order to achieve a future that even he cannot predict. When Shiki becomes a witness to one of his bombings, Mitsuru repeatedly attempts to kill her until she "kills" the vision of the future that he saw in his last attempt. This changes the future completely and Mitsuru's bomb unexpectedly goes off 5 minutes after the predicted time, allowing Shiki to catch him. Mitsuru is revealed to be a 14-year-old and Shiki lets him go after seeing that his right eye is of no use anymore. Mitsuru is forced to quit his bombing job and go to college.  ===Möbius Link=== ''Link'' takes place in 2008. Ten years after the events of ''Kara no Kyoukai'', the debt-riddled Mitsuru is hired by Shiki, who has become the head of the Ryougi family, partly thanks to Mana Ryougi, Shiki and Kokuto's daughter, liking a children's picture book he wrote and published in the meantime. Remarking that Mana saved him from a miserable fate, he takes her to see the Mother of Mifune, an old street [[fortune teller]] who predicted both SHIKI and Shiki's future many years ago.

After learning he needs the Garoken for his coat to recognize him, Kouga learns of Kakashi's plans to merge with the Maryu to become human. However, Judam took the Maryu scale needed for the fusion.

At the , before dangling her above the vortex the Maryu is to emerge from, Judam reveals to a humanized Meru her intention to exact revenge on humans even if she must sacrifice her only beauty by merging with the Maryu to do so. However, as Kakashi makes an attempt to reclaim the scale in a battle between his house and Judam's castle, Kiria saves Meru while Kouga sees the Garoken and reclaims the weapon. Seeing a ghost of Taiga appearing before him while regaining his coat, Kouga arrives to save Kakashi after his house is destroyed before making his way to the Green Castle to face Judam. Seeing her memory wiping against the human, Judam battles Kouga as she reveals that she will merge with the Maryu to enter the human world and destroy humanity for discarding her into the Promised Land.

After Kouga tells him that he was one of many who made him, Kakashi fades away with Kuromaru crying over his friend's departure. Once he arrives with Meru, revealed to be a pen in the human world, Kiria fades once his owner finds him alongside Kuromaru, who is a stuffed animal.  Destroying the Maryu's fang to Meru and Zaruba's shock, Kouga explains that he himself is the actual Fang of Sorrow. Meru is confused and Kouga explains to her that Gajari was a product of the Makai Knights' imagination and that the whole quest was for Kouga to understand the symbiosis of the dreamers and the dream. Gajari appears and congratulates Kouga for reaching that conclusion before transforming into a portal to send Kouga back to his world. Before he leaves, Kouga tells Meru that he knew the entire she was Rekka's dragonfish Kaoru as she returns to her true form to accompany Kouga.

Geethaanjali
   Anjali's ([[Keerthi Suresh]]) twin sister Geetha (Keerthi Suresh) has committed suicide. Anjali is betrothed to Anoop ([[Nishan (actor)|Nishan]]), a member of a prominent family. When her mother falls from a terrace and is paralysed, Anjali and Anoop go to her house in [[Arackal]]. Once there, the spirit of Geetha starts to haunt Anjali, which physically disturbs her. Within days of a series of horrifying incidents, Dr. Sunny Joseph ([[Mohanlal]]) arrives to treat Anjali and to help her out of her crisis. Because the house was haunted, the family buys a new house, and the future owner Vasu ([[K. B. Ganesh Kumar|Ganesh Kumar]]) claims that he had seen Geetha in a car and wrote down the number on a file. He says that he could give it to them the next day. But Vasu gets a phone call from Geetha's spirit asking him to meet her in the church next morning. He goes there and calls Dr. Sunny for help, but Vasu gets killed before he could help him. Sunny then spots a car driving out of the church and follows it, but the killer already got out of the car before he could spot him. Anjali  tells Sunny that Geeta had suicided as she had fallen in love with Anoop as well.  Gruesome events follow that, including the death of Thambichayan ([[Siddique (actor)|Siddique]]), a caretaker at Arakal. Dr. Sunny tells everyone that the ghost haunting Anjali is just a psychological effect and not real. For some reason he tries to postpone their marriage, but in vain. On their engagement day, Sunny grabs Anoop and shoves him to his car. He drives to a small graveyard. He tells Anoop that the so-called Anjali is actually Geetha, who has a criminal nature.  there is then a flaskback. Anjali and Anoop fall in love with each other, but Geetha mistakes that Anoop loves her. She loves Anoop. She was angry that Anoop is going to marry Anjali and not her, and eventually killed Anjali during an argument at a beach. Dr. Sunny shows Anjali's grave to Anoop and tells him the whole truth about her. The feeling of guilt in her mind led to seeing Anjali wherever she goes and all horrible incidents that happened were just an illusion seen by Geetha. Vasu was killed by Thambichayan, the only person who knew this apart from Geetha and her mother. It is also shown that it was actually Geetha who accidentally shoved her mother off the terrace, when she was told that Anjali's spirit was in the house. Thambi is later killed by Geetha so that there is no way anyone could find out the truth. He was still not sure, so he had tried to postpone their marriage until he had collected enough evidence to tell them.  Hearing this, Anoop storms into Anjali's house and accused her of taking Anjali's name. She tries to kill Anoop when he says he doesn't want her anymore. Fortunately, Sunny breaks into the house and rescues Anoop, but she takes a gun and aims at them. But an image of Anjali's spirit appears in Geetha's mind (on a mirror), and prevents her from shooting Anoop. Geetha is killed by a fire in the house and Anjali's 'spirit' watches over Geetha while she is dying.  Later, the grave of Geetha is built alongside Anjali's, and Anoop, his family and Thankappan ([[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]]) thanks Sunny for helping them.  
G.B.F. (film)
 Tanner Daniels ([[Michael J. Willett]]) and Brent Van Camp ([[Paul Iacono]]) are two closeted teenage [[high school]] students. Their school, North Gateway High in [[suburban]] [[New Jersey]], is dominated by three feuding cliques respectively led by the three most popular girls in school: Fawcett Brooks ([[Sasha Pieterse]]),  Caprice Winters ([[Xosha Roquemore]]), and 'Shley Osgood ([[Andrea Bowen]]). Brent hatches a plan to out himself at prom, which will make him the most popular boy at school since the latest trend in teen girl magazines is a G.B.F. – a gay best friend.  Meanwhile, Soledad Braunstein ([[JoJo (singer)|Joanna "JoJo" Levesque]]) is told by teacher Ms. Hoegel ([[Natasha Lyonne]]) that their Gay-Straight Alliance cannot exist if there is not a gay student in the club. Fawcett helps Soledad track down any potential gay students in the school by downloading a hook-up app for gay men. Brent previously persuaded Tanner to download the app on his phone and Soledad and her friends track Tanner down, forcing him to come out in front of the whole school. This attracts the attention of Fawcett, 'Shley, and Caprice, who all believe having a G.B.F. will secure their bid for prom queen.  Angry, Tanner confronts Brent for not also coming out and harshly outs Brent in front of his overbearing mother Mrs. van Camp ([[Megan Mullally]]) as revenge. Tanner quickly regrets it but Brent is no longer speaking to him and he reluctantly agrees to be friends with Fawcett, Caprice, and 'Shley, as the three girls protect him from homophobic bullying led by Fawcett's ex-boyfriend Hamilton (Brock Harris). However, the girls express their disappointment that Tanner is not like the stereotypical gay men they have seen on TV and make him over to their liking. Brent is annoyed at all the attention Tanner is getting, especially since Tanner has become nominated for Prom King. Likewise, 'Shley's conservative best friend McKenzie Pryce ([[Evanna Lynch]]) tries to persuade 'Shley that homosexuality is sinful.   At a party, Caprice sets Tanner up with Christian, a gay friend of hers, who is willing to be his prom date, but McKenzie refuses to allow Tanner to buy a couple's prom ticket, insisting they are only for male and female couples. Tanner agrees to join Soledad's GSA since she is the only one willing to help him fight the school policy and chastizes Fawcett, 'Shley, and Caprice for only caring about him when it benefits them. Chagrined, Fawcett also joins the GSA, but Ms. Hoegel quickly sees that Tanner is being used by the girls as a prize. Fawcett offers to hold an alternate prom, which pleases Tanner but enrages Caprice, who is annoyed that Tanner is endorsing Fawcett. Brent, believing that he is Tanner's prom date, is disappointed to learn that Tanner is going with Christian. He teams up with Caprice who plans on being queen of the school endorsed prom and offers to let him be her king. Meanwhile, Tanner and Brent's old friend group, Sophie (Molly Tarlov), and Glenn (Derek Mio), confront them and reveals how they are being used as tools, and Tanner asks Fawcett if this is true. Fawcett admits that she was but she now does consider him her real friend. She also tells Tanner she created the second prom to win since most of the school dislikes her. Tanner agrees to help her win prom queen after hearing this.  Meanwhile, Brent manages the publicity department for the school-sanctioned prom, and uses explicitly anti-gay posters. The principal cancels the school prom due to the ensuing public backlash  and supports the alternate prom. Tanner and Fawcett win prom king and queen and Tanner makes a speech at the dance, saying that he is tired of being seen as an object or a symbol and apologizes to his true friends for dumping them. Tanner dances with Brent and they make up, although they decide to stay friends instead of being romantically involved and risk a friendship that is already sturdy in its own right.  
Garo Gaiden: Tougen no Fue
 Long ago, a fallen Makai Priestess named Higari became too powerful and after tampering with powers no one should wield, she had to be stopped and was eventually sealed away by another Makai Priest named Sougen. Using his body and his own life, he created the Tougen Flute and sealed Higari shortly after his death. However, through a special ritual, those who seek Higari's power can resurrect her by replaying eight notes on the Tougen Flute to undo Sougen's seal. In the present, while Kouga Saejima has travelled to the Promised Land, two fallen priests will attempt to return Higari.  Agi and Magi are Makai Priestesses and lovers. Magi is suffering from an unspecified terminal illness and Agi swears to find a means to cure her so both of them can be together. By discovering the remains of Higari, the two summon her and use her power to sustain Magi. However, they must serve Higari. Once the two resurrect Higari, the duo are rewarded with immortality. To complete the resurrection though, they need to find a priest who can see the remains of Sougen as a flute and not a set of bones.  Eventually, Magi finds Rekka, while Agi finds Jabi; both priests are suitable candidates to return Higari. The dark duo tricks Jabi and Rekka, each telling them a partial truth of the Tougen Flute's nature and that a fallen priest seeks to use the flute for dark purposes. Through a series of misunderstandings (caused by the dark duo), Jabi and Rekka think of each other as the fallen priest. However, the two eventually figure out the truth and rejoin as allies.  In a final battle between Agi and Magi, the two are no match for Jabi and Rekka. Magi continues to be desperate to live and sacrifices Agi to complete Higari's resurrection. However, Higari does not honor her part of the bargain, and instead devours both Agi and Magi before attacking Rekka and Jabi. Ultimately, the two utilize a powerful Scarlet Bird Flame Formation and defeat Higari. Afterwards, the two place the Agi and Magi's wands over in a shrine and hope they find peace in the afterlife. The story ends with Jabi and Rekka leaving to watch the Makai Knight competition that occurs in ''[[Garo: Soukoku no Maryu]]''.  
Gåten Ragnarok
 Sigurd is an archaeologist studying the ancient Norse people known as the [[Vikings]], continuing work that he and his wife had pursued together before her death 5 years earlier. Now raising their two children alone, he is also facing friction at work around funding and support. His work up to this point - centering on aspects of the [[Oseberg Ship]] - has exhausted all of the available physical evidence. A meeting with funders in the [[Viking Ship Museum (Oslo) | Viking Ship Museum]] in [[Oslo]] intended to increase support for ambitious fieldwork that isn't well substantiated in [[Finnmark]] ends badly. However his enthusiasm is undimmed, partially out of loyalty to his wife. He refers often to a notebook she kept, filled with maps, drawings and [[runes | rune]] symbols related to the Norse culture.  A breakthrough takes place when his co-worker Allan brings to him a stone tablet he found in Finnmark - the particular area in Northern Norway they've been focusing on. They determine that it holds a code, and identify an empty space in the center of the stone as exactly fitting a remnant from the ship. After they retrieve the ship remnant from the museum, they're able to break the code enough to translate most of the runic symbols on it and interpret it as a map of an island in a lake which may hold extensive relics and/or treasure. He decides to start his kids' (Ragnhild and Brage) summer vacation with them up in that area - doing on a smaller scale the work that they had been pursuing, with Allen and a small crew from the region.     When Sigurd et al. land in Finnmark they meet up with Allan's field partner Elisabeth and hired guide Leif and set off hiking, eventually cutting an opening in a [[WWII]]-era fence erected by the Russians filled with signage warning against entering.  As they continue and Sigurd and Allen attempt to retrace the ancient journey, Leif brings them to the only lake for miles around, which surrounds a small island - identified as the "Eye of [[Odin]]". They are able to get across the water by means of a makeshift raft and oars, and they start to search for metal remnants. Exploring farther, Ragnhild finds a Russian barracks and Brage finds an immense cave.    The party all descends via ropes into the cave and easily find a Vikings helmet and other objects.  Brage finds an interesting cylindrical object in the shallow water and stows it in his rucksack for later.  The group's excitement is cut short when Leif demands the pieces at gunpoint and leaves, stranding the rest of the group  in the cave.  As he is paddling back across the lake in the raft he gets taken from below by an unseen thing.  Elisabeth climbs up the cave wall just using the crevices in the rock, and re-establishes the ropes so the others can climb out. Ragnhild asks Sigurd about the notebook and what is going on, and Sigurd explains that they think the [[Harald Granraude | King]]'s daughter [[Åsa Haraldsdottir of Agder|Åsa]] left the message on the stone about the events that took place here.   While Elisabeth, Brage and Ragnhild sleep in the bunker she found, Sigurd and Allen decide not to give up, and to go back in the cave alone.  They discover mass graves - not only of ancient skeletons but also including a Russian soldier - and realize that the stone tablet was not in fact a map but a warning, written by Odin's daughter, who refused to take part in Odin's attempt to kill the still-living creature. The creature appears out of the water - a huge pebble-skinned sea serpent - reminiscent of the dragon heads of [[Viking ships]]. Sigurd understands the last bits of the message that hadn't made sense before - it was this creature that was being described.  Meanwhile, Brage's "rock" is shown to be a hatching egg, from which emerges a baby serpent.  Elisabeth manages to capture it in an old metal box and latch it in.  The infant animal's squeals transmit down the bunker's cable into the water and alert an adult serpent who hauls the bunker into the lake, trying to rescue the baby.  Elisabeth and the children barely escape with everyone's efforts, inadvertently keeping the box with the baby creature with them.  Allan finds the box as he gathers tools for their escape from the island, figures out how momentous it would be to bring it back alive, and decides to try and secretly keep it while they escape. Elisabeth shoots a zipline across the water to the mainland, and they take turns crossing it. They barely escape another serpent attack by Allan shooting it in the eye.  They find that the serpents are not exclusively water bound as they continue to attack the group,   barely escaping back into the underground Russian bunker system. They find a ceiling door out and Allan is first through the door, but then demands that the box be handed up to him before he passes down the rope. Sigurd, horrified, tries to argue but is complying when the serpent bursts from the background and takes Allen, then crashes down into the bunker tunnels.  The children who were farther from the ceiling opening run out of sight but Elisabeth and Sigurd are knocked out cold.    As the serpent eventually corners Sigurd's children, he comes to and realizes that returning the baby serpent will end the danger.  The sound of the baby's squeals distracts the adult serpent from the children and it accepts the infant serpent from Sigurd, slithering off without further harm.  The remaining party of four follow in [[Åsa Haraldsdottir of Agder|Åsa]]'s footsteps, leaving the serpent(s) and the newborn creature in peace.

Gemini Rising
  In 2023, an unidentified spacecraft is found orbiting [[Neptune]] and an investigation is started. Meanwhile, Lisa (Amy Hathaway), a special agent for the [[DEA]] witnesses what she thinks is the death of her best friend, Manning (John Savage), during a drug raid. She quits her job to become a dance teacher, but is soon recruited again for a secret mission, and shipped off to a small remote island.  On the island she finds out the secret mission is an investigation into the alien spacecraft that was found orbiting Neptune. She discovers two aliens were found; one small, one larger and of a different species, with the smaller alien (which looks somewhat like an underdeveloped foetus with typical 'grey alien' large eyes) controlling the much larger and robust one through [[telepathy]]. The team has nicknamed the larger alien 'Spike' due to its spiky and ominous appearance. Later, in attempting to escape or explore her surroundings, Lisa has a surprise meeting with her old friend Manning whom she had thought was dead. After a discussion with Colonel Cenula (Lance Henriksen) it comes to light that Lisa's sister also worked on the alien investigation but was killed through unknown circumstances (later revealed to be due to a mistaken overdose of the serum they're trying to develop), and that Lisa was chosen because of the natural psychic/telepathic link she shared with her twin sister.  After seeing the smaller alien, which is imprisioned in a glass chamber, and forming a chance telepathic connection with it, Lisa is tested for a mental connection with her twin sister by Dr. Bainbridge (Dave Vescio). During the investigation Lisa meets Plummer (Brian Krause) and builds a friendship with him which soon blossoms into romance. Meanwhile, Colonel Cenula, Manning, and the doctor are working together to try and develop a serum to control people using the alien's telepathic technology. The Colonel sells this mind control technology to a Korean billionaire for $4 billion. Lisa learns of the Colonel's plans, steals the access codes to the money/account, and attempts to flee the island.  Colonel Cenula starts a hunt for Lisa and sends Plummer after her, but with Manning controlling him through their telepathy technology. Manning finds Lisa and attacks her but Lisa soon discerns it is really Manning via his obnoxious behavior, and begs Plummer to fight the mind control. Ultimately Plummer regains enough control to kill himself rather than risking harming Lisa. Enraged, Cenula kills Manning with a shot to the head for failing him. He then calls for a full evacuation of the island and releases the large alien, forcing Doctor Bainbridge to control 'Spike' to pursue Lisa. Fleeing from the alien, Lisa runs into a mine field and the alien sets off the mines causing a landslide, burying them both. The Colonel presumes they're dead, but both Lisa and the large alien are still alive as the little alien had managed to wrest control from the doctor and used "Spike" to protect Lisa from being crushed. The small alien informs Lisa telepathically that it wants her to help free both aliens.  With help from the aliens Lisa defeats the military army on the island and they both confront the Colonel Cenula. Lisa begs him to stop the torture and release the aliens. When he emphatically refuses the large alien disarms him and rips him to shreds. Lisa frees both aliens and they escape as the island is set to self-destruct. The aliens thank and warn Lisa to quickly run, then take to their spaceship.  Lisa is rescued from the island via a helicopter, relaying to the superior officer therein that the corrupt colonel and the experiment have been destroyed, that the aliens are 'gone,' and that it's best they take off before the whole island blows up. Meanwhile, somewhere below, in a somewhat cryptic scene, Dr. Bainbridge is seen rowing down a river with a metal suitcase and what appears to be the comatose body of Lisa's twin sister.  As the entire island blows, a spaceship takes off back into space...  
Gay Meets Girl
 Tim den Besten (age 26) and Nicolaas Veul (age 29) are documentary makers and friends. They are both [[gay men]], or at least, they think they are gay. Tim and Nicolaas set out to test and explore the boundaries of their [[Human male sexuality|sexualities]]. Tim is a gold-star gay man (a gay man who has never had sex with a woman) and decides that he wants to lose his [[Virginity#Definitions of virginity loss|heterosexual virginity]] to a woman. The documentary filmmakers want to explore whether or not [[Innate bisexuality|"everyone is bisexual"]], as is common in the [[Homosexual behavior in animals|animal world]], as well as what the boundaries to gay male sexuality are. Tim wants to find out if his [[sexual orientation]] is as fixed as he believed it to be or if he might not be as gay as he thought.  The documentary opens with Nicolaas interviewing Tim about the issues of homosexuality and sex with women. Nicolaas interrogates Tim, asking him what it means to be "[[gay]]" and what Tim's own "gayness" entails. Nicolaas asks Tim if he currently sleeps with women or slept with women in the past. When Tim explains that he has never been with a woman, Nicolaas asks him why he has never considered it. Nicolaas further relates to Tim that sleeping with women was surprisingly enjoyable and that trying sex with women helped him realize he was not as gay as he believed himself to be. Nicolaas tells Tim that he wants him to have sex with a woman, causing Tim to repeatedly decline the suggestion and claim he would never sleep with a woman. Nicolaas insists that Tim should sleep with a woman, engaging in a [[Socratic method|Socratic-style]] debate with Tim about the merits of sex with women, with Tim eventually [[Seduction|relenting]] and coming to the conclusion that gay men having sex with women is the correct thing to do. Tim further adds that he has no reason not to try it and that sleeping with a woman would give him a better understanding of his own sexuality. Nicolaas relates that after trying so hard to be gay, including [[coming out]] to parents and society as well as being involved in the [[gay community]], it can be very difficult for a gay man to "go back" and start sleeping with women again, but that the stigma shouldn't deter gay men from sleeping with women.  During the documentary, Tim and Nicolaas visit a [[sex coach]] to give them lessons on [[heterosexual intercourse|heterosexual intimacy]] and [[female sexuality]] and help prepare Tim for his [[Deflower|heterosexual deflowering]]. They also visit a [[bonobo]] habitat to learn about the bisexual behavior of the primate species. They visit with science journalist Asha ten Broeke, who offers her view that all human beings, including all gay men, are bisexual.<ref></ref> Tim arranges to meet a [[Pornographic film actor|pornographic film actress]] in France who wants to have sex with an openly gay man. [[Judy Minx]], a French porn actress, tells Tim she has only ever had sex with [[straight men]], but is enthusiastic about having sex with a gay man in order to explore the boundaries of homosexuality and go beyond homosexuality's [[Heterosexual–homosexual continuum|binary]] limitations. The film culminates with Tim losing his gold-star by having [[Unsimulated sex|unsimulated]] heterosexual intercourse with the French woman, while Nicolaas films the sexual encounter. During their encounter, Tim tries vaginal sex, performs cunnilingus and receives heterosexual fellatio for the first time. Afterwards, Tim [[high-fives]] the woman he just slept with and gives the [[thumbs-up sign]] to Nicolaas, happy and excited that he'd just finished having his first straight sex. Nicolaas is smiling and asking how things went, while Tim explains to Nicolaas that the sex was excellent and he was surprised by how easy it was for him to perform heterosexual sex. One month later Nicolaas interviewed Tim again, with Tim reiterating that he was glad he tried heterosexual sex and still considered it to have been a very enjoyable experience. However, Tim makes clear that his homosexuality has not been "[[Sexual orientation change efforts|cured]]" as he is still sexually and romantically attracted to men.  It was the goal of Tim and Nicolaas to reject the [[compartmentalization (psychology)|compartmentalization]] of human sexuality into the categories of "gay" or "straight" by exploring sexual fluidity and [[bi-curiosity]]. Tim believes the film was a success because he accomplished what he set out to do by answering whether a gay man could have satisfactory sex with a woman. The answer was "yes", because Tim was able to easily have sex with a woman and enjoy the experience. Tim described his experience of sleeping with a woman and losing his gold-star by saying, "Can you be gay and still have satisfying sex with a girl? I did it and it was quite a revelation."<ref></ref>  
Getaway (film)
 Washed up former race driver Brent Magna ([[Ethan Hawke]]) arrives home to find his house ransacked and his wife, Leanne, missing. He then receives a phone call from a mysterious man known only as The Voice ([[Jon Voight]]), who reveals himself as the kidnapper of Magna's wife. The man tells Magna that he must follow a set of instructions precisely in order to be reunited with his wife. The Voice orders Magna to steal a specially customized [[Shelby Mustang]] from a parking garage. The Voice warns Magna that if he does not follow the instructions or is caught, Leanne will die.  Magna sees two police officers chasing him and speeds off. Being a skilled driver, he is able to evade them with ease, eventually setting a trap to cause one to crash into the other. Despite more police cars joining the pursuit, Magna is able to out maneuver them. Magna is again contacted by The Voice, who directs him towards his next task. He tells Magna to speed up and take some perilous turns, eventually being forced to crash through a park, ice rink, and shopping center, nearly killing numerous civilians in the process. The Voice calls to congratulate him and tells him to keep moving. Magna is ordered to crash into a water truck and run through a red lighted intersection, causing accidents in his wake. Magna is then ordered to park in a construction zone and await further instructions. While Magna is waiting, a young woman, who is armed with a gun, known only as The Kid ([[Selena Gomez]]) attempts to steal Magna's car, but Magna overpowers her and takes her gun, and then takes her with him on The Voice's orders. The Voice then orders Magna to kill The Kid. Magna refuses, and The Voice says that keeping her alive was the right choice, as he will need her help. As Magna and The Kid drive off, with more police in pursuit, she reveals that the Mustang is, in fact, her car, and that she was told, by a police officer, it was stolen. Magna realizes that their meeting was orchestrated by The Voice.  After the Voice assigns Magna another destructive task, The Kid reveals herself as a skilled computer hacker and the daughter of the C.E.O of a large bank. The Voice contacts Magna again and orders him to upload the contents of a USB flash drive into a computer before 11:30 pm. Upon reaching the designated area, a power plant, The Kid attempts to hack the computer in order to contact the police. She appears to succeed, only for The Voice to reveal that he set up the computer as a trap for her, framing her as the person who destroyed the plant. The plant suddenly overloads and explodes, blacking out a large portion of the city.  The Voice gives Magna his final task: to rob the bank owned by The Kid's father. The Kid points out that there is no actual money at her father's bank; it is an investment firm which holds all of its assets on computers. Gradually, the duo realizes that they are not actually committing a heist, but are merely providing a distraction for the police while The Voice executes the real robbery and subsequently frames them for it.  As The Voice's men attempt to commandeer an armored car carrying sensitive hard drives, Magna surprises and overpowers them, succeeding in taking the drives. Now fleeing from the police and The Voice's men, Magna calls The Voice and offers to release the hard drives in exchange for his wife. The Voice accepts and directs him to an airplane hangar. While it appears that Leanne is about to be returned, The Kid deduces that The Voice is planning to have them all killed when the deal is done. As Magna, Leanne, and The Kid attempt to escape, the police arrive, and in the ensuing chaos, a man Magna assumes to be The Voice grabs The Kid and drives off with her. Magna leaves Leanne with the police and pursues.  Following a high speed chase, both cars are destroyed, Magna rescues The Kid, and the police arrest the mysterious man. Leanne and Magna are reunited. However, Magna receives a phone call from The Voice, revealing that the man who was busted was no more than a decoy. The Voice thanks Magna for his help and hangs up. It is revealed that The Voice was in fact controlling the entire operation from a bar in the United States. He checks his balance, revealing that almost 3 billion dollars have been transferred to his account, and walks out of the bar.

Get a Horse!
 The film begins in 2.35:1 and color when the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]] logo is shown, and then switches to a smaller 1.33:1 aspect ratio for the black and white sequence. [[Mickey Mouse]] walks from his house and spots [[Horace Horsecollar]] pulling a hay [[wagon]] with all his friends playing music. He hops on the wagon and helps up [[Minnie Mouse]] and [[Clarabelle Cow]] (who jumped on his leg) onto the wagon. Just then, [[Pete (Disney)|Peg-Leg Pete]] shows up in his [[Decrepit car|jalopy]], his horn bellows in a high pitched voice "Make way for the future!". Pete spots Minnie and gives her a flirty gaze, so Mickey puts Clarabelle in the gaze in Minnie's place much to Pete's disgust and horror. Angry at being pranked, Pete kidnaps Minnie and rams his car into the wagon, sending Mickey and Horace flying towards the screen. Seeing Mickey and Horace bounce off the fabric, Pete hurls them even harder into the screen until they burst into the modern movie theater as the film switches back to 2.35:1 and color. As Pete taunts Mickey from inside the screen and closes the hole in the screen, Mickey tries to get back into his world, pulling back the curtains to reveal a wider screen. Horace then walks onto the stage wearing a [[Captain America]] T-shirt, glasses and carrying a smartphone, [[The Hershey Company|Hershey's]] [[Milk Duds]] and [[popcorn]]. Mickey decides to use Horace as a mock [[biplane]] to fly around the theater and fire at Pete with Hershey's Milk Duds. When they crash land onto the stage, Mickey finds the smartphone Horace brought (and apparently stole) onto the stage, so he calls Pete on his [[Candlestick telephone|candlestick phone]] and Horace sprays foam from a [[fire extinguisher]] into the smartphone and out from Pete's phone.  Pete's car then lands in a frozen lake and the screen fills with water, giving Mickey the idea to poke a hole in the screen with his tail and let the water leak out, causing Pete, Minnie and the other cartoon animals to flood out onto the stage. Minnie is unsure about the new area, asking Mickey if they've landed in [[Poughkeepsie]]. Mickey and Minnie's reunion is short-lived, however, as Pete gives chase to the characters in and out of the screen until he kidnaps Minnie again, punches Mickey onto a support beam and nails the screen shut. Horace and the others decide to swing from the beam and try to break through the screen like a [[wrecking ball]], but the plan only manages to flip the screen upside-down, causing Pete to fall from the ground.  Mickey and the others flip it again and Pete lands on the ground, his car crashing down on him. Getting an idea, Minnie encourages Mickey to flip the screen again, this time having Pete land on a [[cactus]], which sets off a chain of events. First, Pete gets an [[electrical shock]] on some [[telephone line|telephone cables]], then he has his face get hit by all the steps on a [[ladder]], lands face first in the mud, and gets his rear end poked on a [[pitchfork]], and falls onto a [[seesaw]], where he gets hit on the head by numerous tools. Then one of the tools, a [[sledgehammer]], rams the pitchfork deeper into his rear end. Finally, the sledgehammer falls on the opposite side of the seesaw, where Pete is launched, also making the pitchfork fly off of his butt, and lands face first in his jalopy.  Horace, Mickey, and Minnie begin to laugh hysterically at Pete's pain. Suddenly, Horace's hand gets stuck behind the screen due to him pounding the screen. Mickey tries to pull him out, but only succeeds by spinning the screen horizontally like a [[Flip book|flip-book]]. To Mickey's realization, it rewound the scene. Seeing this as an opportunity, Mickey and Horace begin spinning the screen around like a flip-book until Pete is completely knocked out.  Minnie then drives Pete's car with Pete in tow and completely tears the screen down, revealing the black-and-white world in color for the first time. Mickey and his friends enter their world again and dance for a moment while [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]] briefly peeks out from the side of the screen. The horn that was on Pete's car tells an unconscious Pete, "Ah, get a horse!", before Mickey and his friends bring down a new screen, then Mickey waves goodbye to Pete and the audience, and he and Minnie give Horace a kiss on the cheeks as Horace blushes. As the [[Iris shot|iris]] closes, Pete, who has woken up by now, tries to get back in through the screen, but gets his head (and half his body) stuck. Seconds later, the flap on Pete's pants open up to reveal the words "THE END" and Pete bellows "Hey!!", as the screen cuts to the credits. After the credits, the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] logo is in black-and-white, and Clarabelle jumps over the castle, making the arch with her milk.

The movie then tracks back forty hours earlier, showing a woman named Brooke jogging in the woods.  She is joined by local deputy Max, and the two make love in the woods.  Elsewhere, a small group of military men set up a mobile missile launcher on the side of a hill.  The men have been tasked with shooting down an orbiting satellite with a missile.  As the missile is launched, the satellite is struck by a [[meteorite]] and explodes, with the meteorite continuing on and striking the Earth.  Brooke returns home and meets with her parents, while Max heads back to the sheriff's office.  There he learns from fellow deputy Davidson that the meteorite has caused a brush fire.  Davidson tells him that the military advised them to avoid the area due to possible chemical contamination, but the fire department is dispatched to dig [[firebreak|fire breaks]] and contain the area.  One of the firefighters discovers a piece of satellite wreckage with an odd green ooze attached to it and picks it up; later he is shown becoming ill.  That evening Brooke's friend Karen and her boyfriend Chad are spending an evening together when Karen's daughter becomes frightened by a bloodied man walking in their yard.  Chad goes out to investigate and doesn't return, prompting Karen to investigate.  She comes across his severely mutilated corpse in the yard, which is examined the next morning by Davidson.  A preliminary autopsy performed by Davidson, who is also the town's physician, determines that Chad was killed and eaten by more than one human.  He also discovers that Chad's [[hypothalamus]] is growing at an exponential rate despite his being dead.  Davidson then discovers a bacterium in the corpse he has never seen before, prompting him to speculate that the bacterium is the result of [[interplanetary contamination]].  Brooke rides her bike home from town and discovers a horde of bloodied strangers attacking her family.  The attackers act like [[zombie (fictional)|zombies]], chasing down and feeding on anyone they encounter.  The infected kill Brooke's mom and brother before she manages to escape.  Her father also makes it out, deciding to jog into town.  Max encounters the infected at a campsite and is forced to abandon his patrol car and walk back to the sheriff's office.  He meets up with a battered Davidson, who is attacked and bitten.  During the melee, Davidson bites Max on his leg and apparently infects him as well.  Brooke stumbles across the military man in the hazard suit shown in the beginning and together they make it back to the armored vehicles.  Brooke uses a satellite phone to alert the military to the danger before being forced to flee alone.  An infected Max drives another police cruiser out of town and crashes it on the side of the road.  He climbs into the back, trapping himself in the car.  Brooke finds the cruiser and gets inside, where Max confesses his love for her and shows her an engagement ring he bought for her.  The infected surround the cruiser and attempt to get in.  When they break the windows to the back, Brooke and Max decide to try and fight their way out.  The movie ends as the two rush out of the cruiser shooting, leaving the viewer to speculate as to their fate.

The Golden Dream
 Like [[La jaula de oro (1987 film)|the 1987 film]], and the [[Jaula de oro (song)|song]], the plot concerns [[immigration to the United States]] from Latin American countries.  However, unlike the earlier film that concerned itself with a successful and middle-aged Mexican immigrant, the plot of this film deals with younger undocumented immigrants.  Samuel, Sara and Juan, three teenagers from Guatemala, decide to leave poverty by going to the United States.  After crossing the Mexican border by boat, they find another immigrant, a [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil]] native called Chauk who does not know Spanish but is able to befriend Sara.  When they arrive in the town of Chiapas, they busk for money to eat and drink but are later caught by Mexican Immigration Police agents, who steal Juan's boots and threaten Chauk with a gun, before deporting all of them back to Guatemala.  They are deposited by the border to Mexico and so they are able to easily find a way back across it, but at this point Samuel decides to stay in Guatemala.  Juan dislikes the idea of going with Chauk, but Sara forces him to go on with him and the three continue on the road to the north.  While riding on a train to northern Mexico, the train is stopped by the Mexican Army who attempt to capture the immigrants; however, the trio manage to escape and are offered refuge and work by a sugar-cane farmer.  During a party at the plantation, the three of them drink and dance until Sara and Juan begin kissing, and end up leaving Chauk alone.   The next morning Chauk feels betrayed by Sara, but decides to remain with them and continue the ride to the north.  During the trip, they are detained by drug traffickers, who steal the belongings of the passengers and kidnap the females.  Sara is soon recognized as a girl and is taken by the traffickers; when Juan and Chauk resist, Juan is seriously injured and Chauk is knocked unconscious.  Chauk wakes up and tends to Juan's injuries.  When Juan recovers, both recognize that they can do nothing for Sara and decide to continue their voyage to the north.  During the next train ride, they meet a teenager from Guatemala that offers them jobs, but in reality it is just a trick and the boy delivers them into the hands of a group of criminals.  When the leader learns that Juan is from his same hometown, Juan is released.  Juan later returns and offers the leader the American Dollars he had saved before the journey, in order to free Chauk.      Juan and Chauk arrive in Mexicali, where they get help from a group of immigrant traffickers to cross the border between Mexico and United States. The traffickers take the boys across the border, but leave the two on their own in the desert, where Chauk is killed by an immigrant hunter.

Separately, Jack McClane, who has been arrested after an assassination attempt, negotiates for a shorter sentence by offering to testify against Komarov. Meanwhile, Jack's father, [[NYPD]] Detective [[John McClane]], who has not been in touch with his son for several years, has learned his son is in trouble and, taken to the airport by his daughter Lucy McClane, flies to Russia to help. As John arrives and approaches the courthouse where Komarov is on trial, a bomb explosion, orchestrated by Chagarin's henchman Alik, occurs in the courthouse and Jack breaks free with Komarov. Seeing his son, John confronts him, but their dispute is cut short as Alik and his men chase them in a US [[Cougar (vehicle)|Cougar]] [[MRAP]] through the streets of Moscow. John, Jack, and Komarov manage to escape.  Hiding in a safe house, John finds out that his son is a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer and has been on an undercover operation for the past three years. Jack's partner, Collins, demands the file's location from Komarov so that the CIA can bring Chagarin down. Komarov eventually agrees on condition that he and his daughter are given safe passage out of Russia. Collins is eventually shot and killed while the McClanes and Komarov come under heavy gunfire from Chagarin's men, but they escape. They make their way to a hotel in the city to fetch the key to the vault containing the file. There they meet up with Komarov's daughter, Irina, as earlier planned. John grows suspicious of her shifty behavior, and is proven correct when Alik and his men burst in and tie John and Jack up, while Komarov is taken as a hostage, and Irina confesses to informing on them for the "millions of dollars" to be gained. Jack breaks free of his ties and kills the nearest guards using a Russian gun-knife, allowing the two to kill most of the men. Alik and Irina, with Komarov still their hostage, return in a [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter and try to kill them, but the two escape a second time.  That night, the two steal a car full of firearms and drive to [[Pripyat]], [[Ukraine]], where the vault with the file is located. However, Komarov, Irina, and Alik have preceded them. In a twist, the file is revealed never to have existed: the drawer with the file supposedly inside is, in fact, a secret passage to a [[Chernobyl]] vault containing [[euro sign|€]]1 billion worth of [[Uranium-235|weapons-grade uranium]]. Once inside the vault, Komarov kills Alik and calls Chagarin to gloat and to listen as Chagarin is killed by a henchman of Komarov's.  At this point, John and Jack enter the vault, discover Komarov's true plot, and capture him. Irina, with another henchman, comes to her father's aid. As they attempt to escape, Jack follows Komarov, while John goes after Irina, who is escaping on a [[Mil Mi-26]] helicopter. Irina tries to protect her father by firing the helicopter's guns at Jack. John is able to bring the helicopter out of balance by driving a truck out of the hangar section, still shackled by a chain, via the open rear ramp; he is later thrown off into the building. Komarov remarks that Jack will get to watch his father die, prompting Jack to hurl him off the rooftop into the path of the spinning helicopter rotors, killing him. As Jack and John reunite inside the building, Irina tries to avenge her father by ramming the helicopter, now out of ammunition, into the building in a suicide attack. Father and son survive by leaping off the building into a large pool of water, as the helicopter crashes and explodes, killing Irina. In the end, the McClanes return home and reunite with Lucy on the tarmac.

The next morning, Leela is forcibly taken back home by Bhavani, her cousin, while Ram is hailed as a hero by the Rajadis for soiling Leela's reputation. He is rewarded by being made the new chieftain of the Rajadis.   Meanwhile, Dhankor Baa arranges the engagement of Leela and the NRI, much to the chagrin of the pair.

During [[Dusshera]], as the [[Ramlila]] parade is ending, many of the Rajadis are killed and the village is on the brink of war, which Ram senses. Ram and Leela decide that they are each the other's soulmate and  shoot one another dead, all the while oblivious to the fact that Dhankor Baa has undergone a change of heart and has killed Bhavani, ordering that peace be made with the other clan.

Goodbye World
 The film begins with James' recitation of a [[Henry David Thoreau]] quote, after which he states that he saw the oncoming societal collapse and moved his free-spirited wife Lily and young daughter Hannah off the grid.  A montage shows his college friends just before the collapse: Benji, a radical activist, lectures at a college and has sex with Ariel, one of the students; Nick, James' former business partner, and his wife Becky are en route to James' house for a meeting; Laura, formerly a Senator's aide, is rejected from a job at a non-profit due to a past public scandal; and Lev, a computer hacker, prepares to commit suicide until he hears that a computer virus may be responsible for the collapse.  All converge at James' remote Mendocino house, where Benji explains that violent riots have broken out across the nation.  When Laura and James ride into town, he asks if she was forewarned of the attacks.  Although she initially denies it, she admits that [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] contacted her about Lev, whom they suspected to be involved with the virus.  In town, bikers have taken over the local store and gouge the locals.  Laura flashes her breasts for supplies, and they quickly leave when they see a local man bullied mercilessly by thugs. National Guardsmen visit the house and request its use as a base of operations.  Becky objects on Constitutional grounds, and James asks them to leave. At the house, Laura decodes a repeated message and explains that the United States is now under martial law.  At the same time, old rivalries flare up, and the friends begin infighting over unresolved issues from the past.  Becky, who never felt accepted by the others, argues with the others over her Libertarian political beliefs, and James and Nick argue over a business-related lawsuit.  The infighting intensifies, and, after Ariel and Benji break up, Lily kicks out Ariel, who has become disruptive.  At the same time, Nick and Lily explore their feelings for each other, and Lily demands a divorce from James, who responds that he has more important things to worry about than his marriage.  Ariel goes to live with James' neighbors, who have taken in the Guardsmen.  Concerned that James is hoarding medicine, the Guardsmen return and demand James give them his supplies.  When he resists, they violently grope Laura and threaten to kill Lev.  James backs down, and they leave after he promises to deliver them tomorrow.  Lev reveals that he was partially responsible for the computer virus; in Libya, he constructed a cell phone virus that could overload an entire nation's grid.  When he became suspicious of the motivations of his employers, he left before it was completed.  As a part of his suicide attempt, he used his virus to say goodbye to the entire country; when Lily hacked into his computer, it released the virus' source code into the wild, and terrorists were able to mount an attack on the country's technological infrastructure.  Later, Becky finds Benji in the woods, stuck in a bear trap.  Becky, an animal lover, tells Benji how she was forced to hunt and brutally kill rabbits for food in her childhood, and he tells her about Nick and Lily.  Lev and Laura talk about his involvement, and she shows indecision over whether to turn him in to the authorities.  Nick and Lily briefly leave together, but they return when Lily convinces Nick that they should be friends and not lovers.  James visits his neighbors and refuses to hand over his supplies, though he offers to consider any requests.  The Guardsmen cite James' failure to help the bullied local and his refusal to share his supplies as they prepare to execute him.  Laura saves him by killing one of the Guardsmen, donates half of their supplies to the other camp, and promises that they will work together from now on.  Nick rejoins the camp, James and Lily reconcile, Laura and Lev become a couple, and Becky leaves with Benji to help others in need.  
The Grandmaster (film)
 The film narrates the life of the [[Wing Chun]] grandmaster [[Ip Man]], beginning in the 1930s in [[Foshan]] and moving on to cover his flight to [[Hong Kong]] after the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], and the events leading up to his death.  The movie begins with Ip Man reflecting on martial arts, and then cuts to a scene of a fight under the rain between Ip and a dozen combatants. Ip Man wins, and experiences flashbacks of his life, from his early training at the age of seven to his induction into martial arts by his master [[Chan Wah-shun]], and his marriage to his wife Cheung Wing-sing.  Ip Man's peaceful existence is threatened by the arrival of Gong Yutian, the [[Wudang chuan|Wudang Boxing]] martial arts grandmaster from northern China, who announces that he has already retired and has appointed Ma San as his heir in the North. He then concedes that the South should have its own heir. A flurry of discussions and fights erupt as various masters attempt to challenge Gong, but they are all barred by Ma San. As the Southern masters are deliberating on a representative, Gong Yutian's daughter Gong Er arrives and she tries to convince her father not to continue the fight, as she feels they are all unworthy. Meanwhile, the Southern masters decide on Ip Man to represent them, and Ip proceeds to be tested by three Southern masters before he challenges Gong Yutian. However, the "fight" between Ip and Gong turns out to be actually an exchange of philosophical ideas. Gong declares Ip the winner and returns to northern China. However, Gong Er sets out to regain her family's honour by challenging Ip Man, and they agree that if anything breaks, Ip loses. "Kung Fu is about precision", so whoever breaks a piece of furniture during the fight will be the loser.  An intense fight breaks out between Ip Man and Gong Er, which concludes with victory for Gong because Ip broke a step at the very end (albeit while 'saving Gong from falling'). Ip and Gong then part on friendly terms, with Ip saying he wants a rematch.  Ip Man and Gong Er keep in contact after parting ways by exchanging letters, and Ip intends to bring his family with him to northern China, but his plans are disrupted by the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937. During the war, Ip Man and his family descend into poverty and he loses his two daughters due to starvation. In the meantime, in northern China, Ma San becomes a ''[[hanjian]]'' and ends up killing Gong Yutian. When Gong Er returns, she confronts her elders for forsaking her father but they tell her that her father's final wish was for her to be happy and not to seek vengeance. Gong Er refuses to accept that, instead, she vows to never teach, marry or have children, and devotes her entire life for vengeance.  Ip Man moves to Hong Kong in the hope of starting a career as a martial arts teacher, but ends up facing all sorts of challenges because there were also numerous other martial arts masters. He defeats them soundly and earns a reputation. He meets Gong Er again on Chinese New Year's Eve 1950 and asks her for a contest one more time while implying that she should start rebuilding her martial art school. But Gong Er refuses, stating that many martial arts disappeared in the course of history; and that hers would not be the only one. A flashback 10 years earlier shows a confrontation between Gong Er and Ma San at a train station on Chinese New Year's Eve 1940, and Gong defeats Ma after a brutal and intense fight. However, Gong herself is heavily injured and loses her desire to use martial art.  The film then fast-forwards to 1952, when Ip Man and Gong Er meet each other for the last time. Gong confesses to Ip that she has had romantic feelings for him right from the beginning. She dies shortly after. Ip explains in a voice over that in the fight with Ma San, Gong was injured so badly she turned to opium for the pain and this was her downfall. The final scenes offer a visual montage as Ip Man's school flourishes, including a statement that Ip made Wing Chun popular worldwide and his most famous student was [[Bruce Lee]]. Off screen, it is stated that Ip Man died in 1972.

The Grand Seduction
 The story begins with Murray French as a young boy, narrating about his father, one of the fishermen in the small community of Tickle Head, [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. Murray feels that the community has a shared sense of purpose and an ethic of hard work, and notes his parents' domestic bliss.  Several years later, the men of Tickle Head (including Murray) line up at the town's post office to receive welfare cheques from post office clerk Kathleen and cash them with bank branch manager Henry Tilley. Adding to the indignity, Murray's wife is separating from him for a job in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]]. At a town meeting, the mayor tells Murray that a petrochemical factory was being negotiated for the town, but that the company requires a doctor to be resident there, and the community has been trying unsuccessfully for 8 years to find one. Murray resolves that the factory, and thus the doctor, are the solution to his troubles. He later observes the mayor surreptitiously leaving town with his family for a job in St. John's as well.  In St. John's, Dr. Paul Lewis, a plastic surgeon, is flying home when a security agent finds cocaine in his luggage. The agent is the former mayor of Tickle Head, who makes a deal with Lewis. In exchange for overlooking the possession of cocaine, Dr. Lewis agrees to live in the town for one month. Murray arranges for the "seduction" of Dr. Lewis to a long-term contract, lying to the townspeople that this will guarantee the choice of Tickle Head as the location for the new factory. As part of the ruse, he convinces the townspeople to pretend to play cricket, the doctor's favourite sport, and also taps the doctor's phone to learn more ways to entice him to stay.  The executive of the petrochemical company visits the town and tells Murray, posing as the mayor, that the rival town of St. Anne has made a more attractive offer, including a bribe. The executive demands a bribe of $100,000 before the plant will be awarded to Tickle Head, as well as expressing concern about a population in Tickle Head that is too small for the factory. Henry's bank denies the request for a loan, and when Henry presses the issue, tells him that he could be replaced with an ATM. This leads Henry to approve the loan against bank instructions, knowing he will be fired.  Meanwhile, the town's deception and favourable attention do persuade Lewis to stay, helped also by the discovery that his fiancée Helen has been cheating on him with his best friend. But when he accepts the position in front of the whole town, in a speech praising their authenticity and integrity, Murray ashamedly lies and tells him that another doctor has already accepted the position. Kathleen then tells Lewis the truth, causing Lewis to angrily confront Murray just as the executive is signing the paperwork for the factory. After an impassioned speech by Murray, the doctor agrees to stay, and the company agrees to build the factory.  Some time later, the factory has opened, bringing dignity to the town again. Murray has been reunited with his wife, and there is a job for Henry, who has been replaced with an ATM. The film ends with a satisfied ending similar to Murray's opening flashback.

Grand Piano (film)
 Tom Selznick was an up-and-coming concert pianist until he developed [[stage fright]] while attempting to play a complex piece, "La Cinquette". Five years later, he is slated to appear in [[Chicago]] for a comeback performance, dedicated to the memory of his late mentor, pianist and composer Patrick Godureaux (who composed "La Cinquette"). Godureaux posthumously acquired massive media coverage due to the mysterious disappearance of his vast fortune. Tom's return to the stage is prompted by the encouragement of his actress-singer wife, Emma.  As Tom arrives at the theater, his friend Norman (conductor for the evening) offers Tom assurance that he will perform well. Shortly thereafter, a house usher hands Tom a folder of sheet music. Within, he finds the manuscript to "La Cinquette" and discards it. During the concert, Tom finds a note written on his sheet music that reads "Play one wrong note and you DIE". Believing it to be a prank, he ignores it, only to find further notes that threaten Emma, as well as a laser dot that tracks his movement. Disturbed, Tom leaves the stage, shocking the audience. He returns to his dressing room, where he receives a text that instructs him to locate and wear an earpiece, allowing communication with the would-be assassin, Clem. When Tom returns to the stage, Clem demonstrates the stealth and range of his silenced rifle by firing a shot into the floor to Tom's left; no one else notices.  Desperate, Tom surreptitiously uses his cell phone to contact his friend Wayne, who is in the audience. When Wayne's phone rings, it momentarily disrupts the performance; Wayne leaves the concert hall in embarrassment. As he plays, Tom texts Wayne, but the usher (who is revealed to be working with Clem) kills Wayne. Clem tells Tom to look up, and Tom sees Wayne's body on the rafters. Wayne's girlfriend Ashley leaves the hall in search of him, but she is also killed by the usher. Clem then tells Tom that instead of performing [[Beethoven]]'s "[[Piano Sonata No. 17 (Beethoven)|Tempest Sonata]]", as Norman originally announced, he must perform "La Cinquette" flawlessly, as an embedded lock in the piano depends on a flawless performance. Clem further reveals that the release of said lock would yield a key to a [[safe deposit box]] containing Patrick Godureaux's disappeared fortune; Clem himself is the [[locksmith]] who worked with Godureaux to construct the mechanism. Tom insists that he can only perform "La Cinquette" with sheet music.  During intermission, Tom runs backstage in search of the crumpled manuscript, only to find that the janitor has destroyed it. Tom returns to his dressing room and listens to the piece on his [[iPod]], feverishly taking notes to help himself remember before returning to the stage. Norman announces Tom's solo performance of the Tempest Sonata, but Tom interrupts and nervously but firmly announces that he will instead perform "La Cinquette", to the audience's delight. Clem warns Tom to pace himself, so as not to wear himself out. Tom plays the piece completely free of error, until he gets to the very last note, which he deliberately misplays, infuriating Clem. Tom retorts that the audience does not know the difference - he receives a standing ovation, during which Tom realizes that he has finally conquered both "La Cinquette" and his own stage fright. Tom ignores Clem's shouted threats and introduces Emma. Much to her and the audience's surprise, Tom suggests that she sing an encore. Emma reluctantly obliges and Norman accompanies her on a rendition of "[[Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child]]". The usher, realizing that everything he and Clem worked for is over, attempts to flee the building, but is shot by Clem. Tom overhears this and runs offstage.  Racing upstairs, Tom finds the dead body of the usher. Clem comes out of the shadows and chases Tom to the light fixture catwalk, directly above the piano onstage. In the ensuing struggle, Clem threateningly dangles Tom over the catwalk edge, but Tom braces himself and yanks Clem over the railing. To the entire hall's horror, Tom and Clem fall to the stage. Clem crashes into the piano and is killed instantly, but Tom lands to the side and survives. Emma rushes over to him, they embrace, and he says, "I think I [[Break a leg|broke my leg]]". Later, while waiting with Emma for his ambulance to leave, Tom sees the obliterated piano loaded into a shipping truck. Climbing into the truck, he plays the last four bars of "La Cinquette" correctly, but nothing happens. Disappointed, Tom turns away until he hears the gears of the internal lock system turn and the sound of a metal key hitting the floor. He bends down to pick it up as the camera cuts to black.  
Gravity (2013 film)
  [[NASA]] Space Shuttle ''Explorer'', commanded by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski, is in Earth [[orbit]] on mission STS-157 to service the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Dr. Ryan Stone is aboard on her first space mission as a mission specialist, her job being to perform a set of hardware upgrades on the Hubble. During a [[Extra-vehicular activity|spacewalk]], [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control]] in [[Houston]] warns ''Explorer's'' crew about a Russian [[Anti-satellite weapon|missile strike on a defunct satellite]], which has inadvertently caused a [[Kessler syndrome|chain reaction]] forming a rapidly-expanding cloud of [[space debris]], ordering the crew to return to Earth immediately. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter as more and more communication satellites are knocked out by the debris.  High-speed debris strikes the ''Explorer'' and Hubble, tearing Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]] (MMU), rescues Stone, and they return to the ''Explorer'', soon discovering that the Shuttle has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew are dead. Stone and Kowalski decide to use the MMU to reach the [[International Space Station]], which is in orbit about  away, Kowalski estimating that they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again.  On their way to the International Space Station (ISS), the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the station, they see that the ISS's crew has evacuated into one of its two [[Soyuz-TMA|Soyuz spacecraft]], the remaining Soyuz's parachute being prematurely deployed, rendering it unable to return to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Chinese space station ''[[Tiangong program|Tiangong]]'',  away, in order to board its [[Shenzhou spacecraft]] and return safely to Earth in the re-entry [[space capsule|capsule]]. Out of air and maneuvering fuel, the two try to grab onto the ISS; Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both. Despite Stone's protests, Kowalski detaches himself from the tether to save her from drifting away with him. Stone is pulled back towards the ISS, while Kowalski floats away.  Stone enters the space station via the [[airlock]] of the [[Pirs Docking Compartment]]. She cannot re-establish communication with Kowalski nor Earth and concludes that she is now the sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing her to rush to the Soyuz. As she maneuvers the Soyuz away from the ISS, the tangled parachute tethers snag, preventing the spacecraft from leaving; Stone performs a spacewalk to cut the cables, succeeding just as the debris field returns, destroying the station. Stone angles the Soyuz towards ''Tiangong'', but soon discovers that the Soyuz's engine has no fuel.  After a poignant attempt at radio communication with an [[Eskimo]] on Earth, Stone resigns herself to her fate and shuts down the cabin's oxygen supply to commit suicide. As she begins to lose [[consciousness]], Kowalski enters the capsule, scolding her for giving up. He tells her to rig the Soyuz's [[Retrorocket|soft landing rockets]] to propel the capsule toward ''Tiangong'' before disappearing. Realizing Kowalski's appearance was a hallucination, Stone regains the will to go on, restoring the spacecraft's oxygen flow and rigging the landing rockets to propel the capsule towards ''Tiangong''.  Unable to dock with Tiangong, Stone ejects herself from the Soyuz and uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel to the rapidly deorbiting ''Tiangong''. Stone manages to enter ''Tiangong's'' Shenzhou spacecraft just as the station enters the upper [[atmosphere]], unlocking its re-entry capsule just in time.  The ''Shenzhou'' capsule re-enters the atmosphere successfully; however, during the descent it is damaged by debris from the disintegrating Tiangong and a fire starts inside the capsule. The capsule lands in a lake, but dense smoke forces Stone to evacuate immediately after [[splashdown]], shedding her spacesuit and swimming ashore. Stone shakily takes her first steps back on land.

The Green Inferno (film)
 Justine, a college freshman, becomes interested in a [[social activism]] group led by Alejandro and his girlfriend Kara. The group plans a trip to the [[Amazon rainforest]] to stop a company from logging and obliterating ancient native tribes there; the goal is to film the logging crews with cell phones and stream footage to raise awareness. Justine suggests she could bring attention to the issue through her father, an attorney for the [[United Nations]].  The operation is funded by a drug dealer named Carlos, who takes the group of students to [[Peru]] via plane. They arrive in the Amazon and head to a logging site where they begin their protest, chaining themselves to bulldozers while filming the loggers cutting down trees. A [[Private military company|private militia]] arrives, and the protest receives viral attention on the internet when Justine is nearly killed by one of the militia officers. The group is arrested, but Carlos pays the police to let them go. As the plane leaves, it crashes into the forest, killing Carlos.  Justine, Alejandro, Kara, and protest members Jonah, Lars, Amy, Samantha, and Daniel survive and search for a GPS phone to call for help. Suddenly, numerous young men painted in red come out of the bushes and kill Kara. The rest of the group are tranquilized and taken to a small village where they are imprisoned in a bamboo cage. The female elder of the cannibal tribe ritualistically dismembers, beheads, and eats Jonah. Samantha attempts to escape, but she is tranquilized and the group finds out that they are being watched. Alejandro reveals – to everyone else's dismay – that he had cynically staged the protest to benefit a rival company, and the eventual deforestation of the area is inevitable.  The next morning, the tribe's male leader in black and yellow paint orders Justine, Samantha, and Amy out of the cage. The girls are tested with a sharpened instrument, and Justine is revealed to be a virgin. She is taken away, and prepared for a [[genital mutilation]] ceremony. When Samantha and Amy are brought back to the cage, they distract the watchman with a ringing cell phone and Samantha escapes. The next day, Justine is returned with paint marks on her, and the tribe brings the prisoners meat. After finishing her meal, Amy realizes the meat came from Samantha, who was recaptured and dismembered. She smashes her bowl and uses a shard to cut her own throat. Lars stuffs [[marijuana]] down Amy's throat, hoping to get the tribe high when they cook her. His plan works, and Justine and Daniel escape, but Alejandro tranquilizes Lars and both are left behind. Lars is eaten alive by the tribe.  Justine and Daniel return to the site of the plane crash and find a phone in Kara's pocket, but are recaptured by the tribe shortly after. Justine is prepared for her ceremony where she is put in tribal attire and painted white with red across her eyes. Daniel is tied to a pole, his limbs broken, and fed to ants. Logging machinery attracts the cannibals to the jungle. The distraction allows Justine to escape with the help of a child sympathizer. Daniel begs for Justine to kill him and the child sympathizer blows a white powder into Daniel's face, knocking him out before slitting his throat. Alejandro is abandoned by Justine in the cage.  Two tribe members chase her down, but lose her when she crosses a river with a [[Black panther|black jaguar]] on the other side of it. However, the big cat doesn't harm her and she runs into the jungle. Justine encounters the same private militia that had captured her earlier as they slaughter the native warriors and the male tribal leader is killed. Justine uses Kara's phone to pretend to film the fight, stopping the militia from firing on the remaining native warriors. Justine is taken home to safety.  In New York, Justine lies to her father, telling him that she was the only survivor of the crash and that the tribe was friendly to her.  In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Alejandro's sister Lucia tells Justine during a phone call that she has found him on a satellite GPS image, showing a surviving Alejandro painted black like the Natives.

In the film's opening in the Feder household, Lenny wakes up to find a wild [[deer]] standing next to his bed. Lenny tries to get his wife Roxanne to open the window. She wakes up abruptly and startles the deer, causing it to urinate all over the bed and on Lenny. The deer runs down the hall and crashes into the bathroom where it runs into Lenny's elder son Greg showering, scaring him and making the deer urinate on him. It turns out that Lenny's daughter, Becky, left the door open overnight for any animals that wanted to come in.

Meanwhile, Marcus Higgins is waiting at a train station after receiving a letter from an old girlfriend, who tells him that he has a seventeen-year-old son Braden. Marcus is shocked to see a tattooed, six-foot-tall boy, who turns out to be Braden. Marcus tries to be nice and takes him to school, but Braden displays immediate hatred toward him, believing that he abandoned him and his mother.  After dropping off their kids, Lenny, Eric, Kurt, and Marcus form as a group and spend the day roaming around town, reminiscing about the amazing summers they used to have when they were little and Lenny's bully, Tommy Cavanaugh. Lenny argues that he could take Tommy as a little boy and he can still take him. Eventually, the friends go to see Becky's ballet recital, where Lenny runs into Tommy, whom Lenny is visibly intimidated by. Tommy threatens that if Lenny ever lies again about being able to beat him up, he will publicly attack Lenny.  Once the kids are out of school, Lenny, Eric, Kurt, and Marcus decide to visit the old quarry, where they used to swim as little boys. However, they encounter Andy and his gang of college frat men, who force them to jump into the quarry lake naked.

As all of their friends begin to arrive, Roxanne urges Lenny to consider having another baby. Lenny continues to protest the idea and is left speechless when Roxanne reveals that she is pregnant. Lenny, feeling overwhelmed by this discovery, goes off to drink with his friends. The Feder's party goes well most of the night until Tommy Cavanaugh shows up and disrespects Lenny in front of everyone, so Lenny challenges Tommy to a fight. In a surprising turn, Tommy decides to take a dive so that Lenny can look tough for his own bullied son, and the two develop a mutual respect. Soon after, Andy, along with his friends and their entire fraternity [[Gate crashing|gatecrash]] the party, looking for retribution for the damage to their frat house. When they go on to insult the local town residents, Dickie Bailey, Lenny's old nemesis, points out that Lenny accomplished more in his life than the entire frat put together, inciting a fight.

After sharing an embarrassing photo of him and Bailey in kindergarten (they had been forever friends before their personal lives drove them apart), Mrs. Lamonsoff reassures Lenny that a new baby is a wonderful thing and eventually he will never be able to imagine life with just three kids (and also mentions that Eric was an accidental baby because she and her husband had sex in the bathroom at a [[New England Patriots]] game). Lenny has a change of heart and returns home, telling Roxanne he is sorry and excited about the new baby, and they reconcile.  
Grudge Match
  In their prime, [[Pittsburgh]] boxers Henry "Razor" Sharp ([[Sylvester Stallone]]) and Billy "The Kid" McDonnen ([[Robert De Niro]]) become rivals after two fights, one in which Kid beats Razor and one in which Razor beats Kid, the only defeats of their careers. Before they have a rematch, Razor announces his retirement without explanation, infuriating Kid and costing them a big payday.  Years later, Razor is low on money and working in a shipyard when he's visited by promoter Dante Slate, Jr. ([[Kevin Hart]]), who wants Razor to provide a [[motion capture]] performance for a video game. It was Slate's father whose shady business dealings ended up leaving Razor in dire financial straits. The soft-spoken Razor wants no part of this stunt. Kid, a showoff who runs a bar and a car dealership, is all for it.  Razor begrudgingly accepts $15,000 needed to care for his ailing former trainer Lightning Conlon ([[Alan Arkin]]) and pay his overdue bills. He doesn't even own a TV, so when Lightning moves in, the old trainer can't even watch favorite shows of his like ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''.  At the recording studio, Razor is surprised and taunted by Kid, who was also invited by Slate. The two get into a fight and damage the studio before being arrested. Cellphone footage of the fight is uploaded on [[YouTube]] and goes viral, giving Slate the idea of organizing a final grudge match between Razor and Kid, which he will promote as "Grudgement Day."  Kid eagerly accepts. Razor is forced to do so as well, not receiving his $15,000 and then learning he has been fired from the shipyard. At the press conference to announce the grudge match, Razor is approached by his ex-girlfriend Sally Rose ([[Kim Basinger]]), who cheated on him with Kid during their youth and ended up becoming pregnant. Now widowed, Sally wants to reconnect with Razor, but he is reluctant.  Razor asks old trainer Lightning to get him back in shape. Kid expects gym owner Frankie Brite ([[LL Cool J]]) to train him, but Frankie mocks the fight and is of little help. Kid is approached by his estranged biological son, B. J. ([[Jon Bernthal]]), against Sally's wishes. The two begin to bond after B. J. gives Kid helpful advice regarding his technique, and is invited to be his trainer.  Lightning convinces Razor to forgive Sally. He also finds out Razor is blind in one eye. A fight could cause permanent damage, so Lightning and Sally both implore Razor to call it off. At first he agrees, enraging Kid, but ultimately Razor explains that he needs to do this, Kid having cost him what he loved most, boxing and Sally.  Kid takes his grandson Trey to celebrate the news that the Grudge Match is sold out. B. J. believes they're going to a movie, but Kid takes the child to a bar, then leaves him on his own while hooking up with a groupie. Trey ends up accidentally starting Kid's car while he's in the backseat having sex. Kid prevents an accident, but he is arrested, and B. J. is infuriated that he endangered the boy. Kid apologizes to B. J. and gives him a scrapbook that he kept of B. J.'s sports career in school, proving he hadn't been uninterested in him throughout the years. B. J. forgives him.  The Grudge Match arrives, televised and packed. Kid gains the upper hand, severely beating Razor by unknowingly exploiting his blind eye. Upon learning of Razor's condition, however, Kid stops focusing on the eye and helps Razor to his feet. Razor turns the fight to his favor, but likewise helps Kid on his feet after nearly knocking him out. The fight ends and the judges decide it on points. Razor is declared the winner by a very close split decision. He celebrates with Sally and Lightning, while a satisfied Kid enjoys the company of B. J. and Trey, who are proud of what he has accomplished.  In a [[post-credits scene]], Razor has a new TV, on which he and Lightning view a performance by Kid on  ''Dancing with the Stars'' and quickly deduce that he's having sex with his partner. In another, Slate tries to set up another grudge match between [[Mike Tyson]] and [[Evander Holyfield]]. Holyfield refuses several increasingly higher offers to fight Tyson before showing interest when Slate offers Holyfield a role in a fourth ''[[The Hangover (film series)|Hangover]]'' film. Tyson, frustrated by this, approaches Slate angrily before the scene ends.

Malli escorts her and finally tells that her that he can’t go much further as his life and ambition is getting disturbed due to her. That night, police arrest Malli for preparing illegal [[Cannabis (drug)|ganja]]. Malli is fired from his job, his mother loses confidence in him. He finds out that Chandra, a fellow fisherman prepared Ganja. Chandra, after being beaten up by Malli, confesses that Sambasivayya has ordered him to do so as he felt that Sarala and Malli are in love. An enraged Malli goes to Sambasivayya’s home to settle the score but finds that he is not in town. Sarala challenges an inebriated Malli as he is walking away after threatening to outrage her modesty by saying, "You seem to have forgotten that you are a man after the beating you got from police due to my dad."

Due to financial problems, Suri’s mother starts an illicit relationship with the town’s doctor in order to gain money, which is misunderstood by Suri. Thus Suri starts hating his mother along with his father, getting much closer to Chitra. Years pass by and Suri ([[Sundeep Kishan]]), now a man, is a mason and is extremely fond of cock-fights while Chitra works under Dhorababu ([[Ravi Babu]]), a womaniser. One day, Chitra and Suri’s mother go to the doctor’s clinic. There, the doctor misbehaves with Chitra and the ladies leave the clinic, which is seen by Suri. Suri misunderstands that Chitra is also romantically involved with the doctor and starts roaming with Bangari ([[Suja Varunee]]) a native of that town, much to the agony of Chitra. Meanwhile, Suri’s mother passes away and Chitra’s marriage is held with an old man. Chitra pleads Suri to annul the marriage and Suri refuses by telling her whathe saw at the doctor’s place. Chitra tells the truth, thus leading a change of Suri’s heart. That night, Dhorababu tries to molest Chitra only to be attacked by Suri. Suri proposes to Chitra but is attacked by his father. Suri attempts to kill his father but instead is injured fatally. Though Chitra reaches the hospital with Suri, she finds that the doctor who was lusting for her is serving there. She offers herself for a night and the doctor goes to treat him. Suri dies of extreme blood loss and Chitra attacks the doctor by pouring hot water on him.  Thus, Malli and Chitra realize their love and wish to live together. But as fate would have it, the support breaks. Malli succeeds in finding a bridge and stands on it. He finds Chitra drifting by and rescues her. Both reach the top of the bridge and are filled with joy that they are alive and together.

Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters
 Abandoned by their father deep in a forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a [[Gingerbread#Gingerbread houses and decorations|gingerbread house]] and are captured by a [[Human cannibalism|cannibalistic]] [[Witchcraft|witch]]. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire of the oven. In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed [[Witch-hunt|witch hunters]], slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetic]]. He needs a shot of [[insulin]] every few hours or he will get sick and die.  Now adult, witch hunters Hansel and Gretel arrive in the town of [[Augsburg]] and immediately prevent Sheriff Berringer from executing a beautiful young woman named Mina for witchcraft. Mayor Englemann tells the crowd that he has hired the siblings to rescue several children presumed abducted by witches. Berringer hires trackers for the same mission in the hopes of disgracing the mayor and cementing his power. All but one of the sheriff's party are killed that night by the powerful grand witch Muriel, who sends one man back to the town tavern as a warning to the locals. Hansel and Gretel, along with the Mayor's deputy Jackson, capture the horned witch and interrogate her. They discover that the witches are preparing for the coming [[wikt:blood moon|Blood Moon]], where they plan to sacrifice twelve children to gain immunity to fire, their greatest weakness.  Muriel, accompanied by her witches and a [[troll]] named Edward, attacks the town and abducts the final child. Muriel kills Jackson and launches Gretel [[defenestration|out a window]], rendering her unconscious. Gretel is rescued by Ben, a local teenager who is a fan of theirs and plans to be a witch hunter himself. Hansel grabs onto a fleeing witch by her broomstick, but falls and is lost in the forest.   The next morning, Mina finds Hansel hanging from a tree. She takes him to a nearby spring where she heals his wounds and has sex with him. Gretel searches for Hansel in the forest, but is attacked by Sheriff Berringer and his posse. The men capture and beat Gretel before being stopped by Edward who kills the sheriff and his men. Edward tends to Gretel's wounds and tells her that he helped her because trolls serve witches. Hansel and Gretel reunite at an abandoned cabin which they discover is both a witch's lair and their childhood home. Muriel appears in front of them, telling them the truth of their past. She reveals that Hansel and Gretel's mother was a grand [[white witch]] named Adrianna who married a farmer, explaining the siblings' immunity to black magic. On the night of the last Blood Moon, Muriel planned to use the heart of the white witch to complete her potion. She found Adrianna too powerful and decided to use Gretel's heart instead. To get rid of Adrianna, Muriel revealed to the townspeople that Adrianna was a witch. The resulting angry mob burned her alive and hanged Hansel and Gretel's father. Following this revelation, the siblings battle Muriel before she stabs Hansel and abducts Gretel for the ceremony.   Hansel wakes up with Mina, who reveals herself to be a white witch. She heals his wounds again and uses a [[grimoire]] to bless Hansel's arsenal of weapons. Hansel, Mina, and Ben head out to disrupt the Blood Moon [[Witches' Sabbath|Sabbath]]. Mina begins slaughtering dark witches with a [[Gatling gun]], while Hansel squares off against Muriel's witches and frees the children. Edward defies Muriel's orders and releases Gretel before Muriel throws him off the cliff. Muriel flees on a broomstick, but Ben manages to shoot her and forces her to crash. Hansel goes after Muriel while Gretel stops to revive Edward. Hansel, Ben, and Mina follow Muriel's trail to the original gingerbread house. Muriel wounds Ben and kills Mina before Hansel shoots her several times, knocking her into the house. Gretel arrives and the pair engage Muriel in a brutal fight that ends with Gretel decapitating her with a shovel. They burn Muriel's body on a [[pyre]] and collect their reward for rescuing the children. They head out on their next witch hunt accompanied by Ben and Edward.  During the credits, Hansel and Gretel are able to slay a Desert Witch.  
The Hangover Part III
 Two years after [[The Hangover Part II|the events in Bangkok]], Leslie Chow ([[Ken Jeong]]) escapes from a maximum security prison, using a riot as cover. Meanwhile, in the United States, Alan Garner ([[Zach Galifianakis]]) causes a multi-car freeway pileup after he purchases a giraffe and accidentally decapitates it on a low overpass. Alan's father Sid ([[Jeffrey Tambor]]), angry with Alan for his immature antics and never owning up to his mistakes, dies of a heart attack in the middle of a lecture. After the funeral, Alan's brother-in-law Doug Billings ([[Justin Bartha]]) informs friends [[Phil Wenneck]] ([[Bradley Cooper]]) and Stu Price ([[Ed Helms]]) that Alan has been off his [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] medication and is out of control. The group attends an intervention in which Alan agrees to visit a rehabilitation facility in Arizona where he can seek treatment, as long as "the Wolfpack" takes him there. On the way to Arizona, Phil's minivan is rammed off the road by a rental truck and the group is taken hostage. They are later confronted by mob boss Marshall ([[John Goodman]]) and "Black Doug" ([[Mike Epps]]), his head enforcer.  He tells them that a few weeks after [[The Hangover|their shenanigans]] Chow hijacked half of a $42 million gold heist and, seeing how Alan has been the only one to communicate with Chow during his imprisonment, deduced that the Wolfpack could locate him and retrieve the gold. Marshall kidnaps Doug and gives the others three days to find Chow, or else Doug will be killed. Alan sets up a meeting with Chow in [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]], where Stu and Phil will hide and attempt to drug him. However, Alan accidentally reveals their location and Chow forces them to confess that they are working for Marshall. Chow explains his plan to retrieve the stolen gold from the basement of a Mexican villa he previously owned. Stu, Alan and Phil break into the house and successfully retrieve the gold, but Chow double-crosses them by locking them in the basement, rearming the security system and escaping in Phil's minivan. They are arrested but mysteriously released from the police station. They are picked up by a limousine and taken back to the villa, where they meet up with Marshall.  They learn that Chow had lied to them; the villa was never his. In fact, it was Marshall's own villa and the gold they stole was the other half Chow didn't get from Marshall. Marshall forgives them for their mistake but kills "Black Doug" for his incompetence and reminds them of their now two-day deadline. The group tracks Phil's phone, which was left in the minivan, outside a pawn shop in Las Vegas. The pawnshop owner, Cassie ([[Melissa McCarthy]]), tells them that Chow traded a gold brick for $18,000, far less than its usual sell rate of $400,000. Using Stu's former lover Jade ([[Heather Graham]]) as their contact, they learn that Chow is barricaded in the penthouse suite of [[Caesars Palace]]. Phil and Alan sneak into his suite from the roof, but Chow escapes, jumping from the balcony and parachuting down to the [[Las Vegas Strip|Strip]]. Stu catches up to Chow and locks him in the trunk of the limo that Marshall lent to them. They take the gold and meet with Marshall, who releases Doug back to the group. Although Marshall initially promised not to harm Chow, he shoots through the trunk of the car, presumably killing him. However, Alan had given Chow the means to escape from the trunk through a backseat compartment just moments earlier.  Chow emerges from the limo and kills Marshall, allowing the Wolfpack to live because Alan saved his life. He offers Alan a bar of gold as a gift, but Alan turns him down and ends their friendship because of Chow's unhealthy influence on the group. As Chow sadly watches them leave, they go to retrieve Phil's minivan from the pawnshop and Alan makes a date with Cassie. Six months later, the two marry. Vowing to own up to his actions, Alan regretfully resigns from the Wolfpack but would still like for the gang to hang out on occasion. As the four walk to the ceremony, a montage of clips from the previous films play.  In a mid-credits scene after the wedding, Alan, Cassie, Stu, and Phil appear to have staged another wild party that they cannot remember. Stu emerges from the bathroom wearing panties with [[breast implants]] and Alan remembers that the wedding cake was a gift from Chow; who emerges from the next room naked, laughing, holding a bottle of whiskey and wielding a [[katana]]. [[Crystal the Monkey|Crystal]] the capuchin monkey then jumps on Stu before the scene cuts to black.

Hansel & Gretel Get Baked
 The film begins with an electrician ([[Cary Elwes]]) monitoring the electricity box behind an old house. Peering in through a window, he sees a huge [[marijuana]] crop. Something pulls him through the window, and we hear him give a dying scream.  We then cut to see Gretel (Quinn) and her boyfriend Ashton smoking marijuana in Gretel's room. The marijuana is a new strain called "Black Forest" and is being produced by a little old lady living in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. When Gretel's older brother Hansel (Welch) comes home, he tantalizes the stoned pair with a box of gingerbread cookie mix. Gretel agrees to bake the cookies while Ashton goes off to buy more Black Forest from the old lady.  Ashton is invited into the old lady's house. The lady's name is Agnes (Boyle) and she is a witch. Ashton is drugged and awakens on an operating table guarded by Agnes's demonic dog. Meanwhile, Agnes coats his body in butter before eating parts of his body and eventually sucking out his youth (which restores her youth in turn). Eventually, Hansel and Gretel begin searching for Ashton, but they are ridiculed by the police and the trail ends with Agnes. The siblings interrogate Agnes, but she reveals nothing.   Meanwhile, local drug kingpin (Carlos Reynaldo Gallegos) intimidates Agnes' dealer Manny ([[Eddy Martin]]) into giving him the address of the house. Manny finds Agnes first to warn her that Carlos is coming, but she just laughs and kills Manny and steals his youth. When Carlos and his two thugs arrive, she easily dispatches Carlos and one of the thugs, while trapping the surviving henchman in a cage. It is also revealed that she can turn her victims into zombies to help in her attacks. Meanwhile, Gretel and Manny's girlfriend Bianca (Bianca Saad) join forces to infiltrate Agnes' house. Before they leave, Gretel emails Hansel that she is going to confront Agnes again.   While Bianca distracts Agnes through various means, Gretel sneaks into the basement where she finds the Black Forest crop, the remaining henchman, and the remains of the men Agnes has killed. Gretel leaves a trail of Skittles to help her find her way through the Black Forest. Eventually, Agnes sees through the ruse and the two girls are captured (and Agnes kills the henchman in front of them). Hansel shows up and is confronted by Carlos  (now a zombie) after discovering Agnes is a witch. Agnes also shoots two cops who show up to investigate the disappearance of all the teens (but it is later revealed they survived due to wearing bullet proof vests). Although Hansel destroys the zombie, he is knocked out by Agnes and placed in the oven room for cooking preparation.   Gretel and Bianca break out of their cage and sing the demonic dog to sleep. They stop Agnes right before she cooks Hansel, but Agnes manages to kill Bianca. During the struggle, Gretel manages to push Agnes into the oven and lock her in. The oven explodes, causing the marijuana crop and house to burn down. Hansel and Gretel manage to escape.   As various first responders arrive at the scene, we see a cat strolling about the ashes. One of the first responders picks up the cat and takes it into his van with him, planning to take the feline home. We then hear the responder's howls of agony as he is slaughtered in his van. We see that Agnes (who had shape-shifted into the cat and somehow survived the oven) is now behind the wheel. She smiles at the camera as she drives away from the scene.  
Hammer of the Gods (2013 film)
  Britain 871 AD. Young Norse prince Steinar arrives in England with a complement of 500 reserve warriors to combat a Saxon uprising that is crushing the occupying forces led by his father, King Bagsecg. Arriving at his father's camp, Steiner attends a family meeting with his father, his older brother Harold, and their younger half brother Vali, who is disliked by everyone but Steinar for being half Saxon. Absent is their older brother, Hakan, who has not been seen for over a decade due to a bitter animosity between him and their father, the cause unknown to Steinar.  Bagsecg, who is bed ridden and dying, dreads of leaving the throne to Harold (now next in line due to Hakan's absence) whose insistence that diplomacy being their best option would instead put their clan under English rule. He orders Steinar to kill Vali for cowardliness, to test his strength as a leader.  He refuses and warns Harold off who attempts it himself to gain favour with their father. Furious, Bagsecg dismisses Harold and Vali and charges Steinar with a near impossible task. Despite still harbouring contempt for his eldest son, Bagsecg orders Steinar to venture deep into the hostile English lands to find Hakan and bring him back so he may assume the throne.  Steinar departs with his closest comrades: his close friend Hagen, a Berserker named Grim, and Jokul; a superstitious believer in omens. Later they are joined by Vali who warns he has witnessed Harold secretly meeting with the Saxon King. Despite the urgency to return, Steinar pushes forward.  They approach Ivar the Boneless, a Viking recluse and paedophile who lives with a slave girl named Agnes and a mute [[catamite]]. He agrees to lead them to where he believes Hakan to be and departs with Agnes while abandoning the latter.  The group however are pursued by hooded men who slay Grim and later capture them all. Revealed to be soldiers of the Christian faith, their captain confirms that Harold has been secretly negotiating a surrender, on condition he remains in power over his people. But the captain proposes to Steinar that he would be best suited to rule his clan, if he agrees to submit to Christianity. Steinar refuses; knowing the stranglehold it would have on his people. Vali however switches sides to save his own neck and is taken to a nearby church, while Ivar is castrated for biting off the ear of a soldier.  After Agnes (who had evaded capture) frees Steinar, he then frees Hagen and Jokul. Ivar dies from blood loss but tells Steinar where he may find Hakan. They rescue Vali, but Hagen and Jokul demand he be killed for his cowardliness and treachery, forcing Steinar to kill Hagen by duel to protect his brother.  Now down to four, they head into an eerie forest and are captured again; this time by a tribe who dwell deep within a nearby cave. Taken there, Jokul is killed and later served-up as the tribe's banquet, Vali again switches sides, while Agnes is claimed by the tribal chief, Steinar's older brother Hakan, who the tribe worship as a god.  During the tribal festivities, Steinar encounters his mother Astrid; whom he believed dead, and who is also deluded by Hakan's megalomania. Further shocking revelations are made as Steinar learns finally the truth behind Hakan's exile. To his disgust his mother and brother openly share a passionate kiss, revealing their incestuous relationship.  After Hakan kills Vali to further his dominance over the tribe, he and Steinar are lowered into a dark pit to fight to the death, but despite Astrid secretly handing Hakan a knife to win, Steinar emerges the victor. The tribe bow in submission while Astrid, in an attempt to kill Steinar, is thrown into the pit by him.  Steinar later returns to Bagsecg's camp with Agnes, and presents Hakan's head to his father. Harold argues he was supposed to bring Hakan back alive. But Bagsecg responds "He was sent to find a king" seeing that Steinar is now ready to lead their people.  Steinar then kills Harold for his treachery; much to Bagsecg's applause. Later with Agnes by his side he musters his army to confront the approaching Saxon forces.

Hard to Be a God (2013 film)
 A group of 30 scientists travel from [[Earth]] to a nearly-identical alien planet that is culturally and technologically centuries behind. The inhabitants of this planet have brutally suppressed a [[The Renaissance|renaissance]] movement, murdering anybody they consider to be an intellectual, and thus the planet is stuck in the [[middle ages]]. Anton, one of the scientists from Earth, is sent to infiltrate the local populace of the Kingdom of Arkanar and help them progress as a society, although he is forbidden from getting involved with local politics or forcibly interfering with the advancement of technology or culture. He assumes the identity of Don Rumata, a nobleman who resides in a large castle surrounded by poverty. There, he lives with Ari, a young woman whom he has taken as his bride, and the juvenile prince of Arkanar. Rumata's presence divides local opinion; some treat him as a God, others despise him.  Don Rumata tasks himself with finding Budakh, a doctor who has been kidnapped by Don Reba, the tyrannical prime minister of Arkanar. Reba's militia, referred to as "the Greys", are responsible for the murder of many intellectuals, including scientists and writers. During his travels, Rumata witnesses the backward ways of the locals and becomes increasingly frustrated with them. Slavery is rife, and the influence of Reba's Greys turns Arkanar into a police state. One night, while guarding the prince, the Greys besiege the castle and attempt to arrest Rumata. Rumata attempts to escape, but is ambushed and taken before his rival, Don Reba. Reba does not trust Rumata and claims he is an impostor. Rumata reasons with Reba and is freed, along with Budakh.  Later, Rumata meets his friend Pampa, a drunken and washed-up baron. Rumata teaches Pampa his famed signature sword-fighting technique. When Rumata returns to his castle, he finds the local area has been taken over by religious zealots in his absence, called "the Blacks", who prove to be just as oppressive as the Greys. Rumata discovers that Budakh is an impostor, and that the real Budakh is still imprisoned at Don Reba's castle. He returns to Reba on peaceful terms and searches the sewers of the castle for Budakh. He eventually finds him, as well as Baron Pampa, who has been tortured by Reba's men. Rumata, Pampa and Budakh escape Reba's castle, but Pampa is shot by archers and killed.  Upon returning to his village, Rumata becomes annoyed when he discovers that Budakh, apparently a great doctor and intellectual, is actually a bumbling fool who is unable to even urinate properly. He sends Budakh away and retires to his castle. The next day, the Greys attack the castle and kill Ari. Enraged, Rumata butchers their leader.  The next morning, a group of travelers investigates the aftermath of the ensuing battle, which has cost the lives of most of Arkanar's inhabitants. Among the dead civilians and soldiers, they find a lone survivor, Don Rumata. The leader of the travelers, another incognito scientist from Earth, offers to take Rumata back to Earth, but Rumata refuses. He instead gives the fellow scientist advice - that it is "hard to be a God". Months later, during the winter, Rumata is shown traveling away from Arkanar.

Suddenly, Harry and Nan then discover that their beloved pet hamster Abu is ill after he vomits a green substance on them, so they take him to the vet. He is almost put down until Harry takes him back home. Ed the vet and his assistant, Kisko, are working for Harry's [[neo-Nazi]] twin brother Otto who was abandoned by his nan in the 1970s, claiming it was because she couldn't look after them both, and raised by dogs.  After another failed attempt to capture Abu (by disguising as a priest and a nun), Harry and Nan decide to take him on a trip in their [[Rover P6]] to [[Blackpool]] for a week before he dies (when Abu really wanted to visit the home of [[Rihanna (singer)|Rihanna]]). Ed and his assistant pursue them on the road, until they arrive in "Blackpole" by mistake. The next day, Harry and Nan take Abu on a personal guided tour around the nuclear power plant by the cleaner.

Later on, the car runs out of petrol in the middle of the woods and Harry and his nan leave Abu behind while they search for a petrol station.

After they finally arrive there, Harry is reunited with Michelle (much to his Nan's dismay) and Abu is finally kidnapped and replaced with the fox.  Harry later finds out and they go looking for Abu. They follow a trail of BBQ beef [[Hula Hoops]] crisps (which is what Otto was left with to eat when he was abandoned) to his hideout where he reveals his plan to turn Abu into a model figurine for his collection as an act of revenge for being deserted. During a fight between the two, Harry's nan reveals that she got rid of Otto because she kept getting him and Harry mixed up. After being chased away by killer brains, Harry and his nan are saved by the Shell People, to which his Nan accepts his and Michelle's love. Harry pursues his brother to the top of the Blackpool tower.  His Nan rescues him and Abu in a helicopter when Otto falls to the ground after taking a punch from Kisko after he and Ed thought they were working for the wrong brother. After defeating Otto, Abu coughs up a green felt tip pen which turned out to be the cause of his illness. Ed explains that hamsters like sucking on pens and he gave it to Abu so he would be sick and start this whole plan, even though he could've kidnapped Abu at the time.  Abu lives and the movie ends with a big end song with everyone in the film. Just before the final credits, a hamster appears on screen, riding on a model train. He gets off at the model station when the train stops. The hamster can only be thought to belong to Harry Hill, but there is no evidence for this.

The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia
 The film is set in 1993.  Andy and Lisa Wyrick, along with their daughter Heidi, move into a rural home after receiving a deal from the bank. They are told that no one had previously lived on the land, which is why they are getting such a great deal. Shortly after moving in, Heidi begins to experience visions. After a visit from Lisa’s sister Joyce, it is revealed that Heidi, along with her mother, aunt, and grandmother, was born with a veil over her face, allowing the women of the family to have visions. Joyce embraces her visions, but Lisa tries to prevent them with the help of medication to no avail as she begins to have nightmares and visions of her mother.  One of Heidi’s visions is of a man she calls Mr. Gordy, who tells her things to prove his existence, such as money being buried in the garden, and a swing being deep in the woods. When these things turn out to be true, it is revealed that Mr. Gordy had in fact owned the house before the Wyricks. To test Heidi’s knowledge, Joyce and Lisa do some research and ask Heidi to pick Mr. Gordy out of a bunch of old photos, which she does. Lisa begins to have visions of a figure coming after her and her daughter and starts to worry about the sanity of herself and that of her daughter, which leads her to tell Heidi not to speak to Mr. Gordy anymore.  One day, the family receives a visit from the local [[pastor]], who tells them that their property was once part of the [[Underground Railroad]] and that a [[Station master|stationmaster]] lived on their land. He tells them of all the good that the stationmaster brought about and warns the family that they may get some visitors wishing to pay homage to the stationmaster, and asks them to be kinder than the previous owner, Mr. Gordy, was.  Andy comes home with a dog for Heidi named Chief, trying to alleviate some of the tension that has built up in their family since moving into the new house, but soon after Chief follows something into the woods. When Andy and Heidi go to look for him, they can hear him crying from the woods and find him trapped in a snare. Andy tells Lisa that the snares would have been perfect for a [[Taxidermy|taxidermist]], because they would catch and kill animals without leaving a mark. While destroying the snares to prevent Chief from getting caught again, Andy finds Heidi talking to someone who is not there. When he asks her about it, she says that Mr. Gordy says that some people are coming.  These people turn out to be Mama Kay and her grandson who buy a quilt from Joyce that she had found at the old station. Mama Kay tells Heidi that she is special and to be careful of what she sees, while her grandson tells Andy the true story of the stationmaster. He was primarily a taxidermist and would enlist the help of guides called [[Underground railroad#Structure|Conductors]] to help guide slaves to a meeting place. He would hold them somewhere secret, then when it was safe, he would move them to the next location. Two of the slaves he had hidden were Mama Kay’s ancestors, Nell and Levi, but they were never heard from again after they stopped at the station. When the townspeople found out about his involvement, they blindfolded him, filled his abdomen with stuffing and hung him from the tree where the swing once was that Heidi had seen.  Andy relays this information to Joyce and Lisa, who then relays it to Heidi, but tells her that the stationmaster was a good man and helped a lot of people. When Heidi insists that an evil exists in the woods, Lisa becomes frustrated and tells her that she cannot believe her because she cares about her and orders Heidi to get out of the bathtub. When Heidi takes too long, Lisa returns to the bathroom as the lights flicker. The stationmaster is seen standing next to Lisa as Heidi is face down in the bathtub. Lisa pulls her out and attempts to use the Heimlich maneuver to expel the water from her lungs, only for Heidi to cough up sawdust and insects. Concerned, the family takes Heidi to the hospital, where her story is questioned. Heidi seems to have no memory of what happened and tells the doctor that when she didn’t get out of the tub like she was supposed to, her mom pulled her out of the tub really hard, making it even harder to believe Lisa’s story. As Lisa is leaving, Heidi tells her that it is hard when people don’t believe you, indicating that she knew what she was doing.  Later, the family asks the pastor to come out and bless the land and Heidi. During the blessing, Joyce experiences frightening visions of slaves being taken to the station by the stationmaster, along with the conductors, and she sees the bodies of her family members decomposing during the blessing. That night Heidi follows a ghost out of her house, who turns out to be Nell. She leads her out into the woods, where she disappears. Meanwhile, Lisa is having nightmares and awakens to find out that Heidi is missing, and Andy runs out into the woods to look for her.  Somehow, Heidi falls to the bottom of the station and begs her father not to leave her down there with “them”, but she is alone. In a frantic attempt to rescue his daughter, Andy reveals a heavy slab covering the entrance, which leads him to wonder how Heidi got down there, and he realizes that is where the stationmaster hid the slaves, with Heidi revealing the “them” she was talking about were corpses that had been forgotten. When the stationmaster was murdered, there was no one to let the slaves out and they died in the station. Heidi tells her father that she thinks something else is in the station too. She tells her family that she wishes to leave the house. Joyce tells her that she released the spirits and that the bad things are gone, but Heidi insists that Mr. Gordy told her she let something bad out. When Andy takes his daughter’s side, it causes a rift between him and Lisa. Lisa tells Heidi that the stationmaster was a good man, to which Heidi replies, “No he wasn’t”.  Andy decides that the family will leave because he doesn’t want Lisa filling Heidi’s head with the idea that she is sick and needs to be on medication. As they are packing up to leave, the ghost of the stationmaster can be seen watching them. Joyce decides to stay and the ghosts of the slaves alert her to the stationmaster’s presence. She sees him walking towards Heidi and when she attempts to warn her niece, the stationmaster turns his attention on her.  Joyce coughs up a needle and begins to become sutured from the inside. Meanwhile, Lisa notices that Heidi has disappeared from the truck and she decides to check Joyce’s trailer. She finds her sister strung from the ceiling and cuts the sutures just before the stationmaster is able to get them. When Lisa asks her sister where Heidi is, Joyce replies that “they know”, which leads Lisa to accept her visions.  She follows the guidance of the conductor’s ghost, which leads her to the station. There, she finds a hidden door and discovers many animals that had been stuffed by the stationmaster. It is revealed that the stationmaster had kept many slaves and stuffed them for his own keeping, including Nell, Levi, and the conductor. She finds Heidi tied to the stationmaster’s table, and when she attempts to escape with her daughter, she finds the way blocked, except by going straight up through the ground. Heidi begins to climb and then is pulled up through the ground. When Lisa attempts to follow her, she is pulled back down by the stationmaster. She is confronted by the ghost, but experiences a vision of her mother who tells her to “let them in”. She finally embraces her visions and finds out that the Stationmaster had told Nell, Levi, and the Conductor that he would be back for them, but traps them instead, leaving them to starve so that he could stuff them. Learning the truth, it allows their spirits to be freed and have their vengeance on the Stationmaster. The Stationmaster’s death is revisited, but instead of it being the townspeople who murder him, it is the spirits of all those he had killed. This allows Lisa to escape and the Stationmaster’s spirit to be destroyed. It is then revealed that the person who had pulled Heidi through the ground was actually the spirit of Mr. Gordy, who had been the Stationmaster’s descendent and had been there to act as a protector to the Wyrick family.  Two weeks later, Andy attempts to hang a tire swing for Heidi. Lisa and Joyce speculate about why Mr. Gordy hadn’t wanted people on his land and come to the conclusion that he wanted his ancestor to be remember for the good that he did and not the bad. Meanwhile, Heidi is struggling to ride her bike when it suddenly straightens up. She turns around to see Mr. Gordy and he sends her off to ride happily where she sees the spirits of Nell, Levi, and the Conductor heading off into the woods, finally free. She turns around and sees Mr. Gordy waving goodbye to her before he turns and walks away into the afterlife, satisfied that the Wyricks were safe.  In a text epilogue, it is revealed that the Wyricks remained in that house for another five years, Lisa’s visions have not returned, and that Heidi never saw Mr. Gordy again. The final shot shows photos of the real-life Heidi and Mr. Gordy, and then the entire Wyrick family.  
Hatchet III
 The film picks up immediately after the end of the [[Hatchet II|last film]], with Marybeth Dunston ([[Danielle Harris]]) blowing off the head of Victor Crowley ([[Kane Hodder]]) with a shotgun. She walks away and comes across the bodies of Vernon and John, where she hears  a somehow still alive Victor in the woods. Marybeth starts up the chainsaw and prepares for a fight, but is grabbed by Victor, whose head is bloody but reattached. Marybeth puts her arm through his bloody face, and he falls backwards onto the chainsaw, cutting him down the middle and in half. After shooting Victor's head to make sure he is dead this time, Marybeth is satisfied.   She walks back into the city, bloodied and disorientated. She walks into the Jefferson Parish Police Department, immediately having guns drawn on her. Upon discovery of the twenty to thirty bodies at Honey Island Swamp, she is placed as the prime suspect in the murders by Sheriff Fowler ([[Zach Galligan]]), even after telling him numerous times about the events of the last two films. The Sheriff heads out to the swamp with the paramedics and fire department, leaving Deputy Winslow (Robert Diago DoQui) in charge of the station until he gets back.  Amanda Fowler ([[Caroline Williams]]), the Sheriff's ex-wife, journalist and an expert about the legend of Victor Crowley, comes into the station to interview Marybeth about what happened, telling Marybeth she wants to help, otherwise Marybeth will be tried and executed for what happened at Honey Island Swamp. After retelling the events of the previous two films to Amanda, Amanda tells her that Victor Crowley is a repeater, set to relive the night he died, looking for his father and that he will keep coming back unless he gets what he wants: his father. She tells Marybeth that her father, Sampson Dunston, was the one that came up with the idea to start the fire many years ago and tried to get him to deliver Thomas Crowley's ashes to Victor over the past several years, only to be dismissed numerous times. Since he's dead and she's Sampson's bloodline, only she can put an end to Victor Crowley. Marybeth doesn't believe her, continuously declaring that she killed Victor Crowley the night before.  At Honey Island Swamp, the body of Victor Crowley is bagged and tagged and put into the ambulance boat. When the paramedic, Randy ([[Sean Whalen]]) is distracted, Victor reanimates and blows Randy's head off with a [[defibrillator]]. Deputy Hamilton ([[Jason Trost]]) goes to investigate and goes to the boat where Victor appears and kills him by hacking his head in half. Victor then kills about a dozen or so of the first response team (four of them onscreen), leaving paramedic Andrew ([[Parry Shen]]), and another paramedic alive. Victor then escapes back to his house. Back at the station, upon hearing the medical team getting killed on the radio, Amanda convinces Deputy Winslow to let Marybeth out of jail and help her save everyone at Honey Island Swamp.   Back at the swamp, in comes the SWAT team, led by Tyler Hawes ([[Derek Mears]]) and consists of five others: four armed men and one armed woman named Dougherty ([[Rileah Vanderbilt]]). Hawes takes over the operation from Fowler and leads them to the Crowley house, where an officer is killed. After he throws the corpse out of the shed, Crowley kills Elbert ([[Diane Ayala Goldner]]). Crowley ambushes two officers as the SWAT team gangs up on him and fail, as they futilely shoot Crowley as he kills all SWAT but Hawes and Dougherty. Hawes tries tackling Crowley but is in turn pinned against the shed and has his skull and spine ripped out. While Deputy Rick catches Victor's attention, Deputy Schneiderman (Cody Blue Snider) takes the opportunity to fire a [[rocket launcher]] at Crowley,but misses and hits Rick instead, killing him. The resulting explosion blows up the Crowley house, destroying it and covering Victor in the rubble. When Schneiderman begins to celebrate, Victor appears from the wreckage and throws a piece of rubble into Schneiderman's back. He then proceeds to kills Schneiderman by ripping his arms off and drowning him in a puddle. Dougherty, Andrew and the Sheriff run for it. Before running, the Sheriff manages to slow Crowley down by shooting in the chest with a [[handgun]].  Meanwhile, Amanda has Winslow take her and Marybeth to the house of Abbott MacMullen ([[Sid Haig]]), Victor Crowley's racist long distant cousin and only living blood relative who possesses the ashes of Thomas Crowley. When he declines to give up the ashes, Amanda holds him at gunpoint and leaves with the ashes. Back at Honey Island Swamp, the other paramedic is chased by Victor Crowley when he hides behind the canoe which is revealed to be the one from the [[Hatchet (film)|first movie]]. It is the canoe from the first film because there, Ben ([[Joel David Moore]]), who is now revealed to still be alive, was in there, clinging to life with his left arm ripped off. As he begs for help, Victor throws the hatchet at Ben, finally killing him. Before Victor can kill the paramedic, an alligator comes out of the swamp and pulls the paramedic into the swamp to his death.  Victor resumes chasing the Sheriff, Andrew and Dougherty and corners them in the [[water ambulance]] with Randy's corpse.  They barricade themselves in and the Sheriff calls for the National Guard on the ambulance's radio, telling them they're being attacked by crazed gunmen. The National Guard tells them they'll be there in ten minutes. Just as they settle down and think everything's safe, Victor begins to saw his way through the boat wall with the gas powered belt sander. The Sheriff tells them not to move, if they try to leave, they'll get killed, while Andrew thinks they should leave while he's busy cutting through the wall. Amanda, Deputy Winslow and Marybeth arrive at the Swamp outside the burned down Crowley house. Amanda calls out for Victor, telling him they have his father. Upon hearing his ex-wife's voice, Sheriff Fowler attempts to leave, only to be grabbed by Victor and beheaded with the belt sander; his arms then move around in the air before collapsing. Andrew and Dougherty are trapped in the boat with Victor on the other side of the broken door. Dougherty attempts to slowly get the Sheriff's gun, but Victor grabs and pulls her through the hole on the door, which disembowels her. Andrew smartly remains in the boat, keeping himself out of sight of Victor.  Victor goes back to his destroyed home and finds Amanda and Deputy Winslow there but refrains from attacking when he sees the ashes. Marybeth offers Victor his father's ashes and apologizes for what her father did to him. Victor proclaims "Daddy" (his only word) upon seeing the ashes. When he approaches to take the ashes, Deputy Winslow mistakes it for Victor going to attack Marybeth, and so shoots him down, but Victor rises back up, and rips apart Winslow's chest when his back is turned. Amanda grabs the urn and rolls it back to Marybeth, telling her to try it again, as she attempts to grab Winslow's gun, but Victor grabs Amanda and rips her head off. Victor then knocks Marybeth over and impales her on a [[tree branch]], seriously injuring her. Just when Victor picks up a [[machete]] to finish Marybeth off, Marybeth smashes the urn over Victor's head, spreading his father's ashes all over him, and causing him to collapse and melt. With the last bit of her strength, she grabs one of the SWAT team's guns and blows his remains away, finally killing Victor Crowley once and for all. The National Guard then arrives and Andrew, now free of danger, emerges from the boat and signals the helicopters. Just as the screen cuts to black, one final shot of Marybeth gasping for air is shown, leaving the audience to wonder if she will live or die.  
A Haunted House

On the first night, Malcolm is constantly awoken with Kisha farting loudly that eventually drives him out of the room. The next morning, when Kisha notices her keys on the floor, she tells Malcolm  they might have a ghost. To prove to her wrong, Malcolm invites over camera men Dan the Security Man and his brother Bobby. Malcolm tries to have sex with the camera on, but Kisha tells him to turn it off. Before they really start, Malcolm turns the camera back on and records everything. In the morning, Malcolm and Kisha watch the video and notice the door moved. Malcolm suggests it was caused by his lovemaking.  The next night, Malcolm notices the paranormal activity and tries to move out of the house and leave Kisha. Since he can't sell his house in the current market, they hire Chip, a psychic, to investigate; Chip immediately falls in love with Malcolm. Before Chip can leave, after finding nothing wrong, Kisha confesses to making a deal with the devil for a pair of shoes. Chip tells Kisha she is screwed and invites Malcolm to a wrestling match. After Chip leaves, Kisha shows Malcolm a video of her eighth birthday, in which she began to experience paranormal activity by her imaginary friend, Tony. The next night, Kisha awakens in the middle of the night, stands by the bed for several hours, and begins to dance. Malcolm wakes up and follows Kisha to the kitchen, where he catches her eating uncooked food and drinking old milk. She screams crazily when Malcolm restrains her. In the morning, Kisha remembers nothing.  On another night, Kisha urges Malcolm to investigate a noise, but it turns out to be Rosa, his Hispanic housekeeper. Rosa quits, and Malcolm and Kisha smoke marijuana with the ghost to relieve their pain. The next day, Malcolm's friend Steve and his girlfriend Jenny bring a ouija board to communicate with the ghost. When it misspells ghost as "gost", they all laugh at it, and it throws the ouija board across the room, scaring Jenny and Steve out of the house. That night, the ghost drags Malcolm out of the room and has sex with Kisha. When Malcolm finds out, he calls his cousin Ray Ray, who immediately flees when he sees the ghost's powers. That same night, Kisha waits for the ghost until it gets late and leaves. After Kisha leaves, the ghost rapes Malcolm.  Malcolm and Kisha anger the ghost by not getting scared, so it attacks Kisha in the night while Malcolm listens to music on his computer. In the morning, Malcolm notices something is wrong with Kisha and calls Father Doug to do an exorcism. When it does not work (the ghost gives out clues of its plan), Malcolm calls Dan and Bobby to help. Chip also rushes into the house to help. During the exorcism, Kisha escapes into the living room. Before Malcolm and Doug find her, Doug accidentally shoots and kills Rosa, who had come to pick up her last check. When they all meet in the living room, Kisha behaves very strangely and flees to the basement. The group follows and finds her crying in a corner. When Malcolm reaches for her, she attacks him, and the whole group beats her up, apparently forcing the ghost out of her body.  The next night, Malcolm and Kisha have sex with the camera on for about three hours. In the middle of the night, Kisha wakes up and stands next to the bed for a few hours before walking out of the room and making a big crash and screaming Malcolm's name. When Malcolm comes out of his room, Kisha throws him back, and he hits the camera, knocking him out. When Kisha enters the room her shirt is bloody. She crawls to Malcolm and sniffs his body until he farts in her face. As Kisha lunges at the camera, her face takes on a demonic appearance. A minute later, Malcolm wakes up telling everyone he survived and Kisha is behind him making him scream.

He finds out that his aunt had moved without leaving a forwarding address. With no place to stay and little money, he beds down behind the ruins of an abandoned building. He looks around for odd jobs and is eventually hired by the writer Eugenio ([[Manuel Vignau]]), a former childhood playmate. Martín does not want to admit that he is homeless, and lies to Eugenio that he is staying with his aunt. Eugenio eventually finds out about Martín's situation and convinces Martín to stay at his house for the summer.  At first Eugenio does not seemingly remember much about Martín, but little by little they start to recall their shared memories as children. Eugenio realizes his growing attraction to Martín but is reluctant to pursue it, as he does not want to seem to be taking advantage of Martín's current financial situation. He is also afraid that even if the soft-spoken Martín might reciprocate his feelings, it might only be because Martín feels indebted to him. Martín himself is attracted to Eugenio, but he does not know if Eugenio is gay. And given his impoverished background, he does not want to presume on Eugenio's kindness.   Nonetheless, Eugenio and Martín slowly grow closer together, and Eugenio finds it becoming increasingly difficult to hide his attraction. One day while moving some furniture, Eugenio accidentally knocks over some drawings of naked men from his desk. Martín sees the drawings, but Eugenio pointedly avoids talking about it.

The Heat (film)
  [[FBI agent]] Sarah Ashburn ([[Sandra Bullock]]) is an expert and effective investigator in [[New York City]], but is despised by allied agents for her egotistical and vicious personality. When her manager assigns her to a mission in [[Boston]], she meets detective Shannon Mullins ([[Melissa McCarthy]]), a skilled but loudmouth, bloodthirsty, sadistic, hot headed, [[dirty cop]] who is part of the [[Boston Police Department]]. Ashburn's ruthless philosophy clashes with Mullin's nefarious style of law work, proved during their attempt to interrogate local drug dealer Rojas ([[Spoken Reasons]]) who was captured by Mullins. Under pressure from her employer Hale ([[Demián Bichir]]), Ashburn reluctantly agrees to work with Mullins.  Ashburn and Mullins tail a local [[nightclub]] manager named Hank LeSoire (Adam Ray) to his business known as Club Ekko and place a [[Covert listening device|bug]] on his mobile phone to get information on drug lord, Simon Larkin. As they leave the club, Ashburn and Mullins are confronted by [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents Craig ([[Dan Bakkedahl]]) and Adam ([[Taran Killam]]), who have been working the Larkin case for several months and are worried that their case will be compromised. Ashburn and Mullins discover a surveillance video in the DEA agents' van showing Mullins' brother, Jason ([[Michael Rapaport]]), apparently connected to Larkin's organization. Jason was recently released from prison, having been put there by Mullins to keep him off the streets and out of trouble.  Ashburn convinces Mullins to go to her parents' home to ask Jason for information on Larkin. On their arrival, it becomes apparent that Mullins' parents ([[Michael Tucci|Michael B. Tucci]] and [[Jane Curtin]]), particularly her mother and three brothers, Peter ([[Joey McIntyre]]), Mark ([[Bill Burr]]) and Michael ([[Nathan Corddry]]) two of whom have girlfriends, Gina ([[Jessica Chaffin]]) and Beth ([[Jamie Denbo]]) still resent Mullins for her involvement in Jason's incarceration. However, Jason does not have any ill feelings toward his sister, and tips her off about the body of a murdered drug dealer by the name of Sal Netalie in an abandoned car. Chemicals on the victim's shoes lead Ashburn and Mullins to an abandoned paint factory, where they witness a drug dealer being murdered by Julian Vincent ([[Michael McDonald (comedian)|Michael McDonald]]), vicious criminal and second-in-command of Larkin's organization. They apprehend Julian but are unable to extract any substantial information regarding Larkin's whereabouts, even with Mullins going so far as to play [[Russian Roulette]] with Julian's testicles.  The pair spend the evening bonding in a bar, where a drunk Ashburn reveals that her [[foster child]] past may be partly to blame for her attitude. After a night of raucous drinking and partying, Ashburn wakes up the following morning to discover that, in her drunkenness, she has given her car keys to Wayne ([[Steve Bannos]]), one of the bar patrons. After unsuccessfully pleading for the keys, Ashburn and Mullins watch as the patron starts the car and is killed by a [[Car bomb|bomb]]. They discover that Julian has escaped from custody and means to harm Mullins' family, so Mullins moves her family into a motel. Jason leaves, intending to join the Larkin organization in an attempt to help Mullins solve the case. Jason gives her a tip about a drug shipment coming into [[Boston Harbor]]. Despite Mullins' reluctance, Ashburn gets the FBI to take down the shipment. The FBI finds that the ship is actually an innocent pleasure cruise ship. Jason was being tested by Larkin, who shoots Jason for informing the FBI about the supposed drug shipment. Jason escapes death but falls into a [[coma]]. A falling out occurs between Mullins and Ashburn, with Mullins vowing to bring her brother's attacker to justice. They then reconcile when they arrest several drug dealers as a way of gaining leads to Larkin's whereabouts, including Rojas.  Ashburn and Mullins go to equip themselves with assault weapons from Mullins' extensive personal arsenal, and infiltrate one of Larkin's warehouses. Despite taking out several of Larkin's men with a [[hand grenade]], the two officers are captured and bound. Julian is about to torture them with knives when he gets called away by Larkin. Before Julian leaves, he stabs Ashburn in the leg and leaves the knife in the wound. Mullins removes the knife from Ashburn's leg and uses it to cut the rope binding her hands. Before she can finish freeing herself and Ashburn, they are discovered by Craig and Adam. Craig begins to untie the two women, but is shot and killed by Adam. Ashburn and Mullins learn that Adam is actually Larkin, who has been working his own case from inside the DEA for several months. Julian returns and Larkin orders him to kill Ashburn and Mullins while he goes to the hospital to kill Jason. After Larkin leaves, Mullins manages to finish freeing herself and Ashburn incapacitates Julian with a head butt, after Mullins had stabbed him in the leg. Mullins and Ashburn race to the hospital to save Jason.  Upon their arrival, Mullins rushes to find Jason. Ashburn, hindered by the stab wound in her leg, lags behind, unable to move quickly. Mullins learns that, due to the foul language she and her family exhibit, the doctor moved Jason to another room in the hospital; she finds Jason's room, only to be disarmed by Larkin. He is about to kill Jason when Ashburn, having had to crawl to the room, subdues Larkin by shooting him in the genitals (much to Mullins' surprise, as she would never actually do so; scaring Julian earlier was only a way of making him talk). With Larkin captured, Ashburn requests to stay in the FBI's Boston field office, having developed a strong friendship with Mullins. Jason is shown having fully recovered from his coma. The film ends with Mullins receiving a commendation from the Boston Police Department. Members of her family are present and they cheer Mullins, now having reconciled with her. Ashburn later gets a call from Mullins to look in her year book. Mullins had signed the back of Ashburn's yearbook with the words, "Foster kid, now you have a sister", showing the strong friendship that Mullins felt for a previously unpopular Ashburn.  As a surprise, Mullins brings to Ashburn the cat that she had found in Ashburn's neighbor's house, believing it was hers. Earlier, when Mullins saw a photo of Ashburn with the neighbor's cat, Ashburn had lied and said it was her cat which had gone missing in New York. Mullins quickly deduces that it was not Ashburn's and the package is sent to [[freight transport]].

Estela is revealed to be in a relationship with Beto, a cadet who at 17 is much older than her. Estela, despite Beto's enthusiasm for engaging in sexual relations, is firm in her refusal of him, out of fear of becoming pregnant. Beto proposes they marry and run away together. To do so, he plans to sell some stolen cocaine packages that a corrupt general secretly drew from a cache the army confiscated and burned in an official event. Beto hides the drugs in Heli's house with Estela's consent until the sale. However, Heli discovers the affair and reprimands his sister, locking her in her room, after secretly disposing of the drugs in an isolated water pit for cattle.  Later that night, some federal policemen storm Heli's house, killing Heli's father when he tries to defend himself thinking they were being assaulted. The officers take Heli and Estela by force (Sabrina and their son not being present at the time) and with a badly beaten Beto they try to find the stolen cocaine. When they find out Heli destroyed the package, the policemen abandon Heli's father's body on the road, and drive to a secure house where drug dealers harshly torture Beto to the point of killing him. Heli's life is spared, but Estela is taken elsewhere. The dealers hang Beto's body from a pedestrian bridge, leaving a badly hurt Heli at the scene.  Heli manages to walk back home and the local police, learning of the incident, help Heli to heal and find the body of his father. Later they take Heli's testimony; however, the police assumes Heli and his father are involved with drug dealing and decide not to help them because Heli, shaken and scared of the situation, is not willing to tell what happened nor to sign any written testimony in fear of having himself or his father framed as criminals.  Heli has to deal with the traumas inflicted by these experiences and with the corruption of the police, while his wife begins to distance herself from him due to the erratic and even violent behaviour he begins to display. After going back to work at the car assembly plant, Heli gets distracted on the job and is eventually fired. The female detective assigned to his case, after learning that Estela was Beto's girlfriend, asserts that the file of the case is closed, and makes sexual advances on Heli, which are initially reciprocated but eventually rejected.  Estela returns home, traumatised to the point of losing the speech and pregnant beyond the stage she can legally have an abortion. Heli and Sabrina comfort her, and Estela draws a map to the location she was held and raped. Heli goes there and kills the man living there. Seemingly relieved from some of the trauma, he returns home and successfully makes love to his wife, while Estela sleeps peacefully with her nephew.

Unsatisfied with Kentaro and showing off her machoism, the butch continued to pursuit him despite her girlfriend's protest. There he discovered a mannequin  in a sailor suit that looks and feels like a real human from the softness of her skin to the realistic pubic hair. Releasing all his repressed feelings, he began to stage a rape scene with the doll. Unfortunately for him, he was then found by the butch and her girlfriend resulting in another beating. After another beating, the butch and her girlfriend got aroused and decided to go to another room to get intimate. As they proceed to fill their desires, they discovered three thugs, who were running away from the yakuza, hiding and observing  them. A fight ensued and the butch was shot twice. Thinking she has died, two of the men decided to rape the butch's girlfriend in the room where Kentaro was at. Sensing danger, Kentaro hid from under the bed to avoid any conflict and observed the whole ordeal. After a while, the butch reemerged only to be shot again. The thugs' leader then warned that he will release the girl without shooting her, only if she managed to get out of their sights within ten seconds. As the girl rushed to find her belongings, the girl discovered Kentaro under the bed and decided to reveal his presence as a way to distract the thugs and escape. This proved useless as she ended up getting shot at. Knowing his presence, they proceeded to drag him out and attempt to kill him. Before they were able to do that, the mannequin that he "raped" came to life, saved him and kill the thugs. Kentaro shocked by the events, fainted and fell asleep as his strength ebbs away.

As days passed, he began to form a relationship with Kokone, complaining about his sorrows and talking about his everyday life. Due to his solitude and disappointment, he started experiencing weird things about her. One minute she began to talk and move her like a real human, another minute, she remained stationary like a doll. This confusion led him to madness as he then began to have a raping fantasy with the doll.  Unable to find a job due to his bad reputation, he desperately loaned money from loan sharks and gambled. As he began to lose a lot of money, he attempted to commit suicide only for Kokone to save him. This instilled him a desire to come back victorious, which he does when he won a mahjong game with the impossible nine gates. Overjoyed he rushed back to share the good news of his winnings only to discover that Kokone has disappeared. He got very disappointed. This however, was short-lived when he heard Kokone's voice singing on the rooftop. Curious, he went up and found her in a wedding dress playing a piano.  This became a blatant fantasy as he then got married to her and the previous dead characters (the three thugs, butch and her girlfriend) came back to life and embraced his happiness. All of this being done on top of the rooftop. Just as they take a picture for his wedding, the flash brought him back to reality whereby, on his journey back home after his winnings, he remembered jay-walking the street only to stop when he saw a woman who looked exactly like Kokone.  Although he was shocked and frozen, he realized an oncoming truck was going to hit them and he rushed to protect the woman from the impact. This resulted in a blank and showed Kentaro in his subconscious mind still struggling to find Kokone. When he arrived at his apartment, in Kokone's place revealed a messed up mannequin with no hair and tears in her eyes, revealing the whole experience as a fantasy of Kentaro.

It was then the Goody Two-shoes Division appeared and began beating people for violating school codes. Goody Two-shoes Man was the leader of the group and none of the students could stop him. After taking Aiko to safety, Kyosuke became Hentai Kamen and fought Goody Two-shoes Man. Kyosuke was weakened when the division wrapped him in clothes, taking away his perverted powers and got him beaten. However, Hentai Kamen found pleasure in the beating and Goody Two-shoes man became unhinged and lost the fight to Kyosuke. This would only be the start in a series of unusual men all meant to bring down Hentai Kamen.  Pleasant Man arrived to the school and attempted to weaken Hentai Kamen with his pleasantness. With the feelings of pleasantness taking over him, Kyosuke used his Perverted Dance and caused Pleasant Man to freak out and choked out his pleasantness. The next would be Manly Man (aka Moho Man), he's a homosexual villain that attempts to love Hentai Kamen, but Kyosuke managed to escape his grasp. Just as he escaped, he found Slenderly Fit Man and challenged his fitness. It only took a simple jab to the stomach and Slenderly Fit Man was defeated.

However, one of his men noticed that Hentai Kamen often appears when Aiko is around and they plot a new trap for him.   Kyosuke's class has a new teacher, Towatari Sensei. It was during this time, Towatari had taken an interest in Aiko as she's behind in school. During this time, a new pervert is on the loose and looks very similar to Hentai Kamen and has been randomly sexually harassing people on the streets. Destroying Kyosuke's credibility, the copycat is character assassinating Hentai Kamen and now the public thinks he's not a hero, but just a true pervert. Unwilling to let this slide, Kyosuke found and confronted his doppelganger. Unfortunately, the pervert is more experienced than Kyosuke and draws his perversion powers through humiliation. With Hentai Kamen defeated, he was warned to never appear as Hentai Kamen ever again.   With Kyosuke defeated, Tamao felt he has won the right to take over the school. However, many of the students refuse to accept his rule and it was met with limited resistance. Kyosuke searched and found Aiko and found out she has been in a hypnotic trance for some time. Kyosuke would bump into Towatari and realized he's the fake Hentai Kamen that's been defaming him. With his perverted powers weakened, Kyosuke couldn't call forth Hentai Kamen. Tamao had a face off with Kyosuke at their gym, while being beaten, Kyosuke realized he had to draw his powers from a different emotional spectrum and he drew it from justice. Able to draw his perverted powers from this new feeling, Kyosuke restored himself as Hentai Kamen and defeated Tamao in combat. However, Towatari still had Aiko as hostage. Challenging to a final showdown, the two perverts fought.  More energized than ever, Kyosuke had the advantage and bested himself against Towatari. Both used their groin to use their Spinning Fire attack. However, Kyosuke had the advantage and power and defeated him. With his mask ruined, Aiko finally saw Kyosuke's face underneath the panties. Aiko has been emotionally confused as she have feelings for both Kyosuke and Hentai Kamen, but knowing they're the same person explains recent events. Tamao wasn't done with his rampage and made a powerful robot to destroy the school. To save it, Kyosuke asked Aiko for her panties and she reluctantly obliged. Now super charged with Aiko's panties, Hentai Kamen charged himself through the balls of the robot and finally ended Tomao. In the aftermath, Kyosuke had a wet dream about Aiko while in class and had a massive erection. While being called to stand in class to read, everyone realized Kyosuke was hard and he had to embarrassingly hide his erection.

He then goes to Ramnagar village, where he meets his mother, Savitri, and his younger sister, Padma, who are living a miserable life.  Ravi's mother tells him that his father was an honest and respected man, and he was the priest of the temple. His father was framed by Sher Singh, the tyrant zamindar (landlord), for robbing the temple since the latter saw him commit a murder. Disgusted, Ravi's father committed suicide. In revenge, young Ravi tried to kill Sher Singh, but failed. When Ravi's house is burnt, Savitri tells him to run away as Sher Singh will kill him.  With revenge in his mind, Ravi beats up Narayan Das, Singh's manager and brother-in-law, as well as threatening Sher Singh. The next day, he publicly humiliates Sher Singh's daughter, Rekha because she was beating up her innocent driver. In response, Rekha ([[Tamannaah]]) unleashes a tiger on the village in front of Ravi. Her plan was unsuccessful, however, as it backfired. Rekha falls down from the terrace and is about to be attacked by the animal, when Ravi jumps and saves her life. Rekha falls in love with Ravi, and afterwards, saves Ravi's life against her father's plans.  On the other hand, Ravi comes to know that Padma is in love with Shakti, Narayan Das's son. He has his objections and so has Narayan. However, Sher Singh tells Narayan Das that marrying Shakti with Padma would give them an upper hand over Ravi as they can ill-treat Padma and keep Ravi in control. Meanwhile, Padma now knows that Ravi is not her real brother, and the ''real'' Ravi died in a road accident. Before dying, the real Ravi asked him to take care of his family. Padma is initially upset, but then reconciles after Ravi saves her life.  Shortly after Padma and Shakti get married, both the father and son start ill-treating Padma. In revenge, Ravi uses Rekha against her own father, just like what she advises him. After Rekha tells her father that she is pregnant with Ravi, Sher Singh begs Ravi to marry his daughter. Eventually, Ravi punished Narayan Das and Shakti by doing all the household chores. He also wins the Sarpanch election, and Sher Singh finally gives all the property documents back to the villagers, which Sher Singh had illegally taken from them before.  However, Shakti overhears Rekha and Ravi's conversation about the fake pregnancy and that he is not the real Ravi. Angered, Sher Singh tries to kill him by bringing 20 fighters from the city, but failed. While they are beating Ravi, the tiger (which Ravi had fought with) comes and saves his life. Ravi then brutally beats Shakti, and is about to kill Sher Singh when his mother stops him.  In the end, Sher Singh, Narayan Das and Shakti ask for the forgiveness from Ravi, Savitri and the rest of the villagers.  
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug
 <!-- PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. PLEASE DISCUSS ON TALK PAGE BEFORE MAKING MAJOR CHANGES. --> Thorin and his company are being pursued by [[Azog]] and his [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orc]] party following the events of [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey#Plot|the previous film]].  They are ushered along by Gandalf to the nearby home of [[Beorn]], a [[Shapeshifting|skin-changer]] who can take the form of the bear. That night, Azog is summoned to [[Dol Guldur]] by the Necromancer, who commands him to marshal his forces for war, so Azog delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son [[Bolg]]. The following day, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of [[Mirkwood]], where Gandalf discovers [[Black Speech]] imprinted on an old ruin. Heeding a promise he made to [[Galadriel]], he warns the company to remain on the path and leaves to investigate the tombs of the [[Nazgûl]]. Upon entering the forest, the dwarves lose their way and are ensnared by [[Great Spiders of Mirkwood|giant spiders]]. Bilbo sets about freeing them with the help of his recently acquired [[One Ring|invisibility ring]]. He subsequently drops the ring and first begins to understand its dark influence after he brutally kills a creature to retrieve it.  The remaining spiders are fended off by the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]] led by [[Tauriel]] and [[Legolas]]. They also capture the Dwarves and bring Thorin before their king [[Thranduil]]. Thorin confronts Thranduil about his neglect of the Dwarves of Erebor following [[Smaug]]'s attack 60 years earlier, and is consequently imprisoned with the other Dwarves. Bilbo, having avoided capture, arranges an escape using empty wine barrels that are sent downstream. While being pursued by the Wood-elves, they are ambushed by Bolg and his Orc party, and [[Kíli]] is wounded with a [[Middle-earth weapons and armour#Knives|Morgul shaft]]. They engage in a running three-way battle down the river, but ultimately the Dwarves are able to escape both groups of pursuers. Thranduil then seals off his kingdom when an Orc captive reveals an evil entity has returned and is amassing an army in the south, but Tauriel decides to leave and assist the Dwarves, and Legolas goes after her. Meanwhile, Gandalf and [[Radagast]] go to investigate the tombs of the [[Nazgûl]], which they find to be empty.  The company are smuggled into [[Esgaroth]] by a bargeman called [[Bard the Bowman|Bard]], but are discovered raiding the town armory for new weapons. Thorin promises the Master and the people of Laketown a share of the mountain's treasure, and it is revealed that Bard is a descendant of the last ruler of Dale, and possesses the last black arrow capable of killing Smaug. Kíli is forced to remain behind, tended to by [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Fíli|Fíli]], [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Óin, son of Glóin|Óin]], and [[List of Middle-earth Dwarves#Bofur|Bofur]], as the remaining company receive a grand farewell. Meanwhile, Gandalf travels south to the ruins of [[Dol Guldur]], while Radagast leaves to warn [[Galadriel]] of their discovery at the tombs of the Nazgûl. Gandalf finds the ruins infested with Orcs and is ambushed by Azog. The Necromancer overpowers Gandalf and reveals himself as [[Sauron]].  Thorin and his remaining company reach the [[Lonely Mountain]], where Bilbo discovers the hidden entrance. He is sent in to retrieve the Arkenstone, and while doing so, he accidentally awakens Smaug. While trying to find Bilbo, Smaug reveals his knowledge of Sauron's return. Back in Laketown, Bard attempts to bring the black arrow to the town's launcher, as he fears what may happen when the Dwarves enter the mountain. However, he is arrested in the process and leaves his son to hide the arrow. Bolg and his Orc party infiltrate the town and attack the four Dwarves, but are quickly dispatched by Tauriel and Legolas. Tauriel then tends to Kíli, while Legolas leaves in pursuit of Bolg. Meanwhile, Gandalf watches helplessly as Azog and an Orc army march from Dol Guldur towards the Lonely Mountain.  Back inside the mountain, during a long chase, Bilbo and the Dwarves rekindle the mountain's forge using Smaug's flames to create and melt a large golden statue of [[Thrór]], hoping to bury Smaug alive in the molten gold. They do so, but Smaug emerges from the gold, storms out of the mountain and [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|flies off to destroy Laketown]] as Bilbo watches in horror.

Horns (film)
 Ignatius "Ig" Perrish is the prime suspect when his girlfriend, Merrin, is raped and murdered. Despite his declarations of innocence, he is shunned by the community. He stays with his parents and brother, Terry, hiding from the press. After a vigil led by Merrin's father, who believes Ig to be guilty, Ig drinks heavily, urinates on Merrin's memorial, and wakes up with a pair of horns protruding from his head.  While seeing his doctor about getting the horns removed, Ig, under [[anesthesia]], dreams of his childhood, when he first met Merrin. A young Ig and his friends play with [[cherry bomb]]s; Ig risks a dangerous dare to win a cherry bomb, and nearly drowns, but is saved by Lee, his childhood friend and now-lawyer. He later trades the cherry bomb to Lee in exchange for fixing Merrin's broken necklace, and Lee loses two fingers when the cherry bomb goes off accidentally. Ig and Merrin bond over the fixed necklace and fall in love, frequenting a treehouse in the woods together.  It is revealed that Ig's horns force people to tell him their darkest secrets and desires, which, at Ig's bidding, they act upon. Ig visits his parents, but under the power of the horns his mother reveals that she doesn't want him as her son, while his father tells him that he is worthless without Merrin and that a friend of his helped him burn down the lab where DNA tests were being conducted. Ig goes to a bar, where he goads the reporters into a brawl and attempts to find evidence that he didn't kill Merrin. Several people confess their deepest secrets, and the bartender burns down the building.  From one of the confessions Ig learns that a new witness in the case is a waitress at the diner where Merrin broke up with him the night she died. Ig finds her and discovers that she has been fabricating her stories to become famous. When Ig talks to Terry, he learns that Terry drove Merrin from the diner the night she died. When he touches Terry, Ig sees what happened that night: Merrin left the car en route to her home and ran into the woods; Terry passed out in the car, and woke up the next morning with a bloody rock in his hand, finding Merrin dead under the treehouse. Afraid that he would be implicated, he fled. Infuriated, Ig assaults Terry until he is arrested by Eric Hannity, a police officer and another childhood friend. The next morning Ig is released from jail with Lee's help. He discovers that because Lee is wearing Merrin's cross necklace he cannot see Ig's horns.  Ig realizes that snakes are following him wherever he goes, and uses them to exact vengeance against the waitress. He also gets Eric to act on his feelings for his police partner (who reciprocates his feelings) and forces Terry to overdose on drugs, causing Terry to be tormented by memories of Merrin's death. Ig meets Lee by the docks and pulls off Merrin's necklace; exposed to the horns, Lee falls under their influence, admitting he killed Merrin. In flashbacks, it is shown that Lee was also in love with Merrin and was deeply jealous of Ig throughout their childhood. Lee followed Merrin into the woods, thinking that she had broken up with Ig to be with him, and in a jealous rage raped her, killed her with a rock, planted it on Terry, and stole her necklace. In the ensuing confrontation, Lee overpowers him and lights him on fire in his car, causing Ig to drive into the bay. Lee claims that Ig confessed to the crime and committed suicide. The horns allow Ig to survive, horrifically burned and disfigured.  Merrin's father, who now believes Ig innocent, gives Ig the key to Merrin's lockbox. When Ig puts on Merrin's cross, his body is restored and his horns disappear. In the box, he finds a note from Merrin that explains that she knew he was going to propose, but she was dying from cancer and didn't want him to suffer, so she pushed him away under the pretense of loving someone else.  Ig confronts Lee, who does not remember their earlier fight, and leads him into the woods where Merrin was killed. Eric and Terry arrive to arrest Lee. Lee confesses to the murder, but then gleefully kills Eric and injures Terry. Ig tears off the necklace, sprouting a pair of wings and bursting into flame, transforming into a demonic monster. Despite Lee mortally wounding him, Ig impales Lee on one of his horns and telepathically forces a snake down Lee's throat, killing him. Saying that his vengeance was all-consuming, Ig dies from his injuries and his smoldering corpse turns to hardened ash, and he appears to be reunited with Merrin in the afterlife.

However, she relents after understanding her daughter's mental state and enlists the help of Jung-sook. Dong-hoon struggles to pay for medical expenses and calls his friend and manager, Gwang-sik, with the intent of quitting his job to help take care of his family. Gwang-sik is aware of Dong-hoon's situation and convinces him to keep his job, also helping to pay for So-won's medical bills.

Touched by his love and concern for her, she takes off the head of the costume and is able to look at her father for the first time since her hospitalisation.

Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and slowly begins to gain their trust, forming a bond with Ian O'Shea.   Seeker leads a search party into the desert to find Wanderer. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, Aaron and Brandt commit suicide to avoid capture. During the chase, Seeker accidentally kills another Soul, leading her superiors to call off the search.  Returning to the caves, Jared and Kyle move to kill Wanderer, causing Jamie to reveal that Melanie's consciousness is alive. Jeb and Ian accept this, but Jared refuses to believe it until he attempts to determine the truth by kissing Wanderer, provoking Melanie to take back control and slap him, proving to Jared that she is still alive. Kyle tries to kill Wanderer but endangers his own life and ends up being saved by Wanderer. Ian believes that Kyle attacked Wanderer and tells her he has feelings for her. Wanderer admits that, while occupying Melanie's body, she must love Jared, but she has feelings of her own, and the two kiss.  Wanderer enters the community's medical facility and discovers that Doc has been experimenting with ways to remove Souls and allow the host's mind to regain control, resulting in the deaths of many Souls and Hosts from his failed experiments. After isolating herself for several days, Wanderer learns that Jamie is critically ill with an infection in his leg. She infiltrates a Soul medical facility to steal some of their alien medicine, saving Jamie's life.  Seeker has continued looking for Wanderer on her own, but Jeb captures her and imprisons her in the caves. Wanderer offers to show Doc the proper method of removing Souls, on the condition that he remove her from Melanie's body and let her die. Doc uses the technique to remove Seeker from her host, with both Host and Soul surviving. Wanderer takes the Seeker alien to a Soul space-travel site, where she sends it far enough from Earth that it can not return for numerous generations.   Tired of the many lives she’s lived and finding it too painful to leave everyone behind, Wanderer makes Doc promise to let her die when she is removed and not tell anyone. Their friends intervene with Doc, who then inserts Wanderer into Pet, a human who was left brain-dead after the Soul inside her was removed. Now with a body of her own, Wanderer is able to be with Ian properly, while Melanie reunites with Jared.  A few months later, while on a supply-gathering trip, Wanderer, Melanie, Ian and Jared are captured. They discover that their captors are humans, who reveal that there are several other human groups as well. They also learn that a Soul with this group has sided with the human resistance, as Wanderer has, and they may not be the last Souls to do so.

 College student Beth Stratman (Constance Medrano) decides to travel to the small town of Bridgeport to do some additional research for a paper about local folklore. There are many stories about the old abandoned hospital there. The police think it is full of drug dealers and prostitutes. The locals think it is full of ghosts.  Unfortunately, they are both wrong.

Hours (2013 film)
 In 2005, before [[Hurricane Katrina]] strikes [[New Orleans]], Nolan Hayes rushes his wife Abigail Hayes to the emergency room as she is in labor five weeks early. The doctor explains to Nolan that his wife gave birth to a baby girl but lost her life in the process due to liver failure. Nolan refuses to accept her death and is in grief. He then learns that his newborn baby needs to be kept in a ventilator for the next two days before she can breathe on her own. The only problem is that the hurricane is beginning to flood the hospital and the ventilator can't be moved.  When the hurricane becomes too strong, everyone in the hospital, including the doctors and nurses, evacuate the building, leaving only Nolan and his baby (who he names Abigail, after her mother) in the empty hospital. One of the nurses promises to bring back help and leaves, because Nolan is unwilling to abandon his baby. The power then goes out and Nolan is forced to find a way to keep his baby alive. He finds a hand-cranked generator in a storeroom and is able to manually charge the ventilator battery, but it only holds a charge for three minutes. He also finds some more I.V.s for the baby to keep her nourished, and some food and drinks for him to stay alive as well. With each charge the battery life gets shorter. Using only that amount of time, Nolan tries to juggle trying to get help outside of the hospital and rushing to help his baby before her timer runs out. Sometimes, Nolan sits down with his baby and tells the story about how he met her mother, to help keep himself preoccupied. (The two met after stopping a bank robbery together.)  After this, Nolan finds a stray dog hiding in the hospital and takes care of it. He names the dog Sherlock while also having illusions of talking with his late wife. Nolan goes to the rooftop to find helicopters flying around the building. When he tries to signal one, criminals distract it by shooting at it, demanding to be rescued first. This leaves Nolan furious, but he has to return to his daughter to charge the battery before he can do more. Nolan manages to also find an ambulance on a flooded street outside. He calls for help using the ambulance's radio, but can't wait for a reply when he has to return to the room to charge the battery.  Nolan attempts to find a spare battery, but has no luck. After running back upstairs and charging the battery, he returns and finds a generator in a flooded basement room, but it is ruined from water, and almost electrocutes him. Nolan barely returns to the room in time to charge the battery again. Despite being awake for over 36 hours without power and running low on food, (his hand cut from cranking the generator), Nolan continues to come up with more clever ways to charge the battery (i.e. using his foot and later a rod). He also plays games with Sherlock, like playing fetch with him and sharing his lunch meat given to him by one of the hospital cooks.  Looters soon start to break into the hospital and steal food, drug and saline water for the baby. One comes in Nolan's room and tries to steal food but gets attacked by Sherlock, who runs him off. Nolan later realizes that this man had robbed and killed the nurse who was bringing back supplies (as she promised earlier). Since he hasn't slept in almost two days, Nolan takes a shot of some adrenaline to keep himself awake. Two more looters later break in the hospital and try to steal drugs to get high with and sell. When Nolan finds that they are both armed with guns, Nolan takes two shots of the adrenaline and sneaks up on one, injecting him with it and giving him a fatal overdose. Nolan takes his Marlin 336 lever-action rifle and surprises the other thug, who has discovered his baby. Nolan shakes his head "no" while holding the rifle on him, trying to get him to leave them alone. However, the man tries to shoot Nolan in revenge so Nolan shoots him in the head, vowing to his daughter that he will let no one hurt her.  Nolan is now so exhausted he cannot crank it with his hand any longer. Nolan has to use both his hands to slowly crank the handle, but breaks it off accidentally. Nolan's attempts to fix the crank generator fails, so he gives his child mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to keep her alive. Before he can do any more, Nolan passes out from shock, stress, and exhaustion. Nolan then hears the ventilator beeping; it is running out of power. However, he is too weak to get back up. Nolan accepts that he has failed his child. But Sherlock comes to his aid and brings two paramedics with him to save Nolan, and drag him out. When Nolan wakes up, the paramedics hear his baby crying and run off to find her. Abigail has finally learned to breathe on her own. The paramedics give Nolan his baby and the two embrace, with Nolan crying tears of joy as they are brought to safety.  
Horror Story (film)
 The film opens with Vikrant Nerula ([[Bikramjeet Kanwarpal]]) entering the deserted Grandiose Hotel alone. He proceeds to room 3046, goes to the terrace and jumps off, killing himself.  Seven friends, Sam ([[Hasan Zaidi]]), Margesh ([[Ravish Desai]]), Achint ([[Nishant Malkani]]), Neel ([[Karan Kundra]]), Neena ([[Radhika Menon]]), Sonia ([[Nandini Vaid]]) and Maggie ([[Aparna Bajpai]]), reunite in a local pub  after several years apart to celebrate the farewell of Neel, who is going abroad. They learn about an abandoned hotel that is reportedly haunted. It had originally been a [[mental asylum]] for the criminally insane, but was almost completely destroyed in a fire. The origin of the fire has never been fully explained. After years of neglect, the ruins were refurbished into a five star hotel by a builder. The hotel was unsuccessful due to strange happenings that drove the owner to suicide. Rumors state that he was pushed into suicide by the ghost of an asylum inmate.  All of them treat it seriously, except Maggie and Sam. They say that they wouldn't believe something they haven't seen. A worker at the bar says, that "...you would not be alive to believe once you see it". Sam suggests that the group explore the abandoned building.  They try to enter the hotel from the main door, but cannot, so enter by the back door. Neena observes strange things, but Neel brushes her claims aside. They find a TV set on with no transmission or power. Both Achint and Neel hear the sounds, "WELCOME". Ignoring it as a hallucination, they proceed to room 3046, a notorious room.  There, Sam is killed. The group flees in panic and come to realize that they are trapped inside the hotel with no way out. Achint and Margesh go to the terrace to try and find the network. There, Margesh is killed by ghost spirits.   The group starts being terrorized by a ghostly woman. Sonia is dragged into the darkness by the ghost. With three people dead, the remaining four find an abandoned jeep which they use to try to get out of the hotel, amid ghostly apparitions. After a tiring drive through misty areas, the group escape, only to find that they are back at the door of room 3046. They realize that the only way to escape is to survive until dawn.  Soon they are confronted by Sonia, whom Achint and Neel think is the ghost, but a tearful Sonia tells them that it is really her. The group learns that, when the hotel was a mental asylum, a possessed girl named Maya ([[Sheetal Singh]]) was admitted after she murdered her entire family. Maya would always claim to have 'married the devil', and would become very violent at the hospital, even killing the doctors. The fire that broke out killed all the inmates. The group realize that it is Maya who is terrorizing them.  Sonia tries to contact Maya to find what she wants. She gets a call from Maya, saying that the spirit wants to kill them all, nothing else. The terrified group then discover that Sonia is actually dead and Maya is speaking through her. Neena asks the time from Neel, only to be told that it is the same time (3:55 AM) she had seen on the clock in one of the rooms shortly after entering the hotel. Believing it is some kind of intuition, they decide to go back to the same room to understand Neena's extrasensory perception.   There they find a book containing paranormal explanations and a way to locate an energy source of dark spirits. With the help of incantations from the book, they have visions of the past. They see that the hotel was a mental asylum and find that the energy source of the dark spirit is in a shock machine. They decide to burn it down to end the horror.   Neel and Maggie go to kitchen in search of something flammable. Maggie sees a female spirit sitting on chair and reading newspaper. When she reaches towards her, Neel again brushes her aside. Maggie is killed by Maya who appears in the form of Neel. Achint is beheaded by the spirit, leaving only Neel and Neena alive.  Neel tries to burn the machine, but is pulled by the spirit into a closet. The spirit starts terrorizing Neena. Neena starts a fire. Amidst ghostly apparitions and obstructions, and with the help of the spirit of Vikrant Narula (who had died at the beginning of the film), she manages to burn the machine down. This results in the destruction of Maya's spirit. The film ends with the entrance doors of the hotel opening at dawn and a traumatized Neena, being the only survivor, walking outside.

The House at the End of Time
 In 1981, Dulce ([[Ruddy Rodríguez]]) lived in an old house with her sons Leopoldo (Rosmel Bustamante) and Rodrigo (Hector Mercado), and her husband Juan José (Gonzalo Cubero). Amid strange [[supernatural phenomena]], her family is attacked.  Dulce, bleeding from a wound on her face, regains consciousness and races downstairs to protect her family.  In the cellar, she finds Juan José dead of a stab wound, and Leopoldo disappears into thin air after being mysteriously pulled through a doorway.  When her prints are found on the murder weapon, Dulce is arrested and imprisoned. Thirty years later, an elderly Dulce is released from jail—under the requirement that she serve the rest of her sentence under [[house arrest]] in the very house where the murders took place. Once settled, Dulce is visited by a local priest (Guillermo Garcia) who wants  to restore her faith in God.  When the priest expresses his own faith in her innocence, she enlists his help to learn the truth.  Investigating the house's history in the library, the priest learns that an English Freemason built the house a hundred years earlier, only to disappear mysteriously.  Subsequent news reports indicate frequent disappearances.  Dulce claims the house to be haunted after she sees an elderly man scrawl a series of elevens on her mirror, but the police instead accuse her of being crazy.  The priest arrives in time to stop Dulce from committing suicide, and, with the house's history, convinces her that she may yet rescue her Leopoldo.  In 1981, Leopoldo and Rodrigo play with the local children.  Rodrigo develops a crush on a girl, and Leopoldo devises a secret handshake with his best friend.  After an apparent intruder in the house vanishes, Dulce becomes worried when Leopoldo hands her a note he says comes from a ghost.  The note warns her that she must prevent her children from playing together for the next few days and accuses Juan José of attempting to murder Leopoldo in the future.  Juan José dismisses the note and allows the children to play together.  During a baseball game, Leopoldo is responsible for a freak accident that kills Rodrigo.  Not knowing what else to do, Dulce consults a local medium.  The woman channels a conversation from the future in which Juan José refuses to recognize Leopoldo as his son and attempts to kill him.  Distraught, Dulce demands a divorce from Juan José.  Initially surprised, Juan José then threatens her if she attempts to take the kids away from him.  While grieving the loss of Rodrigo and confused about his failed marriage, Juan José finds evidence that Leopoldo is not his child.  Enraged that Dulce would keep this secret from him, he attacks Dulce and Leopoldo.  In 2011, as the clock hits 11:11 and 11 seconds on November 11, Dulce realizes that the house has transported her 30 years into the past, just before Rodrigo's death.  As she bangs on the doors and scares her family, she realizes that she is the source of the disturbances and ghostly apparitions that have haunted her family.  She quickly writes a note to Leopoldo that explains the future events and make him promise to give it to her 1981 self without reading it.  A version of Leopoldo from after Rodrigo's death also travels backward in time to same day and sees Rodrigo again; he tearfully embraces his brother.  When Dulce travels to the day of Leopoldo's disappearance, she meets an elderly man who introduces himself as Leopoldo from 2071.  He explains that the house has the ability to randomly transport people through time and that she must kill Juan José and abduct his 1981 self, as he has a latent disease that 1981 medicine can not cure.  Though reluctant to follow through with causing her own murder conviction and loss of a child, Dulce relents, knowing it is the only way.  In 2011, the priest leads Leopoldo out of the house, claiming to the police guards that it is one of his local orphans.  When clear, the priest reveals himself as Leopoldo's best friend by performing their secret handshake, and introduces Rodrigo's crush, now a grown woman.

They throw the cat out but he finds his way back in through a cellar window, attempting to escape a thunderstorm, and explores more of the house. Then, he hides behind an urn as the house's owner, Mr. Lawrence, a kindly old magician, has a conversation with the various automatons and gizmos he created for his magic shows while fixing one named Edison (after [[Thomas Edison]]) and later having a visit from his materialist real estate agent nephew, Daniel. Afterwards, while Lawrence dozes off, Jack and Maggie locate the cat after he re-activates Edison and Jack pursues the kitten. Before Jack throws him out, Lawrence wakes up and picks up the kitten and decides to adopt him, naming him Thunder (after his fear of lightning).  Thunder learns more about the house, as well as the romantic pigeons named Carlo and Carla. Meanwhile, Jack and Maggie try by all ways to exile Thunder from the house, jealous and afraid of being substituted. The next day, after performing a magic show at a hospital for children and while riding on a bicycle, Jack tries poking Thunder with a crayon in order to get rid of him. However, during the ensuing mayhem, Lawrence suffers an accident and is sent to the hospital.  With Lawrence in the hospital, his nephew, Daniel, tricks him into putting his house of magic up for sale by having him sign a document which provides Daniel with the power of attorney. Discovering Daniel's trick, Thunder alerts Lawrence's toys. When Daniel comes home with two possible buyers, Thunder has Carlo and Carla poop on them in order to prevent the house from being sold. Daniel returns his uncle's magic trunk back home, Jack (who broke his leg in the accident) and Maggie convince Lawrence's automatons (except Edison) that Thunder was guilty in the accident despite Thunder trying to tell the truth. He hopes Carlo and Carla will prove his innocence, which fails when they are intimidated by Jack.

Later, Thunder goes to the hospital to see Lawrence only to discover that Lawrence was never mad at him for what happened as Jack and Maggie had led him and the automatons to believe. Thunder returns home and the inhabitants of the house drive two more buyers away. When Jack and Maggie again try to exile Thunder, he tells the truth about the accident to everyone and the birds stand up for him this time, as well as the automatons. Daniel attempts various increasingly aggressive and bizarre ways to get rid of Thunder, but is foiled at every turn. His latest attempt involves a gun and leads him to believe that he finally got rid of Thunder only to get kicked out of the house by his uncle's toys in retaliation for Thunder's supposed "death." Lawrence also discovers Daniel's deceit and tries to leave the hospital. Meanwhile, Thunder (revealed to have survived), Jack, Maggie, and the rest of Lawrence's toys are in a race against time to save the house before Daniel destroys it using a wrecking ball.  When Lawrence gets back from the hospital with the help of some of the children he met there and finds his nephew swinging a wrecking ball, he finally discovers Daniel's true colors. Meanwhile Jack is stuck midway in the cat-flap of the front door, as Thunder attempts to save all the automatons from getting crushed. When he saves Maggie's life, Thunder finally earns the mouse's respect and friendship. They band together and use Daniel's cat-allergy against him until he ends up wrecking his own beloved car instead with the wrecking ball. Lawrence orders Daniel to make repairs on the house. Thunder is finally accepted as a member of the family by Jack and Maggie. When Lawrence recovers from his injuries, he returns to entertaining children with his magic shows, in which Thunder now has his own part alongside Jack and Maggie. Thunder is happy finally to have a family that appreciates him.  
House of Good and Evil
 Maggie Conley has a miscarriage after an argument with her husband, Chris, turns physical. To save their marriage, they move to a large house in rural Virginia. They are met by a real estate agent, Rob Bradley, who explains that the house has been converted into a duplex. A quiet, elderly couple, the Andersons, rent the other half of the house.  As constant storms have made public utilities prohibitively expensive, Bradley suggests that they use cell phones and a generator.    After showing them the house, Bradley comes upon a locked door and offers to return in a week with the key. Later, Chris refuses Maggie's offer to start the generator and insists on doing it himself. That night, Chris celebrates with mixed alcoholic drinks.  Annoyed that he has resumed drinking, Maggie declines to join him in bed.  Maggie has a nightmare about the locked room involving vines connecting to her umbilical cord. After Chris drives into town for supplies, she forces her way into the room. She hears a loud ringing from an [[rotary dial|rotary]]-style telephone and she is frustrated when Chris reacts skeptically to her account. While they take a walk, he points out that the telephone lines are still down, and Maggie angrily accuses him of not supporting her. Tensions are further raised when Chris announces that he must leave the house for several days. Chris, a firefighter, explains that late fires have started in the nearby forest.    Because of the poor cell reception, Maggie is forced to travel to a clearing to use her cell phone, but is continually frightened away by strange noises in the trees. Maggie becomes increasingly agitated as she misses Chris' daily phone calls and continues to hear ringing from the Andersons' house. Maggie makes several unsuccessful attempts to meet the Andersons, only to meet Mr. Anderson one night after the generator stalls. Dressed in a nightgown and feeling vulnerable, she does not answer his double entendres as he restarts it for her. After she overhears Mrs. Anderson talking on the phone, she breaks into the Andersons' house; after she apologizes, the two chat.    Mrs. Anderson says that her husband is also a firefighter, though it is only a desk job due to his age and the lack of any recent fires. Already uncomfortable due to the previous revelation, Maggie leaves when her life and Mrs. Anderson's increasingly continue to mirror each other. Later, as the two take a walk together, Mrs. Anderson reveals that her husband beats her.  When Chris finally returns, Maggie confronts him in a rage, and he knocks her unconscious. Maggie accuses Chris of domestic violence, but he says that she was hysterical. At dinner, she and Chris get into another argument, and Maggie leaves the table as he shouts at her to sit back down.  Quoting Mrs. Anderson, Maggie calls Chris a violent monster, and grabs an axe. Seeing this unfold outside, Mr. Anderson belittles Chris's manhood, and offers to kill Maggie.    Offended, Chris attacks Anderson, but Anderson fatally stabs him. Maggie kills Mr. Anderson with the axe and reconciles with Chris as he dies. She goes into the house, calling for Mrs. Anderson, who she saw through a window outside. A scream is heard from inside the house followed by repeated thuds. When Bradley returns, he finds the formerly locked room has been turned into a shrine to Maggie's lost baby, and Maggie is cuddling with Chris' decomposing corpse.    Later, the police explain that Maggie apparently went insane with grief after Chris choked on his own vomit the same night they arrived. The Andersons pull up in their car and reveal that they have only just arrived back from a vacation; Maggie imagined their presence.

 Daisy, a neurotic and anorexic American teenager, is sent to the English countryside for the summer to stay with her Aunt Penn and her cousins, Eddie, Isaac, and Piper. She arrives at [[Heathrow Airport]] to tightened security and reports of a bombing in Paris, and Isaac drives to her cousins' farm, which she discovers to be dilapidated and very messy. Although initially abrasive, Daisy warms to them upon learning that her deceased mother used to stay there frequently. She also falls in love with Eddie, her eldest cousin, finding him to be as introverted and strong-willed as she, and noticing his unusual, almost mystical connection to animals. A few days after her arrival, her aunt flies to Geneva to attend an emergency conference because she is an expert in terrorist extremist groups, and the group takes advantage of her absence to explore their local woodlands.  Their summer fun ends when a [[terrorism|terrorist]] coalition detonates a nuclear bomb in London that potentially kills hundreds of thousands; the nuclear fallout reaches as far away as their home. In the aftermath, electricity goes out, and they learn from an emergency radio broadcast that [[martial law]] has been imposed. The next day, an American consular official arrives at the house and offers Daisy passage home. Unable to help her cousins, he advises them to remain indoors and wait for evacuation. After they move to a nearby barn, Daisy has sex with Eddie and decides that she would rather stay with them.

Determined to escape, Daisy discreetly begins hoarding supplies, but their neighbourhood is attacked by the enemy before she has time to take everything she needs.  As Daisy and Piper hike through the countryside, Daisy interprets her dreams of Eddie as indications of his current situation. One night, Daisy is woken up and witnesses a gang-rape. She and Piper flee, but after Piper starts whining, Daisy threatens to abandon her. Already disturbed by the prior experience, they discover a massacre at the camp where Isaac and Eddie were taken. Daisy reluctantly checks the bodies; although Eddie is not among the dead, Isaac's body is. She mournfully takes his glasses and later buries them. As they leave, they are spotted by two armed men, who chase them through the woods. Piper and Daisy decide to hide, but the men discover Piper. Daisy threatens them with a gun and impulsively shoots them both; she kills one and wounds the other. The horror of what she has done, along with her fears, begins to take its toll on Daisy. Later, she realises that they have lost their map and compass, and the girls are on the verge of giving up when they see Eddie's pet hawk fly overhead. They realise it will lead them home and follow it.  Upon arriving home, their elation turns to horror when they discover that the military garrison stationed there has been massacred; the house is ransacked and empty; only Jet, Piper's dog, remains. Eddie is not at the barn where they took shelter either, and although Piper is elated to be home, Daisy breaks down in tears outside. The next day, however, the two hear Jet barking, and Daisy runs out into the woods, where she finds Eddie lying unconscious; he has severe burns, gashes, and his eyes are swollen shut. As she nurses him, a ceasefire is announced, electricity is returned, a new government forms, and the country begins to recover. However, it becomes clear Eddie suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] and is mute.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire
    After the 74th Hunger Games, [[Katniss Everdeen]] and [[Peeta Mellark]] return to [[Fictional world of The Hunger Games#District 12|District 12]], where President Snow visits Katniss. Snow explains that her actions in the Games have inspired uprisings. He orders her to use the upcoming Victory Tour to convince people that her actions were out of love for Peeta and not defiance against the Capitol, or District 12 will be destroyed, "just like [[Fictional world of The Hunger Games#District 13|District 13]]". He makes Katniss promise that the two will not lie to each other.  As the tour begins, Haymitch Abernathy warns Katniss and Peeta that the "show" of their relationship must continue for the rest of their lives. Katniss suggests they announce their [[engagement]], which is approved by Snow, with their wedding to be staged at his mansion in the Capitol.  Katniss warns Gale Hawthorne of Snow's threat to kill both their families. Peacekeepers crack down on District 12, and Gale is publicly whipped after attacking new Head Peacekeeper Romulus Thread. Snow announces that the third Quarter Quell of the upcoming Hunger Games will involve tributes selected from previous victors. Katniss immediately devotes herself to ensuring Peeta's survival, and makes Haymitch promise to help. At the reaping, [[List of The Hunger Games characters|Effie Trinket]] draws Katniss's and Haymitch's names, but Peeta immediately volunteers to take Haymitch's place.  Haymitch reveals that the tributes are angry about being returned to the Games, and all of them will most likely attempt to stop the games. For her pre-Games interview, Katniss wears a wedding dress, as ordered by Snow, but her stylist Cinna rigs it to transform into a representation of a [[mockingjay]]. Peeta announces on-air that he and Katniss secretly married and are expecting a baby. The audience of Capitol citizens shouts for the Games to be stopped, to no avail. Just before Katniss enters the arena, Cinna is severely beaten and dragged away by Peacekeepers, as Katniss watches helplessly.  In the Games, Katniss allies with Finnick Odair and the elderly Mags, his mentor. When the arena's force field shocks Peeta, stopping his heart, Finnick revives him. The group flees from a [[Blister agent|poisonous fog]], with Finnick carrying Mags, but when Peeta cannot go on, Mags sacrifices herself so that Finnick can help him. When [[mandrill]]s attack, Peeta is saved by the unexpected sacrifice of a hiding tribute, the female from District 6. The group escapes to the beach around the central lake, where Finnick greets District 3's Wiress and Beetee and District 7's Johanna Mason. Wiress repeats the phrase "tick-tock", leading Katniss to realize that the arena is designed like a clock, with unchanging hazards each hour contained within their respective zones on the clock. As the team waits for the next danger, Wiress is stabbed to death by Gloss, who alongside his sister Cashmere, and District 2 tributes Brutus and Enobaria, comprise the Careers. Having wounded Gloss earlier, Katniss immediately fatally shoots him while Johanna strikes Cashmere with her axe, killing her. Enobaria wounds Finnick with a knife, and escapes with Brutus, while Katniss and the others flee the beach as well.  Beetee suggests luring the Careers to the wet beach and electrocuting them by running his wire to the lake from a tree that is struck by lightning every 12 hours, having won his games by doing so, killing six tributes at once. The group separates to prepare the trap, Finnick and Peeta protecting Beetee, and Katniss running the wire down to the beach with Johanna. While pulling the coil, an unknown source of tension makes it apparent another tribute is on their tail. When Brutus and Enobaria emerge, Johanna knocks Katniss to the ground, cuts the tracker out of her arm, and flees. Katniss returns to the tree and finds an unconscious Beetee. Unable to recover Peeta, and hearing a cannon, Katniss almost kills Finnick, but he reminds her to remember who "the real enemy" is, as Haymitch had advised her before the games. Katniss attaches the wire to an arrow and shoots it into the arena's roof just as the lightning hits. The lightning strike leaves her paralyzed, causes a power failure that brings down the dome and cuts off the Capitol's surveillance.  Katniss awakens in a hovercraft with Beetee, who is still unconscious. In another room she finds Haymitch, Finnick, and Plutarch Heavensbee, the head Gamemaker, who is revealed to be a rebel against Snow. He tells her they are bound for District 13, headquarters of the rebellion, and that half the tributes (the ones from 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 11) were recruited to help Katniss escape, as she is the symbol of the growing rebellion. They were unable to rescue Peeta and Johanna, and they are captives in the Capitol. Katniss is sedated after attacking Haymitch for not keeping his promise to protect Peeta. She later awakens to find Gale by her side. He assures her that her family is safe, but District 12 has been destroyed by the Capitol.

  Joseph Smith is a former [[United Kingdom Special Forces|Special Forces]] soldier who went [[AWOL]] from his unit while deployed in [[Afghanistan]], and is now living as a homeless drunk in [[London]]. One night, he is attacked and chased by a group of thugs engaged in shaking down homeless people; he successfully hides by breaking into an apartment. Realizing that the residents are absent, he explores the flat and deduces that the owner, a successful photographer named Damon, is in [[New York City]] until the first of October - several months away. He decides to [[Squatting|squat]] there until Damon returns, and establishes a new identity for himself: calling himself Joey Jones, wearing Damon's clothes, driving his car, and spending his time searching for his homeless friend Isabel, from whom he was separated some time before. He finds Damon's new debit card in the apartment mail, and begins stealing from him to fund a regimen of self-improvement. Meanwhile, Isabel has been coerced into becoming a prostitute by the same gang that attacked Joseph.  Joey is friends with Sister Cristina, a [[Poles|Polish]] nun who runs the local soup kitchen, and she helps him with antibiotics for the wounds he received in the fight with the thugs and information on Isabel's whereabouts. To deflect suspicion of Damon's neighbors, he tells them that he is Damon's boyfriend. To avoid using any more of Damon's money from the debit card, Joey gets a job at a Chinese restaurant. One night at work, the management call upon him to help deal with some rowdy diners. The fighting skill he displays brings him to the attention of senior manager Mr. Choy, who is connected to a London Chinese organized crime syndicate; he hires Joey as a driver and enforcer, tasked with collecting extorted payments and delivering drugs. He saves some of the money he receives and begins to do charitable work, ordering pizzas for the homeless at the soup kitchen and buying gifts for Cristina. The homeless begin calling him "Crazy Joe". He finds Dawn, his ex and mother of his young daughter, and starts giving her money.  Joey invites Cristina to dinner at a barbecue in the street behind the Chinese restaurant. Cristina attends, but shows him a police photo of Isabel, who had been beaten to death and thrown in the river. Joey becomes upset, but Cristina is able to calm him, and encourages him to start an honest life. He finds the street thugs who chased him away from Isabel and viciously beats them, interrogating them about Isabel's murder, acquiring a rough description of her killer. Joey meets Cristina at an art gallery showing off Damon's work, to give her this information to pass on to the police. She gets a bit tipsy, opens up to Joey, and they kiss. She tells him about a ballet ticket she has for the same date as when Damon is due to return.  The police eventually learn of Joey's activities, and begin questioning Cristina. Joey finds her later, and they share life stories. As a child, she was sexually abused by her gymnastics instructor in Warsaw, and eventually killed him. Being too young for prison, she was instead sent to a convent. Cristina is ashamed of her relationship with Joey, and asks her mother superior to be transferred to another mission in Sierra Leone. Joey continues his search for Isabel's killer, trading services with Mr. Choy's boss. He is given the keys to a truck with boxes containing Chinese victims of human trafficking to be delivered.  Meanwhile, Isabel's killer, Max Forrester, is savagely beating another hooker. A neighbor finds Max's invitation to a rooftop cocktail party, and the invitation finds its way to Joey, who had put the word out that he wanted information of someone fitting Max's description. The party is on the first of October.  Joey meets Cristina the day of the first of October. He asks her to take photos of him for his daughter, and he hints that he won't be the same for long. She tells him that she is leaving for Africa, and that she wants to be with him before she leaves; the last of her "crazy patch" she's going through, she says. The two consummate their relationship as the apartment's owner returns, and they escape through the back. She invites him to the ballet. He delivers the photos and a bag full of cash to his ex and daughter, who does not recognize him.  Cristina waits for Joey, but he goes to the rooftop cocktail party instead. He finds Max Forrester and throws him from the roof many stories down in front of the guests, killing him. Cristina leaves the ballet, still looking for Joey. She finds him drunk and sleeping on the curb near the ballet theatre. He reveals that he is wanted by the military police for court martial for a random revenge killing he carried out in Afghanistan in payback for the deaths of five of his men, who were slaughtered in front of him in a tank. He often has random hallucinations of the innocent man he hanged and hallucinates hummingbirds; as thus was what the aerial drones in Afghanistan were designated. He explains to her that when he is sober and functional, he hurts people, because that is what his training turned him into. Joey tells her that he is going to return to life as a wandering drunk because that way he doesn't hurt anybody, but not before he gives the police information on Mr. Choy's human trafficking operation.  The next day, Cristina is leaving for Africa, and receives a note from Joey. He has paid his debts with everyone and is homeless again. As he walks the streets, the police are closing in, and he is hunted by a surveillance drone similar to the one that witnessed his crimes in Afghanistan.

Some of their differences are highlighted when they talk about their honeymoon in Morocco: Nat didn't enjoy the leather museum; Josh remembers it as interesting. When the topic changes to Josh's former flame, Chloe ([[Anna Faris]]), Nat discovers that the two never officially broke up when Chloe departed to Africa for four years. In the kitchen Chloe apologizes to Nat for not realising she didn't know. The women talk about the constrictions of marriage. Nat's sister Naomi has issues with her own husband's annoying habits. Josh's best man Danny asks Chloe out but is rebuffed.  The following day, Nat and her work-colleagues make fun of their new client, Guy Harrap ([[Simon Baker]]), the new owner of a bleach company. They believe he will be a stereotypical American who thinks the British are "quaint". They do not realize that their client has been sitting right there in the same café. Before the meeting, one colleague steals Nat's wedding ring, believing that the account will have a better chance of success if she appears single. During the meeting, Guy deliberately fulfils their expectations of him: speaking in a brash American way, asking for high-fives and casual fist-bumps, asking Nat to repeat certain words he finds amusing and doing a crude Austin Powers impression. Then when they focus on business talk, he switches to his true self, embarrassing the women for their earlier stereotyping. As he and Nat exit the boardroom, she apologizes for their misjudgment of him, and he says they should get better acquainted for the sake of the account. Feeling the attraction between them, she struggles with telling him she's married, then ends up leaving without telling him.  Josh talks to Chloe about his book while she's working at a charity office. He invites her to dinner because Nat's going to a work party that night. Chloe declines, saying she's going out with her work-colleague Charlie, whom she's been dating.  The scene returns to the marriage-guidance counsellor's office as the two explain that the realities of marriage do not live up to the fairytale expectation they both had.  Unable to focus on his writing, Josh sits at home watching television while Nat's out jogging. At work, Nat receives a large bouquet of roses from Guy. The couple bicker over domestic issues; Josh leaving the toilet seat up, Nat's inability to sing the right words to popular songs and their different definitions of the rubbish bin being full.  Guy shows Nat around one of the factories he owns, where one of his longest-serving workers expresses approval of her as a potential wife for him. Guy explains that he basically grew up in the factory during his childhood summers. Nat comments that she's not the marrying type, still unable to tell Guy she's married.  Nat tries to discourage Josh from accompanying her to a work party, but he is determined, irritating her. At the party, he makes a fool of himself with embarrassing dancing and standing next to a poster he can joke about during the night. When he approaches Nat while she's talking with Guy, she still doesn't reveal that he is her husband and Guy attempts to shake him off, assuming he's an unwanted menace. Guy asks her to dinner and Nat declines. Incredibly annoyed at Josh for embarrassing her at the party, she heads home without him.  Meanwhile, Chloe and Charlie attend a boring dinner party, then leave early to adjourn to Charlie's apartment. As they kiss on the bed, Chloe's colleague Alexandra joins them and Chloe finds herself in an awkward threesome. Feeling too silly to continue, Chloe eventually leaves. The next morning she calls Josh to tell him about it, and he soon turns up at her apartment with coffee and her favourite sweets to cheer her up.  Chloe and Josh then go Christmas-shopping. Josh wants to get casserole dishes for Nat but Chloe laughs that this is not a present for a wife and she must help him; they end up at a lingerie shop with Josh uncomfortably trying to make conversation with the shop assistant amongst the shop's expensive contents. Chloe tries on a lingerie set, and asks Josh what he thinks of it. They end up kissing in the dressing room, although both are embarrassed about it afterwards. Josh ends up buying the lingerie.  When Nat meets with Guy at his hotel to discuss their business deal, she rebuffs his attempts to get her into his room. He mentions that he has booked a conference room down the hall, but when Nat enters she finds a romantic dinner complete with doves and a violinist. When Guy makes advances, she finally blurts out that she's married and can't leave her husband because it would destroy him, and finally storms out.  Guy chases after Nat and they bump into Chloe and Josh on the street. After some initial awkward exchanges, Josh suggests that Chloe and Guy get together and they agree on a double date.  Back to the present in the counsellor's office: Nat explains that they hit a low point around the Christmas period, commenting that her husband's family are weird—in particular his mother. Josh retaliates that Nat's family were not overly friendly towards him.  The scene shifts to a Christmas family reunion at Nat's parents', where a series of embarrassing incidents revolving around Josh occur. Josh unwittingly but clumsily offends Nat's grandmother during a game of charades, Nat's father makes him sleep on the upper deck of a bunk bed of a young female relative, and Nat's parents giving Josh a pair of books titled ''How to Be a Successful Writer'' and ''How to Stop Wasting Your Life''. At the end of the visit, while leaving her parents' house, Nat confronts Naomi about why she stays with her husband as they clearly hate each other. Naomi says that they both "embrace the hatred" and that is what marriage is about. Even though she admits there could be something better out there for her, she ultimately loves her husband.  Nat and Josh have a conversation about his suggestion of Chloe dating Guy. The two talk about the prospects of both of them as romantic interests. The four meet for dinner, and spend the evening playing pool. Chloe and Guy seem to hit it off, happily competing against Nat and Josh. Nat becomes more frustrated with Josh's clumsy and patronising attempt to teach her how to play properly, as well as with her growing jealousy towards Chloe, who can play well. They leave the bar, and Nat asks Guy to talk about packaging details, intending to meet Josh back at their flat afterwards. Chloe and Josh depart together, while Nat and Guy go the other direction. After a moment, Nat passionately kisses Guy, resulting in the ripping of the underwear bought for her by Josh.  Meanwhile, Josh attempts to discourage Chloe's attraction to Guy, and she admits she is and has always been still in love with him, lamenting that Josh never stopped her from leaving and insisting that their current circumstances are impossible, that they cannot see each other anymore.  When Nat returns home, she and Josh talk about their relationship. After nine months they decide to get help instead of giving up on their marriage. This leads us back to the counsellor's office, who ultimately advises them to try to make it to the one-year marker.  The couple then put up with each other's quirks over the next few months, eventually making it to their anniversary. Nat brings out the same expensive lingerie for the special occasion, and struggles to do it up because of two broken hooks, remembering the circumstances in which they were broken—her with Guy. Josh meanwhile leaves the flat, telling Nat he's remembered he has to do something and that he will meet her at the restaurant. He races to Chloe's apartment, only to find that she is heading off in a cab with Guy, whom she embraces lovingly. Nat contemplates phoning Guy, but then decides to go to the restaurant, where her friends and family are there waiting to surprise the couple. After failing to contact Josh, Nat sits down. She discovers that their friends didn't think her marriage would last.  Josh makes it to the restaurant party, and tells Nat that he thinks she is the perfect wife, just not for him. He asks her for a divorce and she immediately and delightedly agrees. The couple rejoice at the situation, and immediately leave the party one after the other.  Meanwhile, Guy and Chloe are at the railway station waiting to go to Paris on a romantic trip. Josh finds them and professes his love for Chloe. When it's discovered that he split up with Nat, the two are shocked. Nat appears behind Josh, who awkwardly assumed he is the one she wants to speak to, but it turns out she was there for Guy. After a short exchange they happily discuss how perfect Guy and Chloe are for them. In the end, Chloe and Guy mutually break up. Nat ends up kissing Guy and Chloe shares a kiss with Josh.

I Am Breathing
 I AM BREATHING reminds us what it is to be alive - a tale of fun and laughs with a smattering of upset and devastation. Within a year, Neil Platt goes from being a healthy 30-something British bloke with a great sense of humor to becoming completely paralyzed from the neck down, thanks to the devastating illness he has inherited - known as ALS, MND, or [[Lou Gehrig's Disease]]. As his body gets weaker, his perspective on life changes. His humour remains, but new wisdom emerges: "It's amazing how adaptable we are when we have to be. It's what separates us and defines us as human beings." Knowing he only has a few months left to live, and while he still has the ability to speak, Neil puts together a letter and memory box for his baby son Oscar and communicates his experience and thoughts about life in a blog - and in this film which he was determined to make. The directness of his communication mingles with images of the sensory details of a life well lived, and makes us revalue the ordinary. His blog posts form the film's narration as he tells his own story through memories and impressions of his life - the sheer joy of falling in love, of partying with his mates, of fast motorbike rides. Through his determination to share his final journey, he makes us ask questions about our own lives.<ref></ref>

I'm So Excited (film)
 The film opens as ground technician León ([[Antonio Banderas]]) removes the [[Wheel_chock|chocks]] from the wheels of an [[Airbus A340]] for Peninsula Flight 2549. He waves to his wife Jessi ([[Penélope Cruz]]), who is towing a luggage cart across the tarmac. The distraction causes her to crash into another ground technician who was checking [[Twitter]]. León checks on his wife to make sure she is okay, and she reveals that she is pregnant.  On board the aircraft, a flight attendant drugs all the passengers in Economy class with a muscle relaxant. She also sedates herself and the other flight attendants in Economy. First Class is tended to by Joserra ([[Javier Cámara]]), Fajardo ([[Carlos Areces]]), and Ulloa ([[Raúl Arévalo]]). They take shots of [[tequila]] as they prepare service for the passengers and the cockpit. One of the first class passengers, Bruna ([[Lola Dueñas]]), observes that the Economy passengers are asleep, and she visits the cockpit. She informs Joserra, Captain Alex Acero ([[Antonio_de_la_Torre_(actor)|Antonio de la Torre]]), and co-pilot Benito Morón ([[Hugo Silva (actor)|Hugo Silva]]) that she is a psychic and a virgin.   Bruna makes vaguely ominous warnings about the flight. Joserra asks her if they will all die. Bruna does not think so, because she retches whenever death is imminent. Benito changes his drink order from wine to tequila at Bruna's news. Two more passengers from First Class come to the cockpit: Norma Boss ([[Cecilia Roth]]), and Infante ([[José María Yazpik]]). Norma is outraged at Peninsula's treatment of its passengers, particularly the fact that the First Class attendants are not serving the passengers. She is organizing a complaint against the airline. During her visit, Joserra reveals that he is the captain's lover, but with two daughters, aged 11 and 13, the captain is reluctant to come out of the closet and leave his wife. The co-pilot admits that he tried giving fellatio to the captain to see if he was gay, but he retched from the experience.  Mr. Más (José Luis Torrijo), another First Class passenger, visits the cockpit to offer his help, because he knows that something is wrong with the plane.  León forgot to clear all the chocks after Jessi's accident, and one of them has gotten tangled up with the landing gear. The plane will not be able to land with its wheels down.   When Norma finds out that the Economy passengers have been drugged, she becomes more determined to lodge a formal complaint. She wakes a sleeping passenger, Ricardo Galán ([[Guillermo Toledo]]), and asks him to sign her letter of complaint. Ricardo asks to use the phone, and he calls Alba ([[Paz Vega]]). The plane's phone is malfunctioning, however, so everyone can hear the other side of the conversation over the cabin's speakers.   Alba has climbed onto the ledge of the [[Segovia Viaduct]] in [[Madrid]], when her phone rings with Ricardo's call. She is relieved to hear from him, but as she tries to climb back to safety, she drops her phone. It falls into the basket of Ruth ([[Blanca Suárez]]), who is riding a bicycle under the viaduct. She picks up the phone and is astonished to hear the voice of her ex-lover Ricardo. She had worked very hard to overcome the heartache of their breakup. Ruth realizes that Alba had thrown all of Ricardo's things out of her apartment window before attempting suicide. Ruth gathers Ricardo's things while Alba is taken by ambulance for psychiatric treatment.  On board the plane, the flight attendants try to distract the passengers, who know that their lives are in danger. They perform a dance routine to [[The Pointer Sisters]]' "[[I%27m_So_Excited|I'm So Excited]]", and then they mix a batch of [[Agua_de_Valencia|Valencia cocktails]]. One of the passengers is smuggling a drug-filled condom in his anus. He gives the flight attendants some of his [[mescaline]], and they put it into the cocktail. Norma enjoys her cocktail and reveals that she has a thriving [[dominatrix]] practice. She is horrified to learn that she has been drugged and that one of the side effects of mescaline is sexual arousal.  The passengers act on their drug-induced sexual urges. Norma has sex with Infante. The Captain joins Joserra in the bathroom. Bruna goes back to economy class and loses her virginity with one of the passengers who has an erection in his sleep. Ulloa performs fellatio on the co-pilot.   The plane finally gets clearance to land at [[Ciudad_Real_Central_Airport#Current_situation|La Mancha airport]], which is a [[boondoggle]] engineered by Mr. Más. As they prepare to jettison the 40 tons of fuel on board, the co-pilot tells the captain that he and Ulloa [[69_(sex_position)|69'ed]] each other. The captain explains that the co-pilot is in denial about the fact that he is gay. Bruna confesses that she feels like retching, which means death must be near. She narrows the sensation down to one passenger in particular: Infante. He confesses that he is a hit man. He was hired to kill Norma by the wife of one of her clients, but refuses because he won't kill a woman.  The aircraft successfully makes a crash landing at the airport. Norma and Infante leave the tarmac arm in arm while he plots how he can escape from his contract and his life as a hit man. Ruth meets Ricardo with a suitcase full of his things that she recovered from Alba. Mr. Más calls his wife, who has reunited with their estranged daughter, and vows to join the reunion, even though he knows he will be arrested. Bruna and the passenger she seduced are happily walking side by side. The captain tells Joserra that he will leave his family to move in with him, but Joserra reveals that he and the captain's wife are in constant contact, and that it is not necessary to break up the family. Underneath the [[Firefighting_foam|foam]], two figures are clearly having sex. The co-pilot's hat comes flying out of the foam.

 In [[Denver]], accountant Sandy Patterson ([[Jason Bateman]]) buys identity theft protection from Diana ([[Melissa McCarthy]]), a con artist, over the phone and reveals all of his personal information.  At work, after Sandy clashes with his obnoxious and bullying boss, Harold Cornish ([[Jon Favreau]]), he receives a phone call that reminds him he has an appointment at a salon in Florida. Confused, he puts it out of his mind when co-worker Daniel Casey ([[John Cho]]) suggests they and several others leave Cornish's company and start their own firm; Sandy agrees to join them.

As the credit card company tells him that he has spent huge amounts of money in Florida, he is arrested for missing a court date there.  At the police station, Detective Reilly ([[Morris Chestnut]]) determines Diana has stolen Sandy's identity.  The situation worsens when cops ask Daniel, now his boss, about Sandy's possession of drugs.  Reilly says Sandy's name was used to buy drugs from someone named Paolo ([[Jonathan Banks]]).   Even though it's clear Sandy is not guilty Reilly states he cannot be formally cleared of suspicion until they have evidence of Diana's guilt as it still could technically be Sandy in the eyes of the law. Daniel states they may have to fire Sandy due these issues. When the cops say they can do nothing due to jurisdictional issues unless the identity thief is in Denver, Sandy offers to retrieve her and convince her to clear his name with his boss , despite his wife, Trish's ([[Amanda Peet]]) concerns.

Ida (film)
 In the 1960s [[Polish People's Republic]], Anna, a young novice nun, is told by her prioress that before she takes her vows she must visit her aunt, Wanda Gruz, who is her only surviving relative. Anna travels to visit her aunt Wanda, a chain-smoking, hard-drinking, sexually promiscuous judge who reveals that Anna's actual name is Ida Lebenstein. Ida's parents had been [[Jews of Poland|Jews]] who were murdered late in the [[History of Poland (1939–45)|German occupation of Poland]] during [[World War II]] (1939–45). Ida was then an infant, and as an orphan she had been raised by the convent. Wanda, who had been a [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Communist resistance fighter]] against the German occupation, had become the state prosecutor "Red Wanda"<ref>"Red Wanda" is the English subtitle translation of the Polish "Krwawa Wanda". The literal translation is "Bloody Wanda"; see </ref>  who sent "men to their deaths".  Wanda tells Ida that she should try some worldly sins and pleasures before she decides to take her vows. On their way to their hotel for the night, Wanda picks up a hitchhiker, Lis (Polish for "fox"), who turns out to be an [[alto saxophone]] player who is going to a gig in the same town. Wanda tries to get Ida interested in Lis, and to come to his show, but she resists until drifting down after hours to watch the little band wrapping up their evening with a song after the crowd has left. Lis is indeed drawn to Ida and talks with her before she leaves for the night to rejoin her aunt who is passed out in their room.  Ida wants to find the graves of her parents. Wanda asks her what would happen if she goes to where their bodies are buried and discovers that God is not there. Wanda takes her to the house they were born in and used to own, which is now occupied by a Pole, Feliks Skiba and his family. Wanda had left her young son with Ida's family (Wanda's sister and brother-in-law) during the war; the Skibas had taken over the home and land, and hidden the Lebensteins from the German authorities. Wanda, a former prosecutor, demands that Feliks and his father tell her what happened to the Lebensteins. Finally, Feliks agrees to tell them—if Ida promises that they will leave the Skibas alone and give up any claim to the house.  Feliks takes the women to the burial place in the woods and digs up the bones of their family. He admits to Ida that he took the three into the woods and killed them. Feliks says that because Ida was very small and able to pass for a Christian, he was able to give her to a convent. But Wanda's small son was "dark and circumcised". He couldn't pass for a Christian child, and Feliks had killed him along with Ida's parents.  Wanda and Ida take the bones to their family burial plot, in an abandoned, overgrown Jewish cemetery in [[Lublin]], and bury them.<ref name=Stevens></ref>  Wanda and Ida then part ways and return to their previous existences and routines, but they both have been profoundly affected by their experience, and nothing is the same. Although Wanda continues to drink and engage in apparently meaningless casual sex, she is also now mourning not only the loss of her son and sister, but the niece whom she has just met and who reminds her deeply of her sister. Ida returns to the convent but is visibly unenthusiastic about her life there, and even sees some of it with a new perspective of humor. Wanda's melancholy deepens and she ultimately jumps to her death out of her apartment window. Ida returns to attend Wanda's funeral, where she sees Lis again. At Wanda's apartment, Ida changes out of her nun's habit and into Wanda's [[Stiletto heel|stilettos]] and evening gown, tries smoking and drinking, and then goes to Lis' gig, where he later teaches her to dance.  After the show Ida and Lis sleep together. The next morning Lis suggests they get married, have children, and after that, live "life as usual." After sleeping with him one more time, Ida quietly arises without awakening Lis, dons her convent habit again and leaves.

Magda is quarantined because of her lung disease. Ewa is almost deported, but Bruno ([[Joaquin Phoenix]]), who is Jewish and claims to be from the [[Travelers' Aid Society]],  notices her and her fluency in English, bribes an officer to let her go, and takes her to his house. Knowing Ewa has to make money to get Magda released, Bruno lets her dance at the Bandits' Roost theater and prostitutes her. Bruno also becomes interested in her romantically.  Ewa looks for her expatriate relatives living in New York, but her uncle by marriage turns her in to the authorities; he says he had heard she had gotten in trouble for engaging in illicit behavior on the ship from Europe, and he wishes to distance himself from sheltering a prostitute. Policemen take her back to Ellis Island, and once again she is slated for deportation. While at Ellis Island Ewa watches a performance by Emil ([[Jeremy Renner]]) (Bruno's cousin, making a living as a performing [[illusionist]] called Orlando); after his performance he hands her a white rose. The next morning Bruno manages to get her released.  Ewa meets Emil again at the Bandit's Roost. Emil asks Ewa to come onstage to aid him in his mind reading trick, but the men in the audience start [[catcalling]] at Ewa. The scene ends in a brawl between Bruno and Emil and with Bruno and the girls being fired from the theater. Soon after Bruno has his "doves" parade around [[Central Park]] to attract men to sleep with them. Another encounter between Emil and Ewa proves Emil's feelings for her. Emil falls for Ewa, much to Bruno's discontent, which causes continued and intense conflicts between the two men. One violent conflict concludes with Bruno's being jailed overnight.  One day, Emil sneaks into Bruno's home to see Ewa. While there, he promises to get her the money to save her sister so they can all leave New York together. Coincidentally, shortly after making such promise, Emil hides as Bruno returns. Bruno also makes a promise to Ewa: he is to arrange for her a meeting with her sister. But Emil interrupts Bruno, as he pulls out an unloaded gun and points it at Bruno. Emil pulls the trigger just to frighten him, but his attempt at intimidating Bruno backfires, as Bruno stabs him to death in apparent self-defense.  Overcoming the shock and distress of the death, Bruno and Ewa dump Emil's body in the street at night to get rid of unwanted police investigations, but the police are told by another prostitute with whom Ewa had had conflicts that Ewa killed Emil. Bruno hides Ewa from the police, who then give him a severe beating and steal a large bundle of money he had been carrying. Ewa learns Bruno had had enough money to pay for her sister's release all along but was hiding it from her as he did not want her to leave him. Bruno claims he has now had a change of heart and would help Ewa and her sister if he had any money. Ewa makes another contact with her aunt and successfully pleads for her aunt to give her the money for Magda. With it, Bruno pays his contact on Ellis Island to release Ewa's sister and gives them both tickets to [[New Jersey]]. Ewa and Magda leave, while a repentant Bruno stays in New York, intending to confess to the police about Emil's killing.

After the family car is sold for scrap, the family acknowledges they can no longer afford to keep Terry employed as Jia Le's father has been recently fired from his job due to an accident tripping over eggs while attempting to find a suspected intruder.

Sam forces Carol to move out of his house so that he can live with his girlfriend Jamie, who is a year younger than Carol. Carol leaves to stay with her older sister Dani and her husband Moe.  An upcoming film series, ''The Amazon Games'', plans to bring back the "In a world..." line made famous by the late [[Don LaFontaine]]. The trailer voice-over is highly sought after.

Intrigued by the voice of a flirtatious Irish guest, she asks Dani to interview and record him for her voice archive. During the interview, Dani pretends to be single.  Carol joins Sam and Jamie at a party at Gustav's mansion. Gustav flirts with her, and Carol ends up staying the night. While waiting for Dani to come home from work, Moe listens to the recording of her interview with the hotel guest and is shocked at her lie. He leaves the apartment after she arrives.  Rumors spread quickly about Carol and Gustav. Gustav boasts to Sam of his night with some party-crasher, and when Gustav learns she is the woman in competition for the job, he decides to keep pursuing her, still not fully realizing who she is.

Jamie berates him and threatens to leave him if he does not grow up and show support for his daughters. During his acceptance speech, Sam is magnanimous in victory, dedicating the award to his daughters. In the ladies room, Carol encounters the executive producer, Katherine Huling, who bluntly tells Carol that she was not the best person for the job, but was chosen for the greater meaning of having a woman in that role.  In the final scene, Carol goes back to her work as a voice coach, helping low self-esteem, high-pitched, squeaky-voiced women to speak less like a "baby doll" or "[[sexy baby voice|sexy baby]]" and be taken more seriously as mature women, using her voice-over on ''The Amazon Games'' trailer as their inspiration.

 In 1982, young Albert is harassed by bullies. His mother gives him a special [[magic trick]] set by veteran magician Rance Holloway as his birthday present. He studies the instructional video and begins to practice some tricks, attracting the attention of a classmate, Anthony. They practice together and eventually become professional magicians Burt Wonderstone and Anton Marvelton, earning them success and an ongoing headlining act at the [[Bally's Las Vegas|Bally's Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]]. However, after ten years of performing the same tricks over and over again, Anton is fed up with Burt's ego, which has already cost them previous female assistants, all called "Nicole" in the act. In a rush, Burt enlists production assistant Jane as the new Nicole.  Burt and Anton encounter up-and-coming street magician Steve Gray performing a unique yet horrifying card trick for his TV magic show, ''Brain Rapist''. Audience numbers soon dwindle at Burt and Anton's show, upsetting Bally's owner Doug Munny. Taking a cue from Gray's endurance-based stunts, Anton suggests that he and Burt try a similar tack—locking themselves in a Plexiglas cage called the Hot Box hung above ground. Overconfident, Burt does not prepare for the stunt and almost instantly falls into a panic, causing the stunt to fail and injuring Anton. Anton angrily ends his partnership with Burt, and Jane also quits.  Burt refuses to change his act, staging his two-man show alone to disastrous results. Munny shuts down the production and Burt, having squandered his earnings over the years, is left broke. Despondent, Burt tries to find work and is eventually hired as an entertainer at an [[Assisted-Living Facility|assisted-living facility]] catering to former Vegas entertainers. There he meets Holloway, who retired several years before because he found that he was no longer happy performing. Holloway counsels Burt about magic, inspiring him to remember the initial wonder that led him to become a magician. Burt is shocked to see Jane—herself an aspiring magician—working for Gray. Appalled by Gray's style, Holloway and Burt polish their own tricks. Jane visits her grandmother at the facility and patches things up with Burt.  Doug is opening a new casino-hotel and is offering a five-year [[contract]] to the winner of a talent search on the casino's opening night. He invites Burt to do a magic show at his son's birthday party, but Gray also appears and tries to upstage Burt with his own tricks. Disgusted by Gray's actions, Jane leaves his show. Burt reconnects with Anton, who has been distributing magic sets in [[Cambodia]]. [[Mitragyna speciosa|A drug found in Cambodia called kratom]] that puts users into a deep sleep gives them an idea for a sensational trick.  At the talent search show, Gray's performance involves him drilling into his brain, claiming it will not affect him. This however, backfires, leaving Gray with [[brain damage]]. Holloway then introduces Burt, Anton, and Jane's performance, the "Disappearing Audience". The group secretly sedates the audience with kratom sleeping gas and then transports them to an outside location in the same seating arrangement. The audience awakes and responds with awe, and Doug awards the headlining act to Burt and Anton; they ask Jane to be their opening act. The trio then performs the Disappearing Audience trick again, returning everyone to the casino theater, as now mentally-impaired Gray watches on with the drill bit still in his skull.  As the film ends, the final scene shows how Burt, Anton, Holloway and others transported the audience to the open area, by unceremoniously dragging and transporting the unconscious audience members to the area, and hauling them back to the theater in a moving van.

Inequality for All
 In the wake of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2007–08 financial crisis]] and the rise of the [[Occupy movement]], the issue of [[income inequality]] has gained public awareness. Over the last thirty years according to this documentary, most of the economic gains went to a very few: the top 1% of earners now take in more than 20% of all income—three times what they did in 1970. Inequality is even more extreme at the very top. The [[400 richest Americans]] now own more wealth than the bottom 150 million combined. While this level of inequality poses a serious risk to all Americans, regardless of income level, much of the rhetoric on this subject has been fueled by anger and resentment from a frustrated middle class who feel their birthright—the American Dream—has been taken away from them.  [[Robert Reich]], author, professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], official in three administrations, including [[United States Secretary of Labor]] under [[Bill Clinton]], narrates the film. Reich is a thinker on the topic of inequality, having spoken on the subject for nearly three decades.  Structurally, the film is organized around a central "spine", in which Reich speaks directly to the audience about key economic topics. As Reich elaborates on each sub-topic, the film cuts to newly shot footage of real people and real lives, as well as archival footage and experts that address the points of his lecture. Throughout the film are graphics that expound upon statistical data.

Later, Jean asks Llewyn to pay for an abortion, though she is upset she just might be losing Jim's child.  Llewyn visits his sister in the hope of borrowing money but realizes it will not be possible.  Their conversation makes it clear that they are living in different worlds. She gives him a box of his belongings, but he tells her to trash it.  She mentions that he could make money by going back to the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]].  On Jim's invitation, Llewyn records a space travel-themed [[novelty song]] with Jim and Al Cody. Needing money for the abortion, Llewyn agrees to an immediate $200 rather than royalties. Llewyn is setting up Jean's appointment when the gynecologist informs him there is no charge, as a previous girlfriend did not go through with the abortion Llewyn had paid for, keeping the baby and moving to Ohio.  While talking to Jean at a café, Llewyn spots what he believes to be the Gorfeins' cat and returns it that evening. Asked to play after dinner, he reluctantly performs "[[Dink's Song|Fare Thee Well]]", a song he had recorded with Mike.

In Chicago, Llewyn auditions for Bud Grossman, who says Llewyn is not suited to be a solo performer but suggests he might incorporate him in a new trio he is forming. Llewyn rejects the offer and hitchhikes back to New York. Driving, he hits what he fears may be the same cat.  Back in New York, feeling tired and out of options to make something of himself, Llewyn uses his last $148 for back dues to rejoin the Merchant Marine union, and visits his ailing father. Llewyn searches for his seaman's license so he can ship out with the Merchant Marine, but it was in the box his sister finally trashed. Llewyn goes back to the Union Hall to replace it, but he cannot afford the $85 fee. Llewyn visits Jean and she tells him she got him a gig at the Gaslight.  At the Gaslight, Llewyn learns that Pappi, the manager, also had sex with Jean. Llewyn, angered by this, heckles a woman as she performs, and is thrown out. He then goes to the Gorfeins' apartment, where they graciously welcome him. There, he learns that the novelty song is likely to be a major hit, with massive royalties. He is amazed to see that their actual cat, Ulysses, has found his way home.  Returning to an expanded version of the film's opening scene, Llewyn performs at the Gaslight.

Instructions Not Included
 Valentín Bravo had always been a rather fearful child, afraid of everything from heights to spiders. His father, Juan "Johnny" Bravo, raised him trying to make him fearless by making a tarantula walk on Valentin and throwing him off a high oceanside cliff known as [[La Quebrada (Acapulco)|La Quebrada]]. When his father locked Valentín in a crypt at a cemetery, Valentín began to resent his father and ran away after stating that he no longer loves him.  Valentín grows up to be Acapulco's local playboy and sleeps with every tourist that crosses his path. One day a former fling named Julie shows up at his doorstep with a baby girl, claiming that she is his daughter. Julie leaves the baby with Valentín after asking him for cab fare, but she doesn't come back. After receiving a phone call from Julie in which she says she is not prepared to raise a child, Valentín races to the airport to try to return the baby to Julie but fails to catch up to her before she boards her flight to Los Angeles.  Valentín leaves Acapulco with the baby, Maggie, and hitchhikes across Mexico toward Tijuana. After being turned back at the US border, he crosses by being smuggled in a hidden compartment in a transport truck along with numerous other Mexicans. Going only by a single photo of Julie in which a Los Angeles hotel is visible in the background, Valentín visits the hotel to track down Julie. However, when Maggie wanders to a nearby pool, Valentín ends up jumping out of a hotel presidential suite into the pool 10 stories below, rescuing his daughter. A movie director witnesses this event and hires Valentín as a stuntman — a job which Valentín accepts since he believes it is the only way he can support Maggie.  An unlikely father figure, Valentín raises Maggie for six years, giving her a happy, fun, and carefree home. Meanwhile, he also establishes himself as one of Hollywood's top stuntmen to pay the bills, with Maggie acting as his on-set coach and translator as Valentín still doesn't know any English. As Valentín raises Maggie, she forces him to grow up too in his large fears, though he does it only for her own fun. Meanwhile, during a visit to the doctor in which he receives an injection, the doctor confides in Valentín — with Maggie out of earshot — that the treatments aren't working. To hide from Maggie the fact that her mother abandoned her, Valentín writes weekly letters to Maggie from her, detailing various adventures and feats around the world to explain her absence. But Maggie wishes to meet her mother, so Valentín goes to his director, and looks for an actress to play "Julie". Before the casting is complete, Valentín gets a call from Julie saying that she is in Los Angeles and wants to meet.  Julie, now in a relationship with a woman, tries to be a part of Maggie's life again, along with her girlfriend Renee who she lives with in New York, but after a tearful departure at the airport Julie realizes she doesn't want to just see Maggie during visits and holidays. She files for custody and cites Valentín's dangerous job and lack of English skills as reasons that he is unfit to raise Maggie. Valentín's sincerity and the story of his daring ten-story jump convince the judge that he has Maggie's best interest at heart, and he awards custody to Valentin as he is the only parent she has really known. Not backing down, Julie asks for a DNA test which proves Valentín isn't the father after all. Valentín ends up losing legal custody of Maggie, but they sneak away and decide to go back to Acapulco where he reunites with his friends, although he discovers that his father died a few years ago.  Julie and Renee threaten Valentín's director to bully him into revealing Valentín's location, who repeatedly claims he doesn't know where the father and daughter are. Eventually he relents and states that Valentín has woken up every day not knowing if it would be the last day he would see his daughter, but the details are not revealed on-screen. Julie finds Valentín and Maggie on the beach and has surprisingly dropped her attempts to gain custody. Instead, the three enjoy time together as a family in Acapulco while in a voice-over Valentín narrates how doctors can sometimes discover a heart defect for which there is no cure and which could kill the patient any time. As Valentín and Julie sit on the beach with Maggie falling asleep in Valentín's lap, Maggie peacefully passes away, which reveals that she, not Valentín, was the one with the heart defect.  One year later, Valentín is seen walking down the beach, with a dog but without Julie, narrating that he now understands his father's motives in wanting to prepare him for the future and give him the courage to face his fears. The film concludes with a vision of Maggie playing in heaven with her grandfather.

Stuart, Yo-Yo, and Neha see Billy and Nick as useless during a task focused on debugging and send them on a [[Snipe hunt|wild-goose chase]] for [[Charles Xavier]] at [[Stanford University]] (only to be brutally beaten when they find someone matching the description). But later, during a game of [[Quidditch (sport)|Quidditch]] against Graham's team, Billy rallies his team to a comeback that unifies them as a team, despite ultimately losing after Graham cheats.  When the teams are tasked with developing an app, Billy and Nick convince the team to indulge in a wild night out. At a strip club, Neha admits to Billy that, despite her rich fantasy life, she has no real world experience and is nervous. With his support, she decides to stay. Nick gets Yo-Yo to break out of his shell by drinking and receiving [[lap dance]]s. Encouraged by Billy, Lyle approaches one of the dancers, Marielena, who is also a dance instructor at Google on whom he had developed a crush. She is charmed by him, but another customer challenges Lyle for her attention and they fight, getting the team kicked out. Before sunrise, Stuart learns to appreciate his surroundings while overlooking the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], and Lyle's drunken antics inspire the team to create an app that guards against reckless phone usage while drunk. They win the task by earning the most downloads.  Meanwhile, Nick has been flirting with an executive, Dana, with little success. When he begins attending technical presentations to impress her, he develops an interest in the material. While the teams prepare to staff the technical support hotline, only Billy feels at a loss. A Google employee, "Headphones," who always wears headphones and never socializes, approaches Billy and tells him that the way he interacts with people is special. He tutors Billy on the technical information. Dana agrees to go on a date with Nick, and she invites him in at the end of the evening. During the task, Billy is comfortable with the material, but his team receives no score because he failed to properly log his calls for review. Dejected, Billy leaves Google to pursue a new sales opportunity with his former boss. The final task is announced as a sales challenge. Teams must sign the largest possible company to begin advertising with Google. The team is stunned when Nick tells them that Billy has left, and they declare that they do not want to do the task without him. Nick convinces Billy to return, and Billy leads the team to show a local pizzeria owner how Google can help him interact with potential customers and thereby expand his business, while remaining true to his professional values.  Chetty is about to announce that Graham's team have won, when Billy, Nick, and their team arrive to give a dynamic presentation about their new client. Chetty recognizes that although the pizzeria is not a large business, its potential is limitless because it is expanding via technology. Graham protests and is [[Dressing down|dressed down]] by Headphones, who turns out to be the head of [[Google Search]]. Nick and Billy's team win the challenge and the guaranteed jobs. Graham berates his team, who finally reject him. As the students depart, Nick and Dana are still seeing each other, as are Lyle and Marielena. Stuart and Neha have formed a romantic connection as well with Stuart promising to see her in person rather than texting her, and Yo-Yo asserts himself to his mother. Billy and Nick toast their success.

Iron Man 3
  At a [[New Year's Eve]] party in 1999, [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] meets scientist [[Maya Hansen]], the inventor of experimental regenerative treatment [[Extremis]] that allows recovery from crippling injuries. Disabled scientist [[Aldrich Killian]] offers them a place in his company [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]], but Stark rejects him. In 2013, Stark is having panic attacks due to his experiences during the alien invasion and subsequent Battle of New York. Restless, he has built dozens of [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|Iron Man suits]], creating friction with his girlfriend [[Pepper Potts]].  A string of bombings by a terrorist known as the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]] has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. Stark's security chief [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] is badly injured in a Mandarin attack, causing Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, who responds by destroying Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack with Potts. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit, which his [[artificial intelligence]] [[Edwin Jarvis|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.  Teaming with Harley, a precocious 10-year-old boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment. These explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents [[Ellen Brandt|Brandt]] and [[Coldblood|Savin]] attack him. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts and Hansen. American intelligence agencies continue to search for the Mandarin's location, with [[War Machine|James Rhodes]]—the former War Machine, now re-branded as the [[Iron Patriot]]—lured into a trap to steal his Iron Man-like armor.  With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to [[Miami]] and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named [[Trevor Slattery]], who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals that he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope that Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her. Killian kills Hansen when she tries to stop him.  Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard [[Air Force One]]. Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts, as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the president and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. However, before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian.  Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit as a sign of his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark promises to leave his life as Iron Man behind, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.

IRL (film)
 Elias (''Valter Skarsgård'') is a high school junior struggling with constant bullying and torment from his fellow students, especially his neighbour, Agnes (''Alba August''). Increasingly distant from his divorced father, Stefan, younger brother, Jonas, and his best friend, Adam, he finds solace in the online game ''[[The Secret World]]'', where he befriends the avatar ''Sc4rlet''.  After yet another incident at his school where he is stripped down and videotaped, and ridiculingly edited footage uploaded to ''[[YouTube]]'', Elias becomes increasingly angry and depressed, contemplating [[suicide]]. Later that night, Sc4rlet sends him her photo and an invitation to meet at the central station of their hometown, [[Stockholm]], but after his phone is stolen by Agnes and destroyed, their meeting is ruined as Elias cannot find her. Spotting her on the train home, he is afraid of talking to her, and steps of train with the intention of jumping on the tracks. He is narrowly saved by Sc4rlet, who suspected the boy of being him, and they soon become friends.  As things progress, Sc4rlet begins pressuring Elias to stand up for himself, helping him plan his revenge on his tormentors. They decide to go after Agnes, the leader of the gang, hoping that it will cause the others to stop. They soon make a plan to strip her naked and post photos of her on the internet, mirroring what she did to Elias earlier, and later steal drugs from the local hospital for him to use. The following day, Elias attacks her during an outdoors gymnastics class, but she managed to fight him off, and he left alone in the forest after she injects him with the drugs intended for her. Hallucinating from the injection, Elias begins seeing Sc4rlet, who leads him to the roof of the building next door to his apartment, where she tells him that they will "die together, like he wants to". Meanwhile, Elias' father, Stefan, finds the stolen drugs in his sons bedroom, alongside an unedited video of the earlier incident at school, given to him by Adam. Stefan then spots Elias alone on the next door roof, and comes to his rescue just in time.  Elias wakes up in the hospital, where Stefan angrily berates him for not telling him about the bullying and the drugs. Stefan asks Elias what he can do to help, and Elias asks him that there's only one thing he wants to do. After being discharged from the hospital, Elias records a suicide letter on video and says goodbye to his friends and family. That night, ''Sc4rlet'' appears in his room, and we realize that she never stepped off the train in the beginning, and that Elias has been envisioning her to help him. She spends the night, comforting him. The next day, he boards the ferry to [[Åland]], where Sc4rlet appears once again, asking if he is sure about what he is doing. He sets up his camera to record, and jumps off the ferry in the middle of the sea.  Three days later, Stefan is watching a news report about his sons disappearance and suspected suicide. The next day a memorial is held at his school, where the students mourn Elias. As the principal takes the stage to give a speech, Adam cuts into the projector feed, playing Elias' suicide note to the entire school, who watch in shock as he exposes Agnes and her friends, before cutting to the unedited video of incident, revealing Agnes and her friends as they truly are. As the students struggle to grasp with what they have seen, Elias appears on the gallery behind them, alive and well. A quick flashback reveals that Elias had jumped to a deck below, where his father caught him. They then faked the disappearance and suicide, with the faked suicide video as "evidence", in order to bring attention to the bulluying.  Some time later, Stefan, Elias and Jonas, a family once again, is watching an interview with Stefan on television, where he is questioned about the ethics of Elias faking his death like he did. Stefan then responds that bullying is never taken seriously, "not until someone dies. We needed someone to die, so that the world could see the truth." A vision of Sc4rlet appears once again, smiling to Elias, who, for the first time, can smile again. He decides to find her; and using the number she texted him from earlier in the film, tracks her down, learning that her real name is ''Scarlet Friedmann''. The film then ends with Elias finally meeting Scarlet, who recognizes him from the train and tells him that she waited for him at the station and was sad when he never showed up, but is glad that he finally had the courage to meet her.

Returning to his apartment, Jake faxes to a friend stateside a photo of a tattoo from the corpse believed to be Sultana's.

He is working for [[Atari]] and develops a partnership with his friend [[Steve Wozniak]] ([[Josh Gad]]) after he sees that Wozniak has built a personal computer (the [[Apple I]]). They name their new company [[Apple Computer]], though there already is a company called [[Apple Records]] that is owned by [[The Beatles]] (Wozniak then teases Jobs that this is symbolic of his preference for [[Bob Dylan]]). Wozniak gives a demonstration of the Apple I at the [[Homebrew Computer Club]]. Jobs is later approached by [[Paul Terrell]] ([[Brad William Henke]]) who shows interest in the Apple I. Knowing that he and Wozniak will need a studio in which to build them, Jobs convinces his father Paul to allow them to use the family garage (set up as a carpentry/tool center) for his new company. Realizing that they cannot build these computers alone, Jobs also recruits Kottke, [[Bill Fernandez]] ([[Victor Rasuk]]), and [[Chris Espinosa]] (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team.<ref name=slashdot/>  Terrell, however, is disappointed by the Apple I, a reaction which inspires Jobs to start again with a second model. He hires [[Rod Holt]] ([[Ron Eldard]]) to reconceptualize the power supply for what would be called the [[Apple II]]. In addition, after many failed attempts, Jobs finally wins the interest of a venture capitalist, [[Mike Markkula]] ([[Dermot Mulroney]]), who also joins Apple. They release the Apple II at the 1977 [[West Coast Computer Faire]] where it is a remarkable success. Suddenly Jobs and the company are very successful.  The success also causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends and his high school girlfriend [[Chrisann Brennan]] ([[Ahna O'Reilly]]). When Brennan tells him she is pregnant with their child, he promptly ends their relationship. Brennan eventually gives birth to [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa Brennan]] whom Jobs continues to deny as his daughter. He also brings in [[John Sculley]] ([[Matthew Modine]]) to become the CEO of the company. As his behavior becomes more erratic (for example firing an employee for not appreciating his investment in using fonts), Jobs is moved away from [[Apple Lisa|The Lisa]] to the [[Macintosh#History|Macintosh Group]] where he works with Bill Atkinson, [[Burrell Smith]] (Lenny Jacobson), Chris Espinosa, and [[Andy Hertzfeld]] ([[Elden Henson]]). He also forces the original team leader of the Macintosh group, [[Jef Raskin]], out of it. Though the Macintosh is introduced with a great deal of fanfare in 1984, Jobs is forced out of the company by Sculley in 1985.  The film jumps forward to 1996. Jobs is married to [[Laurene Powell Jobs]] ([[Abby Brammell]]) and has accepted Lisa (Annika Bertea) as his daughter (she now lives with them). He has a son, Reed (Paul Baretto) and is also running the company [[NeXT]] which Apple decides to buy. He is asked by then-CEO [[Gil Amelio]] to return to Apple as a consultant. Jobs does so and soon he is named the new CEO, ultimately firing Amelio and his ex-friend Markkula (who refused to support him when he was forced out of Apple 11 years prior). Jobs becomes interested in the work of [[Jonathan Ive]] (Giles Matthey) and works to reinvent Apple. The film ends with Jobs recording the [[Think Different#Text|dialogue for the ''Think Different'']] commercial in 1997. Before the credits, there are original photos of all the main characters paired with clips from the film of the actor playing the part, plus a dedication to Steve Jobs.  
Joe (2013 film)
 Joe Ransom is a foreman for a small tree-poisoning crew in rural Texas. A 15-year-old drifter named Gary asks Joe for a job, and impresses him with his work ethic. The next day, Gary brings his [[alcoholic]] father Wade with him to work, but Wade's attitude and laziness gets them both fired. Joe witnesses Wade beat Gary and take his money. Gary later goes to Joe's house to ask for his job back. Joe agrees, and Gary begins working for him regularly, hiding his money from Wade.   Willie Russell, a criminal with whom Joe has a long-standing feud, shoots Joe as he leaves a friend's house. Later, Gary meets Willie and asks him for a ride home; when Willie makes lewd comments about Gary's younger sister, Dorothy, however, Gary beats him up. Later, Wade beats to death a homeless man, stealing his liquor.  Willie confronts Joe at a bar and asks him where Gary lives in an attempt to find him and seek revenge. Joe doesn't answer, and when Willie continues to press him, Joe beats him up. Joe tells the bartender to call the police before fleeing to a brothel. Joe leaves the brothel after getting spooked by an angry guard dog. Joe returns home, gets his dog and returns to the brothel, where he sets his dog on the guard dog, and has sex with a prostitute. He leaves with his dog, who has killed the guard dog. Two police officers stop him and hold him at gunpoint as he lets his dog out of his truck, and Joe challenges them to a fight. Joe is arrested, but released.  Wade asks Gary for money, but Gary claims that he doesn't have any. They get into an argument that ends with Wade pulling a knife on Gary. Wade leaves, but promises to return and find the rest of Gary's money.   Gary visits Joe, who tells him that he once served 29 months in prison for assaulting three police officers. Gary agrees to help Joe look for his dog. They find the dog, and Joe gives Gary his lighter as a keepsake. Joe finds Wade walking along on the side of the road and invites him into his truck. Joe mentions that Gary wants to buy his truck, but when Wade insults Gary, Joe grabs him by the collar and threatens to hurt him if anything happens to the boy.  Gary tells Joe that he has enough money to buy his truck, and they buy a new one. Joe tells Gary to keep the money he was going to use to buy Joe's truck, and use it to get insurance instead. As Joe drives home, a patrol cop stops him and tries to make him take a breathalyzer test, but Joe refuses and drives away. An altercation ensues in which Joe beats the officer. A higher-ranking officer, a friend of Joe's and a fellow ex-con, visits Joe and says the patrol cop had it coming, but warns him to keep his nose clean.  Gary arrives at Joe's house, his face bruised. Gary asks to borrow his truck, and Joe asks what happened. Gary reveals that Wade beat him up, stole his truck and left with Dorothy, intent on pimping her out to Willie. The two of them go after Wade. Meanwhile, Willie pays Wade $30, and prepares to rape Dorothy. Joe arrives and subdues Willie, and Gary leaves with Dorothy. Willie begs an unmoved Joe for his life, but as Joe prepares to kill him, one of Willie's thugs shoots him in the leg. Joe kills Willie and the thug, and limps towards Wade, who is standing on a nearby bridge. He tries to shoot him, but misses. He attempts to shoot Wade again, but finds he is out of bullets. Wade asks Joe if he's his friend, and when Joe doesn't answer, leaps off the bridge to his death. Gary arrives and embraces Joe as he dies.  Later, Gary is shown to have inherited Joe's truck and dog, and he is given a new job replanting the same forest that Joe and his crew killed.  
Jolly LLB
 Jagdish Tyagi a.k.a. Jolly ([[Arshad Warsi]]) is a [[Delhi]] based lawyer staying with his brother-in-law Pratap ([[Manoj Pahwa]]) and is in a relationship with Sandhya ([[Amrita Rao]]). He happens to see prominent criminal lawyer Tejinder Rajpal ([[Boman Irani]]) successfully defending Rahul Dewan (Rajeev Siddhartha), a boy from a high society family in a [[sessions court]], who is accused of drunken driving in a [[Toyota Land Cruiser Prado]] causing death of six people sleeping on the footpath.   Jolly, desperate to have some money and fame, decides to pursue the case and files a PIL in the court against Rahul Dewan. After initially reprimanding Jolly for his mistakes in filing the PIL and taking the press reports as an [[Admissible evidence|evidence]], Justice Sunderlal Tripathi ([[Saurabh Shukla]]) warns Jolly to collect some evidence before the next hearing. Jolly then runs into Albert Pinto ([[Harsh Chhaya]]), who claims to have witnessed the accident but soon learns that he is a lackey of Rajpal and was a plan to extract more money from the Dewan family. As part of the deal, Pinto gives Jolly a share of the money and turns hostile in the court. Sandhya and Kaul saab [[Ramesh Deo|(Ramesh Deo]]) chides him for compromising on justice for his greed. He returns the money to Rajpal and challenges him to win the case.  With the help of his brother-in-law, he collects the video footage of the car involved in the accident and presents it to the court. Rajpal counters that the car was driven by the driver of Dewan family and the footage was fake. Jolly refutes it by successfully cross examining the driver, who finally accepts that he has registered a false statement. The Judge orders the police to provide a bodyguard for Jolly after he is manhandled by assistants of Rajpal. Although Sub-Inspector Rathi tries to sabotage Jolly, but with the help of the bodyguard, Jolly leaves for Gorakhpur after he comes to know that Sadakant Mishra (Susheel Pandey), a survivor of the accident stays there.   Jolly after passing through many hurdles successfully brings Mishra to the court. Rajpal tries to scuttle proceedings but the hesitant judge overrules him. Mishra states that Rathi had threatened him after the accident and fabricated the investigation. He was only allowed to go after he offered his hard-earned money and jewelry. Mishra also identifies Rahul Dewan as the one who drove the car. After the emotional closing arguments by Rajpal and Jolly, the judge directs the police department to suspend Rathi and initiate a criminal inquiry against him and also declares Rahul Dewan as guilty of the crime and sentences him to seven years in jail under [[List of sections of Indian Penal Code#Chapter XVI|Section 304]] of the [[Indian Penal Code]].  
John Day (film)
 John Day is a bank manager of Royal Citizen Co-operative Bank and lives with his wife Maria Day. The couple has recently lost their only  daughter Pearl in a forest fire accident while she was on a trip with her boyfriend Kanishk. Maria is always depressed and never opens up with anyone. One day when John is away for office work, a courier-boy enters the house and takes Maria as a captive. He then calls up John informing him about his wife is a hostage and tells him that a man will visit him at his bank and John has to do his work. It is shown that actually it was a planned bank heist where the visitor gagged John, opened up the cash locker and fled. Meanwhile, the kidnapper hammered Maria causing her a serious brain damage and she got admitted to the hospital in a state of coma.  The news spread like wildfire in all TV channels. An impatient and short tempered Police Officer Gautam (Randeep Hooda)is shocked and calls his girlfriend Tabassum (Elena Kazan) to collect a very important document stored in a locker of the bank. Inside the bank, the bank authorities in the presence of the police are giving away claims to bank customers, when Tabassum approaches and claims her documents which are revealed to be some property papers called "CASABLANCA ESTATES". This surprises John Day and he follows the duo in his car and observes them depositing the file in a government property office. John bribes the office personnel and procures the original Casablanca files and investigates.  During his investigation he comes to know that police Officer Gautam is also in pursuit of the files and wants to sell them to a Mafia-based organization in Dubai. Gautam is under pressure from the Mafia to handover the original documents of "Casablanca Estates". John vows to take revenge on the people who has injured his wife and actually eliminates all the informants including the kidnapper, the bank robbers and others involved. He then takes Tabassum as a captive and calls Gautam and another powerful Mafia Khan Saab(Sharat Saxena) at Gautam's place and there the truth is revealed.  Casablanca estate is nothing but 8000 acres of forest land being acquired illegally on papers by Mafia Lord Khan Saab and Dubai based Al Hunain along with the help of Police Officer Gautam who works for Khan. They had acquired the land, registered it with the insurance company and then set fire to the jungle in order to get heavy compensation. It was revealed that on that fateful day when the fire erupted John Day's daughter Pearl was there for a jungle trip and perished in the same while her boy-friend escaped unhurt.  Meanwhile, Gautam has a plan to sell the papers for billions to the Dubai-based AG group and settling with his girlfriend abroad. When Khan is about to shoot Gautam for his treachery Tabassum opens fire to save him. An ensuing shoot out occurs in the room and results in Tabassum being killed, Khan and his associates badly wounded and finally, Gautam getting shot multiple times by John. John then shoots Khan Saab too. Later he is shown weeping at the graves of his daughter and wife. The film ends with a Biblical quote by Mark "For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Mark 8:36".  
Jîn
  The movie opens with nature shots of clouds over the mountains in Turkey accompanied by heavy organ music. It seems to be fall time. The few minutes of the movie are shots of animals accompanied by the same music. A praying mantis is the first animal that appears, followed by a turtle, a grasshopper, the sounds of birds chirping, a male deer and a gecko. The sound of the chirping birds is the first "nature" sound heard in the film as opposed to the music which opens the film.  A woman appears behind the leaves of trees of the mountain forest. It is not easy to identify any of her characteristics other than the fact that she is wearing a red scarf on her head. The peace is suddenly disrupted by explosions and gunfire. The gecko and the snake go into hiding. Shots of people (later revealed to be the Kurdish guerrilla's living in the mountains) running away from the explosions and gunfire follow. The convoy vehicles from which the gunfire was coming from drive away. The Kurdish guerilla's are now more clearly in view and are seen wearing the same items of clothing (nude colored jumpers and boots). Night falls and the guerilla's are in a cave. This is the first point in the movie where human speech is first heard in the form of a Kurdish song:  ''My lovely mother''  ''tell me how are you''  ''regards to my father''  ''and to my brothers.''  ''Your father and I have grown old''  ''life is bitter to us''  ''enough sweetheart come back.''  After singing this song, the main character (Jîn) is seen running away from the armed organization she was previously fighting and living in the caves with. She runs away in the cover of the dark. The reason for her fleeing is unknown. At approximately the 13 minute mark of the movie, Jîn's face is clearly revealed for the first time. She runs into the deer, decides not to shoot it, and the two make eye contact. Jîn is now wandering alone in the forest, searching for food. She hears a bird screeching (presumably a hawk), climbs into the tree its sounds are coming from, and goes to steal the bird's eggs from the nest. There are three eggs and although initially she plans on taking all three, she returns two and eats only one upon hearing the crying of the bird. It is as if they have a mutual understanding of each other's needs and they come to a compromise (Jîn needs to eat, the egg's belong to the bird). After eating her "meal" she is ready to climb back down to the forest floor and continue her journey on foot. However, she quickly climbs back upon seeing the Turkish soldiers coming into her area and setting up camp. One of the soldiers sings.  ''Were you the one who always cried and burned''  ''I couldn't laught either in this world of lies''  ''did you think I was happy''  ''in a world that stole my life over nothing.''  ''Oh in this world of lies, world of lies''  ''in this world that fakes a smile to your face''  ''you cried dear and I burned''  ''I though the world would be how I wished it''  ''I believed for no reason I was tricked over nothing''  ''In this world that takes its color from the sky.''  This is the second time in the movie there is human speech. Up to this point however, it has only been in the form of song. The soldiers are alerted by something and  leave in a hurry.  Jîn, now safe, continues her journey. The first person she interacts with after being alone since fleeing the guerrillas is a shepard boy. He gives her bread and calls her sister. She asks where the nearest village is and he points her in its direction. This is the first appearance of human speech in the movie.  As she is walking away from him, someone fires shots at her (probably a Turkish soldier). The gecko appears again.  She sees a house in the distance and waits for its owners to leave. Upon seeing them leave in a green truck, she goes inside and starts taking items like clothes, food, books, and money. She is in a girls room indicated by the girls clothes and the framed picture on the desk. Jîn does not seems scared that she will be caught. Suddenly, inside the house, she hears an elderly woman calling for her granddaughter Leyla. Jîn talks to the granddmother and helps her take her medication. The granddmother believes that Jîn is her granddaughter Leyla. Jîn takes this opportunity to call her mother, telling her not to cry or worry. The granddmother calls from Leyla (Jîn) again for help to take her medication. In this moment, Jîn realizes that the granddmother does not remember just having taken her medication. Considering the home owners were just in the house, they probably gave the granddmother her medication. Jîn realizes that she accidentally gave the granddmother a double dose of medication. "Grandma, what have you done?" Jîn says before leaving.  With her new acquired items, Jîn changes her boots to the shoes she took from Leyla's house. Bombs start falling and Jîn runs for cover in a cave. She is not alone. There is a black bear in the cave with her, taking cover from the bombs too. The bombing ends and Jîn tells the bear " Its finished, don't fear". She gives the bear an apple and says "Bye, bye compadre". Jîn now sits alone, trying to read a geography book she took from the house. It is obvious she has some trouble reading. "Which part of the world do you live in? What part of Turkey do you live in?" the book reads. This is the first time in the movie that the audience learns where the movie is taking place (Turkey). This point of innocence and a failed attempt at reading indicate to the audience that although Jîn is very independent and tough, she is really just a young girl.  She changes over to commoner clothes but still keeps her red scarf on her head. She goes to a river to fill her canteen and the shepard boy who she had met earlier sees her and approaches her. Due to her new outfit, he doesn't recognize who she is and starts asking her "what a beautiful girl like her is doing all alone". It seems like he is about to take advantage of the situation but Jîn embarrass and intimidates him, yelling at him telling him who she is and how they had met earlier. She leaves him and continues her journey.  She runs into the bear again telling it "Sorry compadre, no more apples". The next scene shows her sitting alone in the dark, eating bread by a small fire. She is still in the mountainous forest and can hear the hawks over head. She tries to sleep but cannot. She continues her journey and comes upon a road. She sees a car coming and she hides in a ditch. A purple flower is shown. The next car that passes, she stands up to be seen. It seems that she wants to hitchhike but the car does not stop for her. She sleeps in the ditch, waiting for the next car. It is very windy. The snake appears again. A truck finally stops for her. It is green. The driver is an older man and they refer to each other as sister and brother. The driver asks her the reason for her travels, presumably she lies, saying that she is going to see her sick grandmother. The driver inquires more about her: says that she is from Varaptil, reveals her age, she does not have a dad and that her name is Leyla. The truck driver laughs at the irony that his daughter is also named Leyla. (The audience may presume at this point that the truck driver is from the same house, Jîn was in earlier with the sick grandmother). The driver drops her off at her destination and gives her a chocolate. Jîn tells the driver to say hi to Leyla for her. It is windy and the snake is shown again.  Jîn gets on a bus with other people. In their journey, the soldiers stop them asking passengers where they are going. Jîn seems afraid and mimics the response of the other passengers: she is going to go work. A woman on the bus asks Jîn if she ran away from home. Jîn says she is going to visit her sick grandmother. The two exchange a mutual smile as if they both understand the true reason. Ironically, Jîn does end up going to work to make money for a bus ticket. She is with the same woman from the bus. It is at this point in the film (approximately the half way mark) when Jîn first reveals her name. The woman's name is [[Zivar]] (which means ornament or jewelry). Jîn shares her chocolate with Zivar. The truck Jîn, Zivar, and the other workers are on finally arrives at the work field. The boss there tells the group that women hoe for 25 liras a day and men break rocks for 35 liras a day. When the man asks Jîn for her papers, she says she forgot them at home. Zivar backs her up by lying that Jîn is the neighbor's daughter. The man seems to believe the lie. In order for Jîn to make money for her bus ticket quickly, she asks to break rocks instead. She lies to the man telling him that she wants to buy medication for her sick grandmother. She presents herself to him as 17 year old Leyla. The man allows her to break rocks and tells her to come by his quarters later to pick up her payment. She works hard for the next days breaking rocks. The task is difficult for her but she does not give up. When she has worked as many days she needs to, to collect money for her bus ticket she goes to visit the man. He invites her to his home and serves her tea. Jîn, clearly uncomfortable and predicting what will happen (he will try to rape her) tries to not stay for too long, telling him she is only there for her payment. As soon as he gives her the money, he tries to rape her inside his home. She runs away and he chases behind her and catches up to her. He beats her briefly unconscious and starts dragging her back to his house. He rests for a second at which moment, Jîn wakes up, takes a rock and knocks him unconscious in the head. She runs away and goes to the bus station purchasing her ticket.  On the bus she sits next to a young girl who asks Jîn what happen to her face. Jîn's face has some cuts and bruises. Jîn responds by saying that a dog attacked her but she fought back, it got scared and ran away. Soldiers stop the bus, asking for IDs. Jîn is taken off the bus since she doesn't have one along with an old insisting that he just left it at home and can go get it if need be. The two get taken to a Turkish compound where they are questioned. She speaks only in Kurdish while the soldiers speak only Turkish. A Kurdish interpreter comes to speak for he. She says she is from Gevez. She is put in a holding cell along with the old man. A helicopter flies in carrying a wounded Kurdish guerrilla. He is put in the holding cell with her. It seems as if she recognizes him. He asks her to kill him, likely because he will be interrogated by the Turkish soldiers. Upon his request, Jîn kills him. While she is in the holding cell, bombs are falling outside. The Kurdish interpreter comes in and tries to violate her. However, because of the bombings, both she and the old man are released. She runs away but the Kurdish interpreter follows behind her. Eventually, she loses him.  She tries again to hitchhike but the cars don't stop for her. The turtle crosses the road. A car stops and two men get out. It seems that one of them is the Kurdish interpreter. Jîn runs away from them back into the mountains. In the mountains, she find a mule with an injured leg. The mule is carrying food. She takes the mule to the river, cleans and ties its wounds. She takes the food its carrying, takes the mules reins off and sets it free. As she is walking away from the mule, bombs start falling. She runs for cover and later discovered the mule has been killed by one of the bombs.  She returns to the cave where she initially started. She finds her geography book there. She sees a mountain tiger. Bombs start falling again, the purple flower is shown again. There is repeat imagery of the same scenario happening (bombs dropping) with Jîn in different locations. The different animals are also shown (bear, deer, snake etc.). The animals are shown as going into hiding when the bombs are being dropped. Also interesting to note is that despite all her travels, Jîn's white shoes are clean.  Jîn finds a wounded Turkish soldier and she takes care of him. They have a brief conversation. He tells Jîn he only has 7 months of active duty left, perhaps implying that what he is doing is out of requirement and not purely driven by desire. He tells her he comes from Çanakkale and his family (mother and siblings but no father). Upon saying that he never saw his father, Jîn get angry saying that they (likely Turkish soldiers) took her father away from her and she never saw him again. When the soldiers says "may he rest in peace", Jîn responds by saying "what peace? He has no peace". The next morning he leaves. He calls his mother to tell her that he is okay, Jîn also calls hers, telling her mother that she decided not to go (to Izmir).As a token of gratitude, the soldiers offers his cellphone to Jîn but she refuses it. He asks Jîn for her name and despite official hesitation, she eventually tells him. He is the second person in the film to know her true name.  As she continues on her journey, she starts getting shot at again. She climbs into a tree for safety but she is shot and falls from it. She is shown lying on a huge rock, blood stains her once clean white shoes. All the animals shown throughout the movie surround her (bear, mule, mountain lion, deer etc.). She seems alive but it is uncertain. The movie ends with a black screen.  
Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons
 The story takes place before [[Tang Sanzang]] got his disciples and embarked on the [[Journey to the West]].  A riverside village is terrorized by a mysterious aquatic creature. A Taoist priest kills a giant [[manta ray]] and insists that it is the demon. Sanzang, a self-proclaimed demon hunter, appears to warn the villagers that the animal is not the true demon. The villagers ignore him and, at the priest's provocation, string him up. The demon reemerges and kills many of the villagers. Sanzang frees himself and, along with the survivors, manages to beach the creature, which turns into a man. Sanzang then opens a book of nursery rhymes and begins singing to the demon. Annoyed, the demon attacks Sanzang. Another demon hunter, Duan, captures and turns the demon into a puppet. Sanzang tells to Duan that his master taught him a more humane approach and to use nursery rhymes to coax goodness out of demons, a tactic Duan scoffs at. Disillusioned, Sanzang meets his master and bemoans his lack of capabilities compared to more aggressive demon-hunters. His master reaffirms his humanist philosophy and sends Sanzang off again to find "enlightenment."  A couple enters an empty restaurant but the chef reveals himself to be a [[Zhu Bajie|pig demon]] and kills them. Sanzang comes to the same restaurant, this time apparently filled with people. Sanzang sees through the illusion and recognizes them as [[zombie|reanimated corpses]] of the victims, as well as the demon's nine-toothed rake. Duan bursts into the restaurant and destroys all the corpses, and attacks the pig demon. She captures the demon in her magic bag to turn it into a puppet, but it bursts out of the bag and transforms into a huge boar, collapsing the building. Sanzang and Duan retreat. Duan then develops a strong [[limerence]] towards Sanzang after being impressed by his selfless ideals. She expresses her feelings, but Sanzang flees, not wishing to deal with [[romantic love]] in his quest for [[nirvana]].  Sanzang's master advises him to tame the Monkey King demon [[Sun Wukong]] (trapped by Buddha) to subdue the pig demon. That night, he is captured by a gang that had also subdued Duan. It is later revealed to be a ploy orchestrated by Duan to trick Sanzang into having sex with her. After Sanzang rejects her again, she has him imprisoned. The pig demon reappears and injures Duan but is chased off by a trio of rivaling demon-hunters. Duan views Sanzang's concern for her injuries as a romantic attraction. After Sanzang refuses her advances again, she destroys his book of nursery rhymes and he leaves.  After days of traveling, Sanzang finally discovers a cave under a lotus garden, where Monkey King was trapped in for 500 years. Monkey King tells Sanzang to use a dancer to bait the demon. Duan appears and volunteers to dance. When the pig demon appears Monkey King easily subdues it, allowing Duan to turn it into a puppet. Duan then gives both the fish and pig puppets to Sanzang and offers her golden ringed weapon as an engagement band, but he rejects her again. She leaves after returning his nursery rhyme book, which she had pieced back together, although at random as she is illiterate.  Monkey King tricks Sanzang into removing the seal on his prison and bursts out of the cave. Sanzang begins to pray to Buddha, and an enraged Monkey King rips the hair from his head. The three demon hunters appear to catch Monkey King but he effortlessly kills them. Duan returns and defends Sanzang, but the Monkey King mortally injures her. Sanzang admits he loves her, and Monkey King proceeds to vaporize her body. Looking at the nursery book again, Sanzang realizes Duan accidentally reassembled the words of his book into those of the Buddha [[Sutra]]. Sanzang summons Buddha, who defeats Monkey King with the palm of his hand. Sanzang then places Duan's golden ring on Monkey King, and it turns into his restrictive headband.  Sanzang tells his master that his suffering due to Duan's loss has helped him to enlightenment. Sanzang is then instructed to travel on a journey to the west ([[Tianzhu (India)|India]]) for the Buddhist sutras of Leiyin Temple, and it is shown that the Water Buffalo, Pig Demon, and Monkey King have been tamed and turned into humans named, respectively, [[Sha Wujing]], [[Zhu Bajie]] and [[Sun Wukong]]. As they hike across the desert, Sanzang looks across the sand and sees an image of Duan.  
Jug Face
 A backwoods community worships a pit with healing powers. Dawai creates jugs of faces from clay, and when a jug portrays the face of a member of the community, that person must be sacrificed to the creature that lives in the pit. Ada, who has been having sex with her brother Jessaby, finds her own face on Dawai's latest jug. Scared, she hides the jug and keeps it a secret.  Ada is arranged to be "joined" to a boy from another family, Bodey. Later, Ada discovers she is pregnant. While she is with Bodey's sister, Eileen, Ada has a vision of Eileen's death, and the creature later kills Eileen. Worried that they have angered the creature, the community questions Dawai, who claims to be ignorant of whether there's a missing jug, as he creates them while under a trance. The townspeople become frustrated with Dawai and demand that he search for any potentially missing jugs. Ada meets with Dawai, and she suggests that he create a new one from memory. Ada's mother, Loriss, inspects her to see if she is a virgin, and Ada claims to have broken her own hymen. Loriss punishes Ada, who later informs Jessaby that she is pregnant.  The following day, the community gathers around the pit as Dawai presents his latest jug with the face of Bodey, who is sacrificed. Ada visits her sickly grandfather and sees a vision of an emaciated boy, who explains that her grandfather hid his wife's jug face the same as she did, and the community poisoned her grandfather as punishment. Jessaby tells Sustin, his father, that he is sick, so they go to the pit to heal him. Ada has a vision of Jessaby getting killed; the vision comes true. As it seems Dawai has failed again in interpreting the pit's desires, he is severely punished by the community and tied beside the pit to be taken. Ada breaks Dawai free, and they run off. However, the two are caught, brought back, and punished. Assuming that it is Dawai with whom Ada had a relationship, Ada is whipped, miscarries her child, and then reveals to her parents that it was her brother's baby.  Ada has a vision of her father's death, and the creature kills him. She reveals to everyone that she was the missing jug face and that all the deaths are her fault. Her mother ties her up beside Dawai next to the pit. The Shunned Boy and Ada's grandfather appear and free her from her ropes, but she will not leave because she knows Dawai will be killed. The next morning, Ada's mother finds her free of her ropes but kneeling beside the Pit. Ada apologizes and is sacrificed. The film ends as Dawai lights a candle next to his jug face of Ada.

Joséphine chooses to continue the deception and decides to hide in her own apartment, which was temporarily loaned by Chloe to their colleague, Gilles. Despite previously finding him tedious and boring, Joséphine gradually falls for him.  The deceit is discovered by Gilles when Joséphine's bag is returned to her apartment. He calls her friends and when Joséphine returns, he confronts her about the lies.

[[Aquaman]] and his Atlantean forces have sunk most of Europe, while [[Wonder Woman]] has led the [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazons]] in conquering Great Britain, and both forces are now at war after an attempted alliance between them resulted in Wonder Woman murdering Aquaman's wife [[Mera (comics)|Mera]], due to Mera discovering that Aquaman and Wonder Woman had a secret affair together and Mera confronting Wonder Woman herself.  [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] has assembled a team to eliminate both parties and approaches [[Batman]] to join them, but his refusal leads the government to scrap the plan, and instead recruit pilot [[Hal Jordan]] to fly [[Abin Sur|an alien spacecraft]] to bomb the Atlanteans.  Barry visits Wayne Manor, but is attacked by Batmanwho he realizes is not Bruce Wayne but his father [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]]; suspicious of Barry's statements, Batman breaks a few of his fingers. Barry eventually convinces Batman that Barry is in an alternate reality, where Bruce was killed by [[Joe Chill]]; which caused Thomas to become Batman, and [[Martha Wayne]], driven mad by Bruce's death, to become the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and attack Thomas' business: the world's largest casino. Attempting to explain things to the elder Wayne, Barry retrieves his costume from his ring, but Professor Zoom's costume appears instead, causing Barry to believe Thawne is responsible for the timeline alteration.

The second attempt succeeds and Barry's powers are restored, but he discovers he cannot travel through time because Thawne is also using the [[Speed Force]]. Barry recruits more allies, beginning with an emaciated [[Superman]], who is a prisoner of the U.S. Government after his ship crashed into Metropolis. With the aid of Batman and Cyborg, they liberate Superman, who is empowered by Earth's yellow sun for the first time and fends off the facility's security then flies off in fear and confusion. Barry collapses as his memories continue to change.  Barry is taken to [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Billy Batson]]'s home to recuperate, and learns that Jordan's attack has failed and that the final battle between the Amazons and Atlanteans has begun. Barry convinces the superheroes to help stop the war and they depart for Britain aboard Batman's jet, only to be shot down upon arrival. Batson and his siblings combine into Captain Thunder to fight Wonder Woman, while Barry, Cyborg and Batman occupy Aquaman.

Wonder Woman faces Aquaman, with both declaring an intention to fix things their way. Aquaman remotely detonates Captain Atom with a ray. As the explosion tears across the landscape, Thawne declares his intention to keep Barry in this reality to kill him, but he is then killed by Batman. The dying Batman urges Barry to run, and gives him a letter addressed to his son. Barry races back in time and stops his earlier self but again fractures time, creating [[The New 52|another alternate timeline]].  Barry awakens at his desk and finds that reality is apparently back to normal.

Barry then runs off.   In a post-credits scene, a Boom Tube opens in space above Earth and a horde of [[Parademon]]s emerges.  
Justin and the Knights of Valour
  Justin ([[Freddie Highmore]]) lives in the kingdom of Gabylonia, where [[lawyer]]s control everything and [[knight]]s have been ousted. His dream has been to become one of the Knights of Valour, like his grandfather, Sir Roland. But his father Reginald ([[Alfred Molina]]), a widower and the chief counsel to the Queen ([[Olivia Williams]]), wants his son to follow in his footsteps and become a lawyer. After an argument with his father, Justin seeks comfort from his grandmother ([[Julie Walters]]), a friend of the Queen, who encourages him to follow his dreams. Justin notices that his grandfather's sword is missing and decides to find the sword as his knights quest. His grandmother gives him a key which originally belonged to his grandfather and tells him to go to an [[abbey]] where three wise [[monk]]s would train him. Before Justin leaves on his quest, he visits his crush Lara ([[Tamsin Egerton]]) who is a spoilt brat and the daughter of the kingdom's greatest businessman. He says farewell to her, though she is not really listening (Justin actually thinks she is, as her words, actually about [[clothe]]s she is wearing, coincidentially seem answers to his speaking) and rather uncaringly gives him a sock as a token.  Justin embarks on his quest to become a knight. Along the way he meets an extremely beautiful, feisty girl named Talia ([[Saoirse Ronan]]), a [[Bartender|barmaid]] who works at the Broken Eagle Inn, a job which she doesn't enjoy, and a quirky [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] called Melquiades ([[David Walliams]]). Talia is immediately enamored by Justin, while at the same time Talia also falls in love with Justin. Meanwhile, Justin's grandmother visits the Queen, who tells her that she regrets her decision of ousting the knights. An armor polisher and small-time thief overhears their conversation and steals some [[armour]] to disguise himself as a knight, naming himself Sir Clorex ([[Antonio Banderas]]). He instantly becomes popular with the townsfolk and is used to attract customers at the Broken Eagle Inn, but Talia is immediately able to tell that he is a phony.  Justin arrives at the abbey and receives training from the monks, Braulio ([[Barry Humphries]]), an inventor who suffers from nervous attacks when shocked or stressed, Legantir ([[Charles Dance]]), a wizard and head monk of the abbey and Blucher ([[James Cosmo]]), a knight and an old friend of Sir Roland. They train him using the ways of the Knights of Valour. The monks then receive news that a banished former knight, Sir Heraclio ([[Mark Strong]]) and his second-in-command Sota ([[Rupert Everett]]), have returned from exile and have started rounding up an army (composed of people broken out of prison by Sota and his halfwit brothers Champ & Copas) to seek retribution on the Queen & Reginald for outlawing knights. The monks later reveal to Justin the Hall of Heroes, where all the statues of the finest knights were kept. Justin finds his grandfather's statue and notices that his grandfather's sword is not in the chest below it, and Sir Heraclio's statue has been removed. Blucher then tells Justin what really happened to his grandfather and how the Queen outlawed knights: The King was killed in a battle and all the ruling was left to the Queen. The Queen started depending on lawyers and Justin's father chose the Law over Knights, and eventually wrote a contract that outlawed Knights, which the Queen signed. Heraclio, furious, tried to attack the Queen & Reginald, but Justin's grandfather defended the Queen and was killed by Heraclio with his own sword. Justin realizes that his grandfather's sword is with Heraclio. The monks attempt to challenge Justin by battling a [[dragon]], which turns out to be a crocodile named Gustav with mechanical wings and a fire-breathing trumpet. Justin ends up near-fatally injured but is saved by Legantir and Blucher using a healing spell that requires magic, healing leaves and a true knight. The monks fear for his safety and decide to end the training. Just before he leaves, Blucher gives Justin his sword and tells him that he will need it.  On his way back home, Justin saves Talia when she gets intimidated by thugs. Talia joins in and helps Justin defeat the thugs, resulting in her getting fired, though she happily quits before she can actually be fired. Justin is amazed that Talia is a proficient fighter, which she says is from dealing with five older brothers. She gets slightly disheartened when she learns that Justin already has feelings for Lara. Meanwhile, Justin's grandmother tells her son Reginald to understand Justin's dream of becoming a knight, just like his father understood his dream to become a Lawyer. She persuades Reginald to bond with his son at Lara's party, an event that Justin wouldn't miss. Justin attends Lara's party with Talia as his date. Justin is shocked when he finds out that Lara has fallen in love with Sir Clorex. Like Talia, Justin can also tell that Sir Clorex is a fraud, having already seen him shamefully sell autographs for money. Sota and his brothers invade the party in order to kidnap Lara for a ransom of 10,000 gold coins from her father. Justin attempts to save Lara, but Sota drugs him with a sharp ring, making him disorientated and he ends up embarrassing himself in front of Lara. Clorex enters the scene in a choppy way. Sota and his brothers, after hearing that the townsman call him Sir Clorex, think that he is a knight and flee quickly. Lara mocks Justin about his desire to become a knight, and Reginald attempts to bond with his son, but Justin sadly tells him that he will go to Law School (earlier on in the story, Justin was immediately accepted into Law School since he was Reginald's son). Sir Clorex and Lara share a seemingly romantic moment together, until Sir Clorex "kidnaps" Lara and rides off with her.  On his way to Law School, Justin bumps into Talia who tells him that Lara has been captured. Justin is her only hope, as the townsfolk become infuriated with the lawyers. After some encouragement and persuasion, Reginald finally accepts his son's desire to become a knight and allows Justin to stand up against Heraclio. Justin, Talia and Melquiades go to Heraclio's hideout, where they find Sir Clorex, being questioned by Heraclio about his knighthood, and Lara being help captive. Justin and Talia break into the room and briefly fight. Sir Clorex then grabs Lara and runs off with her. Justin and Talia defeat Sota and his brothers, before coming face to face with Heraclio's army. Talia confronts Sir Clorex and engages in a fist fight with him. She eventually corners him and finishes him off by kicking soot all over him, telling Sir Clorex that he is simply a fake and that it's not armour that proves he's a knight; it's the man inside. Blucher arrives with Gustav to aid Justin and defeat Heraclio. Gustav scares the army away, while Heraclio and Blucher engage in a [[duel]] which ends with Blucher being stabbed. Justin then duels with Heraclio. The two get stuck on a [[watermill]] above a [[waterfall]] where they fight over Sir Roland's sword. Heraclio slips and falls to his death while Justin retrieves the sword. Blucher is on the brink of death due to the wound and Justin and Melquiades use the same healing leaves from before on Blucher, proving Justin has become a true knight.  The Queen then gives Justin the title of Sir Justin and praises him for his bravery. She decides to re-establish the outlawed knights by signing a new contract. Reginald is hesitant at first, as he fears that his son would follow the same fate as his father but signs the contract as it would make his son happy. While it seemed as though Justin still has feelings for Lara, he returns the sock she had given him and then turns her down much to her disappointment and surprise, as she was starting to like him. He then turns to Talia and tells her that he wants her to continue accompanying him on quests, as he has realized that she is the girl of his dreams. Talia happily accepts and shares a loving kiss with Justin, officially becoming his girlfriend. At the abbey, the monks have finished creating a statue of Justin in the Hall of Knights. A wall is then torn down revealing another hall for future knights.

Blaming the good-hearted Sam for his ouster, Bergmans vows revenge and challenges to prove that evil does reign supreme in this world. Sam finishes his education and training and arrives at a village as the new Father of the local church. A local boy named Thomas of this village who is the illegitimate son of a local fisherman Chetty ([[Ponvannan]]) has grown up in a rough neighborhood, following the death of his mother and thus being forced to fend for himself.  Father Sam takes the run down church and the skeptical villagers in his stride and soon starts bringing about changes. Through a series of incidents, he also manages to get the unruly Thomas under his control and gets him to learn the tricks of the fishing trade from the villagers. The film fast forwards a few years when Thomas is now all grown up ([[Gautham Karthik]]) and is very close to Father Sam who is now a well respected person in the village.  Thomas comes across Bea (short for Beatrice) ([[Thulasi Nair (actress)|Thulasi Nair]]) when she's running away from her convent school group who had gotten her admitted to hospital. They keep running into each other a few times and Thomas comes to like her presence.  Meanwhile, as Father Sam is meditating on the remote beach, he hears a few gunshots on the sands. On investigation, he finds an unconscious Bergmans in the waters. On seeing that the shooters are still lurking around trying to finish their job of killing Bergmans, he pulls him to safety into an abandoned ship, and takes care of his bullet injuries with the help of a local village woman as well as a woman Celina ([[Lakshmi Manchu]]) from a distant village that Bergmans asks him to get. A few villagers including Chetty who see Father Sam running around in the dark with the 2 women get suspicious and accuse the three of sleeping together. They call the Bishop, upon whose interrogation, Celina admits to the sin, and Father Sam gets unfairly implicated. One of the villagers is also killed in the ensuing mêlée and Father Sam is sentenced to 4 years rigorous imprisonment.  Bergmans visits Father Sam in prison and admits he got the woman to implicate him falsely, to prove that evil will always triumph. When Father Sam returns from prison, he discovers Thomas has fallen in cahoots with the evil Bergmans in his smuggling trade and has committed many sins in his desire to make the village people bow before him. Thomas and Bea have also fallen in love with each other and come to seek Father Sam's blessings. Thomas subsequently gets to know that Bea is none other than the estranged daughter of Bergmans, who does not want to have to do anything with her.  Thomas takes Bea to Bergmans' house to trigger some long-lost memories when she recalls all the previous horrific incidents of her father Bergmans, including the one of killing her mother. Bergmans gets angry with all this and abducts both Father Sam and Bea in his boat and goes out to sea with an intent to kill them both. However, even after a few feeble attempts, the self-professed son of Satan who disavows all family attachment, is unable to get himself to kill his daughter. Thomas comes chasing them and after a long drawn fight amongst the three, Thomas and Father Sam together manage to subdue the evil Bergmans.  The movie ends on a note that good finally triumphs over evil, whether it be Father Sam and Thomas' triumph over Bergmans, Thomas' own suppressing of his bad inclination and re-joining forces with Father Sam, or Bergmans' good nature coming out in his inability to kill his daughter.

  The film begins with Abir ([[Ankush Hazra]]), a young, energetic photojournalist working for the private newspaper [[Anandabazar Patrika]] (ABP), witnessing [[Naxalites]] robbing a local bank. He chases them and manages to click photos of the robbers. When he tries to escape, he is stopped by a young woman Naina ([[Srabanti Malakar]]) who assumes he is the culprit and helps the robbers to take his camera. However, Abir manages to secure the memory card of the camera. The cops catch him, and to prove that he is a press photographer he shows the photos to them. The cops identify everyone in the photos except the gang leader (whose face is covered by a mask). At his office, Abir again meets Nayana, who has newly joined as Article Editor. Payel (Sayani Ghosh) also works in his office and has feelings for Abir. However, Abir does not reciprocate her feelings and treats her only as a friend.  Settled in her new job, Naina writes a cover story about the leader of the opposition Tarakeshwar Dutta (Supriyo Dutta), describing his attempt to marry a minor. Enraged by this, Tarakeshwar barges into the newspaper office and shouts at Naina. The audio recording of her interview disappears (courtesy Tarakeshwar), and she is fired from her job for falsified reporting. Abir later risks his life to capture the pictures of Tarakeshwar who actually engages in child marriage in a temple at midnight. Later the story with the photos is printed in their newspaper and this makes Naina to fall in love with him, which Abir reciprocates. Payel is initially jealous of the love between Abir and Nayana, but later accepts it and gets over Abir.  Meanwhile, Abhimanyu ([[Abir Chatterjee]]), a recent graduate and engineer, strives hard to provide education and spread awareness to the poor people. He and his team of graduates try to contest against more experienced politicians who capture the people by giving freebies and money. No one cares about Abhimanyu and his team of graduates, who promise a healthy government to people. Their party name is 'Borno Porichoy' (Grammar Introduction). One day, Abhimanyu gets attacked by some miscreants on the streets and he rushes towards the ABP office to get help. The attackers are thrown away by the office staffs and security. Abhimanyu tells the staff that those miscreants are from the ruling party and they have been sent by the Chief Minister Surojit Sarkar (Rajatava Dutta). Abir and Naina find out about Abhimanyu's election campaign, and they and the entire ABP team extend their support to the campaign, covering it extensively, much to the chagrin of Tarakeshwar and the Chief Minister.  One night, Abhimanyu's party organises an election campaign meeting. Abir, photographing the event, receives a text message from Payel that states there is a bomb underneath the stage where Abhimanyu is speaking. Abir manages to save Abhimanyu just before the bomb explodes. Later, Abir finds Payel fatally wounded near the blast site. Payel struggles to tell something to Abir and Naina before she dies. Abir, through a video clip recorded by another photographer, finds out that Payel was intentionally killed by someone. He later notices a resemblance between the leader of the bank robber and this unknown killer, concluding that the Naxalite leader killed Payel.  A few days later, Naina notices that Abhimanyu's photo in their newspaper was cut from a college class photo, where Abir is also present. Confronted by Naina, Abir tells her that he and Abhimanyu studied in the same college and were best friends. He also tells her that he is happy for Abhimanyu's success and is wholeheartedly supporting his election campaign.  In the election, Abhimanyu's party wins by a huge majority and Abhimanyu becomes the Chief Minister. He orders the release of 10 naxals on Republic Day, citing humanity. Shocked on hearing this news, Abir rushes to the secretariat to meet Abhimanyu. In Abhimanyu's office, Abir notices that the Naxalite leader who killed Payel is sitting there, talking to Abhimanyu. Abir airs his grievances to Abhimanyu, who ignores him. Abir then follows the leader to his hideout. At the same time, Abhimanyu orders the Kolkata Police to go kill the Naxals at their hideout and the Police Commandos surround the perimeter of that place and start firing at the Naxalites. The Naxalite leader gets shot during the shooting and his group take hold of some people (including children) as hostage. Abir, already at the hideout, confronts the Naxalite leader, whose name is Shankar and finds out from him that Abhimanyu had made a deal with the Naxalites to help him win the election. They orchestrated events such as the burning of a hut and saving the child of a woman in that hut (who was also a Naxalite) in order to win people's sympathy. In the same vein, they had planted a bomb on the stage where Abhimanyu was speaking during his meeting. Payel had found out the truth about Abhimanyu, but was fatally assaulted by him so that she does not reveal his character and intentions to anybody. Abir realises that Payel had tried to warn him and Naina about Abhimanyu's true character before dying and also that now Abhimanyu is double-crossing the Naxalites and is planning to kill them as a show of achievement. Abir records the confession of Shankar using his mobile phone camera sends it to Naina, who plans to publish this story in their newspaper. Abhimanyu then arrives outside the hideout and asks the police personnel to let him go inside alone and try to reason with the Naxalites. Abhimanyu goes inside and asks Shankar to kill Abir. Shankar refuses as Abir has saved his life by getting a Doctor for him to cure his wounds. Abhimanyu then kills Shankar. He also tries to kill Abir. However, Abir triggers a bomb there which explodes, killing Abhimanyu, while Abir manages to escape.  Meanwhile, Abhimanyu's party members arrive at the hideout on hearing the news that Abhimanyu had died. Seeing their innocence, Abir forces Naina not to reveal the truth about Abhimanyu because his party members would get into serious trouble and lose their seats just for supporting Abhimanyu. They did not know about Abhimanyu's true character and intentions and supported him, believing his false claims of a 'healthy government'. Instead Naina publishes an article saying that Abhimanyu had sacrificed his life fighting the Naxalites and died as a martyr.  The film ends with Abir and Nayana submitting their resignations to the Chief Editor for falsified reporting, but he rejects their resignations and tells them to cover the upcoming election.

Kamen Rider × Kamen Rider Gaim & Wizard: The Fateful Sengoku Movie Battle
 Unlike previous ''Movie War'' films, this one is only divided in two stories:  and .  ===''Kamen Rider Wizard: The Promised Place''=== While Haruto is traveling abroad to look for a place to hide the Hope Ring, Kizaki, Rinko, and Nito break into a laboratory where artificial copies of the Phantom Carbuncle are being created. They are attacked by the Phantom Ogre who devours the copies and easily defeats the three Kamen Rider Mages, Mayu, Yuzuru, and Yamamoto before leaving. Ogre then goes after Haruto at a beach near Fortaleza, Brazil, in an attempt to force him into despair and bring forth his Phantom Wizardragon. After failing, the monster steals the Hope Ring from Haruto instead and flees.  After returning to Japan and reuniting with his friends, Haruto is attacked by Ogre once more, bringing with them a copy of Koyomi he created with the Hope Ring that is able to transform into the White Wizard in order to have Haruto choose between killing Koyomi or having her go in a rampage, possibly falling into despair. To prevent that, Nito knocks down Haruto and despite being warned about the consequences, wears a restored Beast Driver and renews his pact with Chimera, transforming into Kamen Rider Beast once again but he fails to defeat them as well. Back at the Antique Shop Omokagedō, Haruto regrets the fact that he did not dispose of the Hope Ring thanks to his attachment to Koyomi and is given a brand new Magic Ring crafted by Shunpei. Back at the fight, Kamen Rider Beast faces against Ogre while Kamen Rider Wizard confronts the White Wizard and, after Shunpei's ring fails to work, Wizard succeeds in dissuading Koyomi and returns the Hope Ring to normal. Ogre then forces himself into Haruto's Underworld in order to capture Wizardragon there and the Hope Ring reacts with Shunpei's ring, allowing Kamen Rider Wizard to enter his own Underworld, while Kamen Rider Beast confronts a trio of Carbuncle copies. Kamen Rider Beast defeats the copies while Haruto finishes Ogre and meets an image of Koyomi inside his Underworld, whom he entrusts with the Hope Ring before returning to the real world. Haruto and Nito celebrate their victory with their friends when a Crack appears and the Pitcher Plant Inhumanoid jumps from it, absorbing Nito before jumping back into the Crack, beside a red-colored Armored Rider resembling Gaim.  ===''Kamen Rider Gaim: Sengoku Battle Royale!''=== A competition is being held in Zawame City between Armored Riders Gaim, Ryugen, Baron, Kurokage, and Gridon with a batch of Lockseeds from DJ Sagara as a prize when a Crack opens amid the battle and the Pitcher Plant Inhumanoid appears from it, attacking Mai. Gaim, Ryugen, and Baron protect Mai and pursue the Inhumanoid as it retreats through the Crack. The Riders arrive in an alternate reality where the inhabitants run away in fear from Gaim, mistaking him for someone else. Looking for answers, they join a battle with a Kamen Rider resembling OOO, while Takatora learns of the situation and follows after the other Armored Riders. Kaito breaks into a burning castle and meets Nobunaga, who entrusts him with a Core Medal before dying amid the flames, but he manages to save Ranmaru from the fire. Outside, the red Kamen Rider Gaim appears and defeats Kamen Rider OOO, before having him absorbed by the Pitcher Plant Inhumanoid. Kouta and Mitsuzane flee the scene just to be later captured by an alternate Iyeasu Tokugawa, who reveals that in that reality each of the Heisei Riders are Bujin Riders serving a feudal warlord and fighting to unify the country but most of them have been defeated, including his own Bujin Wizard, by the red-colored Kamen Rider Bujin Gaim, who serves no one except for himself.   As Mai enters a Crack in search for her friends, Kaito saves Ranmaru from some bandits, earning her gratitude and loyalty. Bujin Gaim then fights one of the last Bujin, Bujin Double and Armored Rider Zangetsu intervenes, but unintentionally assist Bujin Gaim as he realized that Bujin Gaim is not the Gaim from his dimension, leading to Double's defeat, leaving behind Kamen Rider Double's Joker Gaia Memory which Zangetsu retrieves and escape from Bujin Gaim's attacks. After Kouta agrees to work with Ieyasu only until Bujin Gaim is defeated, Kouta and Mitsuzane join the battle between Bujin Gaim and Bujin Fourze but fail to protect Fourze from Bujin Gaim, with both Fourze and Ryugen being absorbed by the Pitcher Plant Inhumanoid. After the battle, Takatora appears and retrieves one of Fourze's Astroswitches. Back in Ieyasu's castle, Kouta learns that Kaito is rallying the armies from the now defeated warlords and intends to conquer the entire land. Mai arrives in the alternate realm and meets Kaito, who refuses to give up on his plans, claiming that he prefers staying there than returning home. When she parts ways from him, Mai is attacked by the Pitcher Plant Inhumanoid again just to be rescued by the real Kamen Rider Wizard, who has her reunite with Kouta while trying to save Nito.  Kouta and Haruto prepare to face an assault from Kaito's forces, while Bujin Gaim uses the power of the other Bujin Kamen Riders to take control of the sacred tree. He returns to Ieyasu's castle to kidnap Mai, who he claims is the "Priestess of Fate". As the three forces clash, Baron joins forces with Wizard, Gaim, and Zangetsu to defeat the Pitcher Plant Inhumanoid and free Mitsuzane and Nito. The six Kamen Riders then confront Bujin Gaim, with Ieyasu entrusting Kamen Rider Wizard with Bujin Wizard's Infinity Ring and Kouta carrying the Flame Ring. The mysterious girl appears before the Armored Riders and creates some Helheim Fruits from which they create Lockseeds from the relics of the fallen Bujin Kamen Riders to attain the powers of Wizard, OOO, Fourze, and Double. Infused with the sacred tree, Bujin Gaim absorbs Kamen Rider Wizard and Gaim, who receive the powers of the other fallen Bujin Kamen Riders to escape and destroy Bujin Gaim with their combined powers. After the battle, Nito discovers that he can feed Chimera with Helheim Fruits in order to avoid being consumed by it and the Kamen Riders bid farewell to each other as they return home. Elsewhere, Takatora is given a new transformation belt by his scientist Ryoma Sengoku. Kouta, Kaito, and Mitsuzane still manage to return to Zawame to face Jonouchi and Hase in their battle royale.

Karma (2013 film)
  
Khumba
  In [[South Africa]] within the [[Karoo|Great Karoo]], a half-striped [[zebra]] named Khumba ([[Jake T. Austin]]) is born into an insular isolated herd of all-striped zebras where his mother is Lungisa ([[Anika Noni Rose]]) and his father is Seko ([[Laurence Fishburne]]). Rumors that the strange foal is cursed spread and before long he is blamed for the drought that sets into the Great Karoo. As he matures, Khumba is picked on and remains ostracized by most of the herd with the exception of Tombi ([[AnnaSophia Robb]]), a young female zebra friend close in age - whom Khumba has a crush on - and uncomfortable in the herd due to her tomboyish manners.  When a mystical [[African mantis]] (Adrian Rhodes) appears to Khumba, he draws a map to what could be interpreted as either water or stripes between it. Khumba jeopardizes the herd and gets into trouble when he attempts to admit several [[gemsbok]] (Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi and Anele Matoti) into the watering-hole enclosure when their wise elderly healer ([[Sindiwe Magona]]) needs water. He also nearly admits the ferocious half-blind [[African leopard]] Phango ([[Liam Neeson]]) who warns Mkhulu ([[Ben Vereen]]) that he and his zebra herd can't stay in their enclosure forever. Seko berates and scolds Khumba for putting the herd at risk and for the next week, he'll drink half of his rations. Lungisa tells the story of how a white horse got its stripes by swimming in a magic river and other horses wanted to have stripes like him, making the [[zebra]] we know today. Shortly after, Lungisa succumbs to her disease and dies. Then, Khumba leaves the confines of his home knowing that he cannot survive in the herd where it is viewed as only "half-a-zebra" even to his father.  Khumba ventures beyond the fence and encounters an opportunistic [[African wild dog]] named Skalk ([[Steve Buscemi]]) who nearly leads the unsuspecting zebra to his doom when Skalk's pack try to eat him. He is saved by a maternal [[wildebeest]] named Mama V ([[Loretta Devine]]) and a flamboyant British [[Common ostrich|ostrich]] named Bradley ([[Richard E. Grant]]). Mama V is a self-confessed free spirit who does not want to be the average stay-at-home mom, like other wildebeest. She mothers Bradley who possesses a histrionic [[diva]]-esque attitude. The duo join Khumba on his quest in the hope that their own search for a safe waterhole is over.  On their journey, Khumba aids a migrating herd of [[springbok]] in opening a hole in a great fence to continue journeying forward. Curiously, the springbok are all so similar that they cannot even differentiate among one another. They break down the fence and left.  Khumba thinks his journey is over when he wanders into a new age, bohemian community living safely within the confines of Ying's National Park. There he meets a colorful group of individuals like a family of [[meerkat]]s, a [[pangolin]], some [[Imbabala|bushbuck]]s, a [[bat-eared fox]], and an Australian endangered [[riverine rabbit]] ([[Jeff Bennett]]) who has survived extinction by mastering a myriad of skills ranging from impersonations to beat-boxing. After narrowly escaping capture by an opportunistic group of [[park ranger]]s who [[tranquilizer gun|tranquilizes]] Bradley and [[animal trapping|traps]] Khumba in a [[cage (enclosure)|cage]], he wanders to a nearby mountain to speak to the mighty [[black eagle|Black Eagle]] under the advice of the riverine rabbit.  Khumba encounters a group of fanatical [[rock hyrax]]es who worship the Black Eagle and stymie his advance. From the albino Black Eagle ([[Roger L. Jackson]]), he learns the way to the watering hole and that it lies in Phango's cave. The Black Eagle also reveals the origins of Phango. Born half-blind and rejected by his family as a cub, Phango is obsessed with being whole and murdered his whole family. Unbeknownst to Khumba, Phango is trailing him because of an ancient myth that says consuming the half-striped zebra will make Phango the most powerful hunter that ever lived.  As Khumba journeys onwards, Seko becomes withdrawn and is remorseful that he has let his herd down. He would have never been so hard on Khumba if it never happened. With Tombi’s help, he realizes that if he does not lead his herd in search of another waterhole, they will all die and sets out to follow the trail of Phango. He is prompted by evidence that Khumba may be alive.  Tensions between Khumba, Mama V, and Bradley escalate as they move on. While slaking their thirst at a well on a farm, they are driven away by Nora ([[Catherine Tate]]), a loony, solitary [[Merino|Merino sheep]], and Khumba reveals that the watering-hole is in Phango's cave. It was revealed that Nora talked about Phango and Khumba reveals that the waterhole is at his cave, although even much ironically, Nora shouts that Khumba promised Phango to make Mama V his boyfriend, even much Khumba has his deal with Phango. The trio has an argument and a fall-out and Khumba continues on alone. Lost and delirious in a [[Salt pan (geology)|saltpan]], Khumba is rescued by the same gemsbok healer that he tried to help and wanders the remaining distance to the mountain, and Phango's lair.  Meanwhile, Phango intercepts Mama V and Bradley and discovers that Khumba is fortuitously heading straight to him and returns to his cave. During this time, it was revealed that Mama V lost her child to Phango. Concerned for Khumba's safety, Mama V and Bradley decide to intercede and warn him. Meanwhile, determined to find the waterhole and get his stripes, Khumba ventures into the leopard's lair.  At the same time, Seko and the zebras journey to Phango's lair where they are joined by the springbok herd, the animals from Ying's National Park, the rock-rabbits, Skalk (who left his pack due to "creative differences"), and Nora (who was let out of the farm by Skalk).  While Khumba wanders the depths of the dark cave, his herd arrives at the base of the mountain, along with many of the other animals he has encountered along his journey. Within the cave, Khumba finds the watering hole and upon reflection of his mother's words and all of the interactions he has had, he realizes that diversity is essential for survival and that would can be one's difference can, in fact, be one's strength. As Phango closes in, he ends up chasing after Khumba. Khumba races to escape the leopard's clutches as the cave starts to collapse. Part of the cliff gives way which forms a water hole outside Phango's cave. The assembled animals watch the fight between Khumba and Phango, which results in both of them falling due to the collapsing cave. During the battle, Khumba was fatally scarred but Phango falls off the cliff where he is killed by two large rocks falling on him, while Khumba falls into the water and his body washes up on the shores.  As it starts to rain, everyone begins to mourn Khumba until he suddenly awakens from his apparent death. As Khumba gets up, Tombi notices the scratch marks that Phango left on Khumba's right side during the fight.  With Phango dead and the zebra herd now having a new home, Khumba celebrates with his herd, Mama V, Bradley, Skalk, Nora, the gemsbok herd, the springbok herd, the animals from Ying's National Park, and the rock-rabbits as they engage in different activities around the waterfall.  
Kick-Ass 2 (film)
  [[Kick-Ass (character)|Dave Lizewski]], bored after having retired from fighting crime as Kick-Ass, begins training with Hit-Girl [[Hit-Girl (character)|Mindy Macready]] to become a real hero. Following the death of his father, Chris D'Amico accidentally kills his own mother by short-circuiting her tanning bed; she had been in denial about her husband's death. Now in control of his father's criminal empire, Chris finds a fetishwear outfit, adopts two of his father's handguns and decides to become a supervillain The Motherfucker, swearing vengeance on Kick-Ass.  Mindy's guardian, Marcus, discovers she is still fighting crime and makes her promise to give it up. Dave's girlfriend, Katie Deauxma, has noticed Dave behaving strangely and breaks up with him, believing he is cheating on her with Mindy (she also reveals she has cheated on him). Dave resumes his life as Kick-Ass, joining the superhero team Justice Forever (which Dave had inspired), led by Colonel Stars and Stripes. It includes Battle Guy (Dave's friend, Marty), Dr. Gravity, Insect Man, Night-Bitch, and the parents of a missing child named Tommy. Kick-Ass begins a sexual relationship with Night Bitch. He and Marty try to get their friend Todd involved with heroics, but instead alienate him by calling his chosen identity, Ass Kicker, a blatant copy of Kick-Ass.  Mindy, attempting to lead a normal life, tries out for the dance team at school, impressing the audience with her audition. Dave tries to convince Mindy to join Justice Forever, but she refuses, and promptly asks a boy to take her on a date. The date ends up as a cruel prank planned by bullies in her school, leaving Mindy abandoned in the forest to walk home alone. Dave consoles the tearful Mindy and encourages her to beat the bullies at their own game. The next day, Mindy does so with verbal put-downs and a specially designed shock [[Baton (law enforcement)|baton]] that makes the bullies vomit and soil themselves in the cafeteria, resulting in her suspension from school.  Dave's father discovers Dave is Kick-Ass after finding his superhero costume, and they have an argument which leads Dave to leave home. Meanwhile, The Motherfucker assembles a gang of supervillains called the Toxic Mega Cunts and establishes an underground lair, including a tank with a live shark. Growing ever more deranged after his imprisoned uncle has his aide Javier killed in order to teach him a lesson, the Motherfucker ambushes Colonel Stars and Stripes in the Justice Forever headquarters and has his henchwoman Mother Russia decapitate him before taunting Justice Forever on [[Twitter]]. He then tracks down Night-Bitch and attempts to [[rape]] her to anger Kick-Ass, though he is unable to reach an [[erection]] in time as the authorities arrive, and instead has her beaten. When police arrive, Mother Russia kills all of the officers, resulting in a police clampdown on both costumed villains and vigilantes. When the police track Dave through his [[IP address]], Dave's father claims he, not Dave, is Kick-Ass, getting himself arrested in Dave's place.  The Motherfucker, unconvinced the real Kick-Ass has been caught, learns from Todd, who had inadvertently joined the Toxic Mega Cunts, that the man identified as being Kick-Ass is actually his father. The Motherfucker has Mr. Lizewski beaten to death in jail by his contacts there and sends a photograph to Dave, revealing his true identity as Chris D'Amico. A grief-stricken Dave vows to abandon his Kick-Ass identity, as he had promised his father. At his father's funeral, The Motherfucker's gang ambushes and kidnaps Dave. Mindy pursues their van and rescues Dave, and then convinces him to confront The Motherfucker.

The boy named Krishna, in a fit of rage (as his love interest Aparna is close to Michael because of Sulaiman), shows Sulaiman to Dayashankar and tells him that he is  Krishna Bhattacharya but prefers to be called as Sulaiman. Though initially he refuses to accept, Sulaiman accepts that he is Krishna Bhattacharya as this would be a Golden Chance to unite the two families. He, along with his friend Michael (Partho Sarathi Chakraborty) and a group of Bramhins (played by Lama, [[Aritra Dutta Banik]], [[Bhola Tamang]] and others) goes to the palace of Aditya Choudhury.  There he manages to act well, only to be noticed by Puja ([[Nusrat Jahan]]), the adopted daughter of Aditya Choudhury.

Kids for Cash
 In the film, former judge [[Michael Conahan]] admits to his crime and accepts the plea agreement, but is still awaiting sentencing; on September 23, 2011, he was sentenced to 17.5 years in prison and ordered to pay 874,000 dollars in restitution. Unlike Conahan, former judge [[Mark Ciavarella]] did not accept a plea agreement and completely denied allegations of his involvement in the kids-for-cash scam. He and his family went as far as accusing Conahan of lying about the scam. They claimed Ciavarella was being falsely accused of a crime he did not commit. As a result, he was sentenced to 28 years in prison, 10.5 more years than Conahan. Had he admitted to his crimes, Ciavarella may have had a lesser sentence similar to that of Conahan.  The documentary points directly to Conahan’s involvement in the scam and how he was involved in several business endeavors that gave him the experience necessary to orchestrate the scam. Conahan signed a plea agreement admitting to financial kickbacks from the scam. Ciavarella was found guilty of twelve of thirty-nine federal felonies including [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], [[Mail and wire fraud|mail fraud]], [[money laundering]], fraud [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] and filing false tax returns.  After beginning his sentence at a [[Federal Correctional Institution, Pekin|Federal correctional institution]] in [[Pekin, Illinois]], Ciavarella was transferred in October 2014 to a [[Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City|Federal transfer center]] in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]]. In March 2015, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] rejected Ciavarella’s petition for an appeal of his conviction. He will be 85-years-old when he is eligible for release. Several sources have published that former judge Conahan demanded $129,000 from former judge Ciavarella’s in-laws, but more reputable sources have yet to confirm this allegation.

Kill Your Darlings (2013 film)
 As a young man in the 1940s, poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] ([[Daniel Radcliffe]]) wins a place at [[Columbia University]] in New York City. He arrives as a very inexperienced [[freshman]], but soon runs into [[Lucien Carr]] ([[Dane DeHaan]]), who is very [[anti-establishment]] and rowdy.  After a while, Ginsberg discovers that Carr only manages to stay at Columbia thanks to a somewhat older man, a professor, [[David Kammerer]] ([[Michael C. Hall]]), who writes all of his term papers for him, and has a predatory relationship with Carr. It appears that Kammerer is still in love with Carr, and is revealed to be pressuring Carr for sexual favors, in exchange for assuring that he cannot be expelled.  Ginsberg soon meets, through Carr, [[William S. Burroughs]] ([[Ben Foster]]), already far into drug experimentation. The writer [[Jack Kerouac]] ([[Jack Huston]]), who was a sailor at that time and expelled from Columbia, also meets and spends time with them. Carr eventually tells Kammerer he is done with him, and recruits Ginsberg (who has a crush on him) to write his term papers instead. After a while, Kerouac and Carr attempt to run off and join the [[merchant marine]] together, hoping to go to Paris.  There is a confrontation between Carr and Kammerer, during which Kammerer is killed by stabbing (and perhaps also by drowning). Carr is arrested, and asks Ginsberg to write his [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] for him. Ginsberg is at first reluctant to help the unstable Carr, but after digging up more crucial evidence on Kammerer and his past relationship, he writes a piece entitled "The Night in Question". The piece describes a more emotional event, in which Carr kills Kammerer who outright tells him to after being threatened with the knife, devastated by this final rejection. Carr rejects the "fictional" story, and begs a determined Ginsberg not to reveal it to anybody, afraid that it will ruin him in the ensuing trial.  We learn from Carr's mother that Kammerer was the first person to seduce Carr, when he was much younger and lived in Chicago. After the trial we find out that Carr testified that the attack took place only because Kammerer was a sexual predator, and that Carr killed him in self-defense. Carr is not convicted of murder and receives only a short sentence for manslaughter.  Ginsberg then submits "The Night in Question" as his final term paper. On the basis of that shocking piece of prose, Ginsberg is faced with possible expulsion from Columbia. Either he must be expelled or he must embrace establishment values. He chooses the former, but is forced to leave his typescript behind. A week or two later he receives the typescript in the mail with an encouraging letter from his professor telling him to pursue his writing.

He announces that they are going to build a house there, free from responsibility and parents. Once their makeshift abode is finished, the three young men find themselves masters of their own destiny, alone in the woods. Joe claims himself and Biaggio to be the hunters, while Patrick goes off to gather fruit, etc. Several weeks pass and Patrick and Joe are reported missing and appear on multiple news channels. Frank finds a Monopoly piece from the game night in Joe's bookbag that was left on a bus and believes that Joe is taunting him.  Conflict arises between Patrick and Joe when Joe invites his crush Kelly ([[Erin Moriarty (actress)|Erin Moriarty]]) to come see the house they built.

The two get into a scuffle. Joe calls Kelly a "cancer" and a "bitch" who ruined the peace and harmony the three of them were having and eventually makes her walk out of the house in despair. Joe, realizing that Patrick feels bad for Kelly, taunts him to go after her and stomps on his previously broken foot. Patrick leaves the house and goes after Kelly, comforting her with a kiss.

Krrish 3
  Scientist Rohit Mehra lives with his son Krishna Mehra (both played by [[Hrithik Roshan]]) in Mumbai. Krishna is married to Priya ([[Priyanka Chopra]]), a journalist for [[Aaj Tak]]. Rohit works in a research institute for the Indian government and Krishna, while moonlighting as the superhero Krrish, is regularly fired from various day jobs due to lack of attendance. Rohit is researching on a device that will bring life to dead tissues by the use of solar energy. Despite several attempts, he fails to complete the experiment due to the high intensity of sun rays. On a usual day, Krishna loses his job from the security wing of a company when he hears news about an aeroplane whose front tyres are stuck due to some malfunctioning which creates high risk, even if landed, it may explode and so will the passengers inside. Krishna immediately changes himself to ''Krrish'' and saves the plane from accident by holding the landing gear in place to allow the tyres to support the nose of the craft.  A few days later, Rohit hears about a deadly disease spreading in [[Namibia]] due to a virus whose [[antidote]] has not yet been discovered. He consults his friend Dr. Varun Shetty ([[Arif Zakaria]]) about the situation. Meanwhile, Shetty receives a phone call from Dr. Alok Sen ([[Asif Basra]]), a scientist working for Kaal Laboratories who insists on meeting him in order to reveal information about the virus and its antidote. Both Sen and Shetty are, however, murdered by Kaya ([[Kangana Ranaut]]), a [[shapeshifting]] female mutant. She is the henchwoman of Kaal ([[Vivek Oberoi]]), a handicapped evil genius who possesses [[telekinetic]] powers. Kaal creates a team of human-animal hybrids called "''maanvars''", with distinct physical powers in order to cure himself but fails. Later it is revealed the virus in Namibia was spread by Kaal himself to incur huge profits by selling its antidote, the singular source of which is his blood.  Rohit discovers that the virus, which is fast spreading through Mumbai, has no effect on Krishna, the pregnant Priya or himself. He, thus, makes an antidote by using the blood from Krishna's bloodstream which he spreads with the help of explosions. An enraged Kaal sends his mutants to attack Rohit and find out how an antidote was developed without using his own blood. Krrish manages to save Rohit, but Priya is injured and hospitalised. Krrish, however, manages to defeat the mutant Striker (Gowhar Khan). Kaya, carrying out Kaal's instructions, shapeshifts into Priya while Priya is kidnapped by Kaal. Posing as Priya, Kaya leads Krishna to believe that Priya has lost her child, and continues to live with the Mehras. While finding the truth behind the antidote's formula she develops an attraction towards Krishna. Failing to get answers about Frog Man's involvement with the virus attack, Rohit travels to Singapore to seek answers from Dr. Siddhant Arya's ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]) partner, where he is kidnapped by Kaal's men. Meanwhile, Krishna discovers the true identity of Priya; furious, he reveals himself as Krrish to Kaya and orders her to take him to Kaal's laboratory. Having fallen in love with Krishna, Kaya decides to help rescue his wife.  At Kaal's laboratory, it is revealed that Kaal is Rohit's son, who was created by an experiment conducted by Dr. Arya while Rohit was held hostage by him years earlier. The child was born handicapped, and was thus given away to an orphanage from where he was adopted by a wealthy man ([[Mohnish Behl]]). Kaal uses Rohit's bone marrow to successfully cure his handicap. Meanwhile, Kaya saves Priya and unites her with Krrish; she is, however, murdered by Kaal for her disloyalty. Kaal subsequently murders Krrish, and dons a metal suit. Deeply disturbed by his son's death, Rohit decides to re-use his failed experiment to bring dead tissues to life in order to save Krishna. This time, however, he absorbs the excess energy himself. The process simultaneously kills Rohit and transfers his powers to a revived Krishna. Meanwhile, Kaal threatens to destroy the city of Mumbai if Priya does not surrender to him. Krrish re-emerges and, after several unsuccessful attempts, manages to kill him using Rohit's solar experiment.  Six months later, Priya names their new-born son Rohit, who also exhibits superpowers.

Since their father's demise, their families lived in hardship with their mother (Ku Faridah) living in fear caused by threats from [[loan shark]]s who came to collect their father's debt. Due to financial problems and hardship,Jai turned aggressive to the point of willing to do anything for money to change his luck,meanwhile gaining the disapproval from his family.  On the other end,Malik is getting bogged down thinking about the problems they faced and coupled with the inspection results from the doctor confirming that his mother is suffering from [[cancer]]. Meanwhile, Tailong ([[Rosyam Nor]])who himself is among the biggest gangster heads in [[Kuala Lumpur]] was actively carrying out illegal activities. All of Tailong's actions was not favoured by the other gangsters, but they had to contend with his power. At the same time, King (Ridzuan Hashim) and his stepson, Shark ([[Syamsul Yusof]]) planned to strengthen their position by taking down Tailong and calling for help from his long-time best friend, Malik,and offering huge sums of money to him.  Malik accepted the offer in the intention of covering the medical cost for his mother and to pay his father's debt. But his activity was not consented by his mother and both the latter and his brother were driven out of their home. King became increasingly powerful with the help of Malik and his presence made Tailong feel threatened. He plans to eliminate King and Malik. A huge fight later ensued  between the two groups when Tailong ambushed King and Malik at a night club. They were almost defeated by Tailong and King was incapacitated,but Malik's fighting skills proved to be a match even for Tailong. Shortly after, the police arrived and they managed to escape. At the same time, Malik spotted a [[tattoo]] on Tailong's body similar to the one the murderer of his  father had. The conflict and animosity between Malek and Tailong grew from that point onwards.  When Tailong discovered that Jai and Malik were brothers, he overpowered Jai and proceeded to kidnap Zati (Sheera Iskandar) and raped her in front of Jai. Malik went home to find his mother suffering severe injuries due to being beaten by Tailong's men. He had no clue as to what his siblings are going through,and he rushed his mother to the hospital.

With the help of Ajib,a section head who sees Malik as his blood brother (Sofi Jikan) and his men, Malik managed to take down Tailong's men.Malik and Jai teamed up, succeeding in defeating Tailong and afterwards handed him over to Shark,who  shot him dead. They then rushed to the hospital with money taken from Tailong's briefcase to pay the deposit so that their mother can undergo [[surgery]].Although this results in their mother and sister disowning them who sees their involvement in the gang world brought upon ruin to the family,just as their late father did. In the aftermath,Jai stubbornly continues to remain in the criminal world in his quest for riches,and Malek was arrested by the police after being framed by Shark,who planted the evidence in his car. While he was being escorted to the police station, Malek prayed to God for the safety of his family while he was serving time.  At the same time, Tailong's  death caused a drastic change in the gang hierarchy. Credited for taking down Tailong,Shark quickly rose to prominence and he became the leader for the strongest gangs in KL(however King later reclaimed his title after making a full recovery).

Upon arriving, he is greeted by the [[Promoter (entertainment)|promoter]] of the Supermarket club. After falling asleep in the hotel, he is rudely awaken by the alarm, dresses up and leaves for the job in the middle of the night. After finishing his [[DJ mix|DJ set]], he leaves the club to take the train to Geneva. While en route, instead of admiring the Alpine scenery, he sleeps.  After a short visit to a friend in Geneva (whether male or female is not shown), he takes the plane back to Moscow. He thus completes the first "story loop", repeated with slight variations throughout the entire film, a metaphor on techno [[Loop (music)|music loops]].  In his flat in Moscow, after quickly replying to booking requests on Skype, he goes through his huge collection of vinyl techno records to prepare his next performances. A quick shave and he leaves to take a taxi for the railway station, where he boards a train for Saint Petersburg.  Once in Saint Petersburg, he waits at a friend’s flat, while listening to tracks on [[Beatport]]. After nightfall, he is driven to Barakobamabar, where he plays a set. At dawn, his friends accompany him to the metro, one of them barely walking from too much drink. Pushkarev then takes the metro back to the train station, using a short-cut through Saint Petersburg down-town.  Back in Moscow, and back to the beginning of the story loop, he visits his friends and while drinking tea, debates his dream of playing techno during the day and bringing the techno club industry more in line with a healthy [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].  After a short metro trip, he plays in a Moscow club Mir, after which he flies out to Geneva, again. There, he takes the same train as previously, looping in the other direction, to [[Olten]] via [[Bern]]. Greeted by the club promoter, he goes directly to the local club Terminus, where technical problems hamper his performance. The [[Technics SL-1200|Technics SL-1210]] turntable refuses to switch the playback speed from 45 rpm to 33 rpm. Later, a club technician bumps his elbow into the [[tonearm]]. Tired, Pushkarev takes a cab to the hotel, where he checks his in-coming booking requests on the notebook computer.  In the morning, he takes the train to [[Lausanne]] where he changes for a [[TGV]] to Paris. After a performance at the 4 Éléments bar, he continues his trip to the [[Swiss International Air Lines|SWISS]] [[Airline hub|hub]] in [[Zurich Airport|Zurich]], where he boards a flight to Budapest.  The local crew transport him from Budapest to [[Kecel]], where he plays at the club Korona to a massive audience. Asleep in the car back to Budapest, he misses the decorated down-town and gets only a couple of hours to repack at the hotel, before leaving again for the airport, restarting the loop.  He flies back to the Zurich hub, where he changes for a flight to Bucharest.  Picked-up at the airport, he is driven to [[Craiova]], where he plays at club Krypton without any rest.  The next day, he sleeps in the car during a huge [[Early 2012 European cold wave|snowstorm of 2012]], one of the deadliest in Romania’s history, to arrive in [[Cluj-Napoca]]’s club Midi. He plays to an ecstatic crowd, only to wake up in the same battered BMW driving again through winter.  Finally, he arrives at the seaside, stares at the waves and the sunset and silently walks away, leaving his bag of vinyls on the beach.  
Labor Day (film)
 In 1987, Adele Wheeler is a depressed single mother who lives in a rural home with her 13-year-old son, Henry. While they are shopping, a bloody man approaches Henry and makes them take him home to look after him. The man is revealed to be Frank Chambers, an escaped convict wanted by police. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Frank is a Vietnam veteran who married his pregnant girlfriend, Mandy. A year after the baby's birth, Frank and Mandy had a fight, in which he asked if he was the father. He pushed her against a radiator, resulting in her death. Simultaneously, through imagery, it is implied that the baby drowned.  Frank was jailed for murder.  Adele tells Frank, seen through flashbacks, that she had a number of miscarriages after Henry, culminating with the full-term stillbirth of a baby girl. This has left Adele with severe anxiety and depression, which Henry's father later explains to Henry as the reasons their marriage failed. Henry has tried to be both a son and a husband but he realizes he cannot provide all of the things Adele needs. Adele is a passionate woman who loves to dance and teaches both Henry and Frank separately to dance. Frank teaches Henry car repairs and other things.

Lake Windfall
 The film begins with five friends who are organizing a weekend camping trip to a Missouri lake. Three of the friends are deaf, one is a hearing [[child of deaf adult]] (CODA) and the last is a hearing person. The film focuses on the interaction between the friends, and mirrors the interactions between 'Big-D' [[Deaf culture|Deaf]], hard-of-hearing, CODAs and hearing people.<ref></ref>  As the friends set off for the weekend, Jake (Jasun Hicks) has a heated discussion with his mom over [[video relay service]] (VRS) using his iPad. Cliff (Timothy Dillard) is watching and is fascinated by the speed of Jake's signing and seems unaware of the nature of the conversation. Cliff identifies as hard-of-hearing and has only recently begun learning ASL as he was brought up [[Oralism|orally]] and was [[Mainstreaming (education)|mainstream schooled]]. He is a [[nerd]]y guy, technology-addicted, and wears a [[hearing aid]]. At the beginning of the movie, he tries to align himself with the hearing people, to the annoyance of Jake. During the campfire that night, the two hearing guys sit around one side of the fire chatting. Cliff joins them and tries to follow their conversation but gets confused. Keith (Will Sanders), the hearing guy, gets annoyed with him and Cliff wanders off to the other side of the fire where the deaf men are chatting. The two deaf guys, Matt (Christopher B. Corrigan) and Jake, chide Cliff for trying to be part of the hearing world, while they were laughing at him. They play a trick on Jake by giving him a [[sign name]]. He is pleased by this and goes to tell Drew (Alex Laferriere) who tells him that it actually the sign for ''penis''. The others laugh at this, and he is infuriated.  Later, Matt and Drew are arguing and the audience learns that Drew is Matt's brother. A CODA, he has distanced himself from Matt and his deaf parents; his new wife had taken their calls and told them that Drew was not in. His wife has never learnt to sign, and it seems that she has played a part in Drew's disconnect from the rest of his family. Matt tells Drew that their mother has stage-2 [[breast cancer]] and he is shocked.  In the morning, Keith and Drew take the boat and go fishing in the lake without telling the others. They eventually wake up but the two other guys will not return. Instead, Jake goes to the truck where Cliff and Matt learn that he has brought his late father's rifle along on the trip. They all decide to take off for a few hours and do some target shooting. They go into the woods where they find a barn and set up some cans as targets. Matt and Keith are reasonably adept at shooting but Cliff has never fired a gun before, so he messes it up. The guys go off down a forest track to explore. Cliff needs a bathroom break, so he steps out behind a tree. Right at that moment, Jake spies a deer in the woods and decides to shoot it. Matt tries to stop him. Just as he is about to press the trigger on the rifle, something happens and they are flung to the ground. The world spins around them and the birds fly up. When Matt and Jake pick themselves up, they see the deer lying on its side, apparently dead. Jake checks his gun and, to his surprise, finds that the shot had not been fired. The deer suddenly gets up and runs into the clearing. Jake reloads, takes a few hurried shots at the deer and misses. It's then that they realize that Jake has accidentally shot Cliff in the lower left abdomen.  They eventually go back to the lake, where they meet up back with Keith and Drew. None of their phones work anymore, cars will not start and electric-powered devices no longer work. Keith is no longer able to hear as the cataclysmic event has deafened him. He does not handle this very well, can 'hear' [[Phantom limb|phantom sounds]], and is unable to communicate with the others. They keep going through the woods where they find a cabin lit with oil lamps. It appears empty, and they go in to investigate. There, they find a stack of notes where the occupants - a family - were deafened and were frantically writing notes to each other. One of the men goes to investigate the basement where he discovers the father hiding. There is an altercation and both of them are shot and killed.  The brothers Matt and Drew escape from the house, along with Keith by taking a diesel [[Willys MB|Jeep]] and push-starting it. They stop briefly at a gas station where Keith is shot and killed by the owner. Drew is saved by his brother Matt, who shoots and kills the owner but is injured in the process. The main story ends with the brothers driving along while Drew is frantically trying to keep his brother alive.  As the movie ends, the epilog shows us a view of the future. It transpires that the vast majority of people on the planet had been deafened by a cosmic event known as the ''"Soundfall"''. The world falls into disarray and chaos but we learn that it is rehabilitated much sooner than expected thanks to a minority community (the [[Deaf culture|Deaf world]]) which nurtured and kept ASL alive, and it was this that the world turned to. The audience then discovers that the person telling us these is actually the [[President of the United States]] and that he is deaf, too.

On the other hand, Rahul and Aanandi start facing problems in their married life because of Aanandi's rigid nature. Aditi and Nishant keep suggesting to Rahul ways to keep Aanandi happy, but in vain. One day, Rahul and Aanandi have a bad fight, after which Rahul meets with an accident.  Aditi, out of guilt for failure of Aanandi and Rahul's marriage, stops her marriage institution.

Meanwhile, Aanandi realises her mistake and reconciles with Rahul. Nishant comes to know about Aditi's past. Aditi had lost her parents and twice her prospective grooms died. People blamed Aditi's destiny for this and no one dared to marry her or keep any kind of relation with her.  Nishant then understands why Aditi is always scared and insecure and how she did not respond to his marriage proposal, as she loves him and does not want him to get harmed due to her. Nishant meets Aditi and tells her that its high time she needs to move on and get married, if not with him then with someone else, and settle down. The film ends with Nishant and Aditi sharing a hug (indicating that Aditi has accepted Nishant's marriage proposal) and going somewhere hand in hand.  
The Last Stand (2013 film)
 Sheriff Ray Owens is a man who has resigned himself to a life of fighting what little crime takes place in sleepy border town Sommerton Junction, [[Arizona]]. He left his [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] post following a bungled operation and leaving him wracked with failure and defeat after his partner was crippled and his team decimated. The crimes experienced in Sommerton range from the mayor parking his Camaro in the [[fire lane]] to vintage arms collector Lewis Dinkum firing off guns at slabs of meat with the deputies.  One night, international [[drug lord]] and race car driver Gabriel Cortez makes a daring escape from [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] custody in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and speeds off in a modified [[Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1]], taking Agent Ellen Richards as his hostage as he races southbound toward [[Mexico]] at speeds over 200&nbsp;mph. Agent John Bannister has a blockade set up in [[Bullhead City, Arizona]], but Cortez's men mow down the police officers on site and clear the road for him to continue his getaway. Cortez also uses his extraordinary driving skills to immobilize two [[SWAT]] vehicles headed toward Summerton Junction. Before flying to Arizona, Agent Bannister has his team do a financial background check on all agents involved to find out how Cortez managed to escape so easily.  Sometime past 4:30 in the morning, Owens dispatches deputies Jerry Bailey and Sarah Torrance to visit the residence of the local farmer Parsons, who has suddenly missed his usual milk delivery at the diner. After discovering that Parsons has been murdered, the deputies follow a trail of tire tracks that lead them to Cortez's henchman Thomas Burrell and his mercenary cutthroats, who are planting a mobile assault bridge across the canyon that marks the U.S./Mexico border. Bailey is fatally shot in the middle of a shootout between the deputies and the thugs before Owens rushes in to bring his officers back to his precinct. Shortly after being notified by Agent Bannister of Cortez's presence, Owens gathers Torrance and senior Deputy Mike "Figgy" Figuerola. He also deputizes jailed local Frank Martinez, a former US Marine who is a veteran of the [[Iraq War]] with [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]] who developed a streak of never finishing what he started; because Bailey was his friend, Martinez insists that he will not falter. Finally, Owens recruits Dinkum to protect their town. Dinkum agrees only if he becomes a deputy and if he keeps the gun Owens had confiscated earlier.  At 7:10 a.m., Owens and his deputies, equipped with weapons from Dinkum's private museum, have the town's main road barricaded with cars when Burrell and his men arrive, prompting a lengthy firefight. Armed with a [[Thompson submachine gun|Tommy gun]], Figuerola holds off the thugs before being injured by a sniper. Owens and Dinkum mow down a majority of the thugs with a [[Vickers machine gun]] mounted on the back of a school bus with Martinez providing cover fire, while Torrance snipes several gunmen on the rooftops. After Owens kills Burrell, Cortez's Corvette eventually arrives in town, veering past the barricade as Owens and the deputies shoot it. Cortez ejects Agent Richards from the car before speeding through a corn field. Suddenly, he encounters the mayor's Camaro commandeered by Owens before both cars collide with a [[swather]]. A dazed Cortez continues his escape on foot, but Owens meets him at the bridge. Owens ignores Cortez's bribe offers before both men fight each other. Despite sustaining slashes and stab wounds from Cortez's [[push dagger]], Owens defeats the drug lord and handcuffs him before dragging him back into town using the battered and now roofless Camaro. Agent Bannister arrives to take Cortez back into custody and arrests Agent Richards for taking the drug lord's bribe and aiding in his escape. Deputies Figuerola and Dinkum are taken to the hospital to be treated for their wounds. Martinez turns in the deputy's badge, Bailey's badge, that Owens had given him earlier. Owens tells him to keep it, as he's earned it. As the mayor sees what is left of his Camaro, Owens warns him about parking in the fire lane before he, Torrance and Martinez walk into the diner.

Billy is a successful entrepreneur in [[Malibu, California]], who lives with his 31-year-old girlfriend Lisa. Shortly after proposing to Lisa, Billy finds an old bottle of [[Scotch whisky|scotch]] he and his friends stole in their childhood days and calls Sam and Archie, who immediately propose a [[bachelor party]] for Billy in [[Las Vegas]] before his wedding that weekend. After being given permission by Miriam to cheat on her, Sam collects Archie and Paddy and fly off to rendezvous with Billy in Vegas.  Arriving in Vegas, Billy and Paddy get into a heated argument about Billy's failure to attend Sophie's funeral. They head to [[Binion's Gambling Hall and Hotel]] to check in, only to realize that the hotel is closed for renovations. They agree to try the [[Aria Resort and Casino]], where the wedding will be held. Before leaving Binion's they are attracted to the lounge by the singing voice of Diana, who is immediately charmed by their appreciation of her singing. The five share a drink, and they convince Diana to join them at The Aria.  While waiting to get rooms, Archie goes to a blackjack table and has a brief altercation with a cocky gambler named Dean. Archie buys chips with $15,000 (half of his pension funds), planning to enjoy his escape from medical worries. When Paddy and Sam return, they find that Archie is up to $102,000, and they quickly leave the table in fear of being accused of card counting. Meanwhile, as Billy tours the [[wedding chapel]] with Diana, he becomes charmed with her as she explains to him that she moved to Vegas because she was recently laid off as a tax attorney in Atlanta and always wanted to sing despite being a divorced empty nester.  The quartet later become judges of a wild [[swimsuit competition]]. They are then confronted by the casino manager, who offers the group his largest [[penthouse suite]] for free, in hopes that Archie will stay and spend his winnings at the hotel. They are assigned Lonnie (who is disappointed because the original person staying in the room was going to be [[50 Cent]]) is their host/butler. Billy suggests they open the old bottle of scotch to celebrate the gang's reunion, but Paddy confronts him about his absence from Sophie's funeral and leaves the suite. That night, the remaining three go to the Aria's popular nightclub, where they accept the bouncer's suggestion that they earn immediate entrance by purchasing $1,800 [[bottle service]], using some of Archie's winnings. There, Billy and Sam talk with the bachelorette and her maid-of-honor from a [[bachelorette party]] while Archie goes dancing. Dean comes by and begins groping the bachelorette and is confronted by Archie, Billy and Sam. Dean attempts to throw a punch at Billy but is knocked down by Paddy, who stopped by to give Archie his [[cell phone]] due to several missed calls from his son Ezra.  The next day, while the others are hungover and recovering, Paddy visits Diana and tells her that he and Billy were both in love with Sophie when they were younger and she picked Paddy. Diana catches his eye while she tries to convince him to stop grieving and move on with life because Sophie would want it. Afterwards, Paddy joins Billy at their pool cabana and admits he needs to move on from Sophie's passing while also showing concern for Billy about marrying a younger woman. Sam and Archie join in and decide to throw a big bachelor party for Billy in their suite that night. Lonnie brings Dean to the cabana to apologize for his behavior, having convinced him that the quartet are mafia members from the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] called "The Flatbush Four." Dean, fearing for his life, agrees to become their errand boy for the day. With Lonnie and Dean's help, they prepare for the party and invite several people including the bachelorette group from the nightclub, exotic dancers, a band of transvestite entertainers, and cast members of ''[[Zarkana]]''.  While the others prepare his party, Billy visits Diana. She admits that she is fond of him, and asks if he truly loves Lisa. As they walk along The Strip, Billy tells Diana that Paddy gave Sophie an ultimatum to choose either Billy or him and she secretly chose Billy first, but Billy told Sophie that she was meant to be with Paddy.  The bachelor party goes into full force as Paddy gets ready to be social again, finally removing his [[wedding ring]]. Sam meets the maid of honor from the night before, who begins flirting with him to his delight. Archie dances with the bachelorette, strippers, transvestites, then gives advice to Dean on how he, too, can meet women properly. Archie is surprised by a worried Ezra, who tracked Archie's cell phone. Archie convinces him to calm down and enjoy this chance for some special father-son time. Sam and the maid of honor head upstairs to be alone, where he encourages and enjoys her seductive ways but eventually turns down sex, realizing that he tells Miriam about all the wonderful things that happen in his life, and telling her about this soon-to-be wonderful moment would devastate her.  Paddy tells Billy he invited Diana to the party because he likes her and wants to start anew after Sophie's passing, but realizes Billy likes her too. When Diana arrives, Billy pushes Paddy into the decorative pool in the suite and takes Diana upstairs to tell her that Paddy likes her and to give him a chance. She states that she feels like she is being treated like Sophie and "gifted" by Billy to Paddy, which Paddy overhears. Paddy is devastated to learn about Sophie's choice and throws the old bottle of scotch in the trash as he leaves the party.

As Lisa and her bridesmaids arrive, Paddy pushes Billy into the pool and tells Lisa that Billy is calling off the wedding. Billy and Lisa talk it out and Lisa leaves with her bridesmaids. As the guys pack up to leave, Billy comes to terms with his age and admits his fear of getting old and being alone. They come together as friends again and tell Billy to go see Diana. Billy shows up at the lounge where Diana is singing and reveals his feelings for her. The guys say their goodbyes to Dean and Lonnie and finally decide to crack open the old bottle of scotch for a final toast..

After spending a few months at the insightful and caring therapist Frank's ([[Muse Watson]]) home for girls in [[New Orleans]] and settling in as a [[chambermaid]] at a hotel under the supervision of her boss Beverly (Diva Tyler), Nell's condition seems to have improved and she no longer has "bad dreams". Nell and her group of friends Gwen ([[Julia Garner]]), Daphne (Erica Michelle), and Monique (Sharice Angelle Williams) attend a [[Mardi Gras]] parade; Nell witnesses many strange happenings there, including masked men watching her. Her personality changes as things get darker. She begins to get hints that the demon [[Abalam]] is back.  When Stephanie (Raeden Greer), one of the girls at the house, dies of an unnatural seizure, Cecile (Tarra Riggs), Nell's former nurse, informs her of the Order of the Right Hand, a secret society which has been monitoring Nell. Nell's friends Gwen, Daphne, Monique, and Michelle (Ashlynn Ross) discover a video on [[YouTube]] which depicts the events from the [[The Last Exorcism|previous film]] revealing that the lost footage has been discovered; this frightens and angers Nell as she becomes a reluctant internet celebrity because of the video. Chris ([[Spencer Treat Clark]]), another worker at the hotel who likes Nell, slits his own throat after viewing a clip from the same footage which depicts Nell lying about how she got pregnant. Cecile seeks help from the Order of the Right Hand, and Nell is introduced to Calder (David Jensen) and Jeffrey (E. Roger Mitchell). They attempt to rid the demon which is "in love" with Nell by transferring it into the body of a sacrificed chicken. The supernatural force in Nell proves to be too powerful, and Calder is forced to kill her by injecting her with a lethal dose of morphine.  The demon appears in front of Nell, taking her appearance as a doppelganger, her father, and Chris, and begs her to accept its hand. Nell's pulse stops temporarily and leads Calder, Jeffrey, and Cecile, to believe that she has died. She finally gives in and grabs the demon's hand; the house is left to burn with the three secret society members being killed. Nell murders Frank and burns the home for girls, leaving her friends to die. Nell gets inside a car and the prophecy of the end of times is proven to be correct as she sets multiple buildings and vehicles aflame whilst driving past them.  
The Last Days on Mars
 In the 2040s, a [[Mars|Martian]] research base, Tantalus Base outpost, is created. The eight person crew, who have been stationed there for six months, are only nineteen hours from the completion of their research mission. The spacecraft ''Aurora'' is inbound from Earth and will collect the team by lander. Mars scientist Marko Petrović has found samples that may point to life on the planet. Without revealing his discovery, he devises a ruse for a last sojourn on the surface. Crewmate Richard Harrington drives Petrović in a solar powered rover to the spot where he had found the sample. After he obtains soil with the biological agent present, a fissure swallows Petrović.  Captain Charles Brunel and crewmate Lauren Dalby plan to explore the pit to retrieve Petrović's body. Dalby remains at the pit but disappears before the team can return with equipment. Brunel authorizes Vincent Campbell to explore the pit and he finds a fungus-like life that grows in the fissure. Dalby and Petrović reappear at the main outpost, but the Martian bacteria has mutated them into fast, aggressive, [[zombie]]-like creatures with blackened skin and no trace of their original personalities. Harrington dies from a power drill attack by one of the zombies and later revives as one himself. The remaining crew hold off the zombies while Brunel and Campbell return. Brunel is also fatally injured and reanimates, which provides the crew with new insight into the symptoms: thirst, memory loss and aggression.  Eventually, after several fights and escapes from the zombies through the habitat modules, mission psychologist Robert Irwin deserts scientist Kim Aldrich, who had often infuriated her crewmates. Rebecca Lane is also stabbed in the leg during the frantic escape to a rover. With their rover's power low, the survivors – Campbell, Irwin and Lane – decide they must get to the other rover, which is still at the site of the fissure. Under the pretense of a scouting operation, Irwin steals the second rover and unsuccessfully attempts to persuade Campbell to abandon Lane, who he states is infected. Irwin meanwhile conceals evidence of his possible infection.  While Campbell and Lane wait for the sun to rise and the solar powered batteries to recharge, they discuss the nature of the zombies and Lane questions whether any human consciousness remains trapped in them. Campbell attempts to comfort her and falls asleep. When he wakes up alone, Campbell realizes that Lane has fled into the desert and he chases her. Lane, who knows she is likely to turn, fails to deter Campbell from following her and in desperation, commits suicide by removing her helmet. After she dies, Lane reanimates and begs Campbell to destroy her. Campbell reluctantly complies by bashing her head in with a rock.  Campbell and Irwin separately converge on the ''Aurora'' lander, where the reanimated Aldrich kills the lander's crew. The other zombies appear desiccated and inert. An obviously infected Irwin initiates a launch, which takes him and Campbell into orbit. Campbell stuns Irwin and ejects the body and virulent blood droplets into the vacuum of space. In a message to mission control, Campbell says he does not have enough fuel for a rendezvous but supplies aboard can last for months if they want to launch a rescue. He tells them that this may not be advisable as he may be infected; if so he has just enough fuel for re-entry and a fast death. Campbell concludes that it will take 15 minutes for the transmission to be received and will be awaiting their reply. He subsequently ends the communication, still floating alone in space.  
Last Passenger
 Lewis Shaler (Dougray Scott) is a doctor and widower heading home with his young son Max (Joshua Kaynama) on a late-night train from London heading to . Max accidentally causes fellow passenger Sarah Barwell (Kara Tointon) to spill coffee on her coat, prompting Shaler to apologize to Barwell. The interaction is the beginning of a romantic connection between the two.  Later, while the train is stationary, Shaler notices an unidentifiable man wearing a high-visibility jacket tampering with the train's brakes. As the train begins to move again he sees another man crawling across the tracks. On investigation, Shaler discovers the conductor has vanished.  Soon after, as the train approaches Shaler's home station, Barwell kisses Shaler and asks him to call her, however Shaler is distracted by the train bypassing his stop. Shaler tries to contact the driver on the intercom, but the driver only speaks to ask how many passengers are left on board. Shaler and fellow passenger Peter Carmichael pull numerous emergency brake cords to no effect. It dawns on Shaler and Carmichael that the driver intends to kill himself and his passengers and, along with fellow passenger Klimowski (who Carmichael originally suspected of involvement), attempt unsuccessfully to stop the train using the rear hand brake.  After the train continues past , the train collides with a vehicle at a level crossing as the train is traveling too fast to activate the gates and lights. It kills all the occupants inside the vehicle instantly and fiercely jolts the passengers. The crash also causes one of the six remaining passengers to suffer a heart attack, and Shaler is unable to revive her. Klimowski and Shaler then work together in an attempt to break into the driver’s compartment using a fire extinguisher as battering ram, but their efforts are unsuccessful due to the reinforced door.  Klimowski attempts to decouple the train carriages by climbing outside, but this dangerous gambit is cut short by an approaching single-track tunnel. Shaler saves Klimowski by pulling him back on board a moment before the open door's impact with the tunnel. It transpires that the police have laid an ineffective blockade in the tunnel which only momentarily stops the train, and none of the passengers can open the doors due to the narrowness of the tunnel.  Suspecting that they are now close to a destructive collision with the Hastings station buffers, Shaler creates an improvised explosive using the last remaining fire extinguisher. The explosion causes enough damage for Shaler, with help of Carmichael, to de-couple the carriages, however Carmichael falls through the gap in the carriages and is killed instantly. The burning carriages separate as they speed through a suburban station where police officers watch helplessly as the train rushes through with the end car trailing not too far behind. Shaler is left on the front car whilst, Klimowski and Barwell attempt to stop their own carriage with the hand brake at the rear. With the train continuing to burn around him, Shaler takes a moment to compose himself, before running and leaping from the carriage as it explodes, dislodging the driver's hand from the dead man's switch (and probably killing him) immediately engaging the brakes. The front carriage of the train finally screeches to a stop just in front of the camera and shows the headlight going off for good.  Shaler is discovered alive and conscious by Barwell, Max and Klimowski while a helicopter circles over the burning wreckage of the train in the distance. The identity of the driver and his motivations for committing a murder-suicide are left unknown.  
Left Right Left (film)
  The story revolves around P.K. Jayan aka 'Vattu' ('mad') Jayan ([[Indrajith Sukumaran|Indrajith]]), Roy Joseph aka Che Guevera Roy ([[Murali Gopy]]) and Kaitheri Sahadevan ([[Hareesh Peradi]]). Jayan is a corrupt policeman, Roy a communist who now teaches in a school with his wife and Sahadevan a megalo-maniacal communist leader. When Roy and two of his friends expose Sahadevan's corruption, the two friends are mysteriously murdered; Roy is spared, purportedly because of Sahadevan's respect for Roy's father. After Roy dies of a medical condition, Jayan discovers the story of this old friendship. Sahadevan and Roy had once worked together, before Roy's idealism and Sahadevan's use of violence and trickery soured their relationship. In one scene, Sahadevan tells Roy about his painful childhood, claiming that his actions are aimed at ensuring that his children do not suffer as his ancestors did. Jayan finally discovers that Sahadevan had once hired goons to attack Roy, maiming him for life and leading to his death. In his anger, he attacks and stabs Sahadevan.  
The Legend of Sarila
  The young orphan Markussi lives with his little sister Mipoulok in an Inuit clan. Markussi can talk to animals and has some special powers unique to shamans. He does not want to be a shaman though and mainly keeps his powers a secret because he fears being a shaman would make him like the clan's shaman Croolik. Croolik grew selfish and unjust after the deaths of his sons, who died along with Markussi's father in an accident on a hunting trip. Croolik blames his sons' deaths on his now-separated wife Saya (whom he accuses of having let their sons go hunting at too young an age) and Markussi's father; by extension, Croolik also hates Markussi.  At the beginning of the film, Croolik secretly turns away from the goddess [[Sedna (mythology)|Sedna]] and tries to call on the spirit of darkness. In punishment, Sedna takes all animals away from the clan's lands, provoking a dangerous food shortage and lack of tradable pelts.  Desperate, the clan decides to search for Sarila, a legendary land where animals are said to be plenty. Under Croolik's influence—who intends Markussi to die on the quest—three young Inuit are selected: Markussi, along with his two friends, Putulik (son of the clan chief), and Apik, who were promised to each other when they were children. Saya, who now lives on her own as a healer, offers to take care of Markussi's young sister and her dog Kajuk in his absence.  The three friends leave the clan with sled dogs and Apik's pet lemming Kimi. On their quest, they face several dangers, repeatedly brought on by Croolik through magic; this includes possessing Putulik by means of twin amulets (called "medallions"), so that Putulik attacks Markussi. The three young travellers can overcome all dangers, repeatedly saved by Markussi's powers. In the meantime, Croolik frames his former wife Saya for stealing food from the clan and has her banned from the clan.  Eventually the three friends reach Sarila, a warm place full of life, where they can quickly hunt the much-needed food for the clan. Besides, Apik realizes she loves Markussi, who had already shown affection for her before. Markussi is told by Sedna that he has passed all tests, but needs to do one "small thing" for her upon return to the clan, for the animals to be released; when asking what she requires, she only responds that "a true shaman knows what to do" and to "do what you must." Briefly afterwards, Putulik is again possessed by Croolik and tries to kill Markussi, but the lemming Kimi realizes the role of Putulik's amulet and rips it off, freeing Putulik.  Upon return to the clan, Apik tells that she wants to marry Markussi, and her parents consent. Putulik had already agreed earlier. He now wishes to travel and learn more about others' ways before becoming the clan's chief one day.  Croolik is enraged that Markussi is still alive and challenges him. Markussi accepts the magical fight, understanding that this is Sedna's last wish and thereby proving himself a true shaman. Croolik is defeated and, dying, confesses that he framed Saya and asks for her forgiveness.  On behalf of the clan, Markussi formally asks Sedna for forgiveness, and she lets the animals return. Croolik's crow offers his services to Markussi. When he declines, the crow flies away; in the last shot it is seen carrying one of the twin amulets, which lights up in the same way as it did when Putulik was possessed.

Legend № 17
 The picture begins set in 1956 with children's experiences during the [[Running of the Bulls]] in Spain where Kharlamov's mother originally was from. Then the action is transferred to Moscow in 1967, where the young hockey player gets acquainted with the famous trainer [[Anatoli Tarasov]], who sends Valeri along with his friend [[Alexander Gusev (ice hockey)|Alexander Gusev]] to the city of [[Chebarkul]], [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]], where they will play for the local "Zvezda" team. Having overcome the difficulties of adaptation in the lower league team, Valeri displays effective hockey skills and returns to Moscow at the end of the season where Tarasov invites him to join [[HC CSKA Moscow]], but at first Anatoli tests Kharlamov's character and his ability to dedicate his life to hockey.  Kharlamov passes all of Tarasov's trials and gradually becomes one of the leading attackers of CSKA, and then the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|USSR national team]]. The trainer constructs an attack trio of Mikhailov-Petrov-Kharlamov. At the same time  intrigues are waged around Tarasov by the curator of hockey from the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], Eduard Balashov, whose son the coach once expelled from the team. Balashov tries to drag Kharlamov to his side, stressing Tarasov's excessive rigidity, but the hockey player refuses to sign any papers against his coach (Kharlamov later tells Tarasov everything but Anatoli responds that he already knew everything).  Against the background of the development of Kharlamov's hockey career, the story of his acquaintance and love with Irina Smirnova is shown, who tries to support the hockey player in difficult moments.  After the scandalous match between the USSR national team and [[HC Spartak Moscow]], when Tarasov led the team away from the ice in a protest against refereeing, the upset Kharlamov gets into a car accident and seriously injures his leg (in the film this biographical episode of the hockey player was shifted to be four years earlier). After the operation Valeri begins to exercise his leg in order to return to the ice as soon as possible since the first [[Summit Series]] in history between the USSR national team and the Canadian professionals is scheduled for 1972. Overcoming his injuries Kharlamov begins to train, and the new coach of the national team [[Vsevolod Bobrov]], appointed instead of Tarasov, includes Valeri in the team that flies to play in Canada. Tarasov comes to escort the team to the airport and says parting words to Kharlamov.  The Soviet hockey players arrive in Montreal. The Canadians are confident in the victory of their team and are trying in every possible way to prove this to the USSR: at a press conference a Canadian journalist says that he will eat the evening edition of his newspaper if the Soviet team wins, and on a television show two leaders of the Canadian national team, [[Phil Esposito]] and [[Bobby Clarke]], hint that the Soviet team has no chance of victory. In conclusion, before the match a newspaper is slid under the door of Bobrov's room with a caricature depicting the Soviet hockey players as "snotty" pupils who learn to play hockey with the Canadian "teacher".  The match begins. The Canadians win the first face-off and in half a minute open the score. At the sixth minute the score is 2:0. But soon the USSR team makes the score even, and in the second period, Kharlamov leads the team ahead 2:3. Valeri stickhandles through several opponents and scores his second goal. After this goal all spectators give a standing ovation to Kharlamov. During the intermission, the Canadian coach tells his players that this is not a match, but a war, and instructed Bobby Clark to deal with the  "Number Seventeen". During the game Bobby Clark slashes Kharlamov's previously injured knee with a [[Hockey stick|stick]]. However, Valeri refuses to leave the game despite danger of aggravating his injury and ending his hockey career, and returns to the ice. At the end of the match, Valeri rushes with the puck towards the Canadians' goal, aggravates his injury and falls down, but while sliding in prone position, passes the puck to one of this teammates who scores the seventh goal for the Soviet team. After the match Phil Esposito tells Kharlamov that he is impressed by his game, speed, and the two goals.  The USSR squad scores several more goals with Kharlamov's active participation and wins with a crushing score 7:3.

Legends of Oz: Dorothy's Return
 In the [[Land of Oz]], the [[Emerald City]]'s co-leaders – the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], [[Tin Woodman]], and the [[Cowardly Lion]] – discover that an evil [[Jester]] has stolen the [[broomstick]] of his sister, the late [[Wicked Witch of the West]], and taken control over the [[Winged monkeys|Flying Monkeys]]. With Oz's future at stake, the Scarecrow decides to use his invention called the Rainbow Mover to summon [[Dorothy Gale]] to save the kingdom again. However, flying monkeys invade the castle and force the trio out the window.  In [[Kansas]], Dorothy's farm has been wrecked by a [[tornado]], leaving it in disrepair. A sleazy man claiming to be a government [[appraiser]] arrives and condemns the farmhouse, handing the Gales an eviction notice. Dorothy discovers people all across town have been handed the same notices and are moving on. Dorothy and [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] encounter a [[rainbow]] which transports them to Oz, but not to the Emerald City as intended.  Dorothy meets Wiser, an [[Obesity|overweight]] but intelligent [[owl]] who [[Flightless bird|cannot fly]]. They enter Candy Country, where everything is made out of [[confectionery]], including the people. They are promptly arrested by Marshal Mallow for breaking the "no eating anything made of candy" rule due to the Jester tampering with the signs, and are taken to court. Upon realizing who Dorothy is, the [[judge]] drops the charges and releases her and Wiser. Mallow joins the group on their way to the Emerald City as a promise he made to find the missing General Candy Apple. Meanwhile, [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] confronts the Jester, who has used a magic scepter created from his sister's broomstick and crystal ball to turn Oz's leaders, including General Candy Apple, into subservient [[marionette]]s. Glinda falls victim to this as well, giving him complete control of Oz.  Dorothy's company enter the Dainty China Country and require permission from the vain China Princess to pass through her kingdom. With Mallow posing as a suitor, the group enter the China Princess' castle and see her rejecting potential suitors, but she is enchanted by Mallow's singing. An [[earthquake]] caused by the Jester damages the land. An angry China Princess blames Dorothy for the Jester's torment, but agrees to allow her group to pass through on the condition that she accompanies them. Finding a bridge to the Emerald City destroyed, the group decide to construct a boat. All the talking trees refuse to cooperate except for an aging tree named Tugg, who is carved into a galleon. They sail into the Emerald City, finding it abandoned, only to be attacked by the Flying Monkeys. Dorothy's group escapes into a cave system but tumbles down a waterfall.  The China Princess is shattered by the fall and presumed dead, prompting Dorothy to head for the Jester's palace alone. Mallow mourns for the princess before discovering she is alive and fixing her. Mustering his confidence and strength, Wiser manages to fly off to aid Dorothy. Dorothy and Toto confront the Jester, who plans to kill her, only for Toto to drop a curtain on his head, with the lead Flying Monkey named "You" stealing the Jester's staff to regrow its wings after the latter shrunk them. As the Jester gives chase, Dorothy reunites with her captured friends, and they confront the Jester on the rooftop. Dorothy falls off the roof in the ensuing fight for the staff, but is caught by Wiser.  The rest of Dorothy's friends arrive with Tugg built on wheels, engaging the Flying Monkeys in battle. The Jester tries to rid himself of Dorothy by summoning a tornado, but Dorothy's own magic breaks the spell damaging Oz, freeing its leaders. The Jester is nearly sucked into the tornado, but is saved by Dorothy. However, when she casts the staff into the tornado, the Jester jumps in after it and vanishes. Glinda appears and sends Dorothy and Toto home.  Reuniting with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, Dorothy rallies the townsfolk to stand up for their homes, discovering the appraiser is a [[Confidence trick|con artist]] using multiple fake licenses to commit crimes. He is arrested by the [[sheriff]] while his lackey runs off, and Dorothy and her town's homes are rebuilt.  
Lego Batman: The Movie – DC Super Heroes Unite
 [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Lex Luthor]] are both nominated for the Man of the Year award, and Wayne wins. As he is making his speech, the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] breaks in with the [[Riddler]], [[Harley Quinn]], the [[The Penguin (comics)|Penguin]], [[Two-Face]] and [[Catwoman]], and steals the award, as well as money and gems. [[Batman]] arrives and stops everyone except the Joker, who escapes on his boat, but [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]'s helicopter picks up Batman. When the rope holding Batman is broken, he calls in the Batwing and defeats the Joker. Meanwhile, Luthor is running for president, but his poll figures are terrible. He learns that the Joker knows how to produce more [[Kryptonite]], and can make a gas that makes people love him, which will help Luthor win the election and defeat [[Superman]]. He breaks the Joker out of [[Arkham Asylum]] and promises him the use of Luthor's De-Constructor weapon to defeat Batman by dismantling all his gadgets and vehicles.  And as they leave, Joker uses the De-Constructor to break Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, the Penguin, Two-Face, Bane, Catwoman, and the Riddler out. While the Joker is "chemical shopping" at Ace Chemicals (much to Luthor's annoyance), Batman is arriving at Arkham. As the villains escape on their vehicles, Robin takes down Catwoman while Batman goes after Two Face's car, with the Riddler and Harley in tow; while they leave Bane, Poison Ivy, and the Penguin because Bane's vehicle was too slow. Batman beats Two Face by stealing his coin, so he does not know which direction to turn and crashes, then follows Bane's mole vehicle underground, where he takes control and crashes them into a wall.  Batman and Robin put them back into prison, then investigate the breakout, which leads them to Ace Chemical Plant, booby-trapped by the Joker after a visit to gather materials for the gas and Kryptonite. Superman rescues the Dynamic Duo, but Batman is rude to him (concerned he might go rogue some day) and he leaves. Batman also does not want help from Superman, much to Robin's dismay. Batman traces Luthor's mobile lab and snatches the manufactured Kryptonite, but the [[Batmobile]] is deconstructed. At the [[Batcave]], he determines the new Kryptonite is harmless, but it proves to be a tracking device which leads the Joker and Luthor to the cave—Batman has a Kryptonite Vault which the Joker knew about. Using explosive pies, the villains destroy the cave, escaping with a load of Kryptonite, while the heroes are saved by Superman.  The next day, election day, Superman and Batman visit the [[LexCorp]] building, and are attacked by Luthor in a giant Kryptonite-powered Joker robot. The villains describe their plan to the heroes as they defeat them, and then leave. However, Batman and Superman had switched costumes to learn Luthor and the Joker's plan. The two then switch back costumes and chase down the robot, but fail; since the Kryptonite drained Superman's powers and Batman doesn't have a vehicle, the two are forced to take a bus to City Hall. Later, outside City Hall, Luthor makes a speech in front of a huge crowd and then has the Joker use the Joker robot to spray the crowd with Joker Gas. Luthor then finds out that the Joker Gas has caused the crowd to start cheering for Joker to be president and realizes that the Joker tricked him. The Joker's handiwork is visible from space, alerting [[The Justice League]], who arrive to help Batman, Robin, and Superman.  After a prolonged battle, the League traps the Joker robot. [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and Batman open up the robot's chest with explosions, and the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] loads the Kryptonite into [[Wonder Woman]]'s invisible jet, which shuts down the robot. The Joker and Luthor are arrested and [[Commissioner Gordon]] congratulates the Justice League for their victory. Robin asks Wonder Woman where the Kryptonite is and she tells him it is in a safe place if Superman goes rogue. Cyborg offers help rebuilding the Batcave. Batman at first refuses, but Robin convinces him to admit they need 'a little' help. As Superman starts to get excited at the thought that Batman is asking him for help, Batman corrects him and says he was asking [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern]] for help. Green Lantern then fires a bright green light into space to celebrate their victory.  From his ship deep in space, [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] spots the green light and realizes that he just found the green energy.  
LFO (film)
 Robert Nord, an awkward man, spends most of his time playing with his synthesizers in his basement.  After he has an argument with his wife Clara, whom he suspects is cheating on him, he returns to the basement again, to her annoyance.  There, over the Internet, he discusses with several of his friends his belief that he has what he calls a "sound allergy" to the music that his wife enjoys.  He proposes that a certain frequency could act as the opposite of this allergy and give him the peace that he desires.  With the help of Sinus-San, one of his friends from the Internet, he makes a breakthrough, though he hides the extent of his success.  When Simon and Linn move next door to him, he resolves to experiment on them over the objections of his wife.  Robert invites over his new neighbors.  Before he leaves to get the coffee, he casually mentions that his family was killed in a car crash.  Uncomfortable with the awkwardness of the conversation, Simon tells Clara that he intends to leave.  However, when Robert returns, he plays a hypnotic frequency that compels them to obey his commands.  He orders Simon to perform menial tasks and Linn to have sex with him.  When Clara calls him pathetic, he defends his actions as being necessary to test the extent of his control.  Eventually, it is revealed that Clara and his son, Sebastian, died when Robert sabotaged the family car.  Clara chides him to take his antipsychotic medicine, pointing out that she is a hallucination, but Robert refuses.  Instead, he forces Simon and Linn to take the place of his dead family members.  After several weeks of servitude at his house, his neighbors are reported missing, and the police show up at Robert's house to ask him if he has seen them.  Robert panics and hypnotizes the police into leaving his house.  Unsatisfied with his fake family, he releases Simon and Linn, though he monitors their life using security devices.  When Linn accidentally discovers through the security device that Simon has been cheating on her, Robert hypnotizes them into accepting him as their marriage counselor.  Robert again forces Linn to have sex with him, and he forces Simon to passively watch as punishment for cheating on her.  When he tires of this, he again releases them from his control and amuses himself with mean-spirited pranks on his other neighbors.  Clara urges him to find a more meaningful life.  Over time, the car manufacturer and police become interested in Robert's involvement in the deaths of his wife and son.  Sinus-San, who has been investigating Robert, threatens to go to the police unless Robert shares his invention.  Robert hypnotizes Sinus-San and a representative of the car manufacturer, but the case against him continues.  Frustrated with both the state of the world and his inability to be left in peace, Robert decides to broaden his experiment.  He first compels Simon and Linn to form a rock band with him, but he abandons that idea when their songs turn out amateurish.  Robert then asks Simon and Linn for advice, and they describe their vision of a utopian society.  Intrigued by their protestations that he should not play God, Robert asks them to define God.  Armed with their conception of a benevolent deity, Robert hypnotizes himself to emulate those qualities.  Robert practices learning various foreign languages, and a series of voice-overs report that he has attained increasingly more prestigious positions in society, ultimately rising to the position of ruler of a unified Earth.  At first, he forces through sweeping changes to society, but his message becomes increasingly pessimistic and [[antihumanism|antihumanist]] until he commands the entire human race to commit mass suicide.  
The Liability
 Young and naive 19-year-old [[slacker]], Adam ([[Jack O'Connell (actor)|Jack O'Connell]]), lives with his mum, Nicky ([[Kierston Wareing]]), in the home of her intimidating gangster boyfriend, Peter ([[Peter Mullan]]) and is sent to conduct a day of driving for Peter's associate after Adam inadvertently views an incriminating video on Peter's laptop. This takes Adam on the road with aging [[hitman]], Roy ([[Tim Roth]]), as he enters a world of murder for 24 hours. Roy tries to force him to kill a mysterious girl ([[Talulah Riley]]) in a forest, but he refrains from doing so, giving her the chance to escape and drive away in their vehicle.   Not pleased, Roy uses Adam to hitchhike and they steal a van from an elderly couple. They call the girl on Adam's phone that was left in the car she took, striking a deal to give her £7000 in return for the bag of evidence that was left in the vehicle, even though Roy doesn't actually have the entire amount. Roy robs a diner to make up the rest. He holds the diner employees at gunpoint and uses them as hostages to make sure the deal goes through.   Having redeemed the bag, Roy and Adam plan to switch automobiles and dispose of the evidence. However, Roy knocks Adam unconscious at a quiet roadside area. Before Roy can kill and dismember his body, the girl, who followed them, runs over Roy and kidnaps Adam.  Retreating to a factory, the girl ties Adam to a rail upstairs. Roy finds his way there and confronts her. She claims her sister was sold in a line of [[sex trafficking]], starting with Peter and ending up last with Roy, and she begins a fight with him. Adam manages to free one of his hands and retrieve Roy's fallen gun. Regaining his memory, Adam realizes Roy attempted to kill him. Irritated, he fires shots off, injuring Roy as the girl flees. Roy pleads with him to stop shooting and tells Adam he was given orders to kill him but no reason, with Adam's death meant to be part of "the job" all along. Adam realizes it must be because he saw the video incriminating Peter of sex-trafficking.  They leave the factory, finding out the girl left behind the car, money and other belongings she had taken. Adam drives Roy in their stolen van to a church for Roy's daughter's wedding. During the ride, Roy reveals he spared Adam's life because of his innocence and tells him he has a second chance at life while Peter believes he's dead. After dropping off Roy at the church, where his fate is left ambiguous, Adam takes the van away to set fire to it and destroy any evidence linking them to the murders done in their travels, but keeps the gun.   Adam returns home, confronting Peter with the gun and alerting his mum Nicky to his double-crossing ways. Adam attacks Peter, who gets a hold of the gun, Peter knocks out Adam's mum and drags him out to the parking lot. There, the girl shows up and shoots Peter for what he did to her sister. Peter starts to strangle her until she stabs and kills him.   To end the film, the girl mounts her pick up truck, opens the passenger door and invites in this way a bewildered Adam.

 Mu-young ([[Kwon Hyun-sang]]) is a 4th-year film student and convenience store clerk. A know-it-all who is quick to pick apart and ridicule the work of others, he is endlessly complaining about the state of the Korean film industry and showing off his vast knowledge of cinema.

Afterwards, a firestorm of international protests from Great Britain and Canada ensued. Ultimately, no one was ever identified or prosecuted for the murders. This new documentary examines the root cause of a small, rural Midwestern town in anarchy; not only due to the Reno Gang's crimes, but the secret formation of the [[Jackson County, Indiana|Jackson County]] [[Vigilance Committee]] otherwise known as the Masked Halters or the Red Mask Society.  
Lego Marvel Super Heroes: Maximum Overload
 The mischievous [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] challenges the Marvel Super Heroes yet again. But this time, he's cast a snowball-themed spell that has Norn Frost in it to "Overload" various villains.  At a secret [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] base in [[New Jersey]], [[Doctor Octopus]] raids it in order to obtain the Beta Burst Missile. Using the Norn Frost obtained by his [[Chitauri]] minion, Loki "overloads" Doctor Octopus. In [[Manhattan]], [[Nick Fury]] calls upon [[Spider-Man]] to help defeat Doctor Octopus. Before Doctor Octopus can use the Beta Burst Missile on the trapped S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents, Spider-Man arrives and tricks Doctor Octopus into shocking himself on a nearby power generator. The next morning, Spider-Man brings a bound Doctor Octopus back to Manhattan in a truck upon running out of web fluid on the Garden State Parkway. Nick Fury takes Doctor Octopus to be locked up as Spider-Man is left walking back to [[Queens, New York]]. Loki is not pleased that his Doctor Octopus "Overload" was defeated and vows that it's not over.  Some time later, news articles are shown about the "Overloads" like the rise of the [[Red Skull]] "Overload," the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] "Overload" forming the [[Frightful Four|Frightful Sixteen]] which outnumbers the [[Fantastic Four]], and the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] "Overload." [[J. Jonah Jameson]] reports on the "Overloads" and claims that Spider-Man is behind this. Loki then uses the Norn Frost on [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] since he is a creature worth overloading. Appearing near the stand of the Hot Dog [[Vendor]], Venom is overloaded as Loki commands Venom to attack Spider-Man. Their fight takes them through the [[Daily Bugle]] much to the dismay of J. Jonah Jameson. Spider-Man manages to defeat Venom by getting one of Venom's tendrils into the [[Linotype machine]] where Venom ends up flattened onto a bunch of newspapers. Venom's body is taken away by Nick Fury, [[Captain America]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. As Spider-Man swings away from the Daily Bugle, J.

As Loki plans to overload Mandarin further, his Chitauri minion slips and causes the Norn Frosts to fall into the nearby crevices. Iron Man uses his left glove to knock Mandarin out of his helicopter as he is grabbed by [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] who takes Mandarin to the [[Helicarrier]]. Iron Man is then helped out of the rubble by his left glove before leaving with Pepper to eat out somewhere. Spider-Man suddenly finds himself at an offshore oil platform wondering how he got there.  While his Scrying Mirror is getting fixed by his Chitauri servants, Loki reaches out with his mind where he finds Iron Man and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] looking for [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]]. Loki finds Abomination on top of a passing airplane as he overloads Abomination. Upon Abomination breaking the airplane, Iron Man and Iron Fist rescue the passengers and land them safely on the offshore oil platform while [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] arrives to fight Abomination. With help from Iron Fist, Hulk knocks Abomination into the ocean. When Loki plans to overload Hulk to serve him, Hulk notices his floating eyes and punches it as Loki feels the pain while getting a black eye.  Loki declares that his plans are almost complete as his Chitauri minions sweep the floor. On the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, Wolverine, Captain America, and [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] do a roll-call on the captive supervillains Doctor Octopus, Venom, Abomination, Mandarin, Red Skull, and Wizard. Loki then commands the supervillains to arise as they all end up overloaded again while being ordered to hop. The constant hopping causes the Helicarrier to fall onto Tony Stark's rebuilt mansion. The supervillains then go on a rampage as Iron Man, Nick Fury, Black Widow, Captain America, Wolverine, and Hulk fight them. [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] arrives with Spider-Man upon finding him whining outside [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]]. Spider-Man claims that he was angsting. Upon taking down Doctor Octopus, Thor traces the Norn Frost back to Loki. Thor brings Iron Man and Spider-Man to Asgard to confront Loki while the others fight the supervillains.  Upon the Chitauri minions fixing the Scrying Mirror, Loki views it and sees Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man approaching his lair. Upon the arrival of Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man, Loki eats all the Norn Frost in the possession of one of his Chitauri minions and fights them. After throwing Spider-Man into a wall, Loki states to Iron Man and Thor that he is meddling in the affairs of Earth and take the throne of Asgard (Loki whispered that part which the Chitauri minion said out loud). Upon Loki slipping, Thor throws Mjolnir at Loki as he hangs over the crevasse. Thor then demands that Loki removes his enchantment and vow to never disturb the peace of Midgard under the threat of the hammer noogie. Loki surrenders where the Norn Frost's enchantment wears off enabling the supervillains to be defeated. Thor then plans to tell [[Odin (comics)|Odin]] what Loki was doing. Loki begs for Thor not to tell their father or to tell him that he was watching the Scrying Mirror since Odin took away his scrying privelages 3 centuries ago. After Thor, Iron Man, and Spider-Man leave, Loki changes the channel on the Scrying Mirror before Hulk can do another attack on him.  On the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, the supervillains are locked up as they plan their revenge. On the deck of the Helicarrier, it was mentioned that Iron Man's mansion has been repaired and the Helicarrier is back on the air. To get the angst out of Spider-Man, Nick Fury gives Spider-Man a S.H.I.E.L.D. Security Card and a Spider-Bike. As Spider-Man rides the web line off the Helicarrier, the superheroes celebrate their victory. As the Helicarrier takes off, the web line breaks causing Spider-Man and the Spider-Bike to fall.

His friend Billy connects him with a job at a local high school working as a janitor.  Eugene gets a visit from his former lieutenant Perry who is now prosperous and the man in charge. The lure to return to his former ways is strong. At the local high school, the students are unruly and dealing drugs in detention and scare off the detention monitor.  The principal Sheila King asks Eugene to fill in as detention monitor for a few minutes.  He proves to be unexpectedly persuasive at getting the students to sit down and follow the rules.  He is allowed to return as the detention monitor until a replacement can be found.  Eugene bets on a game of cards with a student and wins, the prize being that the students will learn to play chess.  Two of the students Tahime Sanders and Clifton are dealing drugs and contemplating armed robbery.  Eugene draws a parallel comparing Clifton to a pawn working for a king he calls refers to as "King Perry".  Clifton tells Perry that Eugene is running detention and preventing the sell of weed there, leading to reduced profits for Perry.  Tahime proves to be an excellent strategist on the Chess board.  Tahime invites another student (Peanut) in on the crimes they are engaged in.  The principal receives an anonymous tip (from Perry) that Eugene is an ex-con and she is forced to fire him.  Eugene visits Perry who offers him cash. Mean Gene does not accept the money and walks away.  Eugene attempts to restart the chess club by driving to the local hang out joint for the teenagers, but they refuse to play outside of detention.  Peanut changes his mind and goes with Eugene who makes him president of the chess club by giving him the wooden king piece.  Eugene rents a run down house in Washington D.C. for the chess club.  Clifton and Tahime come to the chess house to get Peanut and take him to rip off some dealers.  Peanut is shot and killed in the course of the robbery.  While Eugene goes to comfort Tahime the chess house is vandalized.  Tahime refuses to stay involved with Clifton. He comes back to the Chess house and returns the wooden king piece he got from Peanut's body.  The chess team regroups and restores the house and begins advertising via flyers around town and around the school.  Eugene convinces Tahime to compete in a chess tournament, but Tahime's mother refuses to sign the consent form. He forges her signature and enters the contest.  Tahime wins the tournament, however, the officials disqualify the team due to the forged signature and the lack of birth certificates for the students (despite Eugene saying some of the students don't have birth certificates "where we come from").  A local radio producer invites Eugene and Tahime to come on the air and present their argument.  Eugene presents his view that they didn't win, because they didn't play by the rules, and that is crucial in his view (learning the rules and winning within them).  Tahime is angered by this line of reasoning and storms off. While looking for Tahime, Eugene fails to accompany his daughter to get his son Marco, which leads to anger between them.  Tahime returns and wants to play in the Washington D.C. chess open tournament. He begins to study chess from a book and practice relentlessly.  Clifton is arrested and calls Perry from Prison, but is hung up on (illustrating his role as a pawn).  Tahime advances to the final match and faces one of the best players in the country, J. Thomas Gaines.  Tahime puts up a good fight but ultimately loses.  Nonetheless, Tahime gets a standing ovation from his supporters in the crowd.  A representative of the Urban League gives her card to Eugene, saying she wishes to help him go to college.  Gaines tells Tahime that "that was the first time I've been scared all year."

  In 1933, a boy named Will who idolizes the legendary [[Lone Ranger]] encounters the elderly [[Comanche]] [[Tonto]] in a [[sideshow]] at a [[San Francisco]] fair. Tonto [[frame story|proceeds to recount]] his experiences with that [[Old West]] adventurer.  In 1869, lawyer John Reid returns home to Colby, [[Texas]], via the uncompleted [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]], managed by railroad tycoon Latham Cole. Unknown to Reid, the train is also carrying Tonto and outlaw Butch Cavendish, who is being transported for his [[hanging]] after being captured by Dan Reid, John's [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]] brother. Cavendish's gang rescues Butch and derails the train. Tonto is subsequently jailed. Dan deputizes John as a Texas Ranger, and with six others they go after the Cavendish gang.  Cavendish's men ambush and kill their pursuers. Cavendish slays Dan with his [[dagger]] and [[Cannibalism|devours his heart]] as revenge for his imprisonment. Tonto, who has escaped from jail, comes across the dead men and buries them. However, a white [[spirit]] [[horse]] awakens John as a "spirit walker", and Tonto explains John cannot be killed in battle. Tonto also tells him Collins, one of the Rangers, betrayed Dan and is working with Cavendish. As John is thought to be dead, he wears a mask to protect his identity from enemies. Tonto gives John a silver [[bullet]] made from the fallen Rangers' badges and tells him to use it on Cavendish, whom he believes to be a mystical beast called a [[wendigo]].  At a [[brothel]] Collins recently visited, Red Harrington informs the two about Dan and Collins' fight over a cursed silver rock. Meanwhile, Cavendish's men, disguised as Comanches, raid frontier settlements. John and Tonto arrive after raiders abduct Dan's widow and son, Rebecca and Danny. Regretting his earlier actions, Collins attempts to help mother and child escape, but is shot dead by Cole, who rescues them. Claiming the raiders are hostile Comanches, Cole announces the continued construction of the railroad and dispatches [[United States Cavalry|US Cavalry]] Captain Jay Fuller to [[Genocide|wipe out the Comanches]].  A Comanche tribe captures John and Tonto after the pair finds railroad tracks in Native territory. The leader tells John of Tonto's past: As a boy, Tonto had rescued Cavendish and another man from near-death and later showed them a [[mountain]] full of [[silver]] ore in exchange for a [[pocket watch]]. The men murdered the tribe to keep the location a secret, leaving Tonto with great guilt which led to him believing the two were wendigos.  Tonto and John escape as the cavalry attack the Comanche. At the silver mine, the duo captures Cavendish. Tonto demands John use the silver bullet to kill Cavendish, but John refuses. Upon returning Cavendish to Cole and Fuller's custody, Cole is revealed to be Cavendish's partner and brother. Fuller, fearful of being labeled a [[war criminal]] for slaughtering the tribe, sides with Cole. Rebecca is held hostage, and John is returned to the mine to be executed. Tonto rescues him and the two flee. Realizing Cole is too powerful to be taken down lawfully and regretful since his arrogance in ignoring Tonto led to the mass slaughter of the Comanches and the kidnapping of his loved ones, John dons the mask again.  At [[Promontory, Utah|Promontory Summit]], during the railroad's [[golden spike|union ceremony]], Cole reveals his true plan: to take control of the railroad company and use the mined silver to gain more power. John and Tonto steal [[nitroglycerin]] and use it to destroy a railroad bridge. With Red's help, Tonto steals the train with the silver, and Cole, Cavendish and Fuller pursue him in a second train on which Rebecca and Dan Jr. are being held captive. On horseback, John pursues both trains. After a furious chase and fights on both trains, Cavendish and Fuller are killed, Rebecca and Dan Jr. are rescued, and Cole drowns while being buried beneath the silver ore after the train plunges off the severed bridge and into the river below, killing him.  The town recognize John as a hero and offers him a law-enforcement position. John declines, and he and Tonto ride off. Back in 1933, Will questions the truth of the story. Tonto gives him a silver bullet and tells him to decide for himself, and then departs.

Lone Survivor
  In Afghanistan, [[Taliban]] leader [[Ahmad Shah (Taliban)|Ahmad Shah]] is responsible for killing over twenty [[United States Marine Corps|United States Marines]], as well as villagers and refugees who were aiding American forces. In response to these killings, a [[United States Navy SEALs]] unit is ordered to execute a [[counter-insurgency|counter-insurgent]] mission to capture Shah. As part of the mission, a four-man SEAL [[reconnaissance]] and surveillance team is tasked with locating Shah. These four SEALs include team leader [[Michael P. Murphy|Michael P. "Murph" Murphy]]; snipers [[Marcus Luttrell]] and Matthew Axelson; and communications specialist Danny Dietz.  The team is inserted into the [[Hindu Kush]] region of Afghanistan, where they make a trek through the mountains. Here, they begin to encounter communications problems, which will play a critical role in the following events. Upon arriving at their designated location, the SEALs are accidentally discovered by an elderly shepherd and two teenage goat herders. Knowing that if they release them, the herders will likely alert Taliban to their presence, the team is split about whether to kill the herders or not. After a brief debate, Luttrell convinces the others that they will incite [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] if they kill the three herders. The team decides to release them and abort the mission, but before they can escape, they are discovered by Taliban forces. Although they manage to kill several Taliban gunmen, they find themselves heavily outnumbered and at a significant tactical disadvantage. Each of the men suffers serious injuries during the firefight and, in an attempt to flee from the insurgents, they jump off the edge of a precipitous ridge and into a large [[ravine]].  Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a defensive retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee from the Taliban fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is shot in the shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains at the top of the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a [[Mobile phone signal|phone signal]] in order to call in support forces via [[satellite phone]]. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.  In response to Murphy's distress call, a [[quick reaction force]] team assembles, boards two [[Boeing CH-47 Chinook|CH-47 Chinook]] helicopters, and heads toward the location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot down one of the helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|Special Operations aviators]] who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land at the bottom of a rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban fighters.  Luttrell stumbles upon a small body of water and submerges himself, only to find upon surfacing that a local [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] villager, Mohammad Gulab, has discovered his location. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a [[mountain man]] to the nearest American air base to alert military forces to Luttrell's location. The Taliban fighters arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his fellow militia are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack. American forces, arriving via helicopters, shatter the advancing Taliban and, in the process, kill the bulk of the insurgents with concentrated weaponry fire. The American forces evacuate Luttrell back to base.  Photos of the real-life Marcus Luttrell, Mohammad Gulab and the fallen service members who died during the mission are shown during a four-minute [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]], and an [[epilogue]] reveals that the Pashtun villagers agreed to help Luttrell as part of a traditional [[honor code|code of honor]] known as the [[Pashtunwali]].

Despite his job responsibilities and although his wife and sons are eagerly awaiting his arrival home to watch an important [[association football|football]] match, Locke decides to drive to [[London]] to be with Bethan during childbirth.

During these calls, he is fired from his job, banned from his house by his wife, and asked by his older son to please return home.

After Pakhi has an asthma attack from the ensuing excitement, she is rushed home and given medication. As she recuperates, her father comforts her and narrates the story of the invincible king of the Bhil tribe whose soul resided inside a parrot, telling her that she is the parrot within whom his life resides.  One day, after threatening the family driver into letting her drive the family car, Pakhi accidentally bumps into a motorcycle on the road, mildly injuring the handsome young man on the motorcycle. A few days later, the same man shows up at the door, introducing himself to the landlord as Varun Shrivastav ([[Ranveer Singh]]), an archaeologist who wants to study the land surrounding the temple that the landlord owns. Over the next few weeks, Varun charms the landlord and his daughter with his knowledge and persona, and is invited, along with his assistant, to live at their expansive mansion.  Soon, love brews between Varun and Pakhi as they bond over art and literature, and their love culminates into a passionate affair. Meanwhile, an act passed by the Indian government debars the power of landlords, causing tension in the Chaudhary household. The ancient artefacts the family owns must be sold, and Varun helps arrange the purchases.  As Varun's stay comes to an end, he asks Pakhi's father for her hand in marriage, and preparations of their wedding begin. Before the wedding, Varun's uncle, who has raised him, arrives and discourages Varun from marriage, stating that Varun will only give Pakhi grief because of the danger of what he does for a living—people like them are not meant to fall in love and have normal lives. Varun is conflicted but agrees and makes his choice: he and his assistant flee that very night, along with all the valuables they stole from the landlord. On the wedding day, Varun is nowhere to be found, and it is discovered that the idols from the temple have been stolen and the currency notes from the purchase that Varun arranged of the family's artifacts are all counterfeit.  A year later, a sick Pakhi is living all alone in [[Dalhousie, India|Dalhousie]].Except for her maid, she has no company. Her father has died and she has still not recovered from her heartbreak . When a police inspector asks her in helping him nab Varun, she refuses to do so, wanting only to forget him. Soon after, Varun and his friend turn up at Dalhousie for their next heist and stay at a lodge on Pakhi's property. Things turn ugly when the police gets wind of their whereabouts and a chase ensues. Varun accidentally kills his friend and a constable, and is injured in the encounter. He removes the bullet and then goes to seek refuge in Pakhi's house.  Pakhi and her maid try to turn him over to the police, but he threatens them. Pakhi gives in, but she is nevertheless enraged and repel Varun's comforting advances and explanation. In a letter, she explains to him that she is dying of [[tuberculosis]] and will die the day the last leaf falls from the wilting tree outside the window. Her maid leaves the house promising Varun that he wouldn't be reported to the police.  Varun plans his escape but when his accomplice comes, he refuses to go, and instead stays behind to take care of the ailing Pakhi. He confesses that he has regretted letting her go since the day he fled. Soon, Pakhi warms up to him and her faith remains intact when each day she finds one last leaf remaining on the tree.  In the end, seeing Pakhi's condition improving, Varun decides its time for him to leave, and he takes off, only to come face to face with a police blockade on the road, who proceed to shoot him to death. Pakhi wakes up to find Varun gone, but the tree still has a leaf on it. She becomes suspicious and discovers that the leaf has been affixed to the tree by Varun. Every night, he would tie it on a branch of the tree so that she wouldn't give up hope. It was his masterpiece.  Pakhi realizes the truth after she looks at the leaf closely, it's been painted upon, and smiles with tears in her eyes.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2224317/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl</ref>  
The Lost Medallion: The Adventures of Billy Stone

He accepts and the movie transitions into the Lost Medallion universe.  The story begins in a flashback in which a man holding an item wrapped in cloth is running away from another man. The man digs a hole by a tree and buries a medallion. The movie flashes back to the present where Billy ([[Billy Unger]]) sneaks into his father's archaeology site and tries to help work. He is told to leave, so he goes swimming with his best friend Allie ([[Sammi Hanratty]]). When he goes back home, she gives him an old book.  Billy is not a reader, so they read it together. They hear how the medallion was buried in a different spot than where his dad is looking. They go into the forest with Billy's home-made metal detector go searching. Two men from a rival archeology company have been watching them and bring their own metal detectors. The kids stumble on the goons and head off in a different direction. They hide behind a large tree. The detector goes off and they dig up the medallion.  The goons discover them and chase them through the city. After a bit, the kids, thinking they have lost the men, head back to Billy's home, only to find that the goons have arrived before them and tied up Billy's dad. Billy yells "I wish this whole mess had never happened!" and the medallion sends both Billy and Allie back in time (200 years).  The pair are captured and taken to a nearby village, where the village king ([[Jansen Panettiere]]), Huko, notices the medallion and claims that it is his. However, the people say that the king of the village is whoever wears the medallion; they hold a party for the new royalty.  The party is interrupted by the arrival of an enemy force, led by the ancestors of the two goons they had met in the present. Everyone in the village is captured except for Billy, Allie, Huko, and Anui.  Later the group is cornered by a river. Allie is captured, but Billy agrees to exchange her for the medallion. After the exchange, the kids jump over a waterfall to avoid capture. The kids quarrel among themselves but decide to try and seek help from an old wise man, Faleaka ([[James Hong]]), in the mountains.  The wise man tells them that they must complete tasks, and in return he will teach them how to defeat Cobra, the enemy that attacked the camp, and the evil warlord who keeps the natives in terror, and get the medallion back. The kids travel to the island of Cobra. On the beach of Cobra's island, Faleaka is shot by an arrow and killed.  The kids continue trying to get Cobra, but are captured; this time they are sent to a prison/work camp, and Billy is locked up in a cell. Billy escapes and meets the others in the camp. They use the tasks they learned from Faleaka to help everyone escape. Billy and Cobra have one last battle, and Cobra, along with the medallion, is pushed into a hellish pit.  The four friends get back together, and Billy and Allie accept that they are stuck in the past permanently, since the medallion is gone forever. However, Billy realizes that since they are in the past, he and Allie do not find the medallion for another 200 years. Thus, the medallion should still be buried. He goes to the place where he and Allie had discovered the medallion, and finds the medallion there, wrapped up. The jewel that belongs in the middle starts glowing, and is put in its rightful place in the medallion. Billy gives the medallion to Huko, who then activates the medallion to send Billy and Allie back to the present. Billy attacks the goons that had captured his father, only to have his father stop him, revealing that time has changed and the goons are no longer evil. The movie ends with Daniel expressing the story's message of God's love.<ref>[http://theindependentcritic.com/lost_medallion "The Lost Medallion" Review] ''TheIndependentCritic.com''.

Lord of Tears
 James ([[Euan Douglas]]) is an average school teacher that has been estranged from his mother for years and has only returned to her home to settle her estate after her death. This somewhat baffles his friend Allen ([[Jamie Scott Gordon]]), as his own father is undergoing a serious illness and is unlikely to recover. James discovers via letters that he stands to inherit two houses from her: one small and average, the other a large [[mansion]] that he is urged to never again visit. Confused, James ignores her request and moves into the house in hopes of making sense of everything, as he cannot remember his early childhood but does vaguely remember living at the house during this time. Soon after he arrives he meets the beautiful American, Eve (Lexy Hulme), who lives nearby in a set of renovated [[stable]]s. He also finds evidence that he had a mental breakdown as a child, brought about by visions of a creature known as the "Owl Man" ([[David Schofield (actor)|David Schofield]]).  As James stays at the mansion he begins to fall in love with Eve while also discovering that the house sits atop a series of catacombs and that his parents dabbled in pagan magic in order to achieve fortune. He eventually begins to recall more from his past even as the Owl Man's presence begins to grow increasingly ominous, culminating in James discovering that his parents had been worshipping [[Moloch]], who would grant wishes in exchange for a sacrifice. This causes James to regain his lost memories, discovering that Moloch had been manifesting himself as the Owl Man and that he was supposed to be the sacrifice that Moloch demanded. His parents were unwilling to offer James, so they took in an orphaned American girl as a nanny and murdered her in James's stead, claiming that as they had been her guardians, she was a reasonable substitute. James then realizes that this girl was Eve, which has the unfortunate effect of making Eve remember the events as well and turn into a menacing figure intent on driving James insane via a series of attacks. He tries to flee from the house but finds that Moloch will not allow him to leave.  Moloch claims to have no ill will against James; rather his anger is directed at his now deceased parents. He tells James that only finding Eve's bones and putting them to rest will end the haunting and free him. If he does not, Moloch will haunt him forever. James is able to find Eve's bones and puts them to rest in the front yard. Her soul free, Eve leaves the grounds, as a heartbroken James begs her not to go.  James visits his friend Allen and tells his story, horrified that his parents made such a monstrous choice, and states that he would not have done the same. Standing up, James feels woozy. He realizes that Allen has poisoned him and plans to kill him using the ritual sacrifice to appease Moloch. Clearly upset, Allen begs for James to forgive him even as he is killing him, explaining that Moloch came to him and offered to save his father (Neil Cooper) if he completed the sacrifice. The film then cuts to Allen driving his father home from the hospital, with a haunted look on his face. The film ends at back to the mansion, where a light suddenly turns on in the catacombs, and a new skull rests in a ceremonial fashion, hinting that James's ghost has taken the place of Eve's and will remain there until another sacrifice is performed.

The film, from the beginning, tells two stories of the same person, one in colour and the other in black and white.<ref name=sarit></ref>  Sanjay, a detective from the Mumbai police Crime Branch starts investigating the incident that caused the protagonist's ([[Sathish Ninasam]]) current state. While Sanjay is going through the protagonist's belongings he stumbles upon some scribbled notes and a mysterious pill. Meanwhile, the police capture two suspects and interrogate them.  The story starts with Nikki in a village near Mandya, working as an usher/"torch-shiner" in a Bengaluru movie theatre owned by Shankranna (Achyuth Kumar). Nikki has insomnia and yearns for a companion. On one of his sleepless nights Nikki is contacted by a drug dealer who gives him Lucia pills as a solution to his sleeping problems. This drug is said to have the capacity to help one dream the life they want, but has the side-effect that upon discontinuation the same dreams turn into nightmares.  With the help of the Lucia pills, Nikki starts seeing himself as being a successful actor called Nikhil surrounded by people he knows in the real world. Film actor Nikhil's life is depicted in black-and-white. Shankranna, the owner of the theater where Nikki works, had starred in a film in his youth funded by the leader of some goons who now want Shankranna to sign off his theatre for his debt. More events from the dream are followed by similar events in reality as Nikki falls in love with Shwetha ([[Sruthi Hariharan]]) who is a model in the dream and a waitress in reality.  In the dream, Nikhil and Shwetha hit it off easily at the beginning but later friction arises when Nikhil expresses his discontent about Shwetha working in the film industry. Meanwhile, in reality, Nikki struggles to win Shwetha’s heart, who rejects him first due to his low salary but later falls for his humble character. Shwetha’s attempts to get Nikki educated and lead him to find a better paying job turns out to be futile and also result in the death of Shankranna in the hands of goons. Frustrated, Nikki chooses to leave Shwetha and continue to work in the theatre, despite the threats. Nikki redecorates the theatre and releases Shankranna’s film to the audience. He later reconciles with Shwetha, who agrees to marry him.  In the dream, Shankranna is kidnapped, and Nikhil rescues him with the help of the police. In the process, all of the goons are either arrested or killed except for the contract killer. Nikhil feels Shankranna is not safe with him and decides to fire him. Nikhil breaks up with Shwetha and sends off all his servants so as to be alone. Later, a visibly disturbed Nikhil finds himself in a thrashed room. Nikhil gets hold of a torch and through its light sees his life as a "torch-shiner" projected on the walls of the room.  Shwetha is now distraught with being in the limelight and understands what Nikhil had tried to tell her. Nikhil, the actor, meets Shwetha and tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is ultimately happy. Asking Shwetha to close her eyes, Nikhil jumps off the roof to the confusion of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him.  At present, Sanjay with the help of the suspects, performs a sting operation on the drug dealer and learns more about the Lucia pills. Meanwhile, Shwetha is caught in an attempt to kill Nikhil by pulling him off life support. During her interrogation, the whole investigating team along with Shwetha watches a re-run of an interview of the film star Nikhil. In the interview, Nikhil expresses his dissatisfaction of the stardom and reveals that he is actually color blind from an accident in his childhood. He tells the interviewer that he dreams of being a normal person and in fact in one of his dreams he is a "torch-shiner" who gets no attention from people and is happily in love with the dream of his life.   Sanjay is now convinced that Nikhil is living in his own version of reality and chose to live in that dream rather than in the real world by attempting suicide. Sanjay gets Shwetha to act and behave like she was in Nikhil’s dream, and acts himself as if he was a contract killer and shoots the comatose Nikhil in the head with an empty gun. Simultaneously, Nikhil, aware and alive in his dream world finds everything disappearing around him and is killed by a shot to the head. Nikhi wakes up from his coma to see the astonished doctors and Shwetha's relieved face.  At the end we can see Nikhil, Swetha and Shankaranna (who was dead in Nikhil's dream) enjoying pizza (Swetha worked as pizza waitress in Nikhil's dream) while they operate the projector of an old theater. Thus revealing that it was film star Nikhil's dream to be a commoner like Nikki, and he achieved it through Lucid dreams.

Lupin the 3rd vs. Detective Conan: The Movie
 ''Lupin the 3rd vs. Detective Conan: The Movie'' begins with another daring theft committed by [[Kaito Kuroba|Kaito Kid]], with a fabulous diamond as his target - only that Kaito is in this case merely a spectator from the sidelines. Other discrepancies in this case include "Kid" using a real gun and a high-powered boat, instead of his standard hang glider cape, to make his getaway. [[Jimmy Kudo|Conan Edogawa]] takes up pursuit, but is foiled by a shadowy figure using a [[katana|sword]] to slice his skateboard in two; only then does he realize the true identity of the culprit: [[Arsène Lupin III]].  As it turns out, Lupin acts under coercion; his love interest, [[Fujiko Mine]], is being used as a hostage, with an explosive collar around her neck which will detonate if Lupin does not cooperate. The theft of the diamond, which Lupin discards shortly afterwards, was nothing more than a test of his abilities, as his real target is a gemstone named the Cherry Sapphire his "employer", a mystery man later named [[Alan Smithee]], is after. Mystified by Lupin's behavior, the Tokyo Police under [[Juzo Megure]] consults Lupin's would-be-nemesis [[Koichi Zenigata]], with [[Miwako Sato]] and [[Wataru Takagi]] volunteering as assistants. However, despite Zenigata's precautions, Lupin, disguised as Takagi, manages to steal the gem and get away.  Simultaneously, a famous young Italian pop singer named Emilio Baretti is arriving in Japan to conduct a concert tour; but amidst the news coverage Conan notices [[Daisuke Jigen]] among Baretti's entourage. Ran Mouri's friend [[Sonoko Suzuki]] arranges for a pre-concert meeting with her idol in his hotel, but upon arrival they stumble upon Megure and the police in Baretti's suite, along with his manager, Claudia Belucci, and his producer, Luciano Carnevale. Baretti has received a threat letter telling him to cancel his concert or be killed. Despite the danger to Baretti's life, Carnevale insists that the concert take place as scheduled. When Ran and Sonoko decide to leave, Conan stays behind to look for Jigen, whom he finds acting as Baretti's bodyguard, although he evidently pursues yet another agenda.  In the meantime, Ran and Sonoko are suddenly joined by Baretti for a clandestine tour of [[Tokyo Sky Tree]]. Once there, he climbs to a high rampant in a desperate attempt to see the concert cancelled; when Ran finds him there, she begins reprimanding him, thinking he wants to commit suicide. A wind blast nearly blows them both off the tower, but they are saved by the combined efforts of Conan, Jigen and Sonoko. Chastised, Baretti confesses that Carnevale, who is affiliated with the [[Italian Mafia]], uses his concerts as a cover to conduct illegal dealings, and therefore Baretti made up the threat to his life in order to have the Japan concert, an anacrusis for yet another deal, called off.  Eventually, Baretti's concert starts as scheduled. However, Carnevale manages to evade police surveillance and make his way to [[Haneda Airport]], where he meets with Smithee to conduct the deal. However, it is revealed at this point that the middleman who arranged this meeting and the owner of the Cherry Sapphire were Lupin's associates Jigen and Goemon; Lupin has been in fact hired by the Vespanian government to retrieve a rare piece of ore stolen by Carnevale, a mineral which enables the construction of ultimate [[stealth technology]]. Smithee, a native from the (fictional) country of Gillanba, intended to use the ore to offset the military might of a neighboring country, a purpose neither the late queen of Vespania, Sakura, nor her daughter and successor Mira have been endorsing.  However, Smithee has brought heavily armed reinforcements, and despite the help of most of Conan and Lupin's friends, Smithee finds an opening which enables him to take Conan as a hostage. Smithee and Carnevale attempt to escape by plane, but Lupin boards the craft, and he and Conan prepare to take down Smithee for good. Carnevale arrives and wildly fires a [[minigun]] at them, damaging the flight controls, mortally wounding Smithee and puncturing the hull, causing himself to be sucked out by the [[Uncontrolled decompression|sudden decompression]]. When military jets attack, intending to destroy the ore samples before they can leave the country, Lupin reveals that the Cherry Sapphire is also made from a piece of Vespanian ore. After using it successfully to thwart the missiles shot at them, Conan and Lupin abandon the crashing plane via parachute and are subsequently picked up by a submarine temporarily appropriated by Fujiko and Ai Haibara.  In a post-credit scene, Conan, Ran and Haibara see Baretti off safely as he departs Japan. Lupin, in the meantime, tries to steal a national treasure from a [[Kansai region|Kansai]] temple, only to find Kaito Kid having already beaten him to it and alerted the police as payback for dressing up as him.

Its leader murders Sartana while Machete is arrested by corrupt Sheriff Doakes ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) and Deputy Clebourne (Samuel Davis).

Machete is brought to the [[White House]], where the president offers him US citizenship if he eliminates Marcos Mendez ([[Demián Bichir]]), a psychopath who is threatening to fire a nuclear missile at [[Washington, D.C.]] if the American government does not intervene to stop the rampant drug cartels in Mexico and the corruption of its government.  Machete agrees and travels to [[San Antonio]], where he meets his handler Blanca Vasquez ([[Amber Heard]]), an undercover [[beauty pageant]] competitor. She sends him to [[Acapulco]] to meet a young woman, Cereza ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]), who can lead him to Mendez. Machete finds her in a brothel run by her mother, Madame Desdemona ([[Sofía Vergara]]), who attempts to kill Machete before he escapes with Cereza. She takes him to Mendez's associate, Zaror ([[Marko Zaror]]), who kills Cereza before taking Machete to Mendez's base of operations.  There, Machete learns that Mendez has wired the missile's launch device to Mendez' heart and triggered its launch in 24 hours. If he dies, the missile fires. After Machete kills Zaror, he also captures Mendez, intending to escort Mendez to US and find a way to disarm the missile. Machete learns that Mendez is an ex-secret agent who tried to expose his corrupt superiors, only to be betrayed and forced to watch his family being tortured. The trauma drove him insane, creating his split personalities and leading him to join forces with the missile's creator.  Shortly thereafter, a hit is put out on them. Machete is targeted by Madame Desdemona and her prostitute assassins, including a [[shapeshifting]] hitman called El Camaleón ([[Lady Gaga]]), as well as Doakes. Machete and Mendez manage to reach the US and kill Doakes and Clebourne only to be caught by a reborn Zaror and the same mercenaries who killed Sartana. Zaror decapitates Mendez and Machete is riddled with bullets.  Machete wakes up to find himself in a healing tank. He is taken to meet Zaror's benefactor—corrupt businessman, inventor and ''[[Star Wars]]'' fan Luther Voz ([[Mel Gibson]]). He shows Machete Mendez's beating heart, preserved in a jar, and informs him of his plan to manipulate extremists throughout the world to detonate nuclear weapons while planning to escape in a spaceship to rebuild society in space. Machete then escapes with help from Luz ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), who had heard about the hit on Machete. She informs him that the only one who can disarm Mendez's heart is Machete's old enemy, Osiris Amanpour ([[Tom Savini]]). Machete contacts Vasquez, who instructs him to meet her at a rendezvous point.  Arriving there, Machete is betrayed and ambushed by Vasquez, who is in league with Voz. As she is escaping into the desert, Machete gives chase and jumps onto the top of her vehicle but falls off after gunfire comes through the roof. Machete is then given a ride by El Camaleón, who tries to kill him one last time. But he escapes and El Camaleón ends up being shot to death by a group of racist rednecks just inside the US border. Machete then reunites with Luz and her group, the Network. They infiltrate a fundraiser at Voz's base of operations, where Voz kills Osiris. Machete realizes Voz was the one who killed Sartana and fights him. He severely burns Voz's face, disfiguring him to the extent that Voz is forced to wear a metallic, silver mask. Meanwhile, Vasquez shoots Luz in her good eye, completely blinding her. Luz kills Vasquez in return but is captured by Voz, frozen in Carbonite and taken aboard his ship.  Machete jumps on the missile as it launches and disarms it in mid-air, while Voz boards the ship and departs with the Zaror clones, his supporters, as well as Luz. The disarmed missile then plunges into the [[Rio Grande]] and Machete is rescued by President Rathcock, who asks him to follow Voz into space and kill him. Machete agrees and uses a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9 v1.0]] rocket to depart to Voz's Station in Earth's orbit, where he is given a laser machete to start his mission.  
Maach Mishti & More
 The film looks at a Bengali joint family of [[Kolkata]] in the present time. The grandfather (Soumitra Chatterjee) is modern, mingles freely with youngsters and wears hip clothes. The parents (Anuradha Roy and Pradip Mukherjee) are comparatively conventional but generally do not interfere in their kids' lives. The oldest, Rahul (Souvik Kundagrami), a successful NRI, returns to base with his wife (Swastika Mukherjee) with plans of opening a restaurant of American food. The second son, Ronnie (Parambrato), is a corporate honcho going steady with a rich Marwari girl called Swati (Rachita Chauhan) but is not sure about whether he really is in love with her or whether the slightly crazy Ishaani (Raima Sen) fascinates him more. The youngest, Raj (Anubrata), is a wannabe filmmaker with a mind of his own and his pockets filled with money doled out by the elders. The film closes with Rahul and his wife going back to the US to open a Bengali restaurant called Maach Misti & More.  
A Madea Christmas (film)
  In [[Atlanta, GA|Atlanta, Georgia]] Mabel "Madea" Simmons ([[Tyler Perry]]) has been talked into getting a job at a local store by her great-niece Eileen Murphy ([[Anna Maria Horsford]]). Madea gets fed up with the customers and starts speaking rudely, causing herself to get fired on her first day. She then asks for her paycheck, but her boss tells her they will mail it. Infuriated, Madea steals a dress and some money from the cash register, then leaves.  Meanwhile, Eileen's daughter, Lacey Williams ([[Tika Sumpter]]), who is working as a teacher at a small school in Alabama and married to a white man named Connor ([[Eric Lively]]), has many problems on her hands: the school does not have enough money to fund its annual Christmas Jubilee. This angers the townsfolk, thus pressuring Lacey to have her ex-boyfriend, Oliver ([[JR Lemon]]), fund the school through his business. Lacey also wants one of her students, Bailey McCoy (Noah Urrea) to sing in the Christmas Jubilee. Stuck with many issues to deal with, she tells her mother that she will not be able to come home for Christmas. Eileen, determined to see her daughter for Christmas, decides to pay Lacey a surprise visit. She brings Madea, who is hesitant at first, with her, and has Oliver, who is on his way with a contract for the sponsorship, as their ride, as Eileen feels that Lacey and Oliver could still be a couple. The trio then head to Alabama, where Lacey lives. Following a short run-in with the [[Ku Klux Klan]], the trio eventually make it to Alabama. This makes things awkward, since Lacey was not expecting her mother to come see her, and Eileen has never wanted Lacey to marry a white man. Lacey has made her mother believe that Connor is the "farm help" at her house.  Lacey's student Bailey is the son of Tanner McCoy, who Connor has had issues with since childhood. Connor is threatened by Tanner not to plant corn, which ''he'' wants to do, saying he will beat him up, as he did frequently when they were children, if he is not coerced.  Lacey goes to the meeting with the school principal, Oliver, and the town mayor to go over the contract for Oliver's representatives' sponsorship of the jubilee. While she is out, Madea looks after Lacey's class. Bailey walks into the class late and begins to get bullied by the girls of his class. Madea tells the meanest of them to leave Bailey alone and that they need to learn to be nicer to people. When Madea turns around to write her name on the chalkboard, one of the students steals her purse. Madea tells the students a modern day version of the story of the first Christmas, in order to keep the class busy. When Madea realizes that her purse is missing, she tries to then tell the children the story of Easter, but then loses her temper half way through the story and demands that somebody find her purse. Meanwhile, with the contract glazed over and signed, the town and school now have the money they need. Lacey then prepares to return to her class, but is interrupted by Oliver, who gives her a kiss. While she tries to tell Oliver that she is married and is not interested in getting back together with him, her and the principal discover that Madea has tied the girl that stole her purse to the cross decoration in the classroom.  Connor's parents, Buddy ([[Larry the Cable Guy]]), and Kim ([[Kathy Najimy]]), arrive at Connor and Lacey's house, as they have come to visit him for Christmas and are told that they must not mention that he and Lacey are married, as they do not know that Eileen has never wanted Lacey to marry a white man. Meanwhile, Eileen decides to get a Christmas tree and cuts down one with a yellow ribbon wrapped around it in the backyard, not knowing that Kim planted the tree in memory of her deceased father. When Eileen learns of this, she expresses no remorse, upsetting Kim. That night, Eileen walks in on Buddy and Kim, seeing Buddy with a sheet over his head, convincing her that Buddy is in the KKK. Now scared, she bars the door to the room that she and Madea are sharing.  The next day, while helping Connor with the farm animals, Madea reveals to Connor and Buddy that she knows Connor and Lacey are together (but not that they are married). When Connor informs Madea of this, also stating that Lacey is planning to tell Eileen about their marriage on Christmas day, Madea warns that Eileen will become upset.  While at the school that same day, it is discovered by the mayor and several towns people - including Tanner McCoy - that Oliver's representatives require that if they are going to sponsor the jubilee, it must be a holiday jubilee. This means that there may not be any references to Jesus, God, or the Bible.  The company that is sponsoring the event is Sheldon Construction Company, which caused the jobs of many of the citizens in the town to shut down. Angered at these facts, Tanner and the other citizens convince the mayor to fire Lacey. This upsets Bailey, and he complains to his father, who does not take what his son (or his wife) says into consideration.  Later that day, Buddy and Kim learn of Eileen's beliefs and become offended. Kim threatens Eileen, causing Eileen to try and kick Connor's parents out of the house. Madea forces Lacey to confess the truth to her mother and reveals that Eileen despises white people because her husband left her for a white woman when Lacey was 2 years old; she has lied about the story and said that a white man killed her husband. She also reveals that what Eileen said was a heart attack was in fact just gas, and that Eileen has been using this lie to manipulate her daughter. Hypocritically angered by the lies ''she'' has heard, Eileen packs her bags and sits outside of the house, hoping for a taxi to come by and pick her up. Buddy, Kim, and Madea try to convince her to come back into the house, but to no avail. The three give up on Eileen, resulting in her deciding to walk into town and take a bus back to Atlanta.   Connor walks into he and Lacey's bedroom and finds Lacey sitting on the bed, thinking about all that has happened to her that day. Lacey reveals that Tanner caused her to lose her job, setting Connor off. He storms out of the house in a fit of rage, gets into his truck and heads off to Tanner's house, Buddy riding along. While walking to town, Eileen discovers Tanner in ''his'' truck, which has been crashed and knocked upside down. Eileen helps Tanner out of the truck before it explodes. Connor and Buddy drive up to this. Connor punches Tanner in the face and demands that Eileen get into his truck. He tells Tanner to stay away from him and Lacey and says that he is planting the corn that Tanner told him not to plant. Connor, Buddy and Eileen then drive away, while Tanner, now with a change of heart, walks back to his house.  Back at Connor and Lacey's house, Eileen finally accepts Connor and Lacey's marriage. However, not everything has yet been settled, as Tanner and his wife pull up to the house. Connor at first demands that they leave his property, but Tanner apologizes for the things he has done and thanks Eileen for saving him. After the reconciliation, Connor asks Tanner if he wants to help him with the corn, to which Tanner gratefully says yes.  At the Christmas Jubilee, Lacey thanks the Sheldon Construction Company for helping to sponsor the event (while at the same time announcing promises to help the town that were not in the original agreement, knowing that the company would have no choice but to oblige considering the repercussions if they were to back out). Bailey sings "Mary, Did You Know", with his parents cheering him on. Lacey also reveals to Oliver that she is married to Connor as the jubilee commences.

The Machine (film)
 In the future, at an underground subterranean base, the United Kingdom only has a couple of weeks before the city of [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]] falls to the Chinese. The British need soldiers fluent in both Chinese dialect as well as ruthless killers. Scientists employed by Britain's [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] produce a cybernetic implant that allows brain-damaged soldiers to regain lost functions.  Scientist Vincent McCarthy sets up a [[Sally-Anne test|cognitive test]] for soldier Paul Dawson, a recipient of the cybernetic implant to rehabilitate his left [[hemispherectomy]]. Upset with Dawson's inability to remember anything about his past, McCarthy ignores Dawson's requests to see his mother.  Dawson turns hostile, kills a scientist and wounds McCarthy, before apologizing and being shot.  Afterwards, Dawson's mother regularly stays on the road to the entrance of the secret base, though McCarthy denies that her son was ever there.  McCarthy's research leads to a series of more stable cyborgs.  Although they lose the capability for human speech, the cyborgs develop a highly efficient method of communication that they keep secret.  When researcher Ava demonstrates her latest work in [[artificial intelligence]], McCarthy recruits her by promising her unlimited funds for her research.  Thomson, the director, is suspicious of Ava's countercultural politics and sympathy for Dawson's mother but he relents when McCarthy insists that she is the only one who can provide the necessary programme for their latest project, a [[Self-awareness|self-aware]] and [[Consciousness|conscious]] [[android (robot)|android]].  McCarthy plans to use this technology to help his daughter Mary, who suffers from [[Rett syndrome]], a neurological disorder.  When she finds out, Ava volunteers to help and McCarthy maps her brain.  During a demonstration of cybernetic arms that provide superhuman strength, amputee soldier James whispers a cry for help to Ava, who becomes suspicious of the treatment of the wounded soldiers.  After she goes exploring in the base, McCarthy sternly warns her to avoid causing trouble.  The warning comes too late and Thomson arranges to have her murdered by a Chinese agent, who impersonates Dawson's mother.  Grieved by the loss of Ava, McCarthy insists that they use her brain scan and likeness for the new project, whom they dub Machine. Machine turns out to be more human than they expected or even wanted; she shows regret when she accidentally kills a human and refuses orders that violate her sense of morality.  As Thomson's demands on her grow more at odds with her morality, Machine becomes increasingly distressed and asks McCarthy to protect her.  An antagonism grows between Thomson and McCarthy; Thomson promises that he will relent if McCarthy can prove that Machine is sentient.  After Mary dies, Thomson uses her brain scans as leverage against McCarthy, threatening to destroy the scans, unless McCarthy excises Machine's consciousness.  Machine, who has come to love McCarthy, offers to sacrifice herself for Mary and he removes a chip from Machine's head.  Thomson reneges on his deal and orders Machine to kill McCarthy.  Although Machine seems at first to obey, a scientist alerts Thomson that the operation was a sham and it only disabled [[fail-safe]] routines designed to destroy Machine.  Machine and the cyborgs rebel against the humans and free McCarthy.  From his computer console, Thomson disables half the cyborgs but Suri, his cyborg aide, overrides his access before he can kill the rest.  Thomson shoots and wounds Suri but Machine corners him in his office; wounded, he first orders her to obey, then begs for his life.  Although Machine agrees not to kill him, she lobotomizes him, as he attempted to do to her.  After leaving Thomson for dead, Machine downloads Mary's brain scan.  Machine, McCarthy and Suri escape the base; outside, McCarthy hands the base records to Dawson's mother and leaves to start a new life with Machine.  In the final scene, McCarthy talks to a computer virtualisation of his daughter and she requests to play a game with her mother.  McCarthy hands the tablet to Machine, and she is then shown gazing alternately at the device and at a beautiful orange sunset over the Atlantic Ocean.  
Madly Madagascar
 [[Valentine's Day]] is one of Alex the lion's ([[Ben Stiller]]) favorite holidays back in the zoo, for he was practically showered with Valentines from numerous admirers, but now that he's in [[Africa]], he's finding that Valentine's Day is not what he was used to.  Soon after, a perfume, called "Love Potion no. 9", is tossed out of a delivery plane and is discovered by King Julien ([[Danny Jacobs (actor)|Danny Jacobs]]), who wants to sell it to the animals of the savannah. Meanwhile, Marty the zebra ([[Chris Rock]]), meets a female Okapi ([[Taraji P. Henson]]) whom he, and the rest of the zebras, are infatuated with but she's not that interested. He tried to get some of the potion on himself but Julien ran out, so Marty (thanks to the penguins) creates an actual potion that genuinely makes him irresistible to the okapi. Unfortunately, so are 99% of the females (and males) on the savannah.  At first he's enjoying it, but after a while, Marty finds that being irresistible isn't all it's cracked up to be so he eventually jumps in the watering hole to lose the crowd, removing his irresistible smell in the process. Meanwhile, it's Melman the giraffe's ([[David Schwimmer]]) first Valentine's Day with Gloria the hippo ([[Jada Pinkett Smith]]), and as such, he's determined to make it a perfect one, even if it means going a bit overboard. It's Gloria's first Valentine's Day too with Melman and she's excited but Melman's been so caught up with working on Gloria's surprise gift that she assumes he's ignoring her and thinks he is dumping her on Valentine's Day. While the penguins find resources to make the love potion at a camp, Skipper's ([[Tom McGrath (animator)|Tom McGrath]]) bobble-head doll wife, Dollface, has "run off" with another bobble-head doll. While out running the humans, Skipper apologizes to Dollface for being insensitive to her on Valentine's Day and she "forgives him".   Back in the savannah, Alex and Julien attempt to make another potion, but Alex has the opposite effect and smells horrible to everyone.  After Gloria realizes why Melman was so distant and reconciles with him, Marty comes in and reminds them that Alex hasn't got a single Valentine card from anyone. So they put cards on his "Valentine Tree" to make it up to him. Julien soon arrives with another potion labeled "Love Potion no. 15" and, once again, tries to sell the potion to everyone, but the container shatters spilling the potion on Julien causing his fur to fall off, leaving him naked. After all the animals leave, completely disgusted, Julien's advisor, Maurice ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]), tries to cover him up.  
Madras Cafe
  The plot opens in [[Jaffna]], where a bus full of passengers is stopped by armed men. They take all of them out and kill them mercilessly. A little girl tries to escape, but is shot and killed immediately.  The movie then moves to Kasauli, where a bearded man, later revealed to be Vikram Singh ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]) wakes up after having visions of men getting killed. He then finds on TV that the Sri Lankan Prime Minister is killed by a suicide bomber. He purchases a bottle of liquor and goes to a nearby church. The priest of that church, who seems to know him for the past three years, asks him about his "conspiracy" when he says that "Our Prime Minister could have been saved from the conspiracy". The bearded man then starts narrating his story.  The film then goes five years back, when the man tells that the continuous battle between the majority in Sri Lanka Sinhalese and minorities Tamils had reached a dangerous level. In that battle thousands of Tamils lost their lives, causing their youths to take weapons in their hands and join the LTF leader Anna Bhaskaran (a character based on  the real-life LTTE leader [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]]). Due to the plight of Tamils there, the Indian Prime Minister (Sanjay Gurubaxani) decided to sign a peace accord with Sri Lankan Government and said that the elections should happen there peacefully before Diwali. However, Anna refused to accept the accord and the Indian Peace Keeping Forces were forced to withdraw from the island. A heated meeting in New Delhi between the Indian officials leads Robin Dutt aka RD ([[Siddharth Basu]]), the R&AW chief, to call upon his best man, Maj. Vikram Singh  to find out the solution.  After meeting and discussing the strategy with RD and his deputy, Swaroop (Avijit Dutt) Vikram travels to Sri Lanka and meets a war correspondent Jaya Sahni ([[Nargis Fakhri]]) and tries to find out a way to stop the rebels. After reporting to his senior Bala (Prakash Belwadi), he tries to find some that may help to find Shri, the only man who can withstand and oppose Anna. After meeting with an informer called Narayanan, Vikram manages to visit Shri. Vikram promises Shri to help him rise against Anna by providing him with arms. The arms deal date is decided at 6 July. However, the deal goes terribly wrong and one of Vikram's associates is killed in a surprise attack by LTF. Bala scolds Vikram for his working style and tells him to go to Colombo Safehouse. Vikram meets Jaya to seek her help. Jaya tells him that they know his next step even before he implement it. However, she tells him that "a foreign agency guy met with an Indian official" before her arrival in the island. Next day, Vasu, Bala's associate, meets a man, gives him a photo of Vikram, telling him "to keep him alive".  Meanwhile, RD and his team is shocked to learn on TV that Vikram is kidnapped by LTF. However, he is left alive by LTF, but badly wounded. Bala visits him in the hospital and tells him to leave Sri Lanka as he is on the hit-list of both the camps. Vikram feels suspicious about Bala. He calls SP, one of his associates, and tells him to report all activities of Bala to him. Vikram, posing as a war correspondent, manages to reach Malaya, second in-command of Anna and persuades him to meet RD in Colombo. RD tells him that the only way this war could be won is by a political solution. He instigates Malaya to stand up as the only champion of his people, thus dividing the LTF in two. Vikram and Indian forces then launch a massive attack on the LTF base camp where Anna and his men (minus Malaya) were discussing strategy. A devastating gunbattle begins, and Vikram escapes from the island after being told by RD. Everyone believes Anna got killed in the fight. However, Anna survives and later kills Malaya and Shri. In the light of the resurfaced violence, the Indian Prime Minister resigns. Some months later, SP later tracks some discussion of Anna over the phone and tells Bala about this, but Bala tells him to ignore them, causing SP to believe that Bala might be a mole. He escapes with the intercepts and files of the case. Bala finds about it and burns the remaining papers, later telling someone over the phone that SP and Vikram are in Kochi and he should send some men there. Vikram later receives a call from SP who tells him to meet him. After meeting with SP, Vikram comes home to find Ruby (Rashi Khanna), his wife, murdered. Vikram's associate in Kochi, Kush tells him that Vasu has been tracked. He nabs Vasu from a theatre and asks him what he knows. Vasu tells him that indeed Bala was a leak and he was helping him along with a person named Reed from Singapore. Vikram calls Jaya and requests her to use her sources. She agrees to help and later consoles Vikram about his wife.  As told by Jaya, Vikram reaches Bangkok where a source of Jaya (Dibang) tells him that he has a tape. Vikram is shocked to see that Bala was honeytrapped, forcing him to divulge all the information about their movements. Bala later commits suicide by shooting himself. Back in Delhi, R&AW had decoded the intercepts and had also found out about Bala's fake passports and unknown bank accounts. RD realises that this might be a Code Red, to assassinate the ex Prime Minister. He asks Vikram to take care of this and tells his team to seal the coastline. A massive manhunt begins and hundreds of LTF associates are nabbed by Indian security forces and local cops. In the Madras R&AW office, Arjun, an officer tracks down the conversation of Vijayan Joseph, a bombmaker and Anna and tells this to Rishi (Tarun Bali). Rishi tells this to Vikram and further says that Kannan Kanan, an associate of Anna's man Kanda, is in Madurai Jail and might be helpful. Kannan reveals that some suspicious refugees came from the island to Tamil Nadu. After a short but important meeting with Jaya, Vikram sees X on a clock at the Airport and deduces that the LTF is going to assassinate the ex PM on the same day at X PM (10&nbsp;PM). RD then calls the ex PM to cancel his rally, but he replies that he'll be alright. Vikram then manages to catch Vijayan from his hideout who tells that the refugees are going to assassinate the ex PM by plastic explosives which are untraceable to metal detectors.  Vikram rushes to the place where the ex PM is taking part in the rally. He reaches there nearly on time, but the suicide bomber manages to put the wreath on the neck of the ex PM and while bowing down, she pulls the trigger and kills him along with herself and many others. Vikram manages to recover but sits there dejected and defeated. Later, Vikram submits his report on the assassination to the investigation committee who considers his report. A few days later, RD too resigns, and Vikram, after taking a voluntary retirement, comes in Kasauli.  The movie comes to present where the priest asks Vikram who won the battle. Vikram says he doesn't know, but in this battle, Indians lost their Prime Minister and Lankan lost their future. He later walks away, reciting the lines of "Where the mind is without fear". He completes another report and sends it to Jaya in Singapore who starts her work on that report. In Kasauli, Vikram moves out of the house he was living in.  An epilogue tells that the civil war continued for 27 years, killing more than 40&nbsp;thousand Sri Lankan subjects, 30&nbsp;thousand Tamil rebels, 21&nbsp;thousand Sri Lankan forces and 1200 Indian forces, and still thousands of Lankan Tamils are homeless. In 2009, Sri Lankan forces launched a brutal aerial and land attack, finishing the rebels along with their leader.

Magic Magic (2013 film)
 Alicia ([[Juno Temple]]), making her first trip outside the [[United States]], arrives in [[Chile]] where her cousin Sara ([[Emily Browning]]) is studying to accompany her on a road trip with Sara's boyfriend Agustín (Agustín Silva), as well as his sister Bárbara ([[Catalina Sandino Moreno]]) and his friend Brink ([[Michael Cera]]). However, Sara soon receives a call which reminds her of an important exam that she cannot miss. Alicia is nervous about being left alone with a group of Sara's friends, but is reassured that Sara will be back in only a day. She leaves, while the rest of the group continue on to the island where they are to stay.   Several unexpected events along the journey result in Alicia becoming concerned that Bárbara is irritated with her presence. They all finally reach the island, where Alicia grows increasingly isolated due to both the lack of a phone signal in which to reach Sara, and the behavior of Brink, whom she finds self-centred and antagonizing. Having not had much sleep, Agustín invites her along for a walk the next morning, where she becomes upset after Brink kills a [[macaw]] with the air rifle he had brought along. She runs off into the hills and finds a phone signal to call Sara, who says that she'll have to stay in the city for one more day. Alicia becomes exasperated, calling the group "sadists", but the signal dies before Sara can respond. Alicia returns to Agustín and Brink, and also finds a wandering sheepdog, which she happily pets until she realizes that it is humping her leg. She recoils in disgust and Brink laughs as Agustín chases the dog away.   Later that night, Alicia continues to be mocked by Brink about the incident and begins to rough house with her until she becomes frightened and kicks him in the nose. Alicia becomes increasingly uncomfortable feeling unwelcomed and humiliated by the group. She tearfully manages to call Sara again, who arrives on the island the next day and speaks to Alicia in private. Alicia references the call from the previous night, but Sara says she did not get a call from her. In a whispered conversation Sara reveals she did not have to take a test but had an [[abortion]]. The group decides to cliff dive into the water later that day. Agustín, Brink and Sara all manage to perform the dive, yet Alicia becomes extremely fearful of the jump. Ultimately, she has an attack of [[vertigo]] and is brought back to the cabin. Sara is concerned that Alicia does not seem well due to a lack of sleep, but the group does not pay much attention. That night, Agustín demonstrates hypnosis on Alicia, who they think begins to loosen up when she performs the tasks Brink playfully orders her to do. However, she snaps out of her trance when he tells her to put her hand in the fireplace and she burns herself.  Sara puts Alicia to bed after the incident and leaves with Agustín. Alicia, however, begins to suffer hallucinations of Sara and Brink in the room. Later in the night, she wanders around the house and hears voices of the others talking about her disparagingly, but finds only Brink asleep when she investigates. In his room, she finds the air rifle and momentarily aims it at him, before pulling down her pants and waking him up by forcing his face into her crotch and leaving. When Sara returns to the cabin, she notices that Alicia has covered all of the mirrors. The next day, Brink angrily confronts Alicia, but she becomes distraught and denies that it ever happened.

The Maid's Room
   
Man of Steel (film)
   With Krypton destabilized from mining of the planet's core, [[Jor-El]], chief advisor to Krypton's supreme council, recommends the council give him control of the genetics codex. Before any action can be taken, soldiers led by [[General Zod]], an old friend of Jor-El's, launch an uprising and arrest the councilors. Realising that Krypton is doomed, Jor-El steals the genetic codex sought by Zod and infuses them into the DNA of his infant son, Kal-El – the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries. Donning his old armor, Jor-El sacrifices his life to allow his son to escape on a preprogrammed spacecraft. Zod orders the rocket's destruction, only to learn that forces loyal to the council have suppressed the rebellion. In a brief trial, Zod and several of the surviving rebels are convicted of treason and sentenced to the [[Phantom Zone]] moments before Krypton explodes.  Following Jor-El's coordinates, the ship crash lands on Earth in [[Smallville (comics)|Smallville]], [[Kansas]]. A childless couple, [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], find Kal-El and raise him as their own, naming him [[Clark Kent|Clark]]. Clark eventually becomes an isolated young man as a result of developing superhuman powers which he tries to hide from others. He then learns his true origins from Jonathan, who urges him to keep his powers hidden. Several years later, Jonathan dies in a tornado while refusing to let Clark rescue him. Burdened with guilt and looking for a new purpose in his life, Clark leaves to travel the world for an extended period of time under several disguises.  Several months later, [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], ''[[Daily Planet]]'' reporter [[Lois Lane]] receives an assignment to investigate the discovery of a Kryptonian scout ship in the Canadian Arctic. Disguised as a worker, Clark enters the ship and activates its central computer using a key left by Jor-El, which allows him to communicate with an artificial intelligence modeled after his father. The AI explains that Clark was sent to Earth to guide its people, and presents him with a Kryptonian uniform bearing his family's symbol. While following Clark, Lois inadvertently triggers the ship's security system. Clark uses his powers to rescue Lois before wearing the uniform and testing his flying abilities. Unable to convince supervisor [[Perry White]] to publish an article on the incident, Lois tracks down Clark and agrees to keep his secret safe.  Escaping the Phantom Zone, Zod and his crew intercept a transmission from the scout vessel and travel to Earth. Deducing that Kal-El is nearby, they broadcast a global address demanding that he surrender or risk war. Clark meets with the United States Air Force and agrees to comply, with Lois joining him as a hostage. Zod reveals that he possesses numerous [[terraforming]] devices, the largest called a World Engine, which he salvaged from Kryptonian outposts, which he intends to use to transform Earth into a new Krypton. His science officer, [[Jax-Ur]], extracts Clark's genes to create Kryptonian colonists who will annihilate humanity and build a society based on Zod's ideals of genetic purity.   With help from Jor-El, Clark and Lois flee and warn the U.S. military, just as Zod orders an invasion. Zod deploys the World Engine from the Kryptonian ship, which touches down in the Indian Ocean and begins firing a beam through the planet towards the ship, severely damaging Metropolis and initiating the terraforming strategy. Given the codename "[[Superman]]", Clark destroys the terraforming platform while the military launches a suicide attack, sending Zod's troops back to the Phantom Zone. With the ship destroyed and Krypton's only hope of revival gone, Zod vows to destroy the Earth and its inhabitants just to spite Superman. The two Kryptonians engage in a lengthy battle, which culminates in a train station, where Zod attempts to kill some passengers, forcing Superman to reluctantly kill him to end his threat.  Superman persuades the government to let him act independently, so long as he does not turn against humanity. To allow access to dangerous situations without attracting attention, Clark takes a job as a freelance reporter for the ''Daily Planet''.  
Mama (2013 film)
 Distraught after losing his fortune in the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|2008 financial crisis]], stockbroker Jeffrey Desange kills all of his business partners, his employees, and estranged wife before taking his children, three-year-old Victoria and one-year-old Lilly, away from home. Driving dangerously fast on a snowy road, Jeffrey loses control and the car slides down the mountain, ramming into the woods and breaking Victoria's glasses.  Surviving, he takes the children into an abandoned cabin. Planning to kill his daughters and commit suicide, he holds a gun to Victoria's head, but a shadowy figure turns the tables by killing him. The girls, huddled by the fireside, are tossed a cherry by the mysterious figure.  Five years later, a rescue party, sponsored by Jeffrey's [[identical twin]] brother Lucas, finds Victoria and Lilly alive and well, but in a [[Feral child|feral state]] after years of isolation. The girls are put in a welfare clinic under the psychiatric care of Dr. Gerald Dreyfuss. They make reference to "Mama", a maternal protector figure. The girls are initially hostile to Lucas but Victoria recognizes him after he gives her a pair of glasses and she can see him properly. Dreyfuss agrees to support Lucas and his girlfriend Annabel's custody claim against the girls' maternal great-aunt, Jean Podolski, as long as Dreyfuss is allowed to monitor the progress of the girls. Victoria acclimates quickly to domestic life while Lilly retains much of her feralness (language regression, growling, lying on the floor), not being used to being around people.  While in bed with Lucas, Annabel is startled by the appearance of a monstrous figure. Lucas is attacked by "Mama" and is put into a coma. Annabel, who is uncomfortable being around the girls, finds herself left alone to care for them. Although Annabel makes progress with Victoria, she finds Lilly hostile. Alarmed by nightmares of a strange woman and Victoria's warning about Mama's jealousy, Annabel asks Dreyfuss to investigate. He initially thought "Mama" to be an imaginary [[Dissociative identity disorder|alter-ego]] of Victoria; however, his research corroborates Victoria's story that Mama is an aggrieved mother and brings to light the story of Edith Brennan, a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] patient in the 1800s.  Dreyfuss recovers a box from a government warehouse containing a baby's remains. Annabel has a nightmare revealing Mama's past: when Edith Brennan ("Mama") was sent to St. Gertrude's Asylum for an unknown reason, her child was taken from her and given to nuns. She escaped the asylum, stabbed a nun and took her baby back. Fleeing her pursuers, Edith jumped off a cliff but before hitting the water below, she and the child made impact with a large branch. Edith drowned but the child's body snagged on the branch and did not fall with her into the water. Annabel realizes that Mama still hasn't realized her child died from hitting the tree and didn't understand why her baby wasn't in the water with her; in her distress, Mama unsuccessfully searched the woods for her child for more than a century until she discovered Victoria and Lilly, taking them on as substitutes.  Lucas regains consciousness after a vision of his dead brother, Jeffrey, tells him to save his daughters. Victoria's growing closeness to Annabel makes her less willing to play with Mama, unlike Lilly. Dreyfuss visits the cabin and is killed by Mama, with Annabel taking some of the objects relating to Mama, including the body of her baby. Annabel and the girls are attacked by a jealous Mama, who kills Jean, who has been watching the house, and uses her body to spirit the children away in Jean's car. Annabel and Lucas find the children on the same cliff where Brennan leaped with her child to their deaths over a century earlier. Mama is preparing to re-enact her fall with Victoria and Lilly.  When Annabel offers Mama the remains of her child, Mama's appearance changes, becoming more human, and she starts sobbing at the baby's death. However, when Lilly (remembering only Mama as her original parent, since she was abandoned in the woods for most of her life) calls out for her, Mama reverts to her monstrous form and takes the girls again, nearly killing Annabel and Lucas, but refraining mainly because Victoria cares about them and does not want them hurt. Annabel clings to Victoria, who asks to stay with Annabel instead of leaving with Mama, which Mama accepts. After a tearful farewell, Mama and Lilly fall off the cliff, turning into a shower of moths when they hit the branch. Mama and Lilly are shown as spirits happy to be united while embracing and smiling.  Annabel and Lucas embrace Victoria, and Victoria notices a bright blue moth landing on her hand, indicating that Lilly is still with her in some form.  
Man of Tai Chi
 Tiger Chen is the sole student of Ling Kong [[Tai Chi]] style under his elderly master Yang. While Tiger excels in the physical aspects of his training, he has yet to understand its philosophical aspects, which worries Master Yang. Determined to prove the effectiveness of the style, Tiger competes in the local Wulin (武林) Competition.  HKPD officer Sun-Jing Shi leads an investigation into Security System Alliance (SSA), a private security firm owned by the mysterious Donaka Mark. Suspecting Donaka of hosting an illegal fighting operation, Sun-Jing turns one of Donaka's fighters into a mole, but Donaka discovers and personally kills him. Without any evidence, Superintendent Wong orders the case closed, but Sun-Jing secretly continues investigating.  While searching for his next fighter, Donaka sees Tiger at the Wulin Competition. Intrigued by the relative obscurity of the style, as well as Tiger's immaturity, he sends Tiger a job offer at SSA. Tired of his menial courier job, Tiger flies to Hong Kong for the job interview. The "interview" turns out to be a test of Tiger's combat ability, which he passes. Donaka welcomes Tiger offers him great financial rewards for joining his underground fighting ring. Tiger refuses as fighting for money would compromise his honor, and leaves.  Soon after, land inspectors arrive and declare the Tai Chi temple structurally unsafe. They announce the plan to evict its occupants, including Master Yang, and demolish the temple for real estate development. Tiger seeks help from Qing Sha, a paralegal friend. With her help, he finds a means to save the temple through historic preservation and government protection. However, because of the temple's deteriorated condition, it requires repairs within a month's time. Desperate for money, Tiger accepts Donaka's offer.  After each fight, which is a form of modern gladiatorial combat enjoyed by rich individuals, Tiger wins larger sums of money. He quits his job, buys his parents presents, and begins having the temple repaired. However, the challenges became more difficult, with the stakes raised against him, forcing Tiger to develop a style that is more efficient but also more brutal. Noticing the change in him, Master Yang warns Tiger; however, intoxicated with the new life, Tiger ignores the warning.   In the Wulin Competition, Tiger viciously injures his opponent, and is disqualified. When Tiger comes back to train with his master, the usual respectful spar devolves into an intense fight. Master Yang is forced to use his internal chi energies to palm-strike Tiger, reminding him that he has not yet completely mastered Tai Chi. He advises Tiger to return to the path of peace, but Tiger rejects his teachings and leaves. Tiger finds out that the authority has rejected his petition to gain historical protection for the temple. A disappointed Qing-Sha tells Tiger that the decision is in part due to his actions at the Wulin Competition, which are in contrast to the claimed honor and nobility of his temple's philosophy.  Still enraged, Tiger demands a fight and Donaka has him face a mercenary named Uri Romanov. Using his rage, he quickly defeats Uri and almost kills him, but relents at the end. Donaka finishes off Uri. Realizing how much he has changed, Tiger declares his intention to stop participating in underground fighting. Donaka scoffs at Tiger belief that he can just quit. Tiger decides to reach out to the police, and Sun-Jing contacts him. However, unbeknownst to Tiger, Donaka had put him under constant surveillance for a long time, and knows of his every action.  Donaka sets up a private tournament for a death match, which Tiger is to participate. Sun-Jing trails Tiger's escort, but her car is run off the road. Surviving the crash, Sun-Jing calls for assistance and discoveres Superintendent Wong has been working for Donaka and disrupting investigations against him.  At the tournament, Donaka shows a video to his audience. Composed of surveillance footage, the video reveals how Tiger Chen has been manipulated and "corrupted" by Donaka, and has transformed from an innocent martial arts practitioner to a ruthless fighter. In the death match, Tiger refuses to fight his assigned opponent, and challenges Donaka instead. The tournament is interrupted by the HKPD, who storm the compound and arrest participants and audience. Donaka escapes capture.  Donaka waits for Tiger back at his temple, and the two begin fighting. Donaka taunts Tiger, and pushes him to reveal his "true nature". Being formidable fighter himself, Donaka has the upper hand, but Tiger re-embraces his Tai Chi training and holds his own. Donaka pulls out a knife and stabs Tiger. Despite the wound and pressure, Tiger achieves what his master has been trying to teach him, and uses his Chi to fatally strike Donaka. A dying Donaka smiles, pleased for having pushed Tiger to become a killer.  Some time later, Tiger repairs his relationship with his master. Sun-Jing has been promoted to Superintendent. Tiger reaches out to both Qing Sha's law firm and the real estate developers and all three parties reach a compromise. The temple will be part of a historical cultural village. Not only will the government protect the village, but tourists can come and visit to learn more about the 600-year history of the Ling Kong Temple. Finally putting that chapter of his life behind him, Tiger tells Qing-Sha that he intends to return to the city and open his own Tai Chi school to continue the legacy of the Ling Kong Tai Chi.

Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola
   The film tells the story of three individuals, Harphool Singh Mandola a.k.a. Harry ([[Pankaj Kapur]]), his daughter Bijlee Mandola ([[Anushka Sharma]]) and Hukum Singh Matru ([[Imran Khan (Bollywood actor)|Imran Khan]]) known in short as 'Matru'. Harry is a wealthy, cynical businessman who dreams of turning the Mandola village (named after his family) into a shining example of his success and a microcosm of a fledgeling economy in itself. But this dream can only be realised if the villagers agree to sell their land to the government at unfairly low rates in order for the land to be converted into a Special Economic Zone.  Among many vices, a vice relevant to the plot, is Harry's drinking. He is normally a shrewd, sophisticated and composed individual, but whenever drunk, he turns into an advocate of equality and betterment of the villagers, but regrets these thoughts when sober. When he chooses not to drink he hallucinates, as a withdrawal symptom, about a pink buffalo 'Gulabo', the mascot of the brand of alcohol he enjoys. The knowledge of these hallucinations are later used by Matru as a ploy to get Harry drunk in order to serve his own plans.  Bijlee Mandola is the only child of Harry Mandola. She lost her mother when she was young and now lives in Mandola village after having received a higher education in New Delhi and later in Oxford, England. Bijlee is now in love with Baadal ([[Arya Babbar]]), the son of politician Chaudhari Devi ([[Shabana Azmi]]) and is all set to marry him.  Chaudhari Devi is a corrupt politician who, along with her obedients, is helping Harry realise his dream. Baadal and Bijlee's union is strategically apt as it serves Harry's and Chaudhari Devi's personal goals. While Chaudhari Devi conspires to control Harry's wealth by marrying her son to his daughter, Harry seeks Chaudhari Devi's help in realising his dream in exchange for their children's marriage.  Matru is a revolutionary, fighting for the villagers' cause of not letting their land being taken away. He is educated in Law from JNU, holds a job as Harry's driver and is responsible for regulating Harry's drinking. Matru's revolutionary instincts are shown to be significantly influenced by those of [[Mao Tse Tung]].  The film starts with a negotiation at a liquor shop set in crop laden fields, between the liquor shop owner and a heavily drunk Harry. The shop owner's rude refusal to sell alcohol to Harry due to the day being a dry day, provokes Harry to run his Limousine into the shop.  Once drunk, Harry is shown to be an entirely different individual, who wants the land of the villagers to be returned to them, Matru to marry Bijlee while himself to retire into a religious man.   The villagers, in their fight are supported and advised by Mao who regularly sends messages to the villagers, written on cloth. Later in the film it is revealed that Mao is none other than Matru who is advising the villagers without revealing himself in order to retain the key position as Harry's aide.  Bijlee's love for Baadal is depicted to be a contradiction to her subtle, probably subconscious, knowledge of Baadal's incompatibility with her. This subtle thought aggravated by Baadal's affiliation and deeds supporting his mother's corrupt cause, overpowers Bijlee's will to marry him and polarises her into helping Matru and the villagers instead. After this polarisation, seeing Chaudhari Devi and Baadal's ambitions in a new light and while helping the villagers along with Matru, Bijlee falls in love with Matru.  Although they have the help of Matru, his college friends and Bijlee, the villagers lose their entire harvest to an unexpected rain storm. This harvest, which would have fetched enough money to settle their debts to the government bank and some more for their own survival, is now completely destroyed. Thus the villagers are forced to surrender their land, against their will, to the government in order to settle their debts.  Later, discovering Bijlee's alliance with the villagers, Chaudhari Devi, now cautious, decides to finalise the decree to convert the now acquired land into an SEZ only once Bijlee and Baadal are married.  These conflicts of villagers' loss of their lands, Bijlee's marriage to Baadal, builds up the tension leading up to the wedding at the climax wherein Matru and the villagers have a plan to get Harry drunk who will then call off the wedding. This plan apparently works and Harry is shown to be drunk, succumbing to Matru and the villagers' plan. Now, while drunk, he enters the wedding venue, calls off the wedding, chases away Chaudhari Devi, Baadal and their supporters and decides to get Bijlee and Matru married. Consequently, upon refusal by Matru on the pretext that Harry will not feel the same way about him and Bijlee when sober, Harry, to everyone's surprise, reveals that since he had sworn on Bijlee to not consume even a drop of alcohol has stood by his word, in turn revealing that while he did all that he did appearing to be drunk, he was completely sober instead.

Eventually, he is forced to leave his home.  The film then turns to later in his life, when Tanmay and Aniket adopt a child together, naming him "Shlok". The boy grows to become a successful businessman, but his gay parents keep their distance from him to avoid burdening him with social stigma. Shlok meets a woman, Disha, whom he wishes to marry, but his parents' homosexuality becomes an impediment.  The film accordingly shows the social obstacles against gay people in Indian society, in a format divided into three separate vignettes.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2319637/Gujarati-film-focusing-gay-issues-aims-spur-debate.html Gujarati film focusing on gay issues aims to spur debate | Mail Online]</ref>

His loving wife Teena and beloved daughter were murdered by Sam's enemy right in front of his eyes, and as a result, Sam turns into an alcoholic. Sam's supervisor, Mr. Aravindhaksha Menon ([[Vijayaraghavan (actor)|Vijayaraghavan]]) requests Sam to proceed with a parallel investigation in a case involving the disappearance and possible kidnapping of several young married men, since the present police team is not able to make any progress in the case.

The murderer is an eccentric person and has a limp in his feet and is a person who either hates or loves women. The killer leaves certain clues inscribed by sharp surgical knife on the chest of the victims. This serves Sam's thinking of what kind of person the killer is and who is his next target. Upon careful examination of the words inscribed in the body of the victims, Sam uncovers that the words are actually Aramaic, the language that Jesus used for communication. The words are later found to point to biblical proverbs,thus helping Sam to lead to conclusions that the killer is insane and that he assumed that the victims gave up their lives for the sins committed by their respective wives. He soon figures out that the wives of the kidnapped husbands have links and they all had to do with a guy who studied with them certain years back. There was absolutely no evidence of such a person. During all these scenes, Sam realizes that there is one last target and the killer will not miss this and he will disappear after that. He eventually finds out that the next target is his own brother, Sanju and his brother's wife is the last link in the connection. Sam finds out with the help of his colleague and other evidences that the killer has a property near [[Kottayam]]. He goes there for one last confrontation.  
Meet the Small Potatoes
  The film is presented in the style of a [[mockumentary]] documenting the history of The Small Potatoes, a band of anthropomorphic singing potatoes. Narrative segments are interspersed with [[Pundit|talking head]] interviews with the band’s friends, manager Lester Koop (McDowell), and [[man on the street]] interviews with the band’s fans (all of whom are potatoes).  The Small Potatoes’ trajectory roughly follows trends in American popular music through the second half of the 20th century: The Potatoes start as a [[country and western]] band in Idaho in the 1940s, before finding popularity first as [[rock and roll]] and then [[doo wop]] singers in the 1950s. They reach the peak of their popularity in the 1960s as a [[British invasion]] style act, followed by their experimenting with [[psychedelic rock]] after a trip to [[India]]. Through the Potatoes’ career, there is constant infighting between lead singer, Ruby, and Nate, the songwriter, on what the band’s image should be. Olaf, a fat potato, struggles with his weight, which Lester tries to help him keep under control, while Chip is the quiet, detached voice of reason.  Conflict worsens between Nate and Ruby in the 1970s. Ruby, as the frontwoman of the group, begins to style herself as a [[diva]] and attempts to reform the band’s image around herself, turning the group into a [[disco]] act. Nate, meanwhile, wants to keep the band socially relevant as a [[punk rock]] group. Tensions come to a head in the 1980s during the age of [[commercialization]], when Ruby convinces the group to [[sell out]] by lending their names to a line of children’s toys. The toys are all poorly manufactured and fall apart, displeasing customers. The negative backlash causes the group to break up.  Most of the members go on to get regular jobs while Ruby reinvents herself as a [[Britney Spears]] style solo pop act in the 1990s. The group’s old albums remain popular, though, and Ruby becomes depressed at the loss of her friends. The group enjoys a resurgence in popularity on the internet in the 2000s, leading to Simon, Olaf, and Nate reuniting for a reunion tour. Ruby surprises everyone by showing up at the theater on the night of their opening concert and singing with the band. The group finally resolves all of their old hostilities and Lester arranges for them to make a comeback tour.  
Mere Dad Ki Maruti
 The plot is set in [[Chandigarh]], where a wedding is about to take place at the [[Khullar]] House, and father Tej Khullar ([[Ram Kapoor]]) has bought a new [[Maruti Ertiga]] car as a wedding gift for his daughter & would-be son-in-law. A few days before the wedding, his college going son, Sameer ([[Saqib Saleem]]) who the father thinks is good for nothing, secretly takes the car out to impress the hottest girl in college, Jasleen ([[Rhea Chakraborty]]). After dropping Jasleen at her hostel and in a drunk state, he loses the car by accidentally giving the keys to a person who Sameer thinks is a valet. As soon as he realises that the valet doesn't have the keys and he had lost his car, he and his best friend Gattu ([[Prabal Panjabi|Prabal Panjab]]i) go on an all night search to find the car.  The next day they get an Ertiga model (test drive) to the house to show Sameer's father that the car was still in the garage. They also meet a car dealer Pathan ([[Ravi Kishen]]) and agree to purchase a stolen Ertiga from him. Pathan  promises them to give the car the very next day. To ensure that there is a car in the garage in the night, they take another Ertiga on rent from a Jat family and bring it home. The day before the wedding, Sameer returns Ertiga and in the night goes to meet Pathan along with Gattu and Jasleen. While at Pathan's place, a police raid happens and the three barely manage to escape. Pathan's assistant calls Sameer telling him to take the car but it's a trap set by the police and Sameer ends up in jail.  On the morning of the wedding, Sameer explains to the cops what happened but the cops insist on meeting his father. Sameer informs his sister who sends her fiancee to bail out Sameer. While this is happening, a cop informs the police control room that an Ertiga is being stolen by a gang using a tow truck. A chase ensues and police catch the thieves and hand the car back to Sameer.  After the wedding ceremony, Sameer manages to get the car back decorated and behaves as nothing has happened. But a few minutes later, Gattu brings another Ertiga to Sameer's home and so does Jasleen, leaving everyone shocked and confused as there are three Ertigas. Sameer then confesses to his father in the presence of everyone what happened over the past few days. His dad loses his temper, chides him but then forgives him and all are happy.  The audience comes to know that Gattu had won a contest where the 1st prize was a Maruti Ertiga and since Jazleen had saved a Jat family member's life by taking him to the hospital on time, the Jat family gifts the car to her in gratitude.<ref></ref>  
Metallica: Through the Never
 Amid aerial footage of Vancouver and [[BC Place|BC Place stadium]], a radio DJ publicizes Metallica's concert. An overweight heavy-metal fan drives into the empty parking lot, and climbs on the car's hood, whooping and laughing. Trip ([[Dane DeHaan]]), a [[Road crew|roadie]] for Metallica, [[skateboard]]s past the fan and [[Glossary of surfing#Accidental|wipes out]]. He skates into the underground parking lot and down the dressing-room halls, encountering each of the band members. When he gives a brown paper bag to his supervisor, Trip is told to stick around. After standing in the arena, he walks away as the audience files in to Metallica's traditional opener, "[[The Ecstasy of Gold|Ecstasy of Gold]]".  The band begins performing, and during "[[Creeping Death]]" Trip's boss tells him to bring gas to a stranded truck carrying "something very important". Before driving his van, Trip takes a blue-and-red capsule, before the band begins "[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (Metallica song)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]".  As Metallica begins "[[Fuel (song)|Fuel]]", Trip drives down deserted streets. Distracted by his map, he runs a red light and sees a bloody hand print on an illuminated sign. He is [[Side collision|T-boned]], and his van flips, lightning flashing as he leaves, which leads into [[Ride the Lightning]] (alongside a [[steel]] [[electric chair]] surrounded by two [[Tesla coils]] reminiscent of the album's artwork.)  Trip crawls out of the van, peers into the other car and calls to the driver (who is standing with his back to him). The driver glances at Trip, and runs past him down the street, [[One (Metallica song)|One]] beginning to be played. Trip retrieves the gas tank, the map and a doll with a [[noose]] around its neck from the van, which [[The Memory Remains]] is played to. He wanders down a street, and a [[Mounted police|police horse]] drags a dead officer across his path. People run past him, ignoring him, followed by police cruisers (one of which is ablaze). Emerging in the middle of a street, Trip realizes he is between a motionless group of rioters and riot police. The rioters then become rowdy, and when the police throw tear gas they swarm over them. Stunned by the violence, Trip stands in front of a window (which then shatters).  A rider in a gas mask on an armored horse charges, wielding a [[sledgehammer]]. He lassos a rioter, hanging him from a streetlamp. Trip throws a brick at the rider, who gives chase. Trip loses the doll, but escapes through a wall of rioters, surging into [[Cyanide (song)|Cyanide]].  He walks down a deserted, littered street, under a dozen bodies hanging from a pedestrian bridge, leading into [[...And Justice for All (song)|...And Justice for All]]. Trip finds the truck he is looking for in a deserted parking-garage corridor, but the driver (a middle-aged man) is traumatized and does not notice him. The back of the truck contains a leather bag, which Trip opens; he slumps, speechless, as the band breaks into [[Master of Puppets (song)|Master of Puppets]]  He sees a figure waving at him from a distance. The rider approaches the figure, and a group of rioters surge past them. Trip grabs the bag and the can of gas, jumps out of the truck and flees.  He is cornered at the end of an alley by the rioters. Trip ties a black bandanna around his mouth, puts up his hood and drops the bag. He douses himself with the gas, sets himself ablaze and charges the rioters, who eventually overwhelm him, beginning [[Master of Puppets|Battery]].  After the band finishes [[Nothing Else Matters]], Trip wakes up (to "[[Enter Sandman]]") on the roof of a building; his lost doll, now animated, approaches the leather bag. As Trip gets up, he is lassoed and pulled onto the rider's horse. He grabs the rider's hammer to free himself and slams the roof with it. Shock waves rumble across the city, shattering glass and the exteriors of surrounding buildings and disintegrating the rider and his horse. The reverberation affects Metallica's concert, cutting the power and knocking down lighting trusses. With a backup generator, the band continues the concert without pyrotechnics and a light show, playing [[Kill 'em All|Hit the Lights]].  Trip returns to the deserted stadium with the doll and the bag under his arm. The credits roll to scenes of the band performing "[[Master of Puppets|Orion]]" to the empty stadium. Trip takes a seat; the final shot is of the still-closed leather bag which belonged to [[Cliff Burton]] on the ''Master of Puppets'' tour.  
Metro Manila (film)
 Oscar Ramirez is a rice farmer who lives in [[Banaue|Banaue Province]] with his wife Mai and their children Angel and Baby. When his rice crops are no longer profitable, he relocates his family to [[Metro Manila]] in hopes of obtaining a higher quality of life. While searching for a job, they are offered shelter at a low-income apartment building, but are shortly evicted by the police for [[squatting]], as the men who offered them the apartment turn out to be swindlers.  The next day, the family moves into a vacated house in the slums of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] while Oscar secures a job as a security officer for Manila Armored Couriers after the other guards discover his military background. He befriends his senior officer Ong and quickly bonds with his co-workers while earning the respect of Buddha, the president of the armoured truck company. On Oscar's first day at work, Ong tells him he lost his previous partner during a failed robbery six months prior. Ong is also concerned about Oscar's residence in Tondo, which is a hotbed for criminals. One night, Oscar tells Ong the story of Alfred Santos, a man who held up an airliner and jumped off the plane to his death after losing his father and his family's silk factory to a rival company. Oscar feels responsible, as he had previously worked at the factory and did not stand up for his former employer. Ong offers Oscar a spare apartment unit in [[Makati]] for his family to live in. Meanwhile, Mai lands a job as a bar hostess at a nightclub in Makati. While undergoing the mandatory physical checkup, she is revealed to be pregnant. Mai quickly learns of the hardships she must endure as a bar hostess. When she fails to make her drink quota and her pregnancy becomes more evident, her boss proposes to have nine-year-old Angel work for special clients.  During a routine job, Oscar discovers that the client is a drug dealer and sees Ong take a handout for the delivery. The duo have a tense discussion on the corruption that shrouds Metro Manila. When Ong pulls over to find a wall to urinate on, Oscar suddenly sees a black [[Honda Civic (sixth generation)|Honda Civic]] pull over with a group of men headed toward Ong's direction. Going against his protocol, he exits the armoured van and follows the gang on foot, only to discover that they are in cahoots with Ong. After the gang leaves, Ong reveals to Oscar that after the failed robbery, he took one of the security boxes with him, and he is plotting with the gang to have the box opened by staging a robbery and having himself "debriefed" in the company's processing centre while Oscar makes an imprint of the key in another room. He also threatens to blackmail Oscar with the truth about his wife working as a bar hostess, as well as the clever scheme of renting out the spare apartment under Oscar's name and hiding the box there. Just as Ong prepares to surrender the box, he realizes that the robber in front of him is not part of the gang but the same man who killed his former partner. The man guns him down and runs away while the gang speeds off. Oscar is then given the grievous task of "postman", having to deliver Ong's personal effects and severance pay to his wife. He does not disclose Ong's plot to Buddha. As per company procedure, his pay is suspended until the investigation is closed.  Upon learning that Ong's wife is aware of the security box, Oscar races back home and finds it under the floor. He and Mai face the dilemma of what to do with the box as she tells him it was a mistake for them to move to the city. One night, after a job, Oscar sneaks into the processing centre and takes an imprint of the key while stealing another one, but is quickly caught on security camera by Buddha and immediately cornered. He is shot in the chest and dies with the key in his hand. Misled by the different key Oscar stole, the company rushes armed men to the address of the drug dealer client while JJ, Oscar's new partner, becomes the "postman" to deliver Oscar's personal effects to Mai. She notices a locket that Oscar had stolen from a shop earlier that morning; upon opening it, she discovers a clay imprint of the key to the security box in her possession. After having the key duplicated, she takes her children and the money back to the province.  
Metalhead (film)
 In the summer of 1983, a twelve-year-old girl, Hera Karlsdottir, lives a normal life on her family farm in a close-knit community. This changes once she watches her older brother Baldur fall off a tractor before his long hair is scalped by its blades. He is rushed out by the family by truck for medical attention, but he dies of his injury. At his funeral, Hera glares at the portrait of Jesus on the wall and runs out of the church during the service. Returning home, she picks up her brother's guitar and immediately adopts his metal music and fashion, burning all of her old clothes.  Years later, as Hera is a young adult, life in her home has not improved. She and her parents are still in shock and grief over Baldur's death. Meanwhile, her mother and father, respectively Droplaug and Karl, pursue community life by participating in the village church choir. There, they meet the new priest, Janus, who is liberal and rumored to be homosexual. In the local community, Hera's lifestyle stands out. She is bullied by other youths, calling her a [[Satanism|devil worshiper]]. She [[anti-social behaviour|frequently gets into trouble]], doing things such as playing her guitar too loudly in the house and drunkenly stealing her neighbor's tractor. She gets a job at a slaughterhouse, but is soon fired for playing metal music over the loudspeakers and scaring off the livestock. She went with her family to a church sermon, but disrupts it by smoking inside. As she walks out and grieves over Baldur's grave, Janus tries reaching out to her, but she initially rejects him. She goes to a community ball, but is kicked out after starting a fight.  Her childhood friend Knútur comes with her as she heads home, where they have sex. He tries to start a conversation with her afterwards, but she turns away and leaves the room. One morning, Hera dons [[corpse paint]] and furiously herds all of her family's cattle out of the barn in the middle of the winter. Later that night, Knútur comes over to her house to propose to her, but she rejects him and tosses the ring out of his hands. In the wake of Hera's behaviour, her parents called over Janus for counseling. He agrees to help her, but then tries asking Karl and Droplaug about the state of their relationship. They initially refuse to talk about it, but Karl later breaks down, blaming himself for his son's death. Afterwards, he and Droplaug open up to each other about it more and, to Hera's surprise as she comes home, their relationship starts mending.  Janus tries reaching out to Hera again, but Hera tries again to resist. She claims that Christians wouldn't understand her music when he tries discussing it with her, but he then reveals his [[Iron Maiden]] tattoo to her. They start having a friendly discourse on heavy metal music. However, when he tries talking to her on an emotional level, she instantly attempts to seduce him, causing him to leave. Meanwhile, she sees a news report about the [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal scene]] and the arson attacks associated with it. Immensely interested in it, she records a black metal demo of her own and sends a copy of it away to the post office. As Janus still tries reaching out to her, they still talk and she shows him her metal recordings. One night, though, she comes over to his house and starts exhibiting romantic feelings for him, but he then confesses that he doesn't feel mutually about her.  Emotionally estranged, Hera sets fire to the community church and runs away from her parents' home. Gathering supplies and a gun, she heads off into the nearby mountains to stay in a hunting shack. However, as she couldn't survive for long there, she returns home. Upon entering her house, she walks in on a town meeting. She breaks down and is forgiven by her neighbors and friends. As they discuss reconciliation for her actions, the townspeople explained that they will not release her identity as the arsonist. She offers to pay for the damage to the church herself, but out of empathy and realism, the townspeople stated that they will all repay and repair it together. Hera then moves in with Knútur and his family, but is pushed into seemingly giving up metal altogether. She becomes pacified and normal, but not happy.  Things changed however when three young men from Norway made a surprise visit for Hera at her parents' house. They came across her demo on the [[tape trading]] scene in Oslo and, highly impressed with it, wanted to release it on their record label. Later her mother talks to her and, perceiving Hera's discontent, tells her that it's important for her to be happy. One night, after a day of rebuilding the church with the Norwegians and townspeople, she tries apologizing to Knútur. She tries saying that she loves him, but not romantically. Emotionally inflamed, he furiously confronts her for mistreating him and leaves.  One night, Hera, clad again in [[Heavy metal fashion|heavy metal attire]], formed a band with the Norwegians and performed for the entire town. They tried playing her black metal song, but the audience couldn't tolerate it and they stop playing it. They start covering [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], which the audience is enthusiastic to listen to, but the band doesn't want to continue playing it. They ultimately played a modified version of the black metal song, with clean vocals, which both the audience and the band enjoyed. Hera is back home in her room one day and her mother walks in and plays a [[Megadeth]] song on her sound system. Karl walks in and the film ends with all three of them dancing to it.  
Metro (2013 film)
 A Moscow subway tunnel, built in 1935, is starting to fail. One tunnel night crawler, Sergeitch (Sergey Sosnowski), sees a leak in the tunnel where it runs under the [[Moscow River]] and informs the assistant station master (Michael Fateev), who mocks the old man for worrying about it, saying it's only groundwater. Meanwhile, Irina Garina (Svetlana Hodchenkova) is torn between her lover, businessman Vlad Konstantinov (Anatoly Bely), and her husband, surgeon Andrei Garin (Sergei Puskepalis). Konstantinov tries to persuade Irina to divorce Andrei. Arriving from a trip abroad, Irina spends the night with Konstantinov rather than going home. Andrei has to take their daughter Ksenya (Anfisa Wistinghausen) to school but by chance, they take the "Garden" metro station. Simultaneously, Konstantinov arrives, hurrying to work and forced to park his car because of traffic jams. Meanwhile Sergeitch, drinking with casual acquaintance Galina (Elena Panova) next to the "Garden", recalls that the water leaking into the tunnel smelled of slime, which means that it can not be groundwater. They are detained by the police for drinking alcohol in a public place but Galina manages to escape, and flees into the subway. In custody Sergeitch asks for a phone to tell the dispatcher everything, but the police turn a deaf ear to his pleas.  In the tunnel the water breaches the ceiling. The driver of the train (Konstantin Ovseannicov) that by coincidence contains Garin, Konstantinov and Galina activates the emergency brake. The train derails and crashes into the water and rubble. Some of the passengers are killed. Konstantinov, instead of going along the rails, climbs onto the roof of the car. Crawling along, he sees Garin, who is trying to find Ksjushu in a pile of bodies, and helps Garin. Garin is going to follow the others but Konstantinov stops him, pointing out that the contact rail is still electrified. The water rises, a short circuit occurs, and all who did not escape the flooded area of the tunnel die from shock. Garin, Konstantinov and Galina, courier Michael ([[Stanislav Duzhkinov]]) and a couple, Denis (Alex Bardukov) and Alisa (Katherine Spitz), finally can seek to escape. All except Michael hurriedly make their way into a passage leading to a maintenance shaft. Michael, being very frightened, refuses to enter the passage and dies when the car rolls over.  From the passage the protagonists fall into a small bunker, built during the construction of underground. Above it, the vertical maintenance shaft ends in a sewer grate. However, they cannot reach the grate, which is too high, nor can they use their mobile phones underground. The water level in the tunnel and in the well begins to rise rapidly. Tension between Konstantinov and Garin rises, as the latter cannot understand why Konstantinov feels an interest in his daughter. When the water level raises them to the level of the grate, Garin and Konstantinov manage to phone Irina but only have time to tell her that they are in the bunker. They try to attract attention through the bars, but to no avail. Irina is hysterically trying to inform the rescue team that people are in the bunker. But at this time the pressure of the water rips off the train head and the water level in the shaft falls sharply, pulling the characters back into the tunnel. The rescuers descend into the bunker, but seeing the wet walls, assume that all who were there most likely drowned.  The protagonists get to the ghost station "Borodino" (close to the "Garden") and climb onto the platform to rest. Garin makes some indirect hints to Konstantinov that show that he realizes that Konstantinov and Irina are lovers. Konstantinov and Garin fight and Konstantinov nearly drowns in the water.  In the tunnel where the train is stuck the overhead arch collapses and waters fill the tunnel. The leaders of the rescue operation manage to shut off the water. The protagonists get to the bunker and finally get out through the bars on the street. Alice and Dennis together leave the hospital. Garin and Irina tensely meet in a scene where Garin silently deflects all her pleas. The film ends with a scene where Konstantinov is driving around in different directions following the ambulance containing Garin.  
Le Mentor
 The film portrays a family and follows in particular a young woman on a journey of discovery and love.  
The Midnight Game
 Perky blonde teenager Kaitlan ([[Renee Olstead]]) has decided to invite over a few of her friends after she finds that her parents are leaving her home alone for the weekend. She's planning for a small, relatively quiet get together with her friends Jenna ([[Valentina de Angelis]]) and Rose ([[Shelby Young]]), but Kaitlan soon finds that Rose has invited boys to the party, Shane ([[Guy Wilson (actor)|Guy Wilson]]) and Jeff ([[Spencer Daniels]]). Not wanting to seem uncool, Kaitlan allows the boys to stay and party.  Eventually Shane suggests that they play The Midnight Game, where participants confess their deepest fears while performing a strange ritual. Anyone who performs the ritual inaccurately runs the risk of running into the Midnight Man, a terrifying figure that can bring the participants' fears to life. They must carry candles, and if the candle extinguishes then they must relight it in ten seconds or surround themselves instantly with a circle of salt, or the Midnight Man will catch them. The teenagers originally think the game sounds fun and do not take the idea of the ritual seriously, beginning the game gleefully.  Nothing happens for the first hour and a half, yet just as the group is starting to become complacent they begin to hear noises, and their candles start to go out. The boys decide to explore upstairs where they can hear unusual sounds, whilst the girls remain downstairs. Jeff and Shane discover a crucifix upstairs which unnerves them, and they are drawn back downstairs by the sound of the girls screaming; they saw a dark figure moving around outside the house. The candles all start to go out, and the group panics. Kaitlan attempts to end the game by turning on the lights, only to find that they do not work even though the power for the house is still running.  After some time has passed, they eventually draw a circle of salt around themselves and huddle together, eventually falling asleep. At 3:33 AM the lights turn back on and the group awakes, thinking that the game is over. They do not realise that having failed to relight their candles in ten seconds and drawing the circle of salt well after they needed to, the Midnight Man has won the game.  The next morning, Rose awakes to find Jeff is gone. She goes downstairs to the kitchen, and finds that no one knows where Jeff is; Shane assumes that he has gone to basketball practice and texts him, with no response. Jenna, unprovoked, begins to verbally abuse Rose in a bout of sudden anger, accusing her of wanting to steal Shane and always trying to copy her. The others are stunned by Jenna's sudden moodswing, and later she apologises.  Shane, Kaitlan and Jenna decide to go for a hike, whilst Rose chooses to stay at the house and take a nap. On the hike, Jenna begins accusing Shane of cheating on her and acts extremely angry for no reason, until her mood suddenly changes and she is abnormally happy, seeing shapes in the clouds that do not exist and skipping along. Meanwhile, back at the house, Rose begins to hear strange noises and hallucinate unnerving things. Eventually, she walks into a room and sees the Midnight Man, a demonic pitch black figure.  On the hike, Shane receives a text from Rose begging him to help her, and despite Jenna screaming for no reason when he suggests they go back, he and the others return to the house to find Rose huddled in the kitchen, clutching a knife and having a panic attack from seeing the Midnight Man. Shane coaxes Rose to drop the knife, and as she does Jenna begins panicking and acting paranoid. The group deduces that this must be because of the Midnight Game, and Rose decides to go home.  On her way home, Rose starts to hallucinate the Midnight Man again. She sees Jeff at the side of the road and pulls over to talk to him, only to find that he is undead. Rose backs away, and is hit by a car. She then wakes up in the car and realises that this was a hallucination, and decides to go back to the house. Back at the house, Jenna has been growing increasingly panicked and paranoid, hallucinating that Shane cheated on her with Kaitlan. She breaks down, and Shane attempts to comfort her.  The group realise that the reason these things are happening to them is because they did not follow the rules of the Midnight Game, and they decide to play again to see if that will end the chain of horrific events. As they begin the game for the second time, Shane recalls a blog he read on the internet about a boy who did not follow the rules of the game and ended up reliving his worst fears over and over until his death, and the theories he has read that people get trapped in an endless cycle of reliving their death over and over. He fears that this will happen to them.  As they play the game, the candles blow out and they are unable to relight them. They intend to surround themselves with salt, but accidentally spill the salt, leaving them trapped to face the Midnight Man. Jenna goes upstairs, where she is taunted by a hallucination saying that everyone is against her and is driven to hang herself. Kaitlan is pushed off the balcony by the Midnight Man. Shane receives a text from Jeff stating he is in the basement, and discovers Jeff's corpse in a casket. When he returns to the house, Rose states that "he is behind you'", and he turns to see the Midnight Man. Shane runs out the house, pursued by the Midnight Man.  Suddenly, the clock turns to 3:33, and Shane, Rose, Kaitlan and Jenna all wake up on the floor, still alive. Jeff enters the house with a bottle of wine, and they are shocked to see that he is okay. It seems as though the five have survived the midnight game and that things will return to normal. However, the house is then shown to have been vacated for two years, and a realtor shows a prospective tenant around the house. He is put off buying it when he realizes it is where "the incident with the high school kids" took place and discusses the incident with the realtor; how four high school students died, and one (Shane) disappeared, believed to have killed the others.  As the man and the realtor pull away from the house, Rose's car is shown pulling up to the front as it had at the beginning of the film, and the events from the beginning play out for a few minutes. As the camera pans away from the girls entering the house, Shane's corpse is shown in a pile of leaves across the street, vaguely hinting that the five teenagers are all dead and are stuck in an endless cycle of the Midnight Game.

During a session that goes wrong, John suffers a stroke and is left incapacitated for two years. Financially ruined, he still owns the beach house where his wife died, but refuses to sell it. Desperate for money, John asks his old superior, Sebastian, for a new job. The case he receives is that of a brilliant but troubled 16-year-old girl, Anna Greene, who is on a hunger strike. Her stepfather wants her sent to a mental institution, which Anna's mother and, of course, Anna herself are adamantly against. John is sent there to end her hunger strike.  John and Anna begin their therapy sessions, focusing on Anna's time at a prestigious girl's school and several incidents that happened there. John finds himself drawn to Anna but is also wary of her. Anna's maid, Judith, who John had just started dating, is thrown down the stairs, and Anna is blamed for the incident. John also harbors suspicions towards Anna's stepfather, who he believes has hired a mysterious man to shadow him, as well as towards Sebastian, who John learns has withheld a file on Anna from him. Anna's behavior towards John becomes more flirtatious, and she draws a portrait of him with the caption, "You are my only safe place."  John learns that Anna had been involved in a sexual relationship with her photography teacher, Tom Ortega, who took erotic pictures of her. However, when he interviews Ortega, who is now serving time in prison, he insists that Anna was the aggressor and set him up. In another session, John and Anna go back to an incident at the school where three of Anna's classmates were poisoned. John accuses Anna of the act but she blames it on another student, nicknamed Mousey. However, when John interviews one of the poisoned girls, she says Mousey does not exist. Anna is able to regain his trust by showing him a photograph of herself and Mousey together.  John and Anna go further back into her memories and recover an image of Sebastian approaching her as a four-year-old, which causes John to believe that Anna was sexually molested as a child by Sebastian. John accuses his boss of molesting Anna, an allegation Sebastian vehemently denies. John informs Anna's parents of his diagnosis and suggests they don't institutionalize their daughter as they had planned. Back at his home, John discovers that the signature on Anna's portrait of him matches one supposedly written by Mousey on the photograph. Going through Anna's yearbook, he sees that the girl from Anna's memories was not nicknamed Mousey. Just then he gets a frantic, fragmentary phone call from Anna.  John races to her home to find that someone has broken in. From the house's security room, John sees Anna, distraught at discovering the murdered bodies of her parents, fleeing in panic from an unseen assailant. John calls the police, is told that someone else has already called them, and then follows Anna into the woods. As the police begin to arrive, Anna comes up to John, tells him she is sorry, and then runs away. The police arrest John for supposedly attacking Anna. There is blood on his hands and other evidence which seems to indicate that he broke in, drugged her parents, who are revealed to be still alive, and then attacked her.  After being arrested, interrogated by the police and jailed, John is visited by the man who has been following him. It turns out that this man is another memory detective who has been conducting sessions with John to recover the truth about Anna. The memory detective concludes that Anna manipulated her own memories in order to frame John as her killer. Instead, she likely faked her own death in order to [[Runaway (dependent)|escape her parents]], who she knew would never stop searching for her if she were alive. John apologizes to Sebastian, who promises to use this new information to secure John's release.  Elsewhere, Anna arranges to have John sent a single red rose, along with a picture of her holding a recent newspaper so he will know she is still alive. John, now released from prison, drives out to the beach house where he sees the family who bought it sitting happily together on the front porch. John is then able to move on with his life and find peace with Judith.

He is instructed in how to work undercover by Special Agent Kazumi Akagiri and sent to an illegal casino run by the Akogi-gumi, an arm of the Sukiya-kai. He intentionally gets caught cheating in order to meet the boss Masaya Hiura, a.k.a. "Crazy Papillon", who is impressed by his humor and exchanges vows of brotherhood with him, bringing him into the Sukiya-kai. Kazumi informs Reiji that he is sure that the Sukiya-kai makes its money from selling [[MDMA]] but he cannot connect the street dealers to the yakuza. Reiji asks Hiura if the Akogi-gumi is clean and Hiura explains that his father Masayoshii Ako says that "drugs are the root of all evil."<br> Junna, another policewoman on the force, is upset that Reiji is not responding to her texts and angrily texts that she will not pop his cherry if he does not respond soon. Kazumi sends her to a brothel called True Love in [[Kabukichō]], where she and her fellow policewoman are recruited as escorts. Junna encounters Reiji at the brothel and is upset that he has decided to join the yakuza, unaware that he is a mole.

Nekozawa attempts to rape Junna at the brothel but Reiji fights him and his men off. Hiura takes over the brothel as a new revenue source for their clan and rewards Reiji by introducing him to his father Masayoshi Ako.<br> At the meeting Reiji drops a pill of MDMA and it is picked up by Kenta Kurokawa. Reiji meets Kenta later to become partners in the drug business run by Ako and Kenta that is secret from everyone else in the Akogi-gumi and the two make a pact through a game of [[Russian roulette]]. Reiji informs Kazumi of this by phone but then he is captured by Kuroken, a yakuza biker with a full-body leopard tattoo, and taken to Nekozawa, who has shot his own men and plans to blame it on Reiji. Aiko calls and tells Nekozawa and told that Reiji has not yet taken part in the [[sakazuki]] ritual and therefore is not yet a member of the Sukiya-kai. Nekozawa vows to start the clan war as soon as Reiji takes part in the sakazuki ritual. The biker finds Hiura on the road and attempts to shoot him. Hiura knocks him off his bike and enjoys the banter they have, inviting him to continue their conflict as he leaves.<br> Reiji assists Hiura with some debt collection for the clan and Hiura personally flies them to [[Aoushi Island]] in a small plane to collect 40 million yen from Akio Sakuno, the man who brought Hiura into the life but whose formerly swank lifestyle has been destroyed by drugs. Akio has gone into hiding so Hiura and Reiji visit his parents Yahei and Shizue Sakuno to collect the debt but they find the elderly couple living in an old shack and Hiura instead gives them a gift of 2 million yen. Reiji is impressed and decides to take part in the sakazuki ritual in order to take out the drug dealers. Shuho Todoroki attends the ceremony where Reiji gives him the evil eye and is forced to explain that he plans to take out Shuho and become the head man. His passion reminds Shuho of the old days and they make him a yakuza, explaining that betrayal will mean his death and that he must now obey Ako as his father. Shuho acts as witness and witnesses Reiji wholeheartedly eat the ceramic saucer to combine it with his soul and Hiura acts as mediator to complete the ceremony.<br> Nekozawa immediately responds with war and attacks Reiji's crew on the street, where Hiura is seriously injured shielding Reiji from an exploding grenade. The Hachinosu-kai distribute a fake notice to their family and to the police that Reiji injured two unarmed members of their family in order to justify the war. While visiting the comatose Hiura in the hospital, Tsukihara tells Ako that the Russian mafia wants to sell a million pills of MDMA and that Nekozawa's clan tried offering 800 yen per pill but that was not enough. Ako replaces Hiura with Tsukihara as his No. 2. Reiji, fearing that he will die a virgin, has sex with Junna. Reiji tells the police about the drug deal and they tell him that Tsukihara is Ako's illegitimate child and must be arrested as well because he controls Ako's side businesses and finances. They also tell him that Hiura was abducted by a man with leopard tattoos. Hiura awakens in captivity, his legs having been amputated. A doctor who does not speak Japanese fits him with prosthetic legs.<br> Reiji convinces Tsukihara to tell him about the drug business and gives the police one of the cans from Tsukihara's dog food business used to transport the drugs. He must attend the drug deal aboard the Russian boat ''Crime & Punishment'' near the docks and avoid the DEA and the police who want him for attempted murder as well as Nekozawa in order to have Todoroki arrested and prove his innocence with the assistance of Kazumi's team waiting to ambush the yakuza. Tsukihara anticipates the ambush and instead secretly has the MDMA delivered by swimming dogs. Nekozawa surprises the police ambush and is chased off by them but then reaches Reiji and attacks him as Reiji pantomimes a swimming dog to the police running surveillance. The police attempt to sacrifice Reiji but he fights back with new confidence. Kuroken arrives on a motorcycle and brings Hiura, whose new legs enable the Crazy Papillon to take flying leaps and fight off the yakuza clans. Kuroken shoots a rocket launcher into a crane, which collapses and crushes Nekozawa. Reiji pursues Tsukihara and is shot by him but the bullet is stopped by the bulletproof vest that Junna fashioned for him. Reiji defeats Tsukihara in a fistfight and has him arrested. Tsukihara takes full blame for the drug deal so Reiji is unable to arrest Ako or Shuho but he is glad that he has stopped the war between the Sukiya-kai and the Hachinosu-kai. The film ends with Hiura pulling his fancy red car up to the hiding Reiji with Kuroken in the passenger seat and Hiura saying that he thought of something funny.

There, she discovers mounting evidence that John has not been home for a long time.  Worried, she contacts the police, and Sergeant Goodman takes her report, though he suggests that John may simply not want to contact her.  At an exhibition of her work, her daughter Jessie rebukes her efforts at reconciliation, and Lee mistakes a stranger for John.  Haunted by her experiences in Somalia, Lee experiences mental breakdown and leaves the bathroom completely naked.  Her ex-husband and daughter escort her out and have her committed to an upscale psychiatric hospital.  At the hospital, Dr. Bloom expresses skepticism at Lee's insistence that she has killed John.  Instead, Dr. Bloom suggests that Lee may have created a [[false memory]] to cope with the stress in her life.  Peter, a defense attorney who blames himself for the subsequent murder of a legal aide by a murderer he helped to free, offers to put his office at her disposal.  Lee is stunned by the resemblance between John and Peter, but tells Dr. Bloom that they are polar opposites in personality and demeanor.  Flashbacks and psychotherapy sessions reveal that Lee and John met in a hospital after he was involved in a car accident, and she was the victim for a suicide bombing.  Peter hires a private investigator to research John's disappearance, and further flashbacks fill in details about John and Lee's romance.  Intrigued by John's background as a wrongly-convicted felon, Lee invites him to pose for her as a model.  Although wary of more attention from photographers, he agrees, and they begin to develop a bond.  At the same time, Jessie develops a resentment toward their growing closeness.  Later flashbacks reveal repressed memories that John had briefly dated Jessie before becoming involved with Lee.  Furious, Lee breaks up with John, and Jessie wishes that her mother had died in the suicide bombing.  Peter, Lee, and Jessie all grow closer to each other and begin to unravel more drama.  Jessie apologizes to her mother and admits that she knew there was an attraction between John and her mother, but Jessie still chose to pursue John.  She swears her mother to secrecy, and Lee promises to never to Peter.  Meanwhile, Peter and Jessie go hiking together, and Lee panics when they don't return in time for a scheduled dinner.  Peter's brief disappearance conjures all sorts of conspiracies in Lee's mind, and Sgt. Goodman expresses suspicion that either Lee or Jessie may be John's murderer after he finds a bracelet owned by Lee and worn by Jessie.  After Peter cuts short an interview by Lee with the police, he reveals that he is dating Jessie.  Peter's research reveals evidence that John may still be alive.  However, it turns out to be Thomas, John's houseguest, using John's credit card.  Peter alerts Sgt. Goodman, who searches the premises and finds John's decomposing body and a suicide note.  Freed of suspicion from both herself and the police, Lee begins to recover and soon leaves the psychiatric hospital; at the same time, she realizes that Peter and John look nothing alike, and the perceived similarities in appearance were only her imagination.  Although she has promised Jessie to stay closer to home, she takes another job in the Middle East and asks Jessie to understand.  Jessie finally accepts that her mother is a war photographer and gives her blessing.  When Lee returns to active work, she is suddenly struck by the fear that her entire life may be a false memory.

Monsters University
  Michael "Mike" Wazowski aspires to become a scarer – a monster who enters the human world at night to scare children and harvest their screams for energy – after visiting Monsters Inc., Monstropolis' most profitable scaring company, on a school field trip. Eleven years later, Mike is a first-year scare major at Monsters University, where he meets James P. "Sulley" Sullivan. Mike studies hard, while the privileged Sulley, coming from a family of talented scarers, relies only on his natural ability and begins to falter. As the semester progresses, Mike and Sulley attempt to join a fraternity, but only Sulley is accepted into Roar Omega Roar, the strongest fraternity on campus. At the semester's final exam, a fight between the two causes them to accidentally break Dean Abigail Hardscrabble's cherished Scream Can. Hardscrabble fails both of them immediately, stating that Sulley did not study enough, and Mike is not scary enough, and Roar Omega Roar kicks Sulley from their group.  Wanting to prove himself, Mike enters the university's "Scare Games", and makes a wager with Hardscrabble: she will reinstate him and his team to the scare program if they win, but Mike must leave the university if they lose. He joins a group of misfits named Oozma Kappa, the weakest fraternity on campus, but they are denied entry to the Games for being one team member short. Sulley subsequently joins them, seeing the competition as his ticket back into the scare program. Oozma Kappa finish last in the first challenge, but are saved from elimination after another team is disqualified for cheating. Oozma Kappa improve gradually due to Mike's training and intricate knowledge of scaring, and they advance through each following challenge, finishing just behind Roar Omega Roar. In the final round, they defeat Roar Omega Roar with a decisive final scare by Mike in the simulation bedroom. However, Mike soon discovers that he only won because Sulley changed the machine's difficulty to the easiest setting.  Determined to prove that he can become a scarer, Mike breaks into the school's door-making lab. He enters a door to the human world that leads to a summer camp, but he is unable to scare a cabin full of children, and flees into the woods. Meanwhile, Roar Omega Roar offers to reinstate Sulley, but he declines, instead confessing to Hardscrabble that he cheated just as she is alerted to Mike's break-in. Hardscrabble forbids anyone else from going through the door, but Sulley sneaks through to rescue Mike. After reconciling, they try to return, but are unable to exit after Hardscrabble deactivates the door while waiting for the authorities to arrive. Pursued by camp rangers, Mike realizes that the only way to escape is to generate enough scream energy to power the door from their side. Working together, Sulley and Mike terrify the camp rangers and generate an overwhelming amount of scream energy, returning to the lab seconds before the device overloads, and explodes in front of Hardscrabble.  Mike and Sulley are expelled from the university as a result of their actions, while the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program for the next semester, as Hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in the Games. As Mike leaves on the bus, Sulley runs after him to raise his spirits. Hardscrabble then appears and wishes them good luck, claiming they were the first students to have surprised her. The two take jobs in the mail room of Monsters, Inc., eventually working their way up to join the scarer team.  In a post-credits scene, a slug finally makes it to the school, but learns from a janitor that he missed the entire school year due to his slowness, much to his dismay.  
Moondru Per Moondru Kadal
 Varun ([[Vimal (actor)|Vimal]]) and Anjana’s (Lasini) love story happens in the [[Ooty]] mountains (in Tamil literature, they are referred to as Kurinji); Guna ([[Cheran (director)|Cheran]]) and Mallika’s ([[Muktha (actress)|Muktha Bhanu]]) story happens in [[Tuticorin]] seashore (Neidhal); and Harris ([[Arjun Sarja]]) and Divya’s ([[Surveen Chawla]]) story happens in the city (Marudham). The story revolves around these couples and the trials and tribulations they face.  Varun explains the story of his life where he had fallen with Anjana, in spite of knowing that her engagement has been called off, but later sacrifices his love after hearing Guna and Mallika's story.  Guna is a philanthropist who runs an organisation called "Punnagai," a rehabilitation center for jail prisoners. Mallika, a physiotherapist silently pines love for him. When Guna failed to unite a prisoner ([[Aadukalam Naren]]) with his family, Mallika does the job. Impressed with her, he handles the responsibility of taking care of Punnagai to her and leaves the town.  Another story is of Harris, a swimming coach and his student-cum-lover Divya (Varun claims that Divya is his childhood friend, but there is no scene where they are together). Divya is disappointed for losing the swimming match, and her father Thiruvengadam ([[Thambi Ramaiah]]) advises another coach Elango ([[John Vijay]]) to replace Harris with another coach, but Divya is adamant that Harris should be her coach. Meanwhile, Harris gets involved in a bike accident where his legs and hands have been hurt, but he encourages Divya to take part in the Olympics swimming match. Divya practices for the match rigorously and wins the competition by finishing it in less than 56 seconds.  In 2016, Varun narrated these stories, because they prompted him to write a novel called "Moondru Kaadhal". Harris arrives at the press conference of the book release and tells that he is alive because of Divya. She is the epitome of goodness and confidence, and he narrates that though Divya had won the match, she died due to heart attack on the swimming pool. The film ends with Harris uttering ''Kaadhal Ketpadhalla Koduppadhu'' ("Love is not to be asked but to be given").  
Mood Indigo (film)
 Colin has a very pleasant life: he is rich, he loves the food his cook makes (Nicolas), he loves his pianocktail (contraction of piano and cocktail, a word invented by Vian) and his friend Chick.  One day while having lunch with Chick, Chick tells him that he met a girl named Alise with whom he has a common passion: the writer Jean-Sol Partre (a [[spoonerism]] of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was Boris Vian's friend).  Colin meets Chloe at a party Chick invited him to. They fall in love, marry, but Chloe becomes ill during their honeymoon. As time passes, Chloe's condition deteriorates while the relationship between Chick and Alise turns sour.    Colin spends his fortune on treating Chloe, which causes him to passionately fire his cook and sell his pianocktail, and he slips into poverty as Chloe passes away.  His friend Chick spends both his and Colin's money on anything that has to do with Partre, and Chick loses his job due to a Partre-related incident and is later killed when resisting law-enforcement officers.  Alise tracks down Partre himself and kills him.    The aesthetic of the film changes from colorful and whimsical to monochromatic and tragic as the film progresses.  These effects are observed most acutely in Colin's home, which decays supernaturally, and his mouse, who reluctantly tolerates the house until he abandons Colin.

Movie 43
 ''Movie 43'' is a series of different sketches containing different scenes and scenarios.  ===The Pitch=== * Produced and directed by [[Peter Farrelly]] and written by Rocky Russo, Jeremy Sosenko, and Ricky Blitt  The film is composed of multiple comedy shorts presented through an overarching segment titled "The Pitch", in which [[Charles B. Wessler|Charlie Wessler]], a mad screenwriter, is attempting to pitch a script to film executive Griffin Schraeder. After revealing several of the stories in his script, Wessler becomes agitated when Schraeder dismisses his outrageous ideas, and he pulls a gun on him and forces him to listen to multiple other stories before making Schraeder consult his manager, Bob Mone, to purchase the film. When they do so, Mone's condescending, humiliating attitude toward Schraeder angers him to the point that, after agreeing to make the film "the biggest film since ''[[Howard the Duck (film)|Howard the Duck]]''", he confronts Mone in the parking lot with a gun and tries to make him perform fellatio on the security guard (Wessler had gotten on the lot by doing the same thing) and kill him if he does not make the film. Wessler tries to calm Schraeder down with more story ideas to no avail, but Mone pulls out a gun and shoots Schraeder to death.

J. make a video in the style of [[MTV]]'s ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' and upload it on [[YouTube]] where it instantly reaches over 1,000,000 views. This turns out to be an [[April Fool's|April Fool's prank]] from Calvin's younger brother Baxter, who cloned YouTube and hyper-inflated the views while working on his science project. Calvin and J.J. attempt to get revenge. They tell Baxter of a film that's so dangerous it will cause the annihilation of the world. The movie is known as Movie 43. While J.J. and Baxter look for Movie 43 on [[Google]], Calvin retrieves Baxter's laptop and loads it with [[Computer viruses|viruses]] from porn sites, and masturbates to a strip tease video on the porn sites in a bathroom. Baxter finds hundreds of results for Movie 43 on a website referred to by him as a dark corner of the [[Internet]]. They find the sketches starting from the 43rd search on the list of results. As he and J.J. keep watching videos, they are interrupted by a man known as Vrankovich and a group of Chinese mobsters who are tempted to find Movie 43, even going as far as to take J.J.'s classmate Stevie Schraeder, film executive Griffin Schraeder's oldest son, hostage. Vrankovich warns them that if they find Movie 43, civilization will be left to ruins. They ignore his claims and keep searching. They eventually find the real, the one and only ''Movie 43'', which turns out to involve Baxter as a profane commando who leads a group of recruits to survive after the world has ended. As Calvin finishes ruining Baxter's laptop, their mother enters, wearing the same shirt and shorts that the woman in the strip tease video wore, causing Calvin to flip out after realizing that he had masturbated to a video of his mother.

Mr. Jones (2013 film)
 Scott (Jon Foster) and Penny (Sarah Jones) move out to the woods for a year to make a nature documentary. After a few weeks tensions rise as it becomes obvious that the project isn't as well thought out as they had intended. Things begin to look up when Scott's backpack is stolen and they trace the thief to a cabin not far from the one that they are staying in. This new cabin is surrounded by bizarre stick figures and other strange objects.  They go into the cabin and retrieve his backpack. Scott sees that there is a basement, and a sub-basement, and wants to explore more, but Penny persuades him to leave. They realize that this is the home of the almost legendary and mysterious artist, Mr. Jones (Mark Steger).  Scott and Penny decide to make Mr. Jones the subject of their documentary. Scott flies back to New York City where he discovers that Mr. Jones is an elusive artist who has been sending his artwork to random people across the country with no rhyme or reason. He interviews several of them, all of whom seem to indicate that the weird figures have led to disturbing events in their lives. One tells him that he should stop his investigation of Mr. Jones, and if he sees him, he should just run away.  While Scott is away, Penny goes out to photograph Mr. Jones' figures. On one occasion, he approaches her silently from behind, carrying a new figure. Penny tries to ask Mr. Jones for an interview but he does not respond. As she approaches him, she is shocked to glimpse a gnarled and blackened face. She leaves, but films Mr. Jones putting up his new figure from a distance. Darkness falls and suddenly Penny is terrified as thunderous growls fill the air and she glimpses a disfigured face watching her from the bushes. She runs around disoriented until she sees Mr. Jones in the distance holding a lantern. Penny makes a decision to follow him and eventually Mr. Jones' lantern dissolves into one of the lights of her own cabin, and Mr. Jones vanishes. Penny later tells Scott that she felt safe, and thought that Mr. Jones guided her home.  Scott returns to the woods and he and Penny make plans to return to Mr. Jones's house. They wait outside until he leaves, and then Scott sneaks in with Penny keeping watch and communicating by radio. Scott enters the house and goes down into both the basement and the sub-basement where he finds a huge underground maze of tunnels filled with more stick figures. In one of the rooms he finds a figure the size of a doll, with candles for eyes. He puts it in his backpack and starts to make his way out.  Outside, Penny is trying to warn Scott that Mr. Jones has returned. She can't reach him though, and her camera crashes to the ground. Underground, Scott is having trouble finding his way out. He frantically calls Penny, but can't reach her. Eventually he finds the right passage and runs out of the house. Penny is nowhere to be found.  Scott runs back to his own house, determined to find Penny. What he does find is that there are now stick figures in his front lawn, and even inside of his cabin. Penny turns up in their bedroom, seemingly unharmed. She doesn't know how she got there as she just remembers waking up there.  Scott and Penny are now terrorized with a series of bizarre and dreamlike images where they encounter strange sounds, a monitor that shows them video footage of themselves that they didn't film, and even a duplicate of Scott who is trying to break into the house. Time is also distorted as they experience a night that doesn't seem to end, even though their clocks indicate it should be mid-morning. During one episode of terrifying noises outside, there is an urgent knocking on the door. Penny tells Scott to open it, and that it's Mr. Jones. Scott opens the door to find a masked figure who grabs Scott - but he is just trying to hold on in vain as strong winds suck him away into the night. Scott is left holding only the visitor's sack-like mask in his hands.  Eventually they decide to leave the cabin and hike out of the area. Immediately they are separated and Scott runs into a duplicate of Penny who urges him to return the doll that he stole. Another Penny tells him that she never returned to the cabin and that Mr. Jones is gone. She wants him to forget about the doll and just leave.  Scott ends up back in Mr. Jones' house and in the sub-basement where he is chased by hooded figures. He returns the doll and relights the candles in its eyes. He then puts on the mask he was left with earlier and pulls up his hood, making him look quite strange and bizarre.  In the final scene we see Scott kissing Penny goodbye. A voice over suggests that he has become Mr. Jones. Apparently Mr. Jones was a shaman that guarded the borderline between a dream world and the waking world. Somehow Scott and Penny disturbed the balance between those worlds, so now Scott must protect it.

Jay stakes out the suspicious building in the country, and sees a man in an orange car hand over Wayne to someone in a Land Rover. Jay later meets Johnno at a diner.

Nebraska (film)
 In [[Billings, Montana]], a police officer arrives and discovers Woody Grant walking around in the traffic. Woody is picked up by his son David, who learns that Woody wants to go to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], to collect a million dollar sweepstakes prize he believes he has won. When David sees the sweepstakes letter, he knows immediately that it is a mail scam designed to get gullible people to purchase magazine subscriptions. David brings his father home, where his mother Kate becomes increasingly annoyed by Woody's insistence on collecting the money.  After Woody is picked up again trying to get to Nebraska, David and his brother Ross discuss putting Woody in a retirement home. David pays a visit with his ex-girlfriend, Noel, who returns his belongings and refuses to move back in with him. Their conversation is cut short by a call from Kate reporting that Woody has taken off once again. David retrieves Woody and decides to drive him all the way to Lincoln, much to Kate's dismay.  While in [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], Woody goes on a [[Binge drinking|bender]] and hits his head while stumbling back to their motel room. David takes him to the hospital to get his head stitched up. David learns that they will be passing through Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska, and suggests they spend the night with Woody's family. Woody is against the idea, but they end up going anyway.  They stay with Woody's brother Ray, his wife, and their two sons, Cole and Bart. Woody and David visit a mechanic shop Woody once co-owned, followed by some beers at a bar. When David brings up Woody's [[alcoholism]] and problems within the family—with Woody implying that he did not love Kate nor really want children—they get into an argument. At another bar, they meet Ed Pegram, whom the family blames for stealing Woody's [[air compressor]] decades ago. Over David's objections, Woody mentions winning the money and the barflies toast his good fortune. The next day, they learn that the news has spread through the town like wildfire.  Kate arrives by bus in Hawthorne, where David escorts his parents to the cemetery. Kate pays her respects there while providing some colorful history on Woody's relatives, particularly their sex lives. A local newspaper owner wants to run a story about Woody and his sweepstakes "victory." She is an old lover of Woody's and provides David with some background about his father, including how he was affected and turned to alcohol after being shot down during the [[Korean War]]. That night, Ed corners David in the men's room about some money Ed loaned Woody years ago that he wants back, threatening legal action.  The rest of Woody's family, including Ross, come to visit him. Cole and Bart, and others approach David and Ross about their share of the money that they believe Woody owes them. A fight begins, ending abruptly with Kate calling out the relatives for their own unpaid debts. David, Kate, Ross and Woody tour the former's childhood home, which has fallen into disrepair. They drive past a house Kate identifies as Ed's, so David and Ross conspire to steal back the air compressor. Kate soon realizes that the house actually belongs to another couple. She distracts the homeowners so David and Ross can quickly return the stolen compressor.  At the bar, asking Woody for money, Ed reveals that Woody cheated on Kate before David's birth. As they leave, they are attacked by a masked Bart and Cole, who escape with the sweepstakes letter. They later tell David they threw it away after finding out it was a scam. Nevertheless, David and Woody go searching for it. They enter a bar where they find Ed reading the letter aloud to the other patrons, humiliating Woody. After Woody takes the letter back and goes outside, David punches Ed in the face.  Woody has repeatedly said he wants to buy a truck with the money. He cannot drive any more, but Woody tells his son that he also wants to leave something for his family when he passes. David says that they are not going to Lincoln, at which point Woody collapses. David takes him to the hospital in [[Norfolk, Nebraska|Norfolk]]. In the middle of the night, Woody abruptly leaves and starts walking, so David relents and drives Woody to Lincoln.  They arrive at the marketing agency, where they are told that Woody did not have the winning number. He is given a consolation gift of a hat that reads "Prize Winner". David goes to an auto dealership and trades in his [[Subaru]] for a late-model truck that his father always wanted, along with a new [[Craftsman (tools)|craftsman]] air compressor. While driving back through Hawthorne, David lets Woody take the wheel for all to see, hiding below the dash to allow Woody to feel that his days of independence are not over yet. Among them is Woody's former flame who smiles at him, a nonplussed Ed with a black eye, and Woody's brother Albert. Woody waves goodbye and drives out of town, then stops in the middle of the road and switches seats with David, who takes them the rest of the way back home.

New World (2013 film)
  Chairman Seok Dong-chool of Goldmoon International, South Korea's largest corporate crime syndicate, is killed in a mysterious car accident, and the possible successors are Jung Chung, Lee Joong-gu, and to a lesser extent, Jang Su-ki. Goldmoon is an amalgamation of several crime factions that were assimilated by the dominant Jaebum clan. Jung Chung was the former head of the Chinese-descended Northmoon clan, the largest of Jaebum's rival factions, until it merged, and has since become senior managing director of Goldmoon. Lee Joong-gu is the former second-in-command of the Jaebum clan, but was pushed down by Jung after the merging and serves as a managing director instead, despite being backed by the Jaebum faction, which as a whole holds the most power. Jang Su-ki, as the vice chairman of Goldmoon, is officially the heir apparent but his Je-il clan was dissolved during the merging and his position in the group is strictly a formality, with no real power or involvement in day-to-day operations of the syndicate. Although Jung has the highest chance of becoming the heir, Jung's right-hand man, sales director Lee Ja-sung ([[Lee Jung-jae]]), is really an undercover police officer. Ja-sung has been operating for eight years and is exhausted and constantly worried of being discovered. He was promised reassignment to an overseas position in the police force, but he is forced to keep working undercover with the threat of having his true identity leaked if he refuses.  Chief Kang ([[Choi Min-sik]]) and Director Ko wish to influence the succession to favor the weakest candidate, Jang, with the plan resulting in the syndicate being taken down before it grows too powerful for it to be contained by the police. They first ask Ja-sung to leak incriminating evidence about Jung. Then they go to Jung, and convince him to leak evidence about his rival Lee in exchange for not being prosecuted. Once Lee is in jail, they inform Lee that Jung betrayed him, the result of which is that Lee sends directions for Jung's murder.  Jung remains confused as to how the police got the evidence against him, and is insulted when Chief Kang refuses a bribe from Jung in a later meeting. He pays a large sum of money for Chinese hackers to investigate, which leads to the discovery of three undercover police within his staff, one of them being Ja-sung, the second being Ja-sung's Go instructor Shin Woo, who was actually his handler, and his own right-hand man Oh Seok-mu, to which Ja-sung was completely unaware of his real identity. He spares Ja-sung because they have become good friends to the point of Jung calling Ja-sung his brother, and proceeds to murder the other two. Shortly after, Lee's followers ambush Jung's faction, during which Jung, whilst killing most of his assailants, is mortally wounded. While lying in the hospital near his death, Jung tells Ja-sung that he needs to decide his loyalty, stating it will be the only way he can survive.  Chief Kang breaks his promise to Ja-sung once more by refusing to let him disappear, instead making him Jang's vice chairman upon Jang becoming chairman, thus giving Ja-sung more access to sensitive information that can take down the syndicate in the future. Moreover, Ja-sung's wife, who has been secretly spying on him on Chief Kang's behalf, was pregnant, but the stress from Ja-sung's profession and her own spy work, along the sudden shock of an attempted hit by Lee's men, results in a miscarriage. It also happens at this point that Lee is released from jail, due to the evidence against him proving to be insufficient. Lee will certainly seek the death of Ja-sung but Chief Kang show no concern for this, due to Lee seemingly losing all his power after the attack on Jung's faction and the public fiasco afterward resulting in his entire faction being banished from the syndicate.  Jang, who is poised to succeed, tries to kill Ja-sung, an event which Chief Kang anticipated but also did nothing to stop. However, Ja-sung had already secured the loyalty of Jang's men, along with Jung's faction, leading to Jang's own death, as well as Ja-sung's unanimous succession as chairman. Feeling deeply betrayed by Chief Kang's constant refusal to let him walk away, Ja-sung decides to become a full criminal. He orders the murder of Chief Kang and Director Ko so that no record will remain of his old identity. He also murders Lee, his only possible rival, as revenge for Jung.  The last scene is a flash-back from six years ago, when Ja-sung was still beginning as an undercover cop. He and Jung, at that time low-level members, successfully kill a much larger group of rival criminals, seemingly enjoying the process. This demonstrates Ja-sung's early corruption and also the depth of Jung's friendship with him.<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

Night Train to Lisbon (film)
 Walking over a bridge in [[Bern]], Raimund Gregorius, a Swiss professor of ancient languages, notices a young woman in a red coat standing on the railing, about to leap. Dropping his briefcase, he runs and pulls her down. She helps him gather the papers that have spilled from his briefcase and accompanies him to the school where he teaches. But instead of waiting to talk, she leaves during the middle of his class, without her coat.  Concerned, Raimund grabs the coat and runs after her, but in vain. He checks her pockets for identification. All he finds is a small book, a memoir of sorts, by Amadeu do Prado. It is stamped with the address of the bookstore, so he goes there. The bookseller remembers the girl's purchasing this obscure book and, as he leafs through it, a train ticket to [[Lisbon, Portugal|Lisbon]] falls out. The train is, in fact, leaving in 15 minutes. Confused and doubtful, Raimund rushes to the station, but the woman is nowhere in sight. At the last moment he decides to use the ticket himself, and during the journey he reads the book.  Amadeu do Prado lived in Lisbon, so Raimund searches for him, hoping that this will lead to the woman. He finds Amadeu's home, where the writer's sister, Adriana, welcomes Raimund; she gives the impression her brother still lives there. Raimund learns that Amadeu was a doctor, and that only 100 copies of his book were printed. When Raimund asks what happened to their father, Adriana's reaction is hostile. As Raimund is leaving, the maid informs him that he can find Amadeu in the town's cemetery. Raimund finds the tomb: Amadeu died in 1974.  In the street, a bicyclist runs into Raimund and smashes his glasses. While obtaining new glasses from a local optician, Mariana, Raimund narrates his experiences. When he returns to collect the glasses, Mariana tells Raimund her uncle knew Amadeu de Prado well and is willing to talk to Raimund.  Raimund and Mariana both go to the nursing home where her uncle João Eça resides, and Raimund learns João and Amadeu were both in the resistance against the [[António de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar dictatorship]], which story is told in continuing flashbacks as the film continues. Raimund then visits the priest who taught and later buried Amadeu de Prado. The priest explains that Amadeu, a smart young boy from an aristocratic background, befriended Jorge O'Kelly, another bright boy in the school though of lowly means. The boys bonded through their love for knowledge, particularly the philosophical and political knowledge not permitted under Salazar. Amadeu gave a graduation speech that reflected his contempt for the regime, much to the chagrin of his father, a well respected judge.  Raimund returns to Adriana and asks for her side of the story, and then he revisits João to obtain more information. Raimund learns that Amadeu died of an [[aneurysm]], which he knew he had, but had not told Adriana about. As a doctor, Amadeu never refused a patient, and when Mendez, a powerful member of the Salazar regime, called "the Butcher of Lisbon", was brought to Amadeu's clinic, he saved the man's life. Amadeu's friends were shocked by this, especially Jorge, who at that time was already in the resistance. Later, Amadeu confronted Jorge and declared that he too would join the resistance.  Jorge introduced Amadeu to João and to Estefânia, a beautiful woman who helped the resistance by memorizing people's names and contact information, and whom they were both attracted to. When the revolution against Salazar began, Amadeu was able to smuggle Estefânia to safety in Spain. Raimund learned where she went and went there to see that she was still alive.  Raimund finally meets the woman from the bridge again, in Lisbon; she had felt suicidal because she had just learned from the book that her beloved grandfather was the Butcher of Lisbon, but she is learning to accept this.  The events become a catalyst to Raimund's life, in a gentle sort of way. He informs the school that he is now returning to his job. Mariana goes to the railway station with him and, at the last moment, suggests he could instead stay.

He sneaks into Goro's hideout, setting the complex on fire before facing Goro's right-hand man Myat. The fight ends with Casey stabbing Myat in the heart and breaking his neck. He then squares off against Goro before slashing him in the midsection. In the middle of the fight, Goro wraps his barbed wire ''[[Kusari-fundo|manriki]]'' around Casey's neck, but Casey uses his strength to free himself and throw Goro to the ground before decapitating him.  Casey returns to Nakabara's dojo, only to discover that Nakabara was the one who murdered Namiko and Lucas. Nakabara is revealed to be a drug lord himself, and he used Casey to wipe out Goro's cartel to monopolize the Southeast Asian drug trade. He then gives Casey the choice to either join him or die. Both men engage in an intense fight until Casey kicks Nakabara through a thin wall, revealing a room full of ancient artifacts. They continue the fight in the room with weapons, with Casey slashing Nakabara in the midsection and Nakabara impaling Casey's left shoulder with his ''[[wakizashi]]''.

Instead, he lives life hopelessly and recklessly, like there is no tomorrow.

No Man's Land (2013 film)
 The entire film happens in a very desolate region of China, in the northwestern deserts. A poacher ([[Huang Bo]]) is being arrested by a police officer after capturing a rare falcon, worth 1 million RMB on the black market. A second poacher (Tobgye) kills the police officer with his jeep and tells the first poacher to flee, while he stays behind himself to take responsibility. He hires one of the best lawyers ([[Xu Zheng (actor)|Xu Zheng]]) in China for his defense, forcing the lawyer to travel a long distance to get to the town. At the trial, the lawyer gets the poacher acquitted by arguing that the crash happened because the police officer was drunk. The lawyer takes the poacher's car as collateral and begins a long drive back to China's eastern region. While driving, the lawyer is harassed by two people (Wang Shuangbao and Ba Duo) in a truck carrying hay. He throws his lighter at the hay in retaliation, igniting it, and drives ahead.  The second poacher was mad at his car being pawned. He arranges for the first poacher to murder the lawyer on the highway. However, by standing in the middle of the road, pretending that he has car problems in an attempt to trick the lawyer into stopping, the first poacher gets crashed into instead. The lawyer puts him in the backseat, along with his bag, and tries to take him to the nearest rest stop, which is a shanty town, to call for help. He does not realize that that man is the first poacher. When he gets to the shantytown, the first poacher looks like he has died. The lawyer gets scared and decides not to call for help. Instead, he buys gasoline and another lighter. He intends to cover up the crash by cremating the poacher's dead body. But it turns out, the first poacher isn't dead, and upon regaining consciousness he holds the lawyer at gunpoint. A girl from the shanty town ([[Yu Nan]]) had stowed away in the trunk, trying to start a new life, and also gets threatened.  The two truck drivers from earlier come upon them, and the poacher kills one and wounds the other, and proceeds to shoot the lawyer non-fatally. He forces the girl to take the car and drive him to a ghost town further on. The falcon, all along, was being held in his bag, and he has scheduled to sell it there to black marketers. The girl crashes the car by accident. She gets rescued by her abusive father and brother, who kill the first poacher. The father tries to take the falcon to the ghost town and sell it for himself, leaving the girl and her brother.  The second poacher, having lost contact with the first, comes upon the lawyer and lets him ride his pickup truck, pretending he will help. He comes upon the girl and her brother and decides to kill the brother, and tries, but fails, to murder the lawyer through carbon monoxide poisoning. He seizes the girl and heads for the ghost town.  The lawyer wakes up and is arrested by a single police officer, but he causes the police car to crash and races to save the girl. The second poacher and the two black marketers murder the girl's father at the ghost town, complete their transaction, and try to kill the girl. They are stopped by the lawyer, who approaches and tricks the black marketers into thinking that the second poacher is working with the police. The second poacher is forced to kill both black marketers. He is about to kill the lawyer and the girl, but the surviving truck driver from earlier saves them before getting killed himself. At this point, the lawyer is finally defenseless. He gets dragged by the second poacher into a truck which is holding some barrels, and is forced to watch as he attempts to run over the girl. The second poacher taunts the lawyer, saying that his heroism was in vain. The lawyer chooses at that moment to throw his lighter a second time, igniting the barrels and killing them both.  In the last scene, the girl is in a dance studio for elementary aged children, and she is telling the instructor ([[Tao Hong (actress, born 1972)|Tao Hong]]) about the whole sequence of events and how she has been changed. As children come in and the lesson begins, the instructor decides to grant the girl's request to work as her assistant, in spite of her not being qualified.

 Eight-year-old Jacob Lang is having a hard time in school, where he is in a class of [[hearing (person)|hearing]] kids (Jacob is deaf). Although he's trying to learn [[lip reading]], he has difficulty understanding and being understood. He knows ASL but his classmates don't. He longs to fit in and be accepted as an average kid, but that's not happening. Jacob's teacher is recommending that he be put in a class of deaf kids to help his social development and communication skills. Jacob's mother agrees, but his father insists that Jacob will be more "normal" by remaining with hearing kids and becoming more proficient at lip-reading. Jacob is feeling helpless and depressed.  Jacob finds escape from his problems in a TV program named ''SuperDeafy'' that is especially for deaf kids. ''SuperDeafy'' is about a deaf superhero who gets into comical situations with a police officer.

The Noble Family
  Located in modern [[Mexico City]], ''The Noble Family'' tells the story of a wealthy Mexican businessman, Germán Noble, and his three grown children, Javier, Bárbara, and Carlos.   Being always busy at his job, Germán doesn't realize that his kids are doing nothing with their lives, while carelessly spending his money. He never touches the subject, for he attributes their attitude to the depression his children feel in the wake of their mother’s death.  Though Javier works in his father's construction company (in theory), he spends most of his time partying with friends. When not socializing, he dreams up unrealistic and often impossible projects that are often mocked by his father's business partner, Anwar Karim. Hoping to motivate Javier, Germán tells him he plans to leave the company to him in the future, and so he charges Javier with bigger responsibilities. Javier instead flies to Miami with his friends, leaving a subordinate to take his place at a very important business function.   Bárbara is a [[socialite]] about to get engaged to Peter, a man 20 years older than her, who’s left several failed businesses in bankruptcy. He’s hoping that Bárbara’s [[trust fund]] will help him pay off his enormous tax debt. Germán is against said engagement, but Bárbara pays no attention to him and starts planning the wedding   Carlos, Germán’s youngest child, is a [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] that has been expelled from college for being caught by the dean having sex with Lucía, one of his teachers.   Germán’s frustration finally leads him to a heart attack. While in the hospital, he decides to give his children a lesson and a taste of the real world. He tells them that union troubles and an [[embezzling]] partner have led the government to freeze his assets and that, as [[shareholders]] of the company, the whole family could end up in prison. Germán convinces them to hide and cut off all contact with friends and relatives (to protect his charade), and move into a dilapidated house his father owned in a modest area of Mexico City. The children will also have to support themselves, which means getting jobs for the first time in their lives.  A friend’s father helps Carlos get a job as a bank teller, while Lucho, nephew of the family's old maid, helps Bárbara find work as a waitress and Javier as a bus driver.   With a house falling down around them and bills to pay, the three immediately find themselves struggling to make ends meet. Their new situation causes them to see things in a new light. Bárbara discovers that Lucho, who she used to think of as poor and unworthy of her time, is actually a nice guy. Javier sees his old party friends as shallow hangers-on. Carlos starts to create some discipline in his life. Germán also learns a lot from his children during this time, and is dismayed to learn that Bárbara has [[bulimia]], Javier is [[dyslexia|dyslexic]] and that he himself often spent too much time at work while they were growing up.  Meanwhile, Peter, Bárbara's boyfriend, finds out the family's hideout and the truth about Germán’s scheme. Once he finds out it’s all just a plot to teach the kids a lesson, he tries to blackmail Germán into giving him power over Bárbara’s trust fund. Germán refuses, but in the process he’s forced to admit the truth to his children. The revelation generates a feeling of anger and distrust in them. However Bárbara realises that Peter's only intention was to obtain her money, and breaks with him. Disappointed, the three siblings decide to distance themselves from their father, keep their jobs and fully repair the old house.   Gérman's wish to see his children mature and live independently is finally accomplished, even though they break all contact with him. Carlos leaves the bank and gets a real job, Javier opens a business of his own, and Bárbara and Lucho get engaged.  By the end of the film we see Gérman knocking on the now-restored front door of the old house. His children open it, and he asks for forgiveness. They reconcile, acknowledging that everything was for a greater good.   After the credits Peter is inside a prison cell, for his tax debts, as two fellow inmates approach to molest him.

Now You See Me (film)
 Four [[Magic (illusion)|stage magicians]], J. Daniel "Danny" Atlas ([[Jesse Eisenberg]]), Merritt McKinney ([[Woody Harrelson]]), Henley Reeves ([[Isla Fisher]]), and Jack Wilder ([[Dave Franco]]), are each given a [[tarot card]] that leads them to the same empty New York City apartment where they find information from an unknown benefactor.  A year later, the four have their first major performance as the Four Horsemen in an elaborate Las Vegas show funded by insurance magnate Arthur Tressler ([[Michael Caine]]). Their final trick appears to transport one of the audience members to the vault of his bank, the Crédit Républicain in Paris, where stacks of new euro bills are stored. At the magicians' command, the fans in the vault activate, drawing the bills into the vents and then showering the Las Vegas crowd with them. The euros are shown to be real, and the vault in Paris is found to be empty of its recent shipment of euros. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent Dylan Rhodes ([[Mark Ruffalo]]), and [[Interpol]] agent Alma Dray ([[Mélanie Laurent]]), are then partnered to investigate the Horsemen. The two question the magicians but have no evidence to hold them. Dylan and Alma turn to Thaddeus Bradley ([[Morgan Freeman]]), a former magician who now makes money by explaining the tricks behind magic acts. Thaddeus demonstrates how the Horsemen used a mock vault under the Las Vegas stage and says that the group must have stolen the money in Paris before it arrived at the bank, replacing it with [[Nitrocellulose|flash paper]] that left no evidence.  Dylan, Alma, and Thaddeus follow the Horsemen to their next show in New Orleans, where their final trick appears to transfer millions of dollars from Tressler's private accounts to those in the audience, made up of people that were denied insurance claims by Tressler's company in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. Dylan and Alma attempt to apprehend the four, but the magicians elude arrest. Tressler hires Thaddeus to expose the Horsemen in revenge for the loss of his money. Alma investigates the Horsemen and determines they are connected to a group called the Eye, a small group of magicians that claim to have access to real magic. She finds out one of the Eye's members, Lionel Shrike, had previously been exposed by Thaddeus but died in a locked-safe escape trick he was performing in an attempt to regain his standing. Alma suspects a fifth person is aiding the Horsemen.  Alma's research leads the FBI to the New York City apartment. When they raid it, three of the Horsemen escape while Jack recovers numerous documents and then leads the authorities on a high-speed car chase. Jack loses control of his car, causing it to flip and catch fire. Dylan is unable to save Jack, but manages to recover the papers, pointing to the Horsemen's next planned crime, stealing millions of dollars in cash out of a large safe of the Elkhorn company. Dylan, Alma, and Thaddeus find the safe has already been stolen, and when they track it down, its contents have been replaced with balloon animals. The Horsemen broadcast they will perform their final show that night at [[5 Pointz]], inviting the public to attend. The FBI and police converge on the scene and amid the chaos search for the Horsemen. The remaining Horsemen appear to the crowd, giving their fans a farewell and a message about an ulterior purpose, and then run to jump off a roof; Dylan attempts to shoot them but Alma holds him back. The three jump, turning into a shower of money over the crowd. The money is counterfeit, but the audience's race to collect it prevents the authorities from tracking the real Horsemen.  After the show, Thaddeus walks to his car, only to find it full of the money stolen from the Elkhorn safe. Assumed to be the fifth Horseman, he is arrested. Dylan speaks to Thaddeus in jail, where Thaddeus slowly comes to realize that Alma's theory was correct, and Dylan was the fifth Horseman. Dylan quietly walks away, leaving Thaddeus shouting "Why?". Elsewhere, the Horsemen (including Jack, who had faked his death using a duplicate car and an already-dead body) meet at the carousel in Central Park, and use their tarot cards to turn it on. Dylan arrives and welcomes the four to the Eye.  Later, at the [[Pont des Arts]], Dylan meets with Alma and reveals he is Shrike's son. He brought the Horsemen together to get retribution for his father's death: the Elkhorn Safe Company for providing a faulty safe that led to the accident; Thaddeus for humiliating and impoverishing his father and forcing him to try the new trick to regain his standing; and the Crédit Républicain and Tressler's insurance companies for failing to pay out life insurance on Shrike afterwards. Alma, who has come into a romantic relationship with Dylan, decides not to turn him in. She takes a lock and a key that Dylan produces, attaching the lock among the other [[love lock]]s on the railing and throwing the key into the [[Seine]].

He takes them to get some lemonade at a nearby stall, only for Mary's lemonade to end up being drugged with a poison. Mary gets violently ill and tries to go home but is kidnapped by Mason. She awakens to find herself tied to a post while Pastor Kingsman tells her that she was chosen according to God's will. He then opens the "Gateway to Hell", resulting in Mary becoming possessed by the Devil. He then takes her back to her family, telling them that she was sick. Noah unsuccessfully tries to confess to what has happened, but is accidentally interrupted by Christopher. Upon returning home, Dan is called away by Pastor Kingman, who tells him that he is needed in the church. This ends up being a ruse, as Pastor Kingsman then drugs and imprisons Dan shortly after his arrival.  Meanwhile, in the house, Mary awakens completely possessed and begins attacking the family. Wendy sends the remaining two children to find their father, who they discover to be seemingly unconscious on the church floor. With Noah's help they help him up and begin to drive home. On the way, they see that every house has a mark on their door, an X made out of blood. Frightened, Rebecca repeatedly asks Noah about the mark, only for him to refuse to answer her. The group arrives to the house where Dan and Rebecca try to go inside to get Wendy and Mary. Noah grabs ahold of Rebecca telling her to stay out there and that there's nothing she can do to help them. Dan proceeds inside to find Wendy dead and crumbling away on the couch. Dan stumbles back in fear where he sees Mary crawling towards him on the stairway. Dan runs out of the house screaming at Rebecca and Noah to start the car and drive away.   They do so and Dan stays behind to try to free Mary, who has followed Dan out to the front yard, only to meet the same fate his wife did. Rebecca makes Noah stop the car and argues with him about what is going on. Christopher sees Mary is coming up behind them as Noah tries to explain what is happening to Rebecca. Christopher, frightened, runs out of the car to a nearby house and frantically starts banging on the door asking for help. Noah then shoves Rebecca back into the car leaving Christopher behind. Christopher finds a house and manages to get inside, but not before Mary grabs his leg and infects  Noah then takes Rebecca to a gathering where they use her blood to destroy the Devil (Mary) and close the Gateway to Hell.

Abby seduces Larry by saying that she's [[addicted to men]], alluding to her past history with her father. Confirming that he is unfaithful to Danni's mother, Abby shows up at his place of work one day and convinces him to give her a ride, during which she paralyzes him with [[vecuronium bromide]], resulting in a car accident. After hearing of her stepfather's death, Danni seeks solace from Abby, only for Abby to grow angry when Danni says that she's going to move in with her boyfriend. Abby comments that she hopes that Larry's genitals were severed in the car crash. When Danni realizes that Abby knows about the car crash even though Danni never told her how he died, Danni leaves. This infuriates Abby, who decides that instead of seeking to help Danni, she will now hurt her. She accomplishes this by slowly convincing Detective John Rogan that Danni is mentally unstable and obsessed with Abby.  The next day, Abby runs into Rachel Adams, a new human resources employee that remarks that Abby greatly resembles a girl she knew that was sent to a mental institution. Abby invites Rachel out for drinks and takes the opportunity to harass Danni by calling her via [[Skype]] and showing Danni a video of Abby injecting chemicals into Rachel. Danni tries to go to the police, only for Detective Rogan to dismiss her claims as evidence of her trying to hurt Abby because the other woman didn't return her affections. He uses the photographs Abby took as proof to this effect, which Steve sees as a result of Danni summoning him to the police station for support. This prompts an argument between the two, and Steve leaves in a fit of anger. Danni tries to approach Dr. Morris for help, only for him to use this as an opportunity to blackmail Abby into having sex with him. Abby initially pretends to agree to this arrangement but uses the opportunity to dismember and murder him. That same night Abby also knocks out Rachel and drags her away to her death.  Danni goes to the mental institution that Rachel had referred to, where she learns about Sarah Price, a little girl who killed her father after learning he was having an affair, and witnessing him [[Domestic abuse|severely beating]] her mother. Danni discovers that Sarah was taken in by a nurse at the institution named Abigail Russell. Danni then realizes that Abby is Sarah and has taken the name of her caretaker. Danni then tries to call Rachel to warn her about Abby, only to find that Rachel's phone is in her car. She then receives a call from Abby, who implies that she will kill Steve in the same manner as Rachel.  Danni rushes to the hospital, where she and Abby begin to fight. The staff initially tries to intervene, only for Abby to set off on a killing spree and lock herself into a lab. Danni and Steve pursue her, and Abby stabs Steve in the neck and runs off. Abby rushes home, where she is confronted by Detective Rogan, who tries to arrest her. Noticing that her neighbor Jared is viewing the situation, Abby pretends that Rogan is trying to rob her. Her neighbor then comes outside and hits the detective over the head with a bat, killing him instantly. Her neighbor is horrified to discover that Rogan is a cop, but Abby convinces him to hide the body, saying that Rogan was corrupt and that Jared would be treated badly since he is now a cop killer. Abby assumes the identity of human resources employee Rachel Adams.  
Nymphomaniac (film)
 On a snowy evening, middle-aged bachelor Seligman ([[Stellan Skarsgård]]) finds [[self-diagnosed]] [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] Joe ([[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]) beaten up and lying in the alleyway behind his apartment. He takes her back to his home and, over tea, listens intently as Joe recounts the story of her libidinous life. Seligman, a highly-educated but cloistered man, connects and analyzes Joe's stories with what he has read about. Seligman's favourite hobby to read about is fly fishing, which is why he has the fly fishing hook on the wall and this is how their conversation begins.  Throughout the story he parallels much of what she has experienced with various methods of the sport.  ===Volume I=== ====1. "The Compleat Angler"==== Inspired by a [[fly fishing]] hook in the wall behind her and Seligman's love of [[Izaak Walton]]'s book ''[[The Compleat Angler]]'', Joe opens her story by talking about her precocious sexual fascination during her early childhood. Her father ([[Christian Slater]]) is a tree-loving doctor whom she adores while her mother ([[Connie Nielsen]]) is, as Joe describes her, a "cold bitch". In adolescence ([[Stacy Martin]]), she loses her virginity to an arbitrary young man named Jerôme ([[Shia LaBeouf]]). This first encounter, which ends with Jerôme casually leaving her to fix his moped, leaves her disappointed, while Seligman observes that the combination of the number of times Jerôme penetrated her, three times vaginally and five times anally, resembles the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]].   Several years later, Joe engages in a contest with her friend B ([[Sophie Kennedy Clark]]) during a train journey; whichever of the two women has sex with the most passengers by the train's arrival at the station wins a bag of chocolate sweets. After having sex in the toilet with several of the men she comes across, Joe wins by performing a blowjob on a passenger in a first class car, S ([[Jens Albinus]]). S is a married man who resists both her and B's advances, but ultimately Joe forces herself on him. Joe tells Seligman her encounter with S is the first of many terrible things she's done, but he waves off her accusation.  ====2. "Jerome"==== Over [[rugelach]] and a discussion over the lack of masculinity in men using cake forks to eat pastry, Joe talks about her first experiences with actual love, something she dismisses as "lust with jealousy added." Joe takes on more lovers as she, B, and several friends create a club, "The Little Flock", dedicated to liberating themselves from society's fixation on love. Joe eventually leaves after all the other members end up developing serious attachments to their conquests. As a young adult, Joe drops out of medical school and finds work as a secretary at a printing company. Her first employer is none other than Jerôme. While sexual intentions are clearly on his mind, she finds herself avoiding his advances and sleeping with other co-workers, frustrating him. When Joe finally realizes she has developed feelings for Jerôme, she writes him a letter. However, she is too late as he has left along with his uncle's jealous secretary Liz (Felicity Gilbert), who was fully aware of Joe's feelings. She is immediately fired by his uncle ([[Jesper Christensen]]), the actual owner of the company, for her lack of experience and goes back to indulging her nymphomania, despite a yearning for Jerôme.  ====3. "Mrs. H"==== On one occasion with one of her lovers, H ([[Hugo Speer]]), Joe inadvertently causes conflict that makes him leave his wife for her. The distressed Mrs. H ([[Uma Thurman]]) arrives and demonizes both of them in front of her children, though Joe states in the present that this barely affected her. The situation then becomes more awkward as Joe's next lover, A ([[Cyron Melville]]), arrives at the house and finds himself in the middle of Mrs. H's mental breakdown. The family finally leaves, but not before Mrs. H verbally lacerates Joe, slaps her now ex-husband and leaves the apartment wailing.  ====4. "Delirium"==== A conversation about [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and his death from [[delirium tremens]] reminds Joe of the last time she saw her father. She is the only one to visit him in the hospital as he dies of cancer. Joe's father asks her not to slander her mother, who is afraid of hospitals, for not being by his side, explaining they said their goodbyes. Joe is a firsthand witness as her father deteriorates into fits of violent spasms, paranoid delusions and screams for his wife. To take her mind off her father's suffering, Joe has sexual intercourse with several people at the hospital. When he finally dies, Joe becomes sexually aroused, with a drop of [[Vaginal lubrication|vaginal fluid]] running down her thigh as she stands in front of the body, and becomes numb with depression.  ====5. "The Little Organ School"==== After Seligman explains how he feels [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] perfected [[polyphony]], Joe uses his example to talk about three lovers leading up to her "[[cantus firmus]]." The "bass voice", F ([[Nicolas Bro]]) is a tender, but predictable man who puts her sexual needs above his own. The "second voice", G (Christian Gade Bjerrum), thrills Joe because of his animalistic control of her in bed. During one of Joe's regular walks in the local park, Jerôme finds her after separating from Liz, a coincidence Seligman finds preposterous, and they embrace. As the two engage in authentically passionate sex — set alongside Joe's experiences with F and G — Joe becomes emotionally distraught when discovering she can no longer "feel anything".  ===Volume II=== Joe becomes annoyed with Seligman, accusing him of overlooking the severity of her lost sexuality to focus on the allegorical before realizing he can't relate to her stories. He goes on to confirm his asexuality and virginity, but assures her his lack of bias and "innocence" makes him the best man to listen to her story. She becomes inspired to tell him another portion of her life after noticing a [[Andrei Rublev|Rublev]]-styled icon of the Virgin Mary and a discussion about the differences between the Eastern Church ("the church of happiness") and the Western Church ("the church of suffering").  ====6. "The Eastern and the Western Church (The [[Fisting|Silent Duck]])"==== Joe reminisces about a field trip as a young girl that suggests she had a vision of [[Valeria Messalina]] and the [[Whore of Babylon]] looking over her as she levitates and spontaneously has her first orgasm, which shocks Seligman as he explains her orgasm is a mockery of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration of Jesus on the Mount]]. Returning to where she left off in "The Little Organ School", Joe falls into a crisis upon losing her ability to achieve sexual pleasure, though she does find a different sort of pleasure in her time with Jerôme. When the two conceive a baby together, Marcel, Jerôme struggles to keep up with her sexual needs and allows her to see other men. This is shown to be detrimental later, as he becomes jealous of her endeavors.  Several years later to no success, Joe's sexual endeavors become increasingly adventurous by engaging in a tryst with a pair of African brothers that turns into a botched threesome; the frustration to reclaim her orgasm culminates in visits to K ([[Jamie Bell]]), a sadist who violently assaults women seeking his company. The more she visits him, the more neglectful she becomes in her domestic duties. On Christmas, after stopping an unattended Marcel who has wandered out an opened door onto a snowy balcony from coming into any harm, Jerôme forces her to choose between the family and K. She picks the latter and, after receiving an especially brutal beating from K with a [[cat o' nine tails]] that allows her to climax again, takes a path of loneliness away from her one and only possibility of a normal life. Marcel is sent to live in a foster home because Jerôme has no room in his life for him.  Joe concludes the story, to keep it from ending on an unhappy note, with the first time K introduced her to "the Silent Duck", which leaves Seligman surprised and impressed at K's talents.  ====7. "The Mirror"==== Looking at the mirror facing Seligman's bed, Joe jumps ahead in time. Several years later, Joe has regained pleasure, but her genitalia is left with some irreversible damage due to a lifetime of sexual activity mixed with K's brutality. Her habits are known around her new office, prompting the boss to demand she attend [[sex addiction]] therapy under the threat of losing her job and any future job she takes.  When asked why she refused to attend therapy, Joe talks about becoming pregnant after leaving Jerôme and Marcel. Joe demands her doctor abort the 11-week pregnancy, but he insists she speak to a counselor first. The visit to the psychologist ([[Caroline Goodall]]) ends disastrously due to Joe's attitude towards the situation. She decides to take matters into her own hands and perform the abortion herself. Using the knowledge she had retained from medical school, Joe aborts the fetus with the use of several household implements and a wire hanger. Back in the present, Joe and Seligman get into a very heated argument regarding Joe's actions, [[abortion rights]] in general and Seligman's potential hypocrisy in supporting them while wanting to know nothing about how the actual procedure is performed.   Joe reluctantly attends the meetings and, after ridding her apartment of almost everything in it, attempts sobriety. During one meeting three weeks later, she sees a reflection of her younger self in the mirror, harshly insults every member of the group, including the therapist, and proclaims pride in her sexuality before walking out.  Joe tells Seligman she isn't sure where to conclude her story as she's used every item from around his room to help inspire each "chapter". After a suggestion from him, she notices how the stain from a cup of tea she had earlier thrown in anger looks like a [[Walther PPK]], the same kind of gun her favorite literary character [[James Bond]] uses, and knows exactly how and where to end her story.  ====8. "The Gun"==== Realizing she has no place in society, Joe turns to organized crime and becomes a debt collector, utilizing her extensive knowledge of men, sex, and [[sadomasochism]]. She reminisces about a memorable housecall to a man ([[Jean-Marc Barr]]) who she initially finds sexually unreadable. She ties him to a chair, strips him and attempts to provoke him with every sexual scenario she can think of. Upon further interrogation, Joe gleans that he is a repressed [[pedophile]]. She takes pity on him and fellates him. Joe explains to Seligman how she feels deep compassion for people born with a forbidden sexuality. She strongly identifies with the man's loneliness and status as a sexual outcast, and applauds him for going through life without acting on his aberrant desires.  Joe's superior, L ([[Willem Dafoe]]), recommends that she groom an apprentice and suggests P ([[Mia Goth]]), the 15-year-old daughter of criminals. Joe is initially repulsed by the idea, but ends up sympathizing with the girl in question. P is a vulnerable, lonely, emotionally damaged young girl who quickly latches herself onto Joe. The two of them click and form a special connection. Joe opens her heart to P and eventually invites her to move into her home. Over time, Joe and P's relationship develops a sexual dimension, leading to romance. As P seems to mature, Joe hesitantly decides to teach her young female lover the ropes of her trade.  During one round of debt collection, Joe notices that they are at a house belonging to Jerôme (now played by Michaël Pas) and, to make sure she is not seen, tells P to perform her first solo job. This proves to be a mistake as Joe eventually discovers P is having an affair with Jerôme. After finding her "soul tree" in a failed attempt to leave town, Joe waits for Jerôme and P in the alley between his home and her apartment and pulls a gun she confiscated from P earlier on him. When she pulls the trigger, she forgets to rack the pistol. Jerôme viciously beats Joe and then has sex with P right in front of her, thrusting into P in exactly the same way he once took her virginity. P urinates on her before leaving her as she was at the beginning of the film.  In the present, Seligman suggests how the circumstances of Joe's life might have been due to differences in gender representation; all of the stigma, guilt and shame she felt for her actions made her fight back aggressively "like a man", ultimately "forgetting" to rack the gun because her human worth wouldn't allow her to kill someone, even Jerôme. Joe, who has until this moment been playing [[devil's advocate]] to Seligman's assumptions, finally feels at peace, having unburdened her story. She says she is too tired to go on and asks to go to sleep.  As Joe begins to drift off, Seligman silently returns. He climbs into the bed with his pants off and attempts to have intercourse with her. Joe wakes up and, realizing what Seligman is doing, reaches for and racks the gun. Seligman protests and attempts to justify his behavior, but Joe shoots him, grabs her things, and flees the apartment.  
Oblivion (2013 film)
  In 2077, sixty years after a war with extraterrestrials that devastated Earth, humanity has relocated to [[Titan (moon)|Saturn's moon Titan]] via a giant space station called the Tet. Gigantic offshore [[fusion energy]] generators drain Earth's oceans to power the colonies on Titan.  Led by mission controller Sally and guided by his housemate and communications partner Victoria "Vika" Olsen, "Tech-49" Jack Harper regularly leaves his tower post to repair downed [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|combat drones]] that guard the regions and generators against the alien scavengers. Although his [[Mindwipe|memory has been wiped]], he has had recurring dreams and visions of being on the observation deck of the [[Empire State Building]] with a dark-haired woman. He also collects the occasional artifact that he finds from humanity's past. Vika is concerned about Jack's curiosity, questioning whether they are still "an effective team," and encouraging him to do his job, so they can join the others on Titan soon.  After scavengers destroy a generator, Jack discovers that they have been using the Empire State Building's antenna to transmit coordinates to outer space. While taking a break at his secret lake house retreat, he watches a crash-landing module of a pre-war spacecraft called the ''Odyssey''. Thinking that the ship contains aliens, he investigates, only to find humans in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis chambers]]. One of the humans is the woman from his dreams. Jack protects her chamber from a drone that destroys the others, and later, revives the woman, Julia Rusakova, who makes Vika instinctively jealous. Jack and Julia return to recover her [[flight recorder]], but are captured by the scavengers. They are taken to their headquarters at the [[Raven Rock Mountain Complex]], and the scavengers are revealed to be human survivors.  Their leader, Malcolm Beech, wants Jack to reprogram their captured drone to carry nuclear fuel cells to blow up the Tet; he has sensed Jack is different because of the latter's hobby of collecting relics. Although Jack refuses, Beech releases them to seek the truth beyond the boundaries of the forbidden radiation zone. When they reach the Empire State Building, Julia reveals that she is his wife. Jack then remembers that he proposed to her there. Julia recalls that she was on a mission to Titan when they were diverted to investigate an alien presence. Jack's ship arrives, remote-piloted by Vika after Jack used the scavenger beacon to call for pickup. As a result, a jealous Vika witnesses Jack and Julia's moment together.  When the two return to Jack's tower, Vika refuses them entry, and reports her findings to Sally, saying they are "no longer an effective team." Sally acknowledges this, but activates a drone that kills Vika before Julia shoots it down. Jack and Julia escape in his ship, but are shot down by other pursuing drones. The two eject into the radiation zone, which turns out not to be radioactive. Jack discovers another ship with a technician trying to repair a downed drone, and is shocked to see that the tech is a clone of himself who goes by "Tech-52". The clone also is shocked to see Julia. Jack battles and incapacitates his clone, but Julia is accidentally shot. After flying to Tech-52's tower, and discovering an inquisitive Vika clone, he returns to treat Julia then take her to the lake house.  At the scavenger base, Beech reveals to Jack and Julia that the Tet was an alien artificial intelligence that destroyed the Moon, causing massive devastation to the planet, and invaded Earth with thousands of Jack clones and later drones to wipe out the human race, extracting all of the planet's natural resources before moving on. Beech, who had witnessed the destruction of humanity and the various Jack clones over the years, knew Jack was different due to his interest in old relics and the fact that he saved Julia. As Jack repairs the captured drone, the base is attacked by other drones, gravely injuring Beech, and ruining the captured drone except for its fuel cells. Jack agrees to deliver Julia to Sally through the stasis chamber. On the way to the Tet, Jack listens to the ''Odyssey''<nowiki/>'s flight recorder, and learns that he was the mission commander, Vika was his co-pilot, and Sally was their mission controller from Earth. When the Tet started to draw in their ship, Jack jettisoned the pod of stasis chambers containing the crew members (including Julia) leaving himself and Vika to be captured.  Back in the present, Jack enters a large room full of capsules of Jack and Vika clones. He shows Tet the stasis chamber, but it carries Beech and the fuel cells, which they then detonate, killing themselves and destroying the Tet. On Earth, Julia awakens at the lake house. At the same time, all of the drones go off-line, saving what's left of humanity, including the scavengers who were on the verge of a massive drone attack when Jack and Beech destroyed the Tet. Three years later, she and her daughter meet the resistance members and "Tech-52" Jack, who has also recovered his memories.

The Numbers Station
 [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative Emerson Kent is sent to kill a man who owns a bar. Before being killed by Kent, the man reveals he is a former agent who wanted to retire. A witness flees the scene, accidentally leaving his wallet behind. Kent finds the wallet and tracks the witness to his home, where he kills him. Kent spares the life of the man's daughter, Rachel, who follows him outside, hysterical.  As Kent tries to convince his boss, Michael Grey, not to kill her, Grey strikes Kent on the back and he falls to the ground. Kent and Rachel share a last look at each other as Grey kills her. Kent is transferred to [[Suffolk, England]] to watch over a [[numbers station]]. While there, he befriends Katherine, the station broadcaster, and is haunted by memories of the woman who was killed. When the numbers station comes under attack, Kent and Katherine barricade themselves inside. One assassin is already inside the secure station and, after a lengthy shootout, is killed by Kent.  Kent requests assistance, and the operator tells him help will arrive in four hours; since the code has been compromised, he must kill Katherine. Kent notices that Katherine has a serious leg wound and dresses her wound. Kent receives an update from the operator, and, when he reports that he has not killed Katherine yet, the operator orders him to do so immediately. Kent contemplates her death but ultimately decides to recruit her help in tracing fifteen unauthorized messages sent from the station. On the computer, Kent and Katherine discover dossiers of fifteen different government officials, including Grey. The unauthorized codes are instructions to assassinate the officials, and Katherine is to be eliminated so she can't cancel the broadcasts. Kent says that the assassinations would leave the intelligence world crippled and the world unrecognizable.  Kent tricks the telephone operator by giving him a false confirmation code, proving he isn't the real agency operator; the operator offers Kent a deal, and Kent pretends to have killed Katherine. Kent escapes to his car, where he recovers a cell phone, and then races back to protect Katherine, who has cracked the code and is broadcasting orders to cancel to previous instructions. Katherine leaves her station when she sees the assassin, but he manages to wound her before Kent kills him. Katherine insists that Kent complete the final cancellation order, and he leaves her side briefly. When he returns, he administers an anesthetic, and she asks him if she will wake. Kent reassures her that he will not kill her, but he reports her as dead to Grey. Kent spreads [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] explosives throughout the base and drops Katherine's jewelry on the floor.  After he carries Katherine outside, the base explodes, destroying all evidence.  Kent hijacks a car, only to realise that the driver is the telephone operator. When Kent asks him who he works for, the operator replies that he used to work for the same people that Kent does, but he now works for the other side; they are just as twisted, but they pay better. The two shoot each other at the same time, but Kent survives and attempts to drive away, only to fall unconscious from shock and crash. Kent wakes up in a hospital and discovers that Katherine is alive. Grey steps in and says that she is a liability, but Kent is able to save her life by convincing Grey that she is responsible for saving his life. Grey volunteers to find their bodies at the ruins of the station, and, as the end credits roll, cars are shown passing over the [[Orwell Bridge]] in [[Ipswich]] at night, implying that Kent and Katherine escaped.

Odd Thomas (film)
 Odd Thomas (Yelchin) is a psychic who lives in a small town in California. He describes his ability as, "I see dead people, but then, by God, I do something about it." One morning the ghost of a teenage girl, Penny Kallisto, silently leads him to Harlo Landerson. Odd accuses Harlo of raping and murdering Penny. Harlo flees. Odd chases him to a pool party and into a child's bedroom in a stranger's house. Harlo and Odd fight and Harlo is knocked unconscious.  Odd's friend, police chief Wyatt Porter (Dafoe), is aware of Odd's psychic gifts and promises to spin the story to keep public attention away from him.  Odd has a vision of faceless people wearing bowling shirts who cry out to him to save them.  A faceless gunman shoots them all, including Odd.  Recovering from the disturbing dream, he goes to his job as a short-order cook. He serves lunch to a strange man named Hensley, whose hair resembles some kind of mold.  Hensley is surrounded by dozens of [[bodach]]s, who were initially interested in his girlfriend, coworker/friend and Porter, invisible creatures that feed on evil and carnage that only Odd can see. Odd's co-worker, Viola Peabody (Mbatha-Raw), recounts a strange dream in which she saw herself shot dead with another man.  The man's clothing is identical to that worn by the faceless people in Odd's vision.  Odd uses his psychic magnetism to find Hensley; the trail leads to the mall where Odd's girlfriend Stormy (Timlin) is manager at an ice cream shop.  Odd borrows Stormy's scooter to follow Hensley home.  When Hensley leaves again, Odd breaks into his house.  He finds an ashtray with several brands of cigarette butts in it, indicating that Hensley had visitors.  Odd learns that the man's real name is Bob Robertson; he and Stormy refer to him as "Fungus Bob". Odd finds a file containing newspaper clippings of mass murderers, arranged by name.  There is also a blank calendar page for the next day; Odd realizes that Robertson is planning something bad on that date.  Odd reports this to Chief Porter, at his house where he also encounters Officer Eckles and Lysette, who once dated Harlo, being set up by Chief Porter and his wife. Porter assigns two deputies to follow Fungus Bob.  Odd meets Stormy for dinner in the belfry of a church. He sees Fungus Bob approaching and they flee to the sacristy.  As they escape the church, Robertson destroys the sacristy.  Stormy calls Chief Porter, who finds the church vandalized but no evidence to link it to Robertson.  Odd's psychic magnetism leads him and Stormy to a bowling alley, where the bowling shirts from his vision have just become the new uniform.  Chief Porter sends Officer Simon Varner (Tortorella) to watch the place on Odd's advice.  Varner asks Odd about Robertson and is surprised to learn that Odd had encountered him only a few hours ago.  He presses Odd for more information. Stormy interrupts by asking about Varner's visible tattoo, the letters "POD".  Varner dismisses it as an embarrassment from his youth, an abbreviated obscenity that he won't discuss.  Viola remembers more details of her dream; she tells Odd that she and the man in the bowling shirt were not the only victims of the shooting, and a large group of people were killed.  Odd sees bodachs hovering over Vi's daughters, and he advises her to leave town with her daughters immediately.  While driving home, Stormy is overcome with fear for Odd's safety and he tries to comfort her.  They hear a woman screaming.  Odd finds Lysette, a friend of Chief Porter and his wife, who has been mauled to death by dogs resembling those at Robertson's home.  Another man was said to have tried to rescue the woman by shooting the dogs, but was too late. Returning to Stormy's apartment, Odd sees what he assumes to be a police van watching the building, he returns to his apartment.  He finds Fungus Bob shot to death in his bathtub, with evidence framing Odd for the murder. Odd surmises that if he goes to the police, Porter will be required to arrest him based on the evidence, preventing him from preventing the next day's disaster.  He discovers that Bob has been dead for quite some time and deduces that the encounter at the church was with the dead man's restless spirit. Wrapping the body in sheets, Odd dumps the corpse in the execution chamber of an abandoned prison.  As he drives back through town, the magnitude of the coming disaster is indicated by the swarming of hundreds of bodachs.  Chief Porter is shot in a home invasion.  Odd rushes to the hospital and learns that Porter is alive thanks to a metal trinket Odd had given him, but in serious condition. Returning to Bob's home, Odd finds a receipt for a moving van and improvised explosives, and browser bookmarks for Satanic websites. He searches the fridge and freezer and discovers various human body parts as well.  Robertson's poltergeist destroys the house as Odd escapes, though he lost his cell phone in the process.  Odd investigates Bob's fatal bullet wound, and finds a tattoo matching Varner's. He realizes that "POD" is an abbreviation for "Prince of Darkness".  Odd realizes that Robertson was eliminated by his co-conspirators because Odd had begun to look into him.  Odd's psychic magnetism leads him back to the mall.  He finds Officer Eckles has murdered the mall security staff.  Odd disables him with a baseball bat.  He takes Eckles's pistol and seeks out Varner.  Hearing screams from the end of the mall where Stormy works, he hurries to the site. He spots another gunman firing off an automatic weapon. Odd fires at him with Eckles's weapon as the gunman has emptied his magazine. Odd continues to shoot at him while being surrounded with bodachs. When the gunman inserts another magazine and is about to kill Odd, Odd shoots and kills him instead. The lingering spirit of Lysette appears to direct him to the loading dock.  Odd removes the gunman's mask and recognizes him as the man who they thought tried to rescue Lysette. Odd rushes to the loading dock where he discovers Bob's moving van packed with explosives on a timer, apparently part of a plan to kill the shoppers in the mall and possibly any arriving first responders.  Varner, possessed by a larger and more savvy bodach, returns and shoots Odd as Odd manages to start the van and drive it away from the mall.  Varner clings to the outside of the van, attempting to kill Odd. Odd jumps from the van as Varner enters the cab, and the van crashes into a man-made canal and explodes, incinerating Varner but killing no one else. A black, shrieking spirit escapes from the flames.  Odd wakes in the hospital. Stormy is attending him. Viola greets him and tells him that Porter has been released from intensive care.  Odd is a local hero.  He retreats to Stormy's apartment to enjoy uninterrupted time with her.  Porter, his wife, and Viola arrive and reveal what he already knows: Stormy was killed in the mall shooting and he has been spending time with her lingering spirit. Porter, realizing that Stormy is staying in this world only for Odd, advises him to let her go.  Odd bids her a tearful farewell, promising her that they'll be reunited one day.  Odd travels to Las Vegas to continue his crusade to help the living and the lingering dead, believing that he is not yet worthy of an afterlife with Stormy.

Over time, the parents become psychotic; Alan isolates himself in his office, and Marie becomes withdrawn and paranoid. All of the plants in the house die, and the family dog disappears after being shut in the office with the mirror. After Kaylie sees Alan with Marisol, she tells her mother, and the parents fight. One night, Marie goes insane and attempts to kill her children, but Alan locks her away. When the family runs out of food, the children realize that their father is under the influence of the mirror, so Kaylie goes to seek help from their mother, and finds her chained to the wall, acting like an animal. Kaylie and Tim try going to their neighbors for help, but the neighbors disbelieve their stories. When Kaylie attempts to use the phone, she discovers that all of her phone calls are answered by the same man.  One night, Alan unchains Marie, and both parents attack the children. Marie briefly comes to her senses, only to be shot dead by Alan. The children try to destroy the mirror but it tricks them, making them believe they are hitting the mirror when they are actually hitting the wall. Alan also experiences a moment of lucidity and kills himself by forcing Tim to pull the trigger of the gun and shoot him. Before dying, he begs the children to run, but Marisol and other victims of the mirror appear as horrific ghosts. The police arrive and take Tim into custody. Before the siblings are separated, they promise to reunite as adults and destroy the mirror. As Tim is taken away, he sees the ghosts of his parents watching him from the house.  Eleven years later, Tim is discharged from a psychiatric hospital, having come to believe that there were no supernatural events involved in his parents' deaths. Kaylie has spent most of her young adulthood researching the history of the mirror. Using her position as an employee of an auction house, she obtains access to the mirror and has it transported to the family home, where she places it in a room filled with surveillance cameras and a "kill switch" — an anchor weighted to the ceiling. Kaylie intends to destroy the mirror, but first wants to document its powers, proving Tim's innocence.  Tim attempts to convince Kaylie that she's wrong and the siblings argue. When they notice the houseplants begin to wilt, they review the camera footage and see themselves performing actions they have no memory of. Tim finally accepts that the mirror has an evil power and attempts to escape the house with Kaylie, only for the pair to be drawn back by the mirror's influence. Seeing a hallucination of her mother, Kaylie stabs it in the neck, only to realize that she has stabbed her fiancé. They try to call the police, but are only able to reach the same voice who spoke to them on the phone as children. Tim activates the kill switch, realizing too late that Kaylie stood in its path, and he has killed her. The police arrive and arrest Tim, who is hysterical, just as they did when he was younger. As both a boy and an adult, Tim claims the mirror is responsible. As he is taken away, Tim's adult incarnation, sees Kaylie's ghost standing in the house with his parents.  
Oggy and the Cockroaches: The Movie
  The movie itself is divided into four parts, all related to history.  ===Oggy Magnon=== Millions of years ago, when the world was made there was a village with lots of cats. In the meantime, Oggy Magnon was playing a flute and a drum when suddenly, he saw fire in the hands of the village chief. He was afraid of fire due to this: When he was young and a storm struck out burning a tree, he got burned, causing him to cry. Poor him... I wish he was never afraid of fire. Where was I now? Ah, yes. When the roaches started taking the fire, Joey sneezed. No one knows why so. The Village chief was really angry on the wrong excuse he did. Jack came along to the volcano. In the meantime, the Magnon looked at a flower. It almost, I guess bit him, but DeeDee ate it all up. Even on the way, Oggy was just taking a bath in a pool until a swarm of piranhas attacked him. When the reached the walls, they chose who had to go by playing a game. Oggy "lost" against Jack, so he had to go restore the fire. But the cockroaches screw everything up, making themselves and the Magnon fall. Inside the volcano was a jungle that has a dog named Bob and his servants. The servants tied the cat up, bringing it to Bob. Olivia saved Oggy in time. Then it was no one but him... and Olivia! When she greeted him, Oggy screamed as if he were in trouble, and then he was unconscious. When he woke up, he found out that he was in Olivia's flowerhouse aka hideout from the trollish enemies. She had also put leaves to recover Oggy's feet. In that time, Olivia left him for a few minutes to something, then he fell fast asleep. In his dream he was walking for a few seconds, wondering where he could be. Then he paused. He saw Olivia for a few moments and then he woke up. The roaches were the only reason to wake him up, so he tried to hit them until Olivia returned. He threw his weapon away. The scene was switched to the two cats walking. Oggy saw a flower which once, I guess, bit him. Or something. "Don't be silly, it's harmless." Olivia must have said this to Oggy when he was afraid of the flower. When the two were looking at the beautiful sunset, it was like that they became friends. The reason I think they became friends for their lives is this, when they were looking the sunset, they entwined their tails. In the meantime, Jack had also found the two which then resulted in a major problem for these guys. The cockroaches had told Bob that they have been to Olivia's flowerhouse and they know the location. For this, they kidnapped Jack and Olivia. What, about Oggy? Well, he was out to occupy himself. When he found out that the two were missing, he cried, then started finding them. Olivia told Oggy Magnon that the only way to free them is to use fire. But he told the female cat that he was afraid of fire. So she raised the stakes. If he would save the two using fire, she would give the Magnon a kiss. Oggy starts daydreaming of what would happen if he had saved her, going back to the village. "Oh, you are such a brave person! Thank you! (Kisses him)". Of course, this is what I think. Then he accepted the deal. So, Oggy Magnon found those stones and built the fire. He had saved Jack and Olivia, but she forgot to give or faked that she would give a kiss to Oggy. When the two males were escaping, the female refused to come. Then Oggy told Olivia that her flowerhouse was burned down to ashes, so she came. Back at the village, Joey was the chief for a few minutes until he sneezed again and he, Marky and Dee Dee are chased by the tribe, The chief said that how would they get fire again. Oggy had just the thing. Rocks! He used those rocks to recover the village fire. At this cost, the young Oggy Magnon became the next chief of the village.  ===Prince Oggy=== The next story takes place in 1350, on a kingdom that was looking good as they reveal a new statue of Oggy the 1st who vanish the Cockroach king. Trumpets were being blown as the king had handed down his sword to his prince named Oggy the 2nd. but after the sword was broken by an "accident", the prince never met someone who could actually be capable of becoming a princess. The King (Prince Oggy's father) said him to ride a horse, fight a dragon, and raid the enemy's kingdom. But the prince replied negatively about those things. He said he would fail doing all that stuff. When the princess audition started, no lady became the next princess. The prince and the leader of the soldiers, Jack, came alongside with him. If they would hunt animals they would get money. But they did not know that there was someone living in this forest. Prince Oggy wanted to take the butterfly. Jack was hunting for dangerous animals for a big loot. A shadow-like appeared, disappearing the wild boar and the second animal. The third animal was almost gotten when a person kicked the soldier leader. When they were fighting it was revealed that the guardian was Olivia. She called the animals to punish Jack, but the prince had finally found a perfect match! But she was not happy because the young prince had captured the butterfly he was trying to capture. Then he let the butterfly go. She then became happy of what Oggy did. Olivia told the prince that he would be a nicer man if he had carried her to her own house. And so he did. More animals punished Jack, but Oggy liked the place! It was like a dream come true. Olivia gave the prince a piece of cloth so that he would not forget her. When he came back to the castle he told his father and his mother that he had finally found a perfect match! The King and the Queen were very happy on his son. That he had found Olivia as the match. But something was not right. Black Knight Joey (the son of the Cockroach King) and his companions, Dee Dee and Marky, had devastated an evil plan to take over the kingdom. The guardian was captured and it was up to Oggy and Jack to save her once and for all. Oggy and Jack got in and rescued the guardian. When the prince and Olivia met again, they were going round and round. Using the curtain ropes was a brilliant idea to get out, but the cockroaches exploded the bridge to the castle and outside. Then the guardian called the birds to carry them to the other side. They were almost pronounced prince and princess when Oggy had to fight Joey again. But the prince won, and they lived happily ever after, except for the evil cockroaches, who were locked up in a cage on Bob's collar.  ===The Incredible Oggy Watson=== In December, 1899, at [[London]], Olivia closed her clock shop when the Cockroaches plan to steal something inside the shop.

Meanwhile, the remaining pieces of Oggy have been sent to the planet that Bob wants to destroy and was back to the same form from the beginning of the film. The form chased the three forms (who were the Cockroaches) and starts to evolve back to their original form which starts the whole thing all over again.  
Of Horses and Men
 In the remote Icelandic valley, there is not much to do other than observe the horses, the neighbors, and the neighbors' horses with [[binoculars]]. Undisturbed, the stallions and mares do what nobody else in the valley dares to even talk about: love. However, there is still a feeling of love among some of the valley dwellers. Kolbeinn ([[Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson]]) and Solveig's ([[Charlotte Bøving]]) attempts at love are the subject of much interest for the valley dwellers.  Meanwhile, Vernhardur ([[Steinn Ármann Magnússon]]), who has a [[alcoholism|weakness for liquor]], makes a name for himself on a Russian fishing vessel with the sailor Gengis ([[Kash Erden Baater]]). There is often disagreement about the riding routes between Grimur ([[Kjartan Ragnarsson]]) and Egill ([[Helgi Björnsson]]); Grimur generally prefers the classic routes on horseback, whereas Egill prefers riding through rough terrain on his tractor. Jóhanna ([[Sigríður María Egilsdóttir]]), on the other hand, has nothing to say concerning her mare Raudka. One day, she encounters an injured old man. The religious [[Juan Camillo Roman Estrada|Juan Camillo]] (himself) is seeking God on a high spiritual level.  Above all, all the people in the valley share a love of their horses, and eventually come to understand one another.  
Olympus Has Fallen
 Former Army Ranger Mike Banning ([[Gerard Butler]]) is the lead [[United States Secret Service|U.S. Secret Service]] agent assigned to head the U.S. Presidential detail. Banning maintains a personal, friendly relationship with [[President of the United States|President]] Benjamin Asher ([[Aaron Eckhart]]), First Lady Margaret ([[Ashley Judd]]) and their son Connor (Finley Jacobsen). During a snowy Christmas evening drive from [[Camp David]] to a campaign fundraiser, the car transporting the First Family spins out of control on a bridge due to icy conditions; Banning pulls Asher from the vehicle, but fails to save Margaret as she falls to her death inside the car.  Eighteen months later, having been removed from the presidential detail, Banning works at [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]] headquarters. During a meeting between Asher and [[South Korea]]n [[Prime Minister of South Korea|Prime Minister]] Lee Tae-Woo ([[Keong Sim]]) at the White House, a North Korean terrorist organization, led by Kang Yeonsak ([[Rick Yune]]), mounts an air and ground assault that results in the capture of the building. The group is aided by treasonous members of the prime minister's own detail, including Dave Forbes ([[Dylan McDermott]]), a former Secret Service agent. Asher and several top officials are held hostage in the [[Presidential Emergency Operations Center|White House bunker]]; South Korean Prime Minister Lee is executed on live video. Before his own death, detail agent Roma ([[Cole Hauser]]) alerts the [[Director of the United States Secret Service|Director of the Secret Service]] Lynne Jacobs ([[Angela Bassett]]) that "Olympus has fallen".  Kang seeks to use Asher's hostage status as leverage to force U.S. officials to withdraw the [[United States Seventh Fleet|Seventh Fleet]] and [[United States Forces Korea|U.S. forces]] from the [[Korean Peninsula]], thus removing American opposition to a North Korean invasion of South Korea. He also seeks to destroy the American nuclear weapons stockpile by detonating them in their respective silos across the country, turning the United States into an irradiated wasteland. To accomplish this, he requires the access codes to a system called Cerberus, which are held by three top government officials, including the President, all of whom are inside the bunker. Asher orders the other two officials to reveal their codes to save their lives, certain that he will not give up his code.  During the initial assault by Kang's forces, Banning joins the White House's defenders. He falls back into the White House, disabling the internal surveillance and gaining access to Asher's satellite ear phone, which he uses to maintain contact with Jacobs and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] Allan Trumbull ([[Morgan Freeman]]), now the [[Acting President of the United States|Acting President]].  Authorized to proceed, Banning’s first act is to save the President's son Connor, whom Kang plans to use to force Asher to reveal his Cerberus code. Banning finds Connor hiding in the building's walls and sneaks the boy to safety. Banning then begins reconnaissance, during which he kills several of the terrorists, including Forbes. Meanwhile, [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[General (United States)|General]] Edward Clegg ([[Robert Forster]]) convinces Trumbull to order an aerial [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]] assault on the White House. Kang discovers the assault force and activates the Hydra 6, an advanced anti-aircraft system built by the military. Discovering the system, Banning advises Trumbull and Clegg to abort the mission, but the new weapon system annihilates most of the assault force before Banning can stop it. Kang retaliates for the infiltration by killing [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] Charlie Rodriguez (Phil Austin).  After Banning disables Kang’s communications, Kang tries to execute [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] Ruth McMillan ([[Melissa Leo]]) outside the White House in front of the media, but Banning rescues her. With his forces dwindling, Kang fakes his and Asher's death by sacrificing several of his men and the remaining hostages. However, Banning sees through the ruse. Kang eventually cracks Asher’s code using [[brute-force attack]] and activates Cerberus. As Kang and his remaining men attempt to escape, Banning ambushes them and kills the remaining terrorists. During the fight, Asher tries to break free from Kang's grip and is subsequently shot by him in the stomach. Banning and Kang confront each other and a climactic fight breaks out, in which Kang quickly gains the upper hand. Eventually, Banning kills Kang by stabbing him in the head with a knife and disables Cerberus with the assistance of Trumbull and his staff, with only seconds to spare.  During daybreak, Banning walks out with Asher and is received by the soldiers posted to await their arrival. After the events, the United States begins to heal from the attack, while Banning once again heads the president's security detail.

When he wakes, he finds himself locked within a hotel room. His unseen captors provide him with food and hygiene items, but do not explain why he is captive. Joe sees a news report that says his ex-wife Donna was raped and murdered and he is the prime suspect, while their infant daughter Mia was adopted.  Over the next twenty years, Joe works himself into shape, compiles a list of all those who would want to imprison him, and writes letters to eventually give to Mia. One day, he sees an interview with Mia, who says she would forgive her father if she ever saw him.  Joe is drugged shortly thereafter, and wakes to find himself outside with a cell phone and a small amount of money. He spots the woman with the yellow umbrella and gives chase, but ends up running into Marie Sebastian, a nurse that offers to help. He refuses but takes her business card. Joe goes to his friend Chucky, and explains what has transpired. While there, Joe gets a call on his cell phone from a man calling himself the Stranger, mocking him. Joe spends a great deal of effort to determine if any of the men on his list are the Stranger, but they all prove to be innocent. Joe collapses from dehydration, and Chucky calls Marie to help. While he recovers, Marie is taken emotionally by Joe's letters to Mia, and offers to help him further. She is able to help identify a Chinese restaurant that Joe's food came from while imprisoned.  Joe follows a delivery from the restaurant to a warehouse where he was imprisoned, and meets Chaney, its owner. Joe tortures Chaney into confessing that the Stranger arranged for his imprisonment. On return to Chucky's bar, Joe finds the Stranger there with the woman with the yellow umbrella, his bodyguard Haeng-Bok. The Stranger says they have kidnapped Mia, but if Joe can determine his identity in 46 hours, he'll let Mia free, give Joe $20 million in diamonds and proof of his innocence in Donna's murder, and the Stranger will even commit suicide.  Joe learns that Chaney and his men are seeking revenge by attacking Marie, and he races there, only to be captured by Chaney. Just as Chaney is about to beat him savagely, the Stranger calls Chaney and offers to pay him for Joe's release, and Chaney lets them go. Marie recognizes the ringtone from the Stranger as the theme song to Evergreen Academy, where Joe attended. At the school, they look through yearbooks; Joe recognizes one student, Adrian Doyle Pryce, and recalls tormenting his sister, Amanda, for her promiscuity, which led to rumors that their father, Arthur, had [[incestuous]] relations with them both. As a result, Arthur moved them to [[Luxembourg]], but later murdered his wife and Amanda and committed suicide. Joe calls Chucky with the name, and Chucky confirms Joe's guess that the Stranger is Adrian. Adrian, who has cloned Joe's phone, overhears the conversation, and enraged by Chucky's contempt of him, kills Chucky before Joe can arrive. Joe hides Marie in a hotel for her safety, and they end up having [[sexual intercourse]], unaware Adrian is watching through hidden cameras.  Joe goes to Adrian's penthouse, defeats Haeng-Bok, and confronts Adrian. Adrian congratulates him, giving him the diamonds and escorting him to where Mia is. However, Adrian asks Joe to think why he had let Joe go in the first place, and shows that the interview with Mia was all a set-up, and "Mia" was a paid actress. Adrian shows Joe that Marie is really his daughter and had engineered events to this point to make Joe feel what it is like to lose everything. Adrian then fulfills his promise and commits suicide. Shaken, Joe writes Marie a letter saying they can never see each other again, and leaves her most of the diamonds, using the rest to pay Chaney to return him to the captivity of the hotel room.

Mario and Daniel next carry out a hit on a woman named Linda. Upon hearing of her death, Linda's husband, Pol, immediately calls Acosta. Pol reveals that Tiu's murder is one of several assassinations ordered by Manrique's close friend General Pacheco, a military officer campaigning for public office in the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]]. Pacheco runs a gun-for-hire operation using prisoners, and kills others involved in the business in order to protect his campaign. Acosta agrees to protect Pol and heads to the station, where he finds Coronel and Bernabe.

When Coronel discovers Mario's identity, he visits Lulette, who is with her lover, Boy. Coronel informs Acosta of Lulette's affair, and he attempts to use it as leverage while interrogating Mario. He is unsuccessful, but Mario later expresses to Daniel a sense of betrayal by his family's abandonment.  Tiu's father tells Acosta and Coronel that he can provide them with the evidence they need to arrest Pacheco. On the way, though, Coronel abandons Acosta to visit Pacheco, who admits that he killed Coronel's father. Coronel secretly records a conversation between Pacheco and his men regarding the murder of Tiu's father.  The next day, Coronel informs his wife Nicky of his intention to take down Pacheco, incriminating Manrique in the process. Daniel murders Coronel in front of police headquarters. Enraged, Acosta attacks Manrique's and Pacheco's security detail, resulting in a brief shootout, until Pacheco orders them to cease fire. On the day Mario is to be released from prison, he realizes that he has no reason to leave, as his family no longer wants to have anything to do with him, and he stabs Daniel to death in order to remain incarcerated. Coronel's death is mourned by many, including Nicky. Acosta is discharged and investigated for Coronel's murder. Mario visits home, kills Boy in front of his family, and returns to prison.  Sometime later, a recovered Bernabe looks through Coronel's possessions and finds the cell phone that Coronel used to secretly record the incriminating conversation between Manrique and Pacheco.

Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara!
 The film begins [[Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai|where its predecessor ended]], with reigning don Shoaib Khan ([[Akshay Kumar]]) earning respect after assassinating his mentor, Sultan Mirza ([[Ajay Devgn]]). Twelve years later he is still a charismatic, suave womaniser, who has extended his empire to the Mideast. Khan's only friends are Javed ([[Sarfaraz Khan]]) (who oversees his illegal work), his former love Mumtaz ([[Sonali Bendre]]), and Aslam ([[Imran Khan (Bollywood actor)|Imran Khan]]), a teenager Khan met during a visit to the slums in which he grew up.  An older Khan returns to [[Mumbai|Bombay]] to kill Rawal ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]), who opposed his ambition to take the reins in Bombay. Although the city was his first love, rising starlet Jasmine ([[Sonakshi Sinha]]) wins his heart. Khan advances Jasmine's career by rigging awards, and showers her with gifts; he becomes obsessed with her. He sends Aslam and another trustworthy aide, Jimmy, to kill Rawal. Jimmy fails, accidentally killing his girlfriend, Mona, and flees. He is soon captured by the police, hot on Khan's trail after learning about his arrival in Bombay. Jimmy, loyal to Khan, does not crack during his interrogation and is freed due to lack of evidence. The police intend to draw Khan out from hiding; he has eluded them for twelve years, and this is their last chance to take him on Indian soil.  Khan, suspicious that Jimmy has become a police informer, decides to kill him but Aslam offers to do the deed to deflect police attention. He, Dedh Tang and several thugs masquerade as rival (Yamaha RX100)biker gangs and stage a brawl. Plainclothes police officers try to control the chaos when Aslam corners Jimmy. When a police officer stops Aslam, Khan appears out of nowhere, murders Jimmy and injures the policeman. A chase ensues; the police fail to catch the two, who escape in Khan's Mercedes.  Although Khan has bought Jasmine a house, she rejects his advances, saying that she has never seen him as being more than a friend. Angry and disappointed, Khan slaps her and tells her to leave. He angrily destroys the set of the film she is cast in, leaving with her a twenty-four-hour deadline to accept his proposal. Jasmine returns home to see that Khan has filled her house with expensive presents. Her mother is taken aback when Jasmine explains that Khan is a gangster with whom she'd prefer not to associate. Her family questions the sense in rejecting a man as powerful and dangerous as Khan.  Later in the night, Jasmine meets Aslam at his uncle's restaurant. He tries to explain his love for her, only to be interrupted and told that she is engaged and the two should stop seeing one another. Dejected and disappointed, Aslam meets with Khan, who seems unusually pensive. The two lament their relationships, not knowing they are both in love with the same woman. Just before Aslam is about to reveal the name of his romantic interest, a phone rings – Khan, jubilant, announces that his proposal has been accepted and orders Aslam to pick up his new "bhabhi," or sister-in-law.  Aslam arrives at the address Khan has given him and, much to his shock, sees Jasmine walking towards his car. Initially angry that he is still following her, the two realize that they have been caught up in a complicated affair – that Aslam, unbeknownst to Jasmine, works for Khan, and that Jasmine was the one he had been sent to pick up. Before either can speak, a car containing Rawal and his henchmen arrives at a distance. Rawal shoots Jasmine, having learned of her relationship with Khan and hoping that hurting her lure the gangster into a vulnerable position.  Jasmine remains unconscious at the hospital as Khan arrives. He accuses Aslam of being in love with his fiancée – an accusation which Aslam denies as Khan reveals that he has masterminded a plan to murder Rawal and ensure his own dominance over the Mumbai underworld. Khan intends to fabricate a story of him feuding with Aslam to tempt Rawal and his rivals into contacting Aslam. The "news" reaches Rawal, who seems delighted at the prospect of being able to turn Khan's right-hand man against him.  When Rawal calls Aslam at the hospital, Aslam, now fully aware of Khan's feelings towards Jasmine, seems unsure whether to abide by Khan's plan. He reluctantly provides Rawal with an address, ending the phone call by telling him to "murder the bastard." Khan, lying in wait outside the address with a sniper rifle, kills Rawal and his henchmen when they arrive. Khan, having consolidated power, savours his victory and walks into a police station as a taunt to law enforcement. However, Dedh Tang accidentally reveals Aslam's love for Jasmine in the midst of celebration. Khan, infuriated, diverts the car to the hospital to confront Aslam, who has continued to stay with Jasmine as she recovers from being shot by Rawal. Knowing that his friend is in danger, Dedh Tang honks the horn of the car repeatedly after Shoaib and his henchmen enter the building, alerting Aslam to the danger and giving him time to escape. Entering to see an empty bed where Jasmine had before been laying, Khan realizes that Dedh Tang had given him away.  Khan sends his aide Akbar to kill Aslam after he and Jasmine flee to Aslam's uncle's restaurant in [[Dongri]]. Aslam assures Jasmine that Khan, though violent, would never hurt him. Their conversation is interrupted by a car's horn honking – running outside, Aslam is ambushed by Akbar after discovering the body of Dedh Tang, who has been killed by Shoaib for aiding the couple in their escape. Aslam, though injured and initially losing the fight, kills Akbar with a shovel. He calls Khan to tell him that the murder of Dedh Tang has, in effect, erased his deep-seated loyalty to his former boss. Khan responds by telling Aslam that sending Akbar was a mistake, as he must be the one to kill the man he views as also having betrayed him by "stealing" Jasmine.  Aslam and Khan confront one another as the police, having been alerted to Khan's location by a storekeeper, descend upon [[Dongri]]. Shoaib rains down blows and insults upon Aslam, urging him to defend himself in front of Jasmine. Nevertheless, Aslam, who still feels indebted and bound to Khan, does not fight back until Inspector Awant appears through the gathered crowd – even then, Aslam only pushes Khan away so that Khan is not shot by the officer. Reacting quickly, Khan draws a pistol of his own and shoots Awant before turning his weapon on Jasmine and Aslam. Jasmine, through tears and while holding a bleeding Aslam, tells Khan that he is truly evil and will never have her love. Khan seems to recognize the truth in her words as he drops his weapon and stares at the couple. Just then, more police officers arrive on the scene and open fire on Khan, who, now injured, is dragged away by one of his henchmen. He and Aslam, both alive but bloodied, lock eyes and reach out for another, having finally put aside their differences.  In the last scene, a bullet-ridden, dejected Khan reads a letter he was unable to give Jasmine in the [[Ship#Holds, compartments, and the superstructure|cargo hold]] of a ship leaving the city forever.

 Lia Tarachansky grew up in a settlement. When the [[Second Intifada]] broke out in 2000 her family moved to [[Canada]]. There, for the first time she met Palestinians and "discovered" their history and learned why they were fighting Israel in the first place.  When she became a journalist, she returned to Israel to become the local correspondent for [[Real news network|The Real News network]]. Returning for the first time to her settlement, she "discovers" the Palestinians next door as she travels the West Bank covering the Israeli military occupation. In this film she meets with those who played a personal role in the events of 1948 and like her, "discovered" that which they had not only erased from their consciousness, but erased from the map. For years she tries to convince veterans of the 1948 war who started the conflict as we know it today to face the most difficult questions and dig deep into their memories. This is a film about the questions Israelis cannot ask, about memories that cannot be uncovered, and the history which is fighting to come to light.  It was then, in 1948, three years after the [[Holocaust]] that the nascent Jewish state was created on Palestinian land. The [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|war]] that followed after Arab armies started to invade Israel led to two-thirds of the Palestinian people becoming [[refugees]]. Those who fled or were expelled to this day remain in camps throughout the Arab world, the West Bank and [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]]. In 2009 the Israeli government proposed a law that forbade mourning this history—a law that attempted to criminalize history itself.

Adam sits holding a [[lute]], in his cluttered [[Detroit]] [[Victorian house|Victorian]], as Eve wakes up in her bedroom in [[Tangier]], surrounded by books.

Eve confronts Adam when he returns, chiding him for wasting the life and opportunities he has to enjoy and appreciate the good things in the world, as well as their relationship. They spend their nights cruising the empty streets of Detroit, listening to music and playing chess. Their idyll is shattered by the arrival of Eve's younger sister, Ava, from [[Los Angeles]].

After they discuss how Marlowe secretly wrote most of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays, Marlowe dies. Eve takes Adam's ready cash and leaves him with the promise of a gift. He is captivated by the music from a nearby club, where Lebanese singer Yasmine is finishing a haunting song. Eve reappears with a beautiful [[oud]] and as they sit together outdoors and contemplate their likely demise, they spot a pair of young lovers kissing. "What choice do we have?"

One Night Surprise
 At her Marie Antoinette-themed birthday bash, Michelle loses her head after a few drinks and wakes up dishevelled in a hotel room.

Michelle narrows it down to three suspects who turned up at her shindig: figure-skating teenager Jeb (Jiang Jingfu); seafood-sauce tycoon Tiger ([[Leon Lai]]); and her Harvard-educated Chinese-American boss, Bill ([[Daniel Henney]]). Their confrontations provide ample opportunities for overdone slapstick and naughty sexual innuendo, but there’s also the matter of her incompatibility with any of them, poignantly addressing the harsh reality that she’s not exactly long-term relationship material in their eyes.

Her assistant, Tony Zhang, tries to explain to her that Bill doesn't really love her after they go out to dinner and see Bill eating with his new girlfriend.

Open Grave
 A man (Sharlto Copley) wakes up in a large pit full of dead bodies and does not remember how he got there. In a panic he cries for help before a woman throws a rope down into the pit, allowing him to climb and escape.  The man eventually finds his way to a house and discovers five occupants. A mute woman who doesn't understand English, a German man and three Americans, none of whom can remember his or her identity, although they do soon realize that they can remember other aspects of their former lives (such as the ability to speak other languages).  After long arguments about who is to blame they eventually stumble onto their identities. The man, who has no ID, is called John Doe, the German is Lukas, and the other three are Sharon, Nathan and Michael. There are no documents for the mute. Lukas continues to be hostile toward John especially when the group uncovers a picture containing all of them, with the exception of John. A nearby calendar hints that something is going to happen in two days (on the 18th), but there are no notes to indicate what.  The next morning the group explores the surrounding area. John and Sharon stumble across a locked shelter. Inside is a child who refers to John as Jonah and is clearly terrified of him. The child refuses to answer any questions and Jonah is forced to flee.  Meanwhile, Michael hears screams in the background and follows them until he finds a man trapped in barbed wire. The man is heavily covered in cuts, bruises, and sores. He begs Michael for help, but when he goes to help, the man violently attacks Michael and he soon dies of his wounds.  Jonah suffers numerous flashbacks of violence toward people including slamming someone's head against a wall. He and Sharon come across a group of individuals chopping wood and the pair are forced to flee when the woodcutters give chase. Despite catching up with Jonah and Sharon the group gives up chase when they spot dead bodies hung from a tree.  Nathan gets attacked by a group of people in a zombie-like state, but manages to survive.  An increasingly ill Lukas stumbles across a video camera that contains clips of Jonah conducting medical experiments on him and others. In the clips, Jonah explains that the vaccine does prevent the infection spreading, but has the unfortunate side effect of rendering the recipient unconscious for several hours, lowering the pulse to just 30bpm, and causing temporary memory loss upon being awakened.  Lukas confronts Jonah and knocks him out, binding his hands and throwing him back in the body pit. Jonah escapes again, and while trying to drive as far away as he can, Jonah encounters the child from earlier and three others who are trying to escape. They abandon their car for another. They are adamant that his name is Jonah and that he is a dangerous man before driving away. Jonah explores the abandoned car, discovering a medical kit, documents addressed to him, and a photo of him and Sharon confirming the two knew each other previously.  Jonah finally has flashbacks that confirm his identity as Dr Jonah Cooke and that he was trying to cure a plague with the help of the rest of the group who turn out to be his medical team.  Jonah regains focus just in time to see a car hurtling towards him that is driven by a now nearly fully infected Lukas. Jonah manages to convince Lukas of what is happening, but the German dies before a life-saving injection can be given from a cooler containing vaccine that was in a nearby abandoned car and that was supposed to be delivered to the military.  As Jonah is driving back to the house to inform the others what is happening, his car runs out of gas as dawn approaches. Back at the house, the mute is hiding while Nathan and Sharon have now both fully regained their memories. Suddenly, the house is surrounded by a large group of the infected, and in desperation Sharon writes a letter to Jonah that explains what has happened and what the solution is.  She reveals that the mute is the key to survival as she is immune to a virus that has wiped out most of the world's population; that Jonah was the leader of the medical team that was trying to prevent it spreading and, if possible, cure the currently infected. Lukas had become infected a few weeks before the events of the films and Jonah had injected everyone with the vaccine just before he awakened in the pit at the beginning of the film.  The dawn of the 18th breaks and Nathan recalls that it was the date that the rescue team was due to come. Those zombie-like infected surrounding the house suddenly are all shot dead and everyone else seems safe. Nathan wanders outside the house and thanks the person or persons who saved his life. However, the soldier gets orders to leave no survivors. Nathan suddenly finds himself surrounded and then shot to death while Sharon and the now returned Jonah watch.  When trying to escape, Sharon is stabbed in the back by an infected woman.  With very few options available to them, Jonah decides that the only way to escape execution is if he and Sharon were to take the vaccine again, thus appearing to be dead until the soldiers disappear. They climb back into the pit of bodies from the beginning of the film and Sharon gives Jonah the letter she wrote earlier, telling him that he must remember.  Jonah passes into unconsciousness and the letter falls from his grasp. When he awakens later, Sharon has now died from her wounds although Jonah doesn't know who she is. The mute throws down a rope to allow him to escape. As his memory recovers, he and the mute start a journey to an unknown location. It is revealed in the note that the mute is the source of a cure, as her blood is immune to the infection. Finally, Sharon states a message for Jonah "my love, I remembered everything, we were both doctors on the verge of finding a cure for an awful plague that cast the world into darkness, the mute woman is the answer, her blood is immune to the virus you must protect her, you will find death and madness everywhere, but you have to fight to finish what we have started. we have no time Jonah, there are still people waiting to be saved, I know your memory will come back soon, when it does remember I love you".  The film ends with the pair coming across another pit of bodies that stretches for several miles.

Out of the Furnace
 After getting off work at a [[North Braddock, Pennsylvania]], steel mill, Russell Baze catches his brother Rodney at a horse racing [[simulcast]], where Rodney had just bet on a losing horse. Rodney reveals John Petty loaned the money to him.  Petty owns a bar and runs several illegal games.  Russell visits Petty, pays off some of Rodney's debt, and promises to pay Petty the rest with his next paycheck if Rodney has not yet paid it off. Driving home intoxicated, Russell hits another car, killing its occupants, including a little boy. He is incarcerated for vehicular manslaughter. While in prison he is informed that his ailing father has died and his girlfriend Lena has left him for the small town police chief, Wesley Barnes. Upon his release from prison, Russell returns home and resumes his job at the mill.  The same day, Rodney  participates in an illegal bare-knuckle prizefight. Rodney was supposed to take a "dive" for Petty as a way to repay some of the gambling debt he owes Petty, but during the fight, Rodney becomes enraged against his opponent and wins the fight. The next morning, Russell finds Rodney's bloodied knuckle tapes in the trash and confronts him about it.  Russell wants him to work in the mill, but Rodney, a four-tour [[Iraq war]] veteran, is too mentally scarred to take a regular job.  Rodney tells Petty that these "nickel and dime" fights will never earn him enough money to pay Petty back. Rodney then insists that Petty call and organize a more lucrative fight. Petty reluctantly arranges a fight with Harlan DeGroat, a sociopathic drug dealer from rural New Jersey to whom Petty owes a lot of money. Russell wants Lena back, but she is pregnant with Wesley's baby. Russell unsuccessfully feigns happiness to Lena, saying she will be a great mom, but both know that her pregnancy makes their getting back together an impossibility.  Rodney is told he must purposely lose the fight in New Jersey. When DeGroat seeks assurances Rodney will lose, Petty promises he will. Rodney briefly knocks out his opponent, but when hearing Petty pleading with him, Rodney helps the fighter get up, takes a dive, and lets the man pummel his face into a bloody mess. After the fight, DeGroat asks for the rest of his money, but Petty reminds DeGroat they had agreed in advance that this fight made them even, and DeGroat drops the subject. While driving back home, DeGroat and his men ambush Petty and Rodney. DeGroat first shoots and kills Petty, has Rodney dragged into the woods, and kills him, too. Unknown to anyone, Petty had accidentally dialed his cell phone, which fell onto the car seat and connected to his bartender Dan's voicemail while recording DeGroat as clear evidence of his murdering Petty.  That night, Russell finds a letter from Rodney, stating this will be his last fight and he wants to work with Russell at the mill. Wesley informs Russell about Rodney's disappearance, and Russell and his uncle, Red, set off to find him. In DeGroat's town, Russell and Red are stopped by the sheriff, who informs them that DeGroat's men would kill them if they knew why the two were in town, and, as a favor to Sheriff Wesley, he will escort them to the state line rather than searching and arresting them for illegally carrying concealed weapons.  Upon returning to the mill, Wesley visits Russell and confirms Rodney's death. Russell goes to Petty's office, finds a phone number for DeGroat, and calls him without identifying himself, enticing him to come collect Petty's debt. At the bar, Russell sabotages DeGroat's van to prevent his escape and confronts him.  DeGroat escapes to a nearby, shutdown mill, where Russell shoots him in the thigh. Russell then follows DeGroat to a field outside the mill as he hobbles off and shoots him in the back. Russell informs DeGroat that he is Rodney's brother, as Wesley approaches the field in a squad car. Wesley pleads for Russell to put down his gun, but Russell proceeds to carefully aim his hunting rifle and shoots DeGroat in the head. The film cuts to Russell sitting at home at the dining table and fades to black.

Our Sunhi
 Sunhi ([[Jung Yu-mi (actress born 1983)|Jung Yu-mi]]) is a recent [[film school]] graduate who returns to her [[alma mater]] to solicit a recommendation letter from her former professor, Choi Donghyun ([[Kim Sang-joong]]), because she wishes to apply for a post-graduate course in [[United States of America|America]]. At first Donghyun tries to dissuade her, stressing the value of practical experience over theory, but he finally agrees, with one caveat: He can only write an "honest" letter, and if it doesn't satisfy her, she is free not to use it. In the letter, Donghyun states that Sunhi is artistically inclined and a good person, but he also implies that she's introverted, weak and never shows her real mettle.  While grabbing a [[beer]] at a nearby [[fast food]] [[chicken]] restaurant, Sunhi calls her ex-boyfriend Munsu ([[Lee Sun-kyun]]) to join her. She wants to confront Munsu over a film he made based on their failed relationship. As the number of empty bottles between them keeps growing, it becomes apparent that Munsu still carries a torch for the pretty and smart if "slightly bizarre," as Munsu calls her, Sunhi. She turns him down, but won't say why, then leaves.  The next day, Sunhi returns to campus, resolved to use her flirtatious charms to wrest a more flattering recommendation letter from Donghyun. She succeeds, persuading him to write a new letter, in which Donghyun now insists that she was his favorite student.  Meanwhile, Munsu meets with his friend, curmudgeonly fellow filmmaker Jaehak ([[Jung Jae-young]]). Jaehak also happens to be a confidant of Donghyun's, and during another drinking session, he lends a sympathetic ear to Munsu's lovelorn laments. But when Jaehak later encounters Sunhi by chance, he too finds himself falling under her spell after she asks him out for coffee and drinks.  Though Sunhi remains something of a mystery, the three men all think they know who she is and what she needs, essentially depriving her of her right to privacy or a self-determined identity. All three men pursue the same woman without realizing it — until they all meet together in a climax set on the beautiful, autumnal-colored park grounds of [[Seoul]]'s [[Changgyeonggung|Changgyeonggung Palace]].<ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref><ref></ref>

Pacific Rim (film)
 In 2013, an [[interdimensional doorway|interdimensional portal]] called the "Breach" opens at the bottom of the [[Pacific Ocean]], from which giant monsters, the [[Kaiju]]s, emerge. To combat the Kaiju threat, humanity builds massive robotic machines called Jaegers. Each Jaeger is piloted by two or more people, who are mentally linked in a process called "Drifting", to share the mental stress of piloting the machine.  In 2020, the Becket brothers, Raleigh and Yancy, pilots of ''Gipsy Danger'', are launched to defend [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] from Knifehead, a Category III Kaiju. Knifehead kills Yancy, and Raleigh barely manages to pilot the Jaeger on his own and kill the Kaiju. Traumatized by Yancy's death, Raleigh quits the Jaeger program. Five years later, the increasing power and numbers of the Kaiju cause the world governments to end funding for the continuous construction of Jaegers in favor of building coastal walls, and Marshal Stacker Pentecost moves all four remaining Jaegers to the last Jaeger Shatterdome in [[Hong Kong]] and plans to end the Kaiju War by destroying the Breach with a [[nuclear weapon]]. As ''Striker Eureka'', piloted by Herc Hansen and his son Chuck, kills Mutavore, a Category IV Kaiju, in [[Sydney]], demonstrating the ineffectiveness of the walls, Pentecost persuades Raleigh to rejoin the program and they arrive at Hong Kong and meet Mako Mori, director of the Jaeger restoration program. After finding her compatible, Raleigh and Mako try their first drift, but Mako ends up nearly destroying the Shatterdome while lost in the memory of a Category II Kaiju attacking [[Tokyo]] and killing her family, and is relieved of piloting duty. It is revealed that after this incident, Mako was saved and raised by Pentecost.  Pentecost consults Kaiju experts Newton Geiszler and Hermann Gottlieb to plan the assault on the Breach. Newton is able to drift with a piece of a Kaiju brain, discovering the Kaiju are scouts sent by invading beings from another dimension, and establishing a two-way mental link that enables the Kaiju [[Swarm intelligence|hive mind]] to gain access to his knowledge just as he did theirs. Pentecost tasks Newton with finding a [[black market]] dealer and seller of body parts of dead Kaiju, Hannibal Chau, to find a fresh Kaiju brain. Later, two Category IV Kaijus, Leatherback and Otachi, emerge and rampage through Hong Kong going after Newton. After Otachi destroys ''Crimson Typhoon'' and Leatherback destroys ''Cherno Alpha'', ''Striker Eureka'' loses all power by Leatherback's [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP blast]]. ''Gipsy Danger'' is finally sent and kills both Kaijus. Newton and Chau find out that Otachi is pregnant, and the infant Kaiju dies shortly after eating up Chau. Newton and Hermann drift with the infant's brain, discovering the Breach will only open in the presence of a Kaiju's DNA.  As Herc was injured during the previous fight, Pentecost, who is dying from radiation sickness from piloting a Jaeger with a nuclear core before the implementation of radiation shielding, gives a rallying speech and pilots ''Striker Eureka'' with Chuck. Along with ''Gipsy Danger'', they approach the Breach and are warned by Newton and Hermann of what they discovered from drifting with the infant's brain. Three Kaijus, two Category IV called Scunner and Raiju and a first Category V named Slattern, emerge from the Breach to defend it. After Raiju is killed, Pentecost and Chuck sacrifice themselves by detonating the bomb, which kills Scunner and wounds Slattern. Raleigh and Mako kill Slattern and drag it to the Breach, where Mako is ejected and Raleigh successfully overloads the Jaeger's reactor, destroying and closing the Breach. As Raleigh and Mako's escape pods surface in the Pacific Ocean, Herc orders the war clock to be stopped, indicating mankind's victory and Raleigh and Mako embrace.  In a mid-credits scene, Chau is shown cutting his way out of the Kaiju infant, looking for his lost shoe.  
Pain & Gain
  In 1995, schemer [[Daniel Lugo (convict)|Daniel Lugo]] ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) is a recently released convict who had served time for [[Medicare fraud]]. Sun Gym owner John Mese ([[Rob Corddry]]) hires him to increase membership and make the gym more fitness-based. Lugo increases the gym's membership by 75% within six weeks and befriends trainer Adrian Doorbal ([[Anthony Mackie]]), a bodybuilder rendered [[Impotency|impotent]] due to his steroid use. Lugo soon lusts after the earnings and lifestyle achieved by Victor Kershaw ([[Tony Shalhoub]]), a sleazy new member he begins to train, who Lugo believes is a crook. Inspired by motivational speaker Jonny Wu ([[Ken Jeong]]), Lugo decides to be a "do-er" and hatches a plan to [[extort]] Kershaw for his assets by kidnapping and torturing him.  Lugo recruits accomplices Doorbal and Paul Doyle ([[Dwayne Johnson]]), a recently released, cocaine-addicted convict who has turned to [[Christianity]]. Though Doyle is reluctant to join the team, he soon acquiesces after a being kicked out of the halfway house he is living in, after the priest running the home makes a sexual pass at him. This "Sun Gym gang" unsuccessfully attempts to kidnap Kershaw at home, and a second time in public, but later incapacitates him with a [[taser]] outside his deli and takes him to a small warehouse he owns (which is stocked with [[sex toy]]s). The kidnappers wear masks and Lugo disguises his voice, but Kershaw identifies Lugo from his distinctive [[Eau de Cologne|cologne]]. The scheme goes as planned otherwise: Kershaw makes calls, under duress, to provide false explanations for his disappearance, gets his family to move out of state, and signs the documents that transfer his assets to Lugo. Lugo even bribes John Mese to [[Notary public|notarize]] documents in Kershaw's absence, by presenting documents signed by Kershaw and using Kershaw's money to sponsor the Sun Gym.  The Sun Gym gang is able to collect Kershaw's money and assets, but they realize releasing him is a bad idea. Therefore, Lugo concocts a plan to kill Kershaw by forcing him to drink liquor and crash his BMW, making it appear like a drunk driving accident. When Kershaw survives the crash, the gang burns the car with Kershaw in it. Kershaw escapes the blazing vehicle, so the gang runs over his body, twice, and leave him for dead. Unbeknownst to them, Kershaw survives and is hospitalized. The Sun Gym gang members spoil themselves with Kershaw's riches. Lugo takes over Kershaw's car and his home in a ritzy Miami suburb; Doorbal marries the nurse who has been treating his impotence, Robin ([[Rebel Wilson]]), and uses his cut to purchase penile erection treatments; and Doyle abandons his restraints of religion and sobriety, and blows away his money on cocaine and his new stripper girlfriend.  Kershaw reports what happened to the police, but they are turned off by his unpleasant manner and do not believe his bizarre story even when he gives them Daniel Lugo's name, particularly because of Kershaw's blood alcohol level, and the fact that Kershaw was born in a South American country well known for its involvement in the drug trade. He then contacts [[Ed Du Bois, III]] ([[Ed Harris]]), a retired [[private investigator]] - who declines to take the case but warns Kershaw to quickly leave the hospital before the gang returns to kill him. Kershaw takes his advice and hides in a cheap motel. Upon reflection, Du Bois takes Kershaw's case and tails the Sun Gym gang. He visits the Sun Gym and meets with Lugo, who becomes suspicious after Du Bois mentions Kershaw's name.  When Kershaw furiously calls Mese about his stolen money, Lugo, Doyle, and Doorbal [[*69]] the call, thereby identifying where it originated, and go to the motel to kill Kershaw; however, they arrive too late, as he has checked himself out and is hiding at an abandoned baseball stadium. When Lugo and Doorbal discover that Du Bois is paying for Kershaw's room using his own credit card, they plan to kidnap Du Bois at his home. They arrive at the house, but the plot is thwarted when the police stop by to drop off Du Bois. In order to evade arrest, Lugo and Doorbal run and jump off Du Bois' dock into the water.  Du Bois gets a message from Kershaw and goes to the stadium to take him home. Meanwhile, Doyle (who has wasted all of his share of the spoils) attempts to rob an armored car. However, [[dye pack]]s planted in the money bag explode, and he narrowly escapes the police, getting his toe shot off in the process. He and Doorbal (who depleted his share on payments for treatments, his and Robin's wedding, and a new home) explain to Lugo they need more money, and the gang plans another kidnapping.  They target the wealthy Frank Griga ([[Michael Rispoli]]), who owns a [[phone sex]] operation. After a promising discussion at Griga's mansion, the gang invites Griga and his wife Krisztina Furton (Keili Lefkovitz) to Doorbal's home to propose an investment scheme. Griga insists on meeting with someone more senior and questions Lugo's amateurish business savvy. This angers Lugo, who attacks Griga and accidentally kills him. Krisztina discovers this and tries to shoot Lugo, but Doorbal injects her with a potent horse [[tranquilizer]]. Lugo and Doyle try to use the combination obtained from a heavily sedated Krisztina to open a safe at her and Griga's home, but the combination does not work. When Krisztina rouses and tries to escape, Doorbal gives her a second injection, accidentally causing her to fatally overdose.  Lugo and Doorbal purchase equipment to dismember and dispose of the bodies and dump the parts in oil drums (which they sink in a secluded swamp outside Miami), while Doyle incinerates their hands on a barbecue grill to eliminate their fingerprints. Doyle, perturbed by the violence he committed, leaves the gang and returns to the priest's church. The police learn of Griga and Krisztina's disappearances, and with evidence from Du Bois, they set a plan to arrest the Sun Gym gang.  The film returns to June 17: the police arrest Doyle at the church, Doorbal at home, and Mese at the Sun Gym. Lugo, also at the gym, spots the approaching police force and flees. Although struck by a police cruiser, he escapes and heads out by sea in Kershaw's [[speedboat]].

Oz the Great and Powerful
  In 1905 [[Kansas]], [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Oscar Diggs]] works as a [[Magician (illusion)|magician]] in a [[Circus|traveling circus]]. As a storm approaches, the circus [[Strongman (strength athlete)|strongman]] learns Oscar has flirted with his wife and threatens him. Oscar escapes in a [[hot air balloon]], but is sucked into a tornado that takes him to the [[Land of Oz]]. There he encounters the beautiful yet naïve witch Theodora, who believes him to be a wizard prophesied to become King of Oz by destroying the Wicked Witch who killed the previous king; the idea of being an immensely wealthy monarch makes Oscar immediately accept. En route to the [[Emerald City]], Theodora falls in love with Oscar, though he does not reciprocate her feelings. They encounter the flying monkey Finley, who pledges a life debt to Oscar when he saves him from a [[Cowardly Lion|lion]]. Oscar reveals his deception to Finley, forcing him to maintain the lie that he is a wizard.  At the Emerald City, Oscar meets Theodora's beautiful older sister, Evanora, who tells him that the Wicked Witch resides in the Dark Forest and can be killed by destroying her wand. Oscar and Finley are joined en route to the forest by China Girl, a young, living [[china doll]] whose village and family were destroyed by the Wicked Witch. The three reach the forest and, upon retrieving the wand, discover the "Wicked Witch" is [[Glinda the Good Witch]], who identifies herself as the late king's daughter and Evanora as the true Wicked Witch. Evanora sees this with her [[crystal ball]] and tricks Theodora into thinking he is trying to court all three witches at once. She offers Theodora a magic green apple she says will remove her heartache. Theodora bites it and turns into a [[Wicked Witch of the West|hideous green-skinned witch]].  Glinda brings Oscar's group to her domain to escape Evanora's army of [[Winkie Country|Winkies]] and flying [[baboon]]s. She confides in Oscar that she knows he is not a wizard, but still believes he can help stop Evanora. He reluctantly takes charge of an "army" of [[Quadling]]s, Tinkers, and [[Munchkin]]s. Theodora enters Glinda's domain and angrily reveals her new, hideous appearance to Oscar before threatening to kill him and his allies with the Emerald City's well-prepared army. Oscar despairs at his chances of victory, but after telling China Girl about the exploits of his hero [[Thomas Edison]], he conceives a plan that relies on [[sleight of hand|trickery]] and makes preparations with Glinda and his group.  Glinda and her subjects mount a fake attack on the Emerald City using a pulley-rig army of [[scarecrow]] puppets hidden by thick fog. The witches are tricked into sending their flying baboons through a [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]] field that puts them to sleep. However, two baboons manage to capture Glinda, who is brought to the city square and chained. Meanwhile, Oscar infiltrates the Emerald City with his allies, but appears to abandon them in a hot air balloon loaded with gold, which Theodora destroys with a fireball. As the wicked sisters prepare to execute Glinda, Oscar appears before his friends, having faked his betrayal and death. Using a hidden [[Fog machine|smoke machine]] and [[Projector|image projector]], he presents a giant image of his face as his "true" form, and a fireworks display to intimidate the Wicked Witches. Evanora fearfully hides in her castle while Theodora flees on her broom, unable to hurt the "invincible" wizard. Oscar calls to Theodora, offering that she would be welcome to return should she overcome her wickedness, which is met with defiance from Theodora, who flies away to the West hysterically laughing, leaving Oscar saddened. China Girl frees Glinda, who engages Evanora in a magical duel. During the fight, Glinda destroys Evanora's emerald necklace, revealing her to be an old hag, and banishes her. Evanora is carried away by the two remaining flying baboons as she vows revenge.  Oscar, now ruler of Oz, uses his projector to sustain the belief that he is a powerful wizard. He also presents gifts to his friends: Master Tinker, who helped build his machines, receives Oscar's camping-tool [[Pocket knife|jackknife]]; Knuck, the grumpy Munchkin herald, receives a mask with a smiley face; the long-suffering Finley receives Oscar's friendship along with his top hat; and China Girl accepts her friends as her new family. Finally, Oscar takes Glinda behind the curtains of his projector, thanking her for making him a better person, and they kiss.

The ACP goes to the Old city to collect the amount and the money is wrapped in big black plastic bags and is placed in the Deck lid of a Black Innova.  Another story runs parallel to the above plot. Prakash ([[Nani (actor)|Nani]]) is a model of an Old city sherwani firm who dreams to become rich. He has such an obsession for money that he pronounces his name as Pra'cash' often. He has two friends, Tabar ([[Akbar Bin Tabar]]), a cab driver and Gokul. Noor ([[Catherine Tresa]]), who also works in the same firm, is in love with him. However, as Prakash is in love with Sweety (Siddhika Sharma), the daughter of Sanyasi Naidu, Noor decides to leave him and marry an old sheikh in order to solve her family's financial problems on the pressure of their creditor and the local don Yadav (R.K.). But Prakash does not know that Sweety is Sanyasi Naidu's daughter and Sweety is not aware of Prakash's intentions and takes his advances lightly. When Prakash comes to know about Noor's marriage, he beats the sheikh, Yadav and his men in disguise and takes away Noor along with his friends. The two plots converge here as Prakash escapes in that Black Innova along with Noor and his friends while the ACP is left injured severely. Neither Prakash nor his companions are aware of the money in the car.  To save Noor, Prakash arranges her stay in Sweety's house to which Sweety accepts. In the meantime, Sanyasi Naidu calls his henchmen to Hyderabad to kill the ACP and find the money. Another gang of Sanyasi Naidu is approached by Saradhi who tells them to find the 50 crores and distribute it among themselves and this stint makes the other gang turning into Saradhi's henchmen. The ACP makes a deal with Encounter specialist Daniel (Raja Ravindra) to find the money and share it between them equally. Prakash comes to know that his phone is missing and is in the Innova and goes to the parking lot along with Tabar in the latter's cab. There Prakash finds the money in the deck lid and shifts the bags into the deck lid of the cab. Tabar and Prakash go to the place where abandoned vehicles are kept and there Prakash and Tabar see the money. The keys are with Prakash and both go away from there. Meanwhile, Daniel and his sub-ordinate go to the parking lot and find only a part of the money in the Innova's deck lid. While they are informing about it to the ACP, Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen kill him and see the photo of Daniel in the caller image when he dials again.  Daniel arrests all the Old city youngsters along with Prakash and Tabar and Daniel's sub-ordinate (Duvvasi Mohan) asks all of them about the money. Meanwhile, the Local MLA intervenes and all of them are released. Just as Prakash and Tabar leave the station, Saradhi's henchmen attack Prakash about the money and Prakash manages to beat them and escapes with Tabar. After an inquiry with the local Qazi, Daniel comes to know about Yadav's presence in the only marriage that happened on the day of missing of Innova. Yadav's men steal the cab from the new area and while Prakash and Tabar blame each other of stealing the money, Yadav makes a call to Prakash and threatens to sell the cab if he does not bring Noor today. But Yadav is unaware of the money in the cab. When Prakash, Tabar and Gokul see Yadav's men with the cab, they try to attack them but Daniel arrests Yadav's men and Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen rob the car. While Prakash, Tabar and Gokul chase them on a bike, they hit the car of Daniel and since Daniel knows that Prakash is also involved in the robbery of Innova after beating Yadav's men at the spot, Prakash and Tabar are arrested. They are tortured and when Daniel tries to shoot Prakash, Tabar tells that the money is in his cab. Tabar is shot by Daniel and Sanyasi Naidu's men kill Daniel and his sub-ordinate and kidnap Prakash. Gokul reaches the spot and takes Tabar along with him whom Prakash believes to be dead.  Sanyasi Naidu sees Prakash and threatens to kill Noor who is present in his house if he doesn't tell the place where the money is. Then Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen inform him that the cab is at the place where they robbed it as there was no petrol in it to drive. Prakash goes there along with Sanyasi Naidu's henchmen and is informed by Sweety that he is going to be murdered after they reach the spot. Prakash beats them up and refuels the cab. He goes to Yadav's place where Tabar and Gokul are being held. He calls Sanyasi Naidu to come there along with Noor if he wants him. Meanwhile, Prakash leaves petrol cans open inside the cab and plans to explode the cab once the petrol leaks. The two parties meet each other and while everything is going smooth, Saradhi's henchmen arrive along with Sweety and threaten Sanyasi Naidu to kill her if Prakash and the 50 crores are not handed to them. Prakash and Sanyasi Naidu are not at all happy as Yadav is now aware of the money's presence and Prakash displays the money in the deck lid. He locks it and throws away the key. In the chaos that ensues, Sweety's life is endangered which worries Sanyasi Naidu.  Once Sweety and Noor are saved, the petrol starts leaking profusely and Prakash throws a burning stick on it which blasts the car and the entire money is burnt into ashes. Sanyasi Naidu is a reformed man. Prakash marries Noor and goes to Dubai along with his friends. There when his friends blame Prakash for burning the money, Prakash replies that before reaching Yadav's place, he took 50 lakhs from the lot and replaced it with white papers. Out of the 49.5 crores, he donates 45 crores to Saheli, an organisation established for the welfare of poor women in old city to ensure that there is no financial problem to the old city families among which Noor's family is also one.

Paya Enna Hiru Se
   
Pee Mak
 The story is set in mid-19th century [[Thailand|Siam]], during the era of [[Mongkut|King Mongkut]] and at the height of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Rattanakosin Dynasty]], when Siam was plagued with wars with its neighboring kingdoms. Mak ([[Mario Maurer]]) was drafted to serve in a [[Burmese–Siamese War (1849–55)|war]], forcing him to leave behind his pregnant wife Nak ([[Davika Hoorne]]) at the town of Phra Khanong, not far from Central [[Bangkok]]. He was wounded during a battle and sent to a medical camp, where he met fellow soldiers Ter, Puak, Shin and Aey, who later became his best friends after he had saved them from certain death. Meanwhile, in Phra Khanong, Nak struggled alone painfully to give birth to the baby; she calls out for help, but she is too weak to be heard. Shortly after, rumors started circulating the village that Nak had died in labor and was now a ghost of a very powerful form haunting the house. The villagers in the neighborhood then heard her singing lullabies to her baby, terrifying them and forcing them to cower in fear.  When Mak and his friends arrive back in Phra Khanong in the evening, they find the town completely silent. The five soon arrive at Mak and Nak's house during the night, and Mak introduces Nak to them. As it is now too dark to continue traveling, Mak's friends decide to stay. The following day, the men visit the village market but are shunned by the fearful community. A drunk villager attempts to shout out a warning to Mak but is forced down and hushed by her son. Mak's four friends then discuss what they had heard, but dismiss the rumors as ridiculous. Shin, however, while he was sent to fetch Mak, saw that the house was a dilapidated wreck that hadn't been maintained for months, that the baby cot that Mak and Nak's son, Dang, was supposed to be sleeping in, was rocking by itself, and then he saw Nak extending her arm to an unnatural length to retrieve a dropped lime under the house. The following day, Ter discovers a decomposed corpse behind the house wearing the exact same ring as Nak. The drunk villager who had also tried to warn them earlier also turned up mysteriously drowned. Soon, all four friends are convinced that she is a ghost. The friends then try numerous methods to convince Mak of the news, including a game of charades, and come within inches of being murdered by Nak, with only Mak's presence preventing her from doing so, and she scares them away.  Worse, Mak dismisses all of their warnings, proclaims that they are no longer his friends, and kicks them out of their accommodations.   Later, Mak and Nak go out on a date in the town, visiting an amusement park. Mak's friends' attempt to separate the two by kidnapping Mak, but their plans are foiled when Nak discovers them and chases them away. Suddenly, during the getaway, Mak's old wartime wound reopens. His friends express surprise at how slowly it has healed, but Shin and Ter become convinced that he, not Nak, is the ghost, and their fears are seemingly confirmed when Mak reacts in pain when they attack him with holy rice. The friends then flee from their wounded friend and rescue Nak. While escaping in a boat, Mak 'returns' to them, walking into the river to them, but ends up almost drowning when he suffers cramps. As ghosts are not supposed to feel cramps, Mak is revealed to not have been a ghost, and he is rescued; when asked why he screamed when hit by the holy rice, he reveals that the rice had riddled his wound, making him yell out in pain. In the following confusion, Aey drops a ring identical to the one Mak, Nak, and the body behind the house had been wearing. Aey is immediately pronounced a ghost and kicked off the boat. The others then try to escape, but, as they had lost the paddles to the boat earlier, they cannot move. Nak then somehow produces a soaking wet paddle and hands it to Ter, who suddenly recalls that all of them had been thrown overboard, and had already drifted too far away for a normal person to recover. Ter then stands up on the boat to look between his legs at the group; Nak is revealed to have been the ghost all along, and the four remaining men, including Mak, retreat to a temple.  There, the men come under the protection of the local monk, armed with holy rice, holy water, and the temple is fortified with an enchanted 'safety ring.' Nak quickly appears, in her terrifying ghostly form, and attacks. Initially, the holy 'weapons' successfully keep Nak at bay, but, in a panic, coupled with Mak's struggle to get back to his wife, all of the holy rice and water are wasted, and the monk was accidentally kicked out of the "safety ring." The monk then fled the temple, leaving the four, who had since destroyed the 'safety ring' while trying to run, to face the angry Nak. A pale Aey then reappears, and it was revealed that he is also human; he was in possession of the ring because he had stolen it off of the corpse behind the house to finance his gambling. Nak angrily shouted at the five that she just wanted to be with her loved one, which the four friends argued against since they didn't believe the living can be with the dead, and accuse her of killing the drunk; Nak furiously denies her involvement and says that the drunk had drowned herself. Nak, in a combination of sadness, anger, and desperation, then threatens to kill Mak and take him to live with her, but stops when she sees how much she had been scaring her husband. Mak then revealed he knew the truth about Nak all along, having had his suspicions raised during the game of charades. He had already looked at Nak between his legs, which revealed her ghostly form, and found her decomposed corpse. However, even then, he is far more afraid of living without her than of her being dead. The two tearfully reconcile. His friends, seeing them reuniting, also tearfully reaffirm their friendship, and vow to never leave each other again. A flashback to Mak and Nak's first meeting is shown.  In the credit scenes, Mak, his wife and now his four friends live happily in the village. Nak uses her supernatural abilities to do chores, play charades (and helping Mak win for the first time), scare off villagers attempting to drive her away (who are led by the village drunk's son) and even run the town's 'haunted house' attraction. It is also revealed that her child, Dang, also possesses some of her abilities, even though he is still an infant.

Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters
  While in Camp Half-Blood, Percy recounts the story of Thalia and her sacrifice. A young Annabeth, Luke, Grover and Thalia are running to Camp Half-Blood while being pursued by monsters. Thalia sacrifices herself to get the others into the camp, and her father [[Zeus]] transforms her into a pine tree, creating a magical border around the camp. Soon a [[Cyclops]] passes through the border and is revealed to be Tyson, Percy's half-brother. The camp is later attacked by a [[Khalkotauroi|Colchis Bull]] who breaks through the border and ravages Camp Half-Blood. Percy defeats it with the help of Tyson, Annabeth, and Clarisse. Following this, Luke (who had survived his and Percy's battle in the previous film) appears and confronts Percy, trying to convert him to his cause. When Percy refuses, Luke disappears.  The campers realize that Thalia's tree has been poisoned by Luke and they are vulnerable to attacks. Percy visits the [[Oracle]], who tells him of a prophecy of a half-blood of the eldest gods either saving or destroying Olympus. Chiron tells Percy that he is the only living, human half-blood of the eldest gods, so the half-blood in the Prophecy may refer to him. Annabeth and Grover learn about the [[Golden Fleece]], which has the power to heal anything, and propose a quest in which they retrieve the Fleece and use it to heal Thalia's tree. Mr. D chooses Clarisse to lead the quest, much to Annabeth's and Percy's dismay. Percy convinces Grover and Annabeth to accompany him on the quest, and Tyson joins them. Annabeth hails the Chariot of Damnation, and Percy threatens the three drivers ([[the Graeae]]) to tell him of his prophecy, giving him coordinates for the Sea of Monsters (the [[Bermuda Triangle]]) before ejecting the group from the cab in Washington D.C. because they lack money. While walking down the street, Grover is kidnapped by Chris Rodriguez and taken to Luke. Percy, Annabeth, and Tyson first locate Luke with the help of [[Hermes]], then ride a [[Hippocampus (mythology)|Hippokampos]] to his yacht, the ''Andromeda''. Luke reveals his plan to revive [[Cronus|Kronos]] using the Fleece so Olympus will be destroyed. Percy and they are then locked in the brig, though they later escape when Percy uses his ability to manipulate water.  The group is consumed by [[Charybdis]], and they discover Clarisse in the monster's stomach. Percy and Clarisse work together to escape [[Charybdis]] by shooting a hole through its gut, and soon they arrive at Circeland, Polyphemus's lair. Percy finds Grover, and the five escape [[Polyphemus]], retrieving the fleece and trapping him in his cave. Afterwards, Luke arrives and demands the fleece from Percy, who refuses. Luke shoots a [[crossbow]] bolt at Percy, but Tyson takes the bolt in the chest and falls into the water below.  Luke begins reviving Kronos and Annabeth encourages Percy to take leadership. The team escapes captivity, and Percy grapples with Luke over the Fleece, like the prophecy said they would, but Luke easily gains the upper hand. Luke is suddenly thrown away by Tyson, revealed to have survived his wound due to the water healing it, as he is [[Poseidon]]'s son. Kronos rises from the sarcophagus and consumes Luke and Grover before battling Percy. Percy realizes that Riptide is the "cursed blade" of the prophecy and slices Kronos into pieces imprisoning Kronos in the sarcophagus once again, causing him to regurgitate Grover and Luke, the latter landing in Polyphemus's Lair. Their victory is short lived as Annabeth is stabbed by the [[Manticore]], who is killed in turn by Clarisse and Grover. Annabeth dies in Percy's arms but is resurrected by the Fleece. Percy then gives the fleece to Clarisse, and they return to Camp Half-Blood. Clarisse places the fleece on Thalia's tree. The group returns the next day to find Thalia alive, as the fleece returned her to human form.  Percy realizes that Thalia, as a child of Zeus, is another possible child of the prophecy about either preserving or destroying Olympus. The film ends showing the sarcophagus with Kronos's remains in it glowing, implying that Kronos still has some degree of his power, and is still planning to return.  
Persona 3 The Movie: No. 1, Spring of Birth
   Due to an unfortunate accident during the Spring of April 6, 2009, Makoto Yuki (Akira Ishida) arrives in the city late at night on a delayed train. Upon disembarking at midnight, a strange phenomenon grips the city—shutting down all forms of technology and causing humans to become encased in coffins. Unperturbed, Makoto casually makes his way to the Iwatodai Dormitory where a mysterious boy (Akira Ishida) greets him with a contract after which he meets fellow dormmates, Yukari Takeba (Megumi Toyoguchi) and Mitsuru Kirijo (Rie Tanaka), albeit the pair weary of his arrival at midnight.  The next day, Makoto enrolls at Gekkoukan High School as a sophomore with Yukari and fellow classmate Junpei Iori (Kōsuke Toriumi). Afterwards the school's Chairman of the board, Shuji Ikutsuki (Hideyuki Hori), asks Yukari to keep a close eye on Makoto due to his uncanny characteristics which hint at his "potential" and coincidental circumstances involving the death of his parents during an accident in the city some ten years previous. Meanwhile Makoto finds himself in a place called the ''Velvet Room'' and becomes acquainted with Igor (Isamu Tanonaka) and Elizabeth (Miyuki Sawashiro).  During the full moon of April 9, while Ikutsuki, Mitsuru and Yukari are observing Makoto during the midnight phenomenon, Akihiko Sanada (Hikaru Midorikawa) rushes back to the dorm just as it comes under the attack of a swarm of monstrous creatures. Yukari immediately grabs Makoto and flees to the roof. However they are cornered by a giant creature who knocks Yukari out. Much to everyone's amazement though, Makoto awakens to the power of Persona, calling forth Orpheus. However another Persona known as Thanatos, rips out of Orpheus and grotesquely destroys the creature before Makoto faints.  After having been unconscious for over a week, Makoto awakens in the hospital to find Yukari, who explains their similarity in having both lost parents during the accident in the past. The next day Ikutsuki, Akihiko and Mitsuru recruit Makoto to the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad—SEES to help them fight the Shadow creatures responsible for the ''Apathy Syndrome'' by preying on humans during the Dark Hour midnight phenomenon. Not long after as Junpei also joins SEES, Akihiko deduces that they have enough members to begin exploring their school's Dark Hour form, a Shadow-infested labyrinth called Tartarus, where they hope to unearth the mystery of the Dark Hour. Makoto also befriends Fuka Yamagishi (Mamiko Noto) and learns of her strained relationship with class bully, Natsuki Moriyama (Yuka Komatsu).  During the full moon on May 9, Mitsuru detects an abnormally large Shadow presence aboard a train and deploys Makoto, Yukari and Junpei to investigate. However the trio are ambushed by the Shadows just as the train begins accelerating. Junpei charges ahead  and encounters the Priestess Arcana which overwhelms him. However as the train nears an inevitable collision, Makoto evokes the ''Wild Card'' ability to defeat the Priestess with Junpei before stopping the runaway train.  On the night of May 30, two girls fall victim to the ''Apathy Syndrome'' in front of the school which prompts widespread rumors. Yukari, Junpei and Makoto go looking for answers from the delinquents behind Port Island Station and learn from Shinjiro Aragaki (Kazuya Nakai) that the girls had been bullying Fuka before the latter suddenly disappeared that same night. On June 8, Natsuki confesses to Mitsuru that she and her friends had locked Fuka inside the school's gymnasium. However when her friends went to check on Fuka that same night, she had mysteriously vanished while the latter developed the ''Apathy'' cases after being preyed on by Shadows. That night the SEES members deduce that Fuka may be trapped inside the Tartarus tower and plan to rescue her. However when Mitsuru asks Makoto to accompany them, Yukari grows frustrated at his ambivalence and he excludes himself from the mission. Instead, Mitsuru elects him to protect Natsuki at the dorm where he listens to Natsuki's reasoning for bullying Fuka and relates that Fuka genuinely considers her as a friend.  Afterwards the SEES members break into the school and indeed find Fuka inside Tartarus when the Dark Hour strikes. However when Akihiko pieces together the connection between the full moon and the powerful Shadows, Mitsuru and Yukari come under attack by the Emperor and Empress Arcanas at Tartarus' entrance. Junpei, Akihiko and Fuka rush to their aid however the Arcanas easily overwhelm all of their Personas. In the midst of the battle, Fuka also awakens a Persona, Lucia, to defend an entranced Natsuki. However when the Emperor moves to attack her, Makoto arrives in the nick of time and launches a barrage of Persona attacks despite his teammates begging him to flee for his safety. With everyone approaching their physical limits, Fuka uses Lucia to sense the Arcanas' weaknesses and coordinates the SEES members in a collaborative effort which results in the Shadows' defeat. A few days later, Fuka moves into the Iwatodai dorm and repairs her relations with Natsuki, while life returns to a level of normalcy.  In a [[post-credits scene]], the mysterious boy appears to Makoto and introduces himself as Pharos. Meanwhile at an undisclosed location, a girl awakens from a slumber.

In that way, he supported Islam, since, it is the religion that believes God created the man” he adds. The documentary discusses on various platforms such as what is the opinion of Periyar on zakat, how one’s caste discrimination will change if one changes from his religion to other, whether changing of religion affects the ‘Dravidian’ image, whether Periyar accepts Muhammed as a final prophet and finally, most importantly, whether Periyar shifted to Islam religion.

The Physician (2013 film)
  It is the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]], and the Church is fighting against 'black magic'. The medical knowledge of Greek physicians like [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]] had been lost to the [[Medieval medicine of Western Europe|medicine of medieval Europe]] (until taught later in schools such as the [[School of Salerno]] after the [[Latin translations of the 12th century|Arabic-Latin translation movement]] of [[Renaissance of the 12th century|the 12th century]]). In 11th-century England, travelling [[barber surgeons]] attempted to supply medical care to the ordinary population, often at the risk of the Church persecuting them for witchcraft.  Robert Cole has an extraordinary gift, where he can sense when someone left untreated has a [[terminal illness]]. He notices this for the first time when he feels it as a little boy when his sick mother is dying of [[appendicitis]], a disease he was unaware of. The young orphan joins an itinerant barber-surgeon who calls himself Barber. Barber teaches him the basics of medieval medicine, with services such as [[cupping therapy]], [[bloodletting]], and [[dental extraction]]. Even as an apprentice Rob recognizes the limitations of these simple practices. When Barber suffers from a [[cataract]], Rob consults a real Medicus for him. This [[Jew]]ish doctor heals Barber completely. He learns a little bit of Jewish culture. He speaks with two children, Jesse and Benjamin. There, Rob sees for the first time a [[world map]], and learns of the famous [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]], who teaches medicine in distant [[Iran|Persia]]. So he decides to train there to become a physician. During the [[Islamic Golden Age]], the [[medicine in the medieval Islamic world]] (evolved from a symbiosis of [[Academy of Gondishapur|Gondishapur]] [[ancient Iranian medicine|Iranian medicine]] and [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] [[Byzantine medicine]] in [[Baghdad]]'s [[House of Wisdom]]) is far more advanced than in Europe. The doctor, scientist and philosopher Ibn Sina teaches in [[Isfahan]], the most important school for aspiring practitioners in the world at that time.  Rob is told Christians are forbidden in Muslim lands while Jews are tolerated. Upon arriving in [[Egypt]], Rob therefore [[circumcision|circumcises]] himself and calls himself Jesse ben Benjamin, pretending to be a Jew (Rob is, in fact, a Christian). In a caravan he comes to know Rebecca who reads to him from [[One Thousand and One Nights|a book]] about [[Aladdin]] and [[Sinbad the Sailor]]. The caravan experience a desert storm, so Rob almost dies. When, after arriving to Isfahan, he asks for admission to the hospital and school of Ibn Sina, he is thrown out and beaten by guards. Lying in the street with a cut and a [[concussion]] he is found by the Guardian, so then he is taken in as a patient.  In a [[bimaristan]] (hospital) and [[madrasa]] (college), he is treated by Ibn Sina and admitted as a student to learn the basics of scientific medicine as well as [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|other sciences]] and philosophy (including [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] and [[Islamic philosophy]]). Rob learns to perform a [[medical history]] and medical examination including [[pulse diagnosis]], the [[Hirudo medicinalis|leech treatment]], the use of opium, including the [[analgesic]] effect, and surgical procedures. After the Shah refuses a peace treaty with the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]], the Seljuks send a man infected with the [[Black Death]] to infect the city. Thousands begin to die after being cared for by Ibn Sina and his students. Only by Rob's discovery and rapid application of basic [[Hygiene|hygienic]] principles, the plague is overcome. Rob suggests that [[oriental rat flea]]s may be the carriers of the Black Death, and with rat poison the pest may be suppressed. Rob is reunited with Rebecca, who has come down with the plague, and is able to bond with her since her husband temporarily abandons the city, leaving her to become sick. Rob nurses her back to health, Rebecca makes a full recovery, and she and Rob become romantically involved and engage in [[extramarital sex]] right before Rebecca must return to her husband, who has returned to the city. Rebecca is impregnated as a result, and her husband eventually discovers this, which leads to her being sentenced to death by [[stoning]].  The [[Christianity|Christian]], Jewish and [[Islam]]ic religions influence the evaluation of medical science, and a conflict is sparked by the ethical assessment of the [[autopsy]] on the human body. As a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] dies of [[appendicitis]], Rob learns from him that Zoroastrianism does not prohibit an adherent from undergoing autopsy after death. Rob secretly performs an autopsy on his body to deepen his knowledge of anatomy and to discover the inflamed [[vermiform appendix]]. When the [[mullahs]] discover what he has done, both Rob and Ibn Sina are being sentenced to death for [[necromancy]]. Rebecca is about to be stoned for [[adultery]], when the Shah is apparently stricken with appendicitis. Rob and Ibn Sina are freed so that Rob will perform an [[appendectomy]], using [[anesthesia]], on the Shah. Before beginning the surgery, Rob arranges for Rebecca to be rescued from her impending execution.  Isfahan is betrayed by the [[mullahs]] to the [[Seljuks]], since they want to drive the Jewish community and Ibn Sina's madrasa out of the city. Mullah soldiers then arrive to attack the hospital. Ibn Sina heads to the burning library and transfers his [[The Canon of Medicine|medical writings]] to Rob Cole, and also awards him the medical title '[[Hakim (title)|Hakim]].' Ibn Sina . He then stays to die in the burning library.  Rob Cole, as well as others, escape through a gate the Shah has told them about while he and his men go to make a last stand against the Seljuks. Rob returns with Rebecca, as his wife, to London and establishes a hospital. The old Barber, Cole's first teacher, learns from a little boy about his former pupil's return and fame. The Barber then asks the boy to take him to see his old pupil as the film ends.   
Philomena (film)
 [[London]] based journalist [[Martin Sixsmith]] has lost his job as a government adviser. He is approached at a party by the daughter of Philomena Lee. She suggests that he write a story about her mother, who was forced to give up her toddler son Anthony nearly fifty years ago. Though Sixsmith is initially reluctant in writing a human interest story, he meets Philomena and decides to investigate her case.  In 1951, Philomena became pregnant and was sent by her father to [[Sean Ross Abbey]] in [[Roscrea]] in [[Ireland]]. After giving birth, she was forced to work in the [[Magdalene laundry|convent laundry]] for four years, with little contact with her son. The nuns gave her son up for adoption without giving Philomena a chance to say goodbye. She kept her lost son a secret from her family for nearly fifty years.  Martin and Philomena begin their search at the convent. The nuns claim that the adoption records were destroyed in a fire years earlier; they did not, however, lose the contract she was forced to sign decades ago forbidding her from contacting her son, which Martin considers suspicious. At a pub, the locals tell Martin that the convent burnt the records deliberately, and that most of the children were sold for £1,000 each to [[wealth]]y Americans.  Martin's investigation reaches a dead end in Ireland, but he receives a promising lead from the [[United States]] and invites Philomena to accompany him there. His contacts help him discover that Anthony was renamed [[Michael A. Hess]], who became a [[lawyer]] and senior official in the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] and [[Presidency of George H. W. Bush|George H. W. Bush]] administrations. When Philomena notices Martin in the background of a photo of Michael, he remembers that he met him years earlier while working in the US. They also learn that he has been dead for eight years.  Philomena decides she wants to meet people who knew Michael and learn more about him from them. They visit a former colleague of Michael's and discover that Michael was [[Homosexuality|gay]] and died of [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. They also visit his sister Mary, who was adopted at the same time from the convent and that they were both [[emotional abuse|emotionally]] and [[physical abuse|physically abused]] by their adoptive parents, and learn about his partner Pete Olsson. After avoiding Martin's attempts to contact him, Pete agrees to talk to Philomena. He shows Philomena some videos of his life with Michael. To Martin and Philomena's surprise, they see footage of Michael, dated shortly before he died, at the Abbey where he was adopted, and Pete explains that, although he never told his family, Michael had privately wondered about his birth mother all his life, and had returned to Ireland in his final months to try to find her. Pete informs them that the nuns had told Michael that his mother had abandoned him and that they had lost contact with her. He also reveals that, against his parents' wishes, he had Michael buried in the convent's cemetery.  Philomena and Martin go to the convent to ask them where Michael's grave is. Despite Philomena's efforts to stop him, Martin angrily breaks into the private quarters and argues with an elderly nun, Sister Hildegarde McNulty, who worked at the convent when Anthony was forcibly adopted. He accuses her of lying to a dying man and denying him the chance to finally reunite with his mother, purely out of self-righteousness. Hildegarde is unrepentant, saying that losing her son was Philomena's penance for having sex out of [[Marriage|wedlock]]. Martin demands an apology, telling her that what she did was un-Christian, but is speechless when Philomena instead chooses to forgive her of her own volition. Philomena then asks to see her son's grave, where Martin tells her he has chosen not to publish the story. Philomena tells him to publish it anyway.

 A debutant English crime novel writer Jebin M. Jose discovers that his deceased father had run bankrupt with an unlisted property in [[Pondicherry]]. To pay off the debts, he makes a visit to the villa for valuation. But after seeing framed paintings by his father, he calls his girlfriend Aarthi, who is an art student, to accompany him to the villa. She immediately likes both the villa and the mysterious paintings. She particularly shows interest in one dual faced painting.   Aarthi urges Jebin not to sell the villa. Within a few days time, Jebin's career gets a new break when an established publisher comes forward to buy rights for his first novel ''Maybe, Maybe Not!''. He also gets advance  in a two-book contract. Seeing this as a sign, Jebin continues to stay at the villa in hopes it will bring him good luck while starting to work on his second novel ''The Director''. Meanwhile, Aarthi returns to Chennai to seek permission from her father for their marriage, leaving Jebin alone in the villa.  One night, an ecstatic Jebin plays the Victorian piano. The strings get jammed abruptly. He opens the lid and finds a secret key underneath. Jebin also gets curious on the remarkable geometry of one of the paintings which appears to be more like a map than a work of art. He notices that it is similar to the floor plan of the villa given to him by his lawyer. As he probes each room in the villa, he stumbles upon a secret door behind a wardrobe. He uses the secret key to open the lock and discovers plenty of paintings rolled up inside a trunk. Many scenes appear to have come straight out of his own life, like his mother's death by car accident. Jebin slowly realises that his father had [[precognition]] skills and concludes that his paintings may predict future events.   Not too long after that, Jebin wins a prestigious literary award and critical acclaim for his debut novel, as depicted in one of his father's paintings. However, he gets overwhelmed by this unexplained occurrence and tries to sell off the villa. During the process, the estate agent gets injured in a freak accident by the cast-iron gate, scaring away potential buyers who view this as a bad omen. Frustrated, Jebin furiously tries to complete his second novel. When Aarthi returns from Chennai, Jebin tells her about his discovery. They decide to burn all the paintings in the secret room. But almost instinctively, the secret room defends itself by toppling furniture and fittings to block their entry.  Jebin's best friend advises him to consult a renowned [[parapsychologist]], Devanesan to find a solution. Devanesan conjectures that the villa may have the left-over [[Energy (esotericism)|negative energy]] of prior owners as symptoms manifest psychic phenomena. Jebin also finds the identities and whereabouts of prior owners. But all report similar grim events in their lives like [[infanticide]], [[Lunatic|lunacy]], [[fratricide]], disease, [[insolvency]], death, ''et al''. Devanesan also suggests that Jebin's father may have found an outlet, in his passion for paintings, to survive this negative energy which can neither be created nor destroyed but only transferred. He then begins to conduct more experiments using a [[tuning fork]] within the villa compound. But all hell break loose midway and [[Apparitional experience|apparitions]] begin to appear. In the chaos, Jebin's best friend loses his legs. Jebin even finds some paintings depicting a man and a woman getting married, and the man eventually killing the woman. Assuming that his father predicted that he would end up killing Aarthi, Jebin sets fire to himself and the villa to prevent him from harming the girl he loves.   When Aarthi sees that Jebin has taken his own life before legally marrying her, she realises she has no claim over his estate. It is then revealed that Aarthi's true intentions were indicated by the dual faced painting she liked when she visited the villa. She had hoped to secure the money Jebin would gain from his book sale and selling the villa. With Jebin dead, Aarthi quickly seduces and marries an up and coming movie director.   However, it is revealed that Aarthi's killer in the painting that Jebin assumed was him is actually Aarthi's new husband, the movie director. Thus, it can be understood that Jebin did not realise that he too inherited his father's gift, with his second novel depicting that a "director" character would soon appear in the prophecy.

Dusty and Chug train for qualifiers for the upcoming Wings Across the Globe race. On the night before the qualifiers, Dusty asks an elderly and reclusive [[United States Navy|navy]] war plane named Skipper Riley to teach him how to fly well, but Skipper refuses. Dusty enters the qualifiers, and although the audience mocks him for being a cropduster, he manages to wow them by his well-practiced flight maneuvers; but he barely makes it into the race.  Later in the morning, Skipper visits Dusty and tries to talk him out of racing, but when Dusty explains he wants to prove he's more than just a crop duster, Skipper decides to mentor Dusty on his speed and agility. While in the midst of his training, Dusty admits that he has a fear of heights. Despite this, their training continues, and when it is complete, Dusty heads off to the meeting of the race at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in [[New York City]]. There he befriends an eccentric but loyal Mexican race plane named El Chupacabra, who eventually falls in love with a beautiful French-Canadian racer named Rochelle, who shows no interest in him. Dusty then makes a rival of the arrogant and villainous 3-time-winner plane Ripslinger, who rudely dismisses him as being only a crop duster. He also falls in love with a racer plane named Ishani, who becomes supportive of him. During the first leg of the race from New York to [[Iceland]], Dusty's refusal to fly high causes him to finish in last place.  During the second leg of the race to Germany, Dusty shows good sportsmanship by saving another racer, Bulldog, from crashing when Bulldog's eyes get squirted with oil from one of his [[propellers]], winning Bulldog's respect but finishing last again.

In [[India]], Ishani invites Dusty to fly around the [[Taj Mahal]] and advises him to fly low through the [[Himalayas]] by following some railroad tracks. However, after encountering a tunnel and barely being able to fly through it, Dusty realizes Ishani deliberately gave him bad advice to get a new propeller from Ripslinger, and he shuns her. As the race continues, Dusty manages to get into first place. In Shanghai, Dusty manages to help El Chupacabra win over Rochelle with a romantic song.  In the sixth leg of the race across the Pacific Ocean, Ripslinger's henchmen, Ned and Zed, under orders from Ripslinger, sabotage Dusty's navigation [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]. Lost and low on fuel, Dusty miraculously comes across the USS ''Flysenhower'' (a reference to the [[USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69)|real-life carrier]]) which allows him to land and refuel. While on the carrier, Dusty sees a hall of fame set up for Skipper's squadron but discovers that Skipper only flew one mission, which contradicts his previous reputation as a veteran of many battles. He is then forced to take off to try and beat an oncoming storm.  Dusty gets distracted from flying by his thoughts about Skipper and ends up crashing into the ocean but is eventually rescued. He is flown to [[Mexico]] to his friends but he is severely damaged and may never fly again. Skipper confesses to Dusty that he did indeed fly only one mission in the [[Pacific Ocean theatre of World War II|Pacific theatre]], where his entire squad of trainees was killed in an attack on the [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Navy]]. Skipper was the only survivor, but torn by his guilt, he never trained another plane or flew again. Demoralized and heartbroken, Dusty begins to consider dropping out of the race but is encouraged by his friends, Bulldog, Ishani, and many of his newfound fans to continue, and they all donate parts to have Dusty repaired.  In the seventh leg, back to New York, with a change of heart and morale restored, Dusty becomes determined to continue in the race, but Ripslinger still won't give up and plots to put an end to Dusty's competing in the race "once and for all". He and his goons attack Dusty but are thwarted by Skipper, who has overcome his guilt and come to help Dusty. When trying to catch up with Ripslinger, Dusty conquers his fear of heights when his engine starts losing power, forcing him to ride the [[jetstream]]. Both he and Ripslinger make it to the finish line in New York; and when it looks like Ripslinger will win, his ego gets the best of him, and he slows down to have his picture taken. Dusty manages to fly above him and win the race while Ripslinger crashes into some [[portable toilet]]s. Dusty is congratulated by his friends and fans, and Skipper thanks him for giving him the confidence to fly again. Skipper rejoins the navy briefly in the company of Dusty and they take an honorary flight together, ending the story.

 Detective Zhong Wen heads to Wu Bar in search of his estranged daughter, Miao Miao, who is now the girlfriend of the nightclub's owner, Wu Jiang. However, Zhong disapproves of Miao's relationship, which leads to an argument between the father and daughter. Before Zhong can make amends with Miao, he is struck in the head by an unnamed assailant, in a plot orchestrated by Wu.  Regaining consciousness, Zhong finds himself strapped onto a chair, and his hands bound by metal wires. He deduces that Wu was after him all along, but cannot conclude why. Zhong also learns that the other bar patrons, including his daughter, are being held captive. Wu phones the local Lieutenant and demands a hefty ransom as well as an audience with prisoner Wei Xiaofu, before leaving the room Zhong is trapped in.  Zhong breaks free of the wires and escapes from the room. Scouring the bar undetected, he finds the secret chamber of Wu, which is predominantly filled with posters of a teenage girl and a younger Wu, who once went by the moniker "Spider" when he was a [[Kickboxing|kickboxer]]. He also spots blueprints of the bar and discerns that Wu intends to bomb the entire bar should his kidnapping ploy fail. Through Miao, Zhong obtains a handphone, which he uses to contact the lieutenant. Unfortunately, Wu soon discovers that Zhong has fled the hostage room. Wu grabs Miao and threaten to dip her hand in a fish tank full of piranhas, forcing Zhong to reveal his hiding place.  Re-captured, Zhong offers an impatient Wu his assistance in finding Wei, who has yet to arrive. Wu agrees and gives Zhong two options — defeat one of his henchmen in a battle and be allowed to free three hostages, or admit defeat and find Wei alone. Zhong relents, agreeing to fight. With perseverance, and somehow unbreaking his broken finger, Zhong emerges as victor.  Zhong then convinces a reluctant Wei Xiaofu to enter the bar with him. Back in Wu Bar, Wu Jiang reveals the reason behind the kidnapping: he intends to exact revenge on Zhong, Wei, and three other hostages, all of whom were coincidentally witnesses to Wu's younger sister's death. On that fateful day, Wei had wanted to steal medicine for his mother at a pharmacy. Wu's sister was also at the drug store. When Wei's theft is discovered, he panicks and holds Wu's sister at knifepoint. It transpires that she had been pregnant and, due to stress, had committed suicide by slashing her own neck with Wei's weapon. Zhong, who was driving back home, happened to pass by the crime scene, but could not save her. Then out of nowhere, a worker of Wu, reveal’s to be his sister’s boyfriend.  He reveals that he was trying to get through the crowd of police, but fails, and watches his girlfriend die. After that, he was suicidal, and tries to shoot himself, but Zhoung stops him and holds on to his arm.  As Wu digests the truth, police forces storm into the bar. The bombs set in place by Wu go off and very few criminals flee through an escape route. The rest are gunned down. In the ensuing confusion, Wu leaves with Miao. Zhong gives chase and the trio end up in a rail tunnel. Wu offers Zhong an ultimatum: Shoot himself and his daughter lives, or shoot Wu and his knife will slice his daughter’s neck and she will die. Zhong chooses the former but realises after pulling the trigger that the gun is unloaded. Wu informs Zhong that he has passed his test and in doing so, has earned his respect. Wu returns Miao to Zhong and prepares to let an oncoming train hit him. Zhong tries to stop him, but gets shot and is unable to stop his suicidal act in time but luckily, the train switches tracks just as it is about to collide with Wu. The bar owner is apprehended, while Zhong is sent to the hospital to heal his wounds.

Prisoners (2013 film)
 In suburban Pennsylvania, Keller Dover ([[Hugh Jackman]]), his wife Grace, their teenage son Ralph and young daughter Anna attend a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of their friends, Franklin Birch ([[Terrence Howard]]) and his wife Nancy ([[Viola Davis]]), their teenage daughter Eliza and young daughter Joy. The four children go for a walk in the neighborhood and approach an [[Recreational vehicle|RV]] that is parked outside a house nearby. There is music playing, which suggests there is somebody inside. After dinner, Anna and Joy go missing.  Detective Loki ([[Jake Gyllenhaal]]) is informed and starts a search. He locates the RV, which is found parked at a gas station. As police surround the vehicle, the driver, Alex Jones, starts the vehicle and crashes into a nearby tree. He is subsequently arrested and taken away. Alex has the [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of a 10-year-old, and appears confused when being questioned at the police station. His vehicle is searched by forensics but nothing is found relating to the girls. Pursuing other leads, Loki discovers a corpse in the basement of Patrick Dunn, a priest. Dunn admits that he killed the man because the man [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confessed]] he was "[[Misotheism|waging a war against God]]" and had killed 16 children and said that he would kill more.  As the search continues, Dover is informed that Alex has been released and attacks him outside the police station. Alex whispers to him, "They didn't cry until I left them." Since Loki won't re-arrest Alex, and Dover hears Alex singing the same ditty as Anna, Dover abducts him, locks him up in his late father's abandoned home and tortures him—with the help of a reluctant Franklin—to force him to talk. First he beats him, but Alex says nothing. Dover ties him up in the shower and uses plywood to enclose him in the dark. He adjusts the water so the shower is either scorching hot or freezing to further torture him.  At a [[candlelight vigil]] for the girls, Loki sees a suspicious hooded man, who flees when Loki approaches him. Later on, the man breaks into both families' houses but leaves without doing anything. Loki follows Dover to where Alex is being held prisoner but doesn't find him, as Dover fabricates a story about stopping over in the building so he's able to drink to ease his suffering without his wife knowing.  A store clerk recognizes the hooded man from a [[E-FIT|composite drawing]] and reports him to Loki after seeing him buying children's clothing. The suspect, Bob Taylor, is later arrested at his home, where the walls are covered in drawings of [[maze]]s. Loki then finds crates filled with maze books, live snakes, and bloodied children's clothing, including items belonging to the missing girls. They discover Taylor had himself been abducted as a child. At the police station, Taylor confesses to the abduction but during a physical altercation with Loki and two other officers, he snatches a gun and kills himself without revealing any more information. The police conclude that Taylor was a [[fantasist]] and had no involvement with the disappearances; he stole the clothes from the girls' homes and bloodied them with pig's blood to recreate abductions.  Dover continues to torture Alex, who incoherently talks about escaping from a maze. Dover visits Alex's aunt, Holly, who tells him that Alex is the way he is because he had an accident with snakes her husband kept as pets when he was younger. She also says that she and her husband were religious until their young son died of cancer. Back at the police station, Loki becomes frustrated with getting nowhere with the case until he matches a maze Taylor drew while in custody to the maze necklace worn by the man Patrick Dunn killed in his basement.  Suddenly, Joy Birch is found drugged but alive. Dover visits her in the hospital to ask for information. Her memories are confused but she mumbles, "You were there," to Dover. He then realizes that Joy may have heard his voice at the Joneses' house when he visited Holly, and runs from the police. Loki searches for Dover at the apartment building and discovers Alex. Dover then goes back to the Joneses' house to get information from Holly, but she pulls a gun on him. She explains that, before her husband left her, they abducted many children as part of their "war on God" to avenge their son's death. Alex was the first child they abducted, followed by Taylor. Alex just took the girls for a ride, and Holly decided to abduct them. Holly shoots Dover in the leg and imprisons him in a concealed pit in her yard, where he finds the police whistle belonging to his daughter.  Loki goes to the Joneses' house to tell her that her nephew has been found. He finds a photograph of Holly's husband wearing the same maze necklace found on the body in the priest's basement, making him her missing husband. Loki finds Holly drugging Anna, and they exchange gunfire. Loki is wounded, and Holly is killed. Loki then rushes Anna to the hospital where she reunites with her mother. Alex is reunited with his parents after surviving the torture. A day later, Loki returns to the Joneses' house where the authorities have begun excavating the property. As the forensic investigators depart for the night, Loki hears Dover's labored blowing on the whistle from the pit.

Proxy (film)
 While walking home from a doctor's appointment, heavily pregnant Esther Woodhouse (Alexia Rasmussen) is knocked unconscious by a person wearing a hoodie, who hits her stomach repeatedly with a brick. Despite the frantic efforts of [[emergency room]] doctors, her baby is delivered [[stillborn]] via [[caesarean section]]. Noticing that Esther doesn't seem to have any support from family or friends (the baby having been conceived with a sperm donor), a social worker at the hospital recommends that Esther attend a support group for grieving parents.  In the support group meetings, Esther meets and befriends Melanie Michaels ([[Alexa Havins]]), a woman who claims her husband and child were killed by a drunk driver. Later on, while visiting a department store, Esther sees Melanie walking in alone and suddenly start screaming that her son Peyton was kidnapped and begging a security guard for help. Esther follows Melanie to the parking lot and witnesses her taking Peyton out of the car and into the store. Oddly, Esther appears pleased by this.  While Esther is home, her attacker suddenly appears. Esther is dragged from the kitchen and is raped by Anika Barön ([[Kristina Klebe]]) who has performed the attack at Esther's request. Esther then proceeds to perform oral sex on Anika. A short while afterwards, Anika inquires about Melanie- clearly jealous- but Esther dismisses her. Esther is next seen in a bar. She is in a toilet stall, having sex while another man watches. The men swap places and the second man is more aggressive.  Esther later invites Melanie to her home. Esther asks about Melanie's family and she sticks to her drunk-driver story. Esther then tries to seduce Melanie, claiming that she's the only person who understands her. Melanie rejects Esther and when the latter says she knows what happened at the department store, Melanie slaps her and tells her never to contact her again.  Esther takes Anika's truck and tracks down Melanie's house. Sneaking in with a crowbar, Esther finds Peyton in the bathroom and drowns him in the bathtub. Melanie enters, visibly distraught, demanding to know why Esther has done this. Esther responds that she did "the things that [Melanie] couldn't do" and now they can be together. After she says this, Melanie's husband Patrick ([[Joe Swanberg]]) walks in with a shotgun and kills Esther.  Days pass and the Michaels are heavily grieving. Patrick is particularly unhinged and fantasizes about having left Esther alive so he could torture her. After noticing Anika's truck and the fact that it hasn't moved ever since the murder, he enters it and finds the registration. However, when he reports it to the police, he is told to stop since it would constitute theft (even though the door was unlocked). Patrick also starts attending a support group but then finds out from a regular that his wife had been secretly attending for a year and that she had claimed Peyton was kidnapped. Patrick confronts Melanie who denies everything and apparently leaves her.  Meanwhile, Anika, enraged by Esther's death, tries to track down the Michaels and finds out where they are from the police informing her about her truck. She goes to Melanie's house, ties her up and plans to wait for Patrick, so she can torture and kill them both. She then hears running water from the bathroom and investigates, believing it is Patrick taking a shower. Instead, she finds him dead. Melanie breaks free and holds Anika at gunpoint and thanks her, claiming she just made a "much better story". Melanie fantasizes about being interviewed on TV two years later, having written a book about her experiences on having both her son and husband murdered by a deranged woman and her revenge seeking lover, respectively, as well as advocating for child safety and self-defense and ending the interview by announcing that she has remarried and is now pregnant. Anika then manages to reach for a hammer while Melanie fires the shotgun, ending the movie with a black screen and the sound of the gunshot, the outcome unknown.

For 12 hours each year all crime is legal, except the murder of politicians, and all emergency services are unavailable. By 2022, the United States has become virtually crime-free and the unemployment rate has dropped to single-digit rates because of the Purge.  James Sandin returns to his home in an affluent [[Los Angeles]] gated community to wait out the night with his wife Mary and their two children, 17-year-old Zoey and 14-year-old Charlie. The family is assured that the security system manufactured by James' company will keep them safe. While the family awaits the start of the purge, Zoey meets her boyfriend Henry, an older boy whom James dislikes. James enables the security system, and as the purge begins, the family disperses in their home to go about their normal routines.  Zoey returns to her room to unexpectedly find Henry, who sneaked back in before the security system was engaged, and says that he plans to confront her dad about their relationship. Meanwhile, Charlie watches the security monitors, and sees a wounded man calling for help. He temporarily disables the system to allow the man into the house. James races to re-engage the system and holds the man at gunpoint as Henry comes downstairs and pulls a gun on James. Henry fires at James and misses, but James fires back, mortally wounding and eventually killing Henry. During the chaos, the wounded man disappears and hides.  Through the surveillance cameras, the family witness a gang of masked, heavily armed young adults arriving at the front lawn. The leader warns them that failure to surrender the wounded man will result in invasion. Mary asks James if the security system will protect them, but James admits the system will not actually resist a determined assault. They decide to find the man and give him to the purge gang outside, but after capturing him they realize they are no better than the gang. They decide to spare the man, and defend themselves against the gang.  With their deadline having passed, the gang uses a truck to rip the metal plating off the front door and enter the house. James fights back with a shotgun and kills several gang members before being mortally wounded by the leader. Charlie views the surveillance cameras, and notices their neighbors leaving their homes. The neighbors overpower and murder the gang. Elsewhere, Mary is subdued by two purgers, one of whom [[tickle torture|tickle tortures]] her before almost killing her, but are both killed by the neighbors. As the gang leader prepares to kill the remaining Sandins, Zoey appears and kills him.  Mary thanks their neighbors for their support, but one of them, Grace Ferrin, reveals their hatred for the Sandins due to the wealth acquired at their expense. They tie Mary, Charlie, and Zoey up with duct tape, pulling them out into the hallway to kill them, but as the neighbors make final preparations for the murder, the man whom Charlie let in earlier reappears. He shoots a neighbor dead and holds Grace hostage, forcing the neighbors to free the Sandins. He asks if Mary wishes to kill the neighbors, but Mary spares them. Eventually, the sirens go off, announcing the end of the annual purge. The neighbors leave, Mary thanks the man for his help, and he bids the Sandins good luck.  During the credits, news reports are heard, which state that this year’s purge was the most successful to date. Other stations broadcast that the [[stock market]] is booming due to the massive sales of weapons and security systems.

 During the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, a [[Sikh]] [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] named Umber Singh ([[Irrfan Khan]]) evacuates his house with his wife Mehar ([[Tisca Chopra]]) and three daughters. He is disgruntled at the fact that he does not have a son to carry on his family lineage which is assumed to be carried forward by the males of the next generation. He tells his wife that he is confident the next child will be a boy, but Mehar is unsure and fearful that if she has another girl, Umber will leave her. During the birth of their fourth child, Umber takes the child from the womb and declares with happiness that it is a boy. Mehar checks the gender of the child and realizes the child is in fact a girl. Umber is declaring child to be a male because of his strong desire to have a son. She tells Umber that it is better to kill the girl child than enforcing his desire for a son on the child. Umber ignores her and happily, in his own denial, declares the new child a boy named Kanwar Singh.  Umber fosters Kanwar as a son and wants her to gain strength, endurance and the ability to shoot a gun like a son. Kanwar has lapses of normal behavior for a young girl, including crying, giggling and having her first period, which her father tries hard to repress and ignore. One time, when Kanwar goes out to play with her sisters, they end up fighting and Kanwar falls to the ground and breaks her leg. Once home and given proper medical treatment, Umber is blindingly furious at his three daughters for hurting his only "son". He drags his daughters off the bed and starts beating them mercilessly, but his wife Mehar comes in to stop him and tells him to get out. Umber declares if anything happens to his "son", he will cut his daughters to pieces.  Once Kanwar becomes a fully functioning "man" ([[Tillotama Shome]]), after having her turban ceremony, she starts to converse with a girl named Neeli ([[Rasika Dugal]]), who is the daughter of one of Umber's close friends. Kanwar and Neeli tease each other and kid around over the course of several weeks. In one instance, they fool around near the woods, where Kanwar tries to lock Neeli in a shed. She escapes and they both wrestle each other. Umber oversees this and sees his "son"'s happiness and asks Neeli's father for Neeli's hand in marriage to marry Kanwar. Soon, after the wedding ceremony, Neeli comes to know that Kanwar does not have a penis, though she doesn't know that he is actually a girl. Umber tells her that Kanwar had an 'accident' when he was younger. Neeli is disheartened knowing that she will never be able to have children with Kanwar. During one night, Neeli packs her bags and tries to escape her marriage. Umber spots her and pleads for her to come back. When she refuses, Umber wrestles her to the ground and attempts to rape her. Kanwar hears the commotion and comes outside to see her father trying to rape Neeli. Kanwar cries, trying to stop her father, but Umber tells her "it is the only way to have a son in the family". Umber promises Kanwar that if he leaves and lets Umber rape Neeli, they will have a son. Kanwar leaves in a fit of rage, but comes back carrying a shotgun, which he uses to shoot Umber in the back, killing him.  After the funeral of Umber,  Mehar forces Kanwar and Neeli to run away and start a new life together in her father's abandoned house and never to come back. Neeli and Kanwar profess their affection to each other, accepting a sisterly love towards each other, but hiding Kanwar's gender from all others. As they continue to live together as women, Neeli helps Kanwar shed the manhood her father forced on her and embrace the fact that she is biologically a woman.  After some time, Kanwar decides to go and bring her mother to their new home. When she arrives, she sees that their house has been burned down and her mother and two sisters have died in the fire. The only person left is her eldest sister, Baali, who has gone mentally insane and talks about "making Umber's dinner and cleaning Umber's room". As Kanwar explores the house, she sees her father's spirit in the mirror. The unsatisfied spirit of Umber continues to haunt Kanwar all the way back home. Umber tells Kanwar that they must make things right. Kanwar is haunted in her dreams by Umber and on [[Lohri]] night, Kanwar yells out the window to her father that she wants to pretend to be a man as per his desire but her womanhood is beyond her control now and she is failing to control that. Kanwar strips naked and professes her womanhood. The town's people hear this and are extremely disproving. They attempt to break into the house. Neeli tells Kanwar to go and not to come back otherwise they will both get killed. Kanwar leaves again and as she wanders through the desert she sees her father. Broken and at her wits end, Kanwar submits to her father's spirit who drowns her in an oasis. Umber goes to the village to call Neeli, where he masquerades as being Kanwar and removes his shirt off in front of the disputing villagers (to evince his masculinity); and later brings Neeli to the burned down house in which Kanwar's family used to live. He tells her that he will start the life once again and build everything afresh just like he did when he migrated from [[Pakistan]].

Nick buries his share under an orange tree sapling in his garden; his wife, Julia, thinks that the tree is a surprise gift and mentions how content she is with their life together. Nick realizes that they do not need the gold, and decides to submit it as evidence. During a raid later on Hayes tells Nick that he can't let him turn in the gold, Hayes then shoots and kills Nick.  Time stops around Nick and he is drawn into a vortex in the sky.  In the afterlife, as [[penance]] for his thievery, Nick is recruited for the R.I.P.D. (The Rest In Peace Department). The R.I.P.D. is responsible for finding and returning souls who refuse to move on to the afterlife.  Left unchecked, these souls become "deados", monsters disguised as humans. He is partnered with Roycephus "Roy" Pulsipher, a former [[U.S. Marshal]] and participant in the [[American Civil War]].  Their first stop is at a cemetery to watch Nick's funeral, and Nick attempts to make his presence known to Julia but is not recognized.  Roy explains that R.I.P.D. officers are given new identities and appearances to prevent them from revealing that the afterlife exists.  Nick appears as an old Chinese man while Roy appears as a beautiful blonde woman.    On his first field mission, Nick aids Roy in interrogating a suspected deado and discovers the perpetrator is in possession of gold like he and Hayes had stolen.  Nick and Roy submit the gold as evidence before visiting one of Roy's informants.  Nick tricks the informant into revealing Hayes as his contact. They follow Hayes to Nick's old house, where he "discovers" Nick's stolen gold. Roy and Nick track Hayes and observe him handing the gold off to a deado whom they stop and interrogate.  The deado overpowers them, taking the gold and transforming into a hulking monster that leads them on a chase through the city that attracts the attention of normal humans and causes a panic.  R.I.P.D. Chief Mildred Proctor receives orders to remove Roy and Nick from the case and from active duty due to this exposure. Proctor learns from [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Eternal Affairs]] that the gold could be used to construct the Staff of [[Jericho]], which will reverse the flow of souls from earth to the afterlife.  Roy and Nick argue, and Nick leaves by himself to try again to reveal himself to Julia.  Roy tails him and they argue but finally make amends and decide to work together to stop whatever Hayes is planning. They discover that Hayes is a deado and arrest him, but a confiscated item of his freezes the whole department.  Hayes and a group of deados escape with the remainder of the gold and assemble the Staff of Jericho (an [[Obelisk]] of gold).  Hayes takes Julia hostage and stabs her as a necessary [[Sacrifice#Human sacrifice|human sacrifice]] to activate the staff. A battle ensues; Pulsipher destroys the Staff of Jericho, and Nick exacts his revenge on Hayes. Close to death, Julia sees Nick for who he is; and they share a tearful farewell.  Later, Proctor informs Nick that Julia will live. She reinstates them both fully, though she adds 53 years to Roy's term in the R.I.P.D. due to her revealed affections for him. As a reward, Roy gives Nick a new appearance, but he is dismayed to find it is that of a [[Girl Scout]].  
Raanjhanaa
 Kundan Shankar ([[Dhanush]]) is the only son of Tamil Hindu Brahmin parents settled in [[Varanasi]]. Since his childhood, Kundan has had a strong and obsessive one-sided love for Zoya ([[Sonam Kapoor]]), a Muslim girl residing in the other neighborhood, whom he had seen doing namaaz in his teacher's house while he went to collect chandha or donation for Hindu festival, Dussehra. He always attempts to flirt or be around Zoya but gets slapped several times in the process. These acts of courtship from him were being done even without knowing Zoya's name. Zoya finally reveals her name after repeated asking and starts to like him a bit because of Kundan's consistency of affection and tells him to meet at a place. When they meet, she comes to know that Kundan is a Hindu brahmin and starts to avoid again because her family is orthodox, and she is sure that they won't agree for any intimate relationship like marriage. Her family comes to know that Zoya is liking some Hindu guy, and they decide to send Zoya to Aligarh for further studies. After Zoya moves to College for further studies forcefully, Kundan tries to impress Zoya's family members by assisting them with small-small home chores. Zoya gets into [[Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi]] and discovers a long-lost strength as she confronts and then falls for student leader, Akram Zaidi ([[Abhay Deol]]).  After eight years, Zoya returns to Varanasi, barely recognizing Kundan when she meets him again. Kundan again attempts to ask Zoya for her love but she is reluctant, revealing that she is in love with Akram. She urges Kundan to convince her family about her marriage with Akram. Kundan eventually agrees and gets their wedding arranged, promising Zoya that he will also marry someone else and forget her. He proposes to his childhood friend Bindiya ([[Swara Bhaskar]]), who has had a crush on him since childhood.  On the day of Zoya's marriage, Kundan finds out that Akram is a [[Sikh]], whose actual name is Jasjeet Singh Shergill. This enrages him, as Zoya had used their religious differences to convince him that their match was not possible. He crashes the wedding ceremony and reveals the truth to Zoya's parents. Kundan is later informed that Zoya tried to commit suicide, and Jasjeet was mercilessly beaten by Zoya's relatives. At the hospital, Jasjeet tells Kundan that Zoya convinced him to portray himself as Muslim to marry her, a plan he should not have agreed to. While with Jasjeet, Kundan forgets about his own marriage ceremony with Bindiya, taking place that day, and is too late when he returns. Hurt and angry, Kundan's family disowns him. Jasjeet's parents take him back to his village. Kundan tries to redeem himself by taking Zoya to Jasjeet's village. There, he is devastated to find that Jasjeet has succumbed to his injuries, finally understanding that his one-sided love has resulted in an innocent man's death.  Kundan becomes a homeless vagrant and begins visiting various religious places and volunteering in their activities so that he can atone for his sins. During one such visit, a man advises him to do the right thing rather than run away from his sins. Motivated, Kundan locates Zoya to her university, where she is spearheading the political party "All India Citizen Party" (AICP), that had been created by Jasjeet. Kundan joins the nearby canteen and serves the party, while trying to get Zoya's attention. Over time, he becomes popular with the party due to his simple nature. They're also impressed when Kundan helps them in negotiating some tough situations by using his simplistic witty tricks. However, Zoya holds a grudge that the person who is responsible for Jasjeet's death is now taking his place. She tries to instigate party members against Kundan but Jasjeet's sister Rashmi ([[Shilpi Marwaha]]) tells Kundan to continue, as he is the best choice for fulfilling Jasjeet's vision.  Kundan, however, only wants Zoya to forgive him. The Chief Minister tells Zoya that she must get revenge on Kundan. To get back Jasjeet's position, she tells Zoya to let Kundan get injured as he delivers his campaign speech. Zoya apparently seems to get brainwashed by this plan and as the Chief Minister desired, Kundan is hurt badly and sent to ICU, thus fulfilling Zoya's revenge.  At a press meet, the Chief Minister denies having any hand in the blast that hurt Kundan. However, Zoya steps forward and reveals that the plan was plotted by her and the Chief Minister and that she is prepared to go to prison for this. Zoya then finds out that Kundan was aware of the plot and still let himself be injured. Shocked, she rushes to the hospital to be with him.  In a final voiceover, a dying Kundan wonders about letting go. He says he might have the desire to live again if Zoya called out to him, but then again, everything has become so tiring, he would rather let go and rest ([[euphemism]] for dying). He says that he can be born again and again in the same [[Varanasi]], fall in love with a girl like Zoya again, and become a Raanjhanaa (Beloved one) in her love. Then he slowly dies.

Race 2
 The film begins with a sniper shooting out the fuel tank of a Lamborghini, causing it to burst into flames. Some time afterwards, a robbery takes place and European printing plates are stolen. Ranvir Singh  ([[Saif Ali Khan]]) watches this news on TV and smiles. Ranvir goes to a casino owner, Vikram Thapar ([[Rajesh Khattar]]), claiming to have been behind the Euro printing plates robbery.  Ranvir offers Thapar €1.5 billion of counterfeit currency in exchange for €500 million real banknotes. Thapar agrees, and borrows the €500 million from ex-street fighter and billionaire gangster Armaan Malik ([[John Abraham (actor)|John Abraham]]), and makes the trade with Ranvir. It is then revealed that Ranvir never stole the printing plates, and was conning Thapar to get revenge for a previous matter. Now, unable to return Armaan's money, Thapar is forced to give Armaan control of five casinos that he owns in [[Istanbul, Turkey]].  The con is revealed to be a plan that Ranvir made a week earlier with Armaan, who he was introduced to by his friend Robert "RD" D'Costa ([[Anil Kapoor]]) and his dim witted assistant Cherry ([[Ameesha Patel]]). Ranvir essentially gives Armaan ownership of Thapar's five casinos in exchange for a 10% commission, a fraction of the true value of the casinos. Ranvir and Armaan become friends and business partners, while Ranvir begins a romance with Armaan's half-sister and 50% shareholder Alina ([[Deepika Padukone]]).  At a party hosted by Armaan and Alina, Ranvir meets Armaan's girlfriend Omisha ([[Jacqueline Fernandez]]) and sees a picture of his deceased wife Sonia ([[Bipasha Basu]]) in her wallet. He begins to woe her in order to gain her confidence. Meanwhile, he brings a lucrative deal to Armaan that will make them both billions. However, Ranvir later reveals to RD that Armaan and Thapar were responsible for the death of Sonia, and his real plan is to bankrupt Armaan. Ranvir then establishes contact with Omisha, who tells him that she is Sonia's sister Tanya, and has been dating Armaan to get close enough to kill him. However, Omisha is revealed to not be Tanya after all, and actually be working with Armaan, who already knew that Ranvir was Sonia's husband.  Ranvir tells RD and Cherry that his plan is to steal the [[Shroud of Turin]]. He will steal the Shroud himself, but will tell Armaan that someone else will do it, and sell it to him for €15 billion, which is a fraction of the Shroud's true value. Ranvir then plans to steal both the Shroud of Turin and Armaan's €15 billion. However, RD, who is deathly afraid of Armaan, betrays Ranvir and tells Armaan the whole plan. Armaan introduces Ranvir to Godfather Anza ([[Aditya Pancholi]]) and asks him to give 15 billion euros to invest in the deal but only if he wins his fight with Typhoon. Ranvir was listening to their conversation and Alina reveals Armaan was the one who planted the bomb in her car and decides to be on Ranvir's side. Ranvir successfully steals the shroud with the help of Cherry and RD while after unsuccessful attempts Armaan wins his fight with Typhoon.  After Ranvir drinks his glass clean during the celebration Armaan reveals that Alina mixed poison in Ranvir's glass. As Ranvir slowly dies, Armaan reveals that thanks to RD he knew Ranvir's plan the whole time and he was controlling the race the entire time. Alina reveals that she was never on his side because of her blood relationship with Armaan. Omisha drives back with the money and reveals to Ranvir that she was also on Armaan's side and she is not Sonia's sister. After Ranvir dies, RD and Cherry leave after getting 10% of the money from Armaan. Alina leaves to get the private jet ready, while Armaan and Omisha retrieve what they believe to be the real shroud Shroud from Ranvir's luggage locker.  Armaan, Omisha and Alina leave in their private jet. While in the jet, Armaan points his gun at Alina, revealing that all along he was planning to kill her and take her money. Suddenly, Ranvir crashes through the wall and reveals that Alina never poisoned his drink. Alina tells Armaan that she was on Ranvir's side ever since Armaan planted the bomb in her car. Ranvir reveals that RD never betrayed him, and that he himself told RD to inform Armaan of the real plan. This was to make Armaan think he was ahead of Ranvir. Ranvir then reveals that he had seen a picture of Sonia's sister before he even met Omisha.  Afterwards, Ranvir and Armaan have a fight in the plane being in midair. During the fight, Armaan tells Ranvir that he killed Sonia because she had betrayed him and fled with his money. As a result of the fight, a window of the plane was broken and subsequently an object damages the aircraft's propellor. Armaan gets hold of a gun and shoots the pilot and all the parachutes except one and he along with Omisha escape with it. Ranvir and Alina were left out so that they would die as a result of plane-crash but they escape using Armaan's car which opens chutes while in the air. The plane crashes on a mountain.  Sometime later, Armaan and Omisha meet Godfather Anza to hand over the Shroud. But, on inspection, it is revealed to be a fake one. When Anza asks for his [[Bearer bond|Bearer Bonds]], which he had given to Armaan earlier, they are also revealed to be fake. Armaan is forced to hand over his properties, including cars, casinos and yachts to Anza and subsequently Omisha dumps Armaan for Anza. Bankrupt, Armaan vows vengeance on Ranvir, who reveals everything to be his plan.   In the end, Ranvir and RD meet and Ranvir gives him his share. When RD asks about the real Shroud, Ranvir reveals that he never stole it and it is still in the Chruch. Ranvir also reveals that Alina switched the real Bearer Bonds for fake ones when he and Armaan were fighting on the plane. RD appreciates Ranvir for his smartness as he accepts his 10% commission. RD then says that he does not want to risk his life again and makes Ranvir promise to never meet him again. Ranvir shakes on the promise but then warns RD that promises are made to be broken. RD and Cherry then leave in one small aircraft, while Ranvir and Alina leave in another.  
The Railway Man (film)
 During the Second World War, [[Eric Lomax]] is a British officer who is captured by the Japanese [[Battle of Singapore|in Singapore]] and sent to a Japanese [[Prisoner of war|POW]] camp, where he is [[forced labour|forced to work]] on the Thai-[[Burma Railway]] north of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. During his time in the camp as one of the [[Far East prisoners of war]], Lomax is tortured by the [[Kempeitai]] (military secret police) for building a radio receiver from spare parts. The torture depicted includes beatings, rape, and [[waterboarding]]. Apparently, he had fallen under suspicion of being a spy, for supposedly using the British news broadcast receiver as a transmitter of military intelligence. In fact, however, his only intention had been to use the device as a morale booster for himself and his fellow prisoner-slaves. Lomax and his surviving comrades are finally rescued by the British Army.  Some 30 years later, Lomax is still suffering the psychological trauma of his wartime experiences, though strongly supported by his wife Patricia. His best friend and fellow ex-POW Finlay brings him evidence that one of their captors, Japanese [[secret police]] officer [[Takashi Nagase]], is now working as a tourist guide in the very camp where he and his men once tortured British POWs, having escaped prosecution for his war crimes. Before Lomax can act on this information, Finlay, unable to handle his memories of his experiences, commits suicide by hanging himself from a bridge. Lomax travels alone to Thailand and returns to the scene of his torture to confront Nagase 'in an attempt to let go of a lifetime of bitterness and hate'. When he finally confronts his former captor, Lomax first questions him in the same way Nagase and his men had interrogated him years before. The situation builds up to the point where Lomax prepares to smash Nagase's arm, using a club and a clamp designed by the Japanese for that purpose and now used as war exhibits. Out of guilt, Nagase does not resist, but Lomax redirects the blow at the last moment. Lomax threatens to cut Nagase's throat and finally pushes him into a bamboo cage, of the kind in which Lomax and many other POWs had been placed as punishment. Nagase soon reveals that the Japanese (including himself) were brainwashed into thinking the war would be a victorious one for them, and that he never knew the high casualties caused by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Lomax finally frees Nagase, throws his knife into the nearby river, and finally at peace with himself, returns to Britain.  After an indefinite period of time, Lomax returns, with Patricia, to Thailand. He meets up with Nagase once again, and in an emotional scene, after exchanging and accepting each other's apologies, the two make peace. The epilogue relates that Nagase and Eric remained friends until their deaths in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Shweta goes out every night, where Nishan (character name Manu), comes to pick her up. The entire storyline is clear, Shweta, a five star prostitute and associate Manu as pimp, for securing her business. It is a shock to Priya when she realizes the truth about Shweta and decides to leave her friendship and apartment.  A set back comes to Priya because of her need of cash, for her mother’s operation, which Shweta supports by her extra -profession. Since Priya’s requirement is cash, she too falls for the lucrative offers, to trade her body, if she wants to, for a psychiatrist doctor to provide him company for 1 or 2 years.  Meanwhile, Shweta's family decides to go ahead with a marriage proposal for her. She tries to avoid engagement. But the bridegroom is determined to take her in, and forget her past. She agrees for marriage, and they marries. One of her clients happens to be her husband’s friend, and his visits their house, adding up slight sparks of fire.  Priya follows her pro-life with the doctor and finally ends up cheated by her family and the doctor when his wife and daughter who abandoned him, returns from States. At last Priya becomes mad.  Maniyan Pilla Raju’s character as Priya’s father and Harisree Ashokan as a broker agent are similar set of masks which they have worn before.  The film belongs mostly to Iniya, on the performance side. She plays her part with conviction. Sarayu is good, but there are moments where we see her doing it as if she is doing some boring television serial. Yet, she is OK. Nishan is good and so is Jayakrishnan. Thalaivasal Vijay appeals to us as he gets to do something different, but you feel his portion could have been handled a bit more effectively and could have been a bit trimmed and toned down. The rest of them don’t have much to do. Irshad, in his brief role, is good.

A politician named Earl Gundy takes control of the government and begins calling himself [[The beast (Revelation)|The Beast]].

On his day off, Ben's father begins to give them a "tour" around the Beast's mansion outside their hometown of [[Seattle]]. The mansion is heavily guarded by the Beastly Guards, the Beast's own private army of humans who made the deal with the Antichrist and the wraiths that serve his command. As warned by Ben's father, it is secretly loaded with land mines. The Beast, his guards, and his son Little Beast unexpectedly arrive, interrupting the tour. The Beast becomes smitten with Lindsey and pressures her to marry him and bear his evil children, giving her eight hours to decide before he will kill everyone she knows and loves.  Lindsey consults a Bible and together with Ben hatches a plan to imprison The Beast. They are warned not to kill The Beast as he will just return as [[Satan]].

Red 2 (film)
    Three years after the previous film, while trying to lead a normal life with girlfriend Sarah Ross, Frank Moses is approached by Marvin Boggs, who claims people are still after them, but Frank dismisses him. After appealing a second time, Marvin drives off, and his car explodes. Although Frank does not believe Marvin is dead, Sarah convinces him to go to Marvin's funeral where he delivers a teary-eyed eulogy.  After the funeral, a group of government agents approach Frank and take him to be interrogated at an [[FBI]] run [[Yankee White]] Facility. During the interrogation, Jack Horton appears with team of [[private military contractors]], kills most of the facility's personnel, and tells Frank that he will torture Sarah until he gets information out of Frank. Frank escapes from the room, evades Horton's assassins, and with the sudden timely help of Marvin, who turns out to be alive, goes on the run with Sarah.  In a diner, Marvin explains that he and Frank are being hunted because they were listed as participants in a clandestine operation codenamed Nightshade, conducted during the Cold War to smuggle a nuclear weapon into Russia piece by piece. Horton has convinced world agencies that Frank and his crew are terrorists and must be stopped. Victoria calls, telling Frank she has been contracted by [[MI6]] to kill the three of them. Meanwhile, top contract killer Han Cho-Bai, whom Horton knows is seeking revenge on Frank, is also hired.  Frank, Marvin, and Sarah steal Han's plane and fly to Paris to find a man nicknamed "The Frog", with the Americans and Han in pursuit. As they arrive in Paris, they are stopped by Katja, a Russian secret agent with whom Frank had a relationship earlier in his career. Katja is also in search of Nightshade, and joins them to find The Frog. When he sees them, The Frog flees. Frank and Katja catch him and bring him back to his house, where Sarah seduces him, both to help them and to prove she is a better girlfriend than Katja.  The Frog gives them the key to his security box, which Katja apparently takes from Frank after drugging him; but Marvin, anticipating this, had handed a similar-looking key to Frank before his meeting with her. Marvin, Frank, and Sarah later find documents in The Frog's security box which point to Dr. Edward Bailey, a brilliant physicist, as the creator of the Operation Nightshade bomb.  They find that Bailey is alive, held thirty-two years in a [[Supermax prison|maximum security]] asylum for the criminally insane in London. Victoria (alerted by Marvin) unexpectedly confronts the trio, but helps to fake their deaths and then gain access to the asylum, in which Victoria feigns insanity, while Frank and Sarah pose as the facility staff, having tied up and gagged the real staff with duct tape. Frank and Victoria meet Bailey, who is hyperactive and cannot rationally respond to their questions thanks to mind-fogging drugs the asylum had been giving him, so they take him to one of Marvin's safehouses. After the drugs begin to wear off, Bailey remembers the bomb is still in Moscow.  They travel to Moscow, and Bailey concludes he hid the bomb in the Kremlin. They break into the Kremlin, and Bailey locates the suitcase-sized bomb, which is powered by [[red mercury]], which has no radioactive signature and causes no fallout. As they are about to leave, Katja stops them. Frank persuades her to switch to their side. After they escape and are celebrating, Victoria, who has escaped MI6 imprisonment for failing to kill him, calls Frank from London and tells him that Bailey was locked up because he had wanted to ''detonate'' the bomb, not sell it.  Bailey quickly holds Frank at gunpoint and confirms Victoria's message, revealing that he made a deal with Horton and the Americans to give them the red mercury. He shoots Katja, making it look as if Frank killed her, and leaves with the bomb case. Horton reneges on his deal with Bailey, intending to interrogate him until all his secrets have been tortured out of him, but Bailey escapes during air transit using a nerve gas he created, administering the antidote to both himself and Horton. Bailey then moves to the Iranian embassy in London. Before Frank can follow him, Han attacks. Reaching a standoff, Frank urges Han to join sides with him and stop the bomb. Han finally relents, and the five enact a plan to recapture Bailey and the bomb.  Sarah first seduces the Iranian ambassador, then takes him hostage. Marvin poses as a person seeking to defect to Iran, causes a diversion with the embassy plumbing, and the disguised team comes to "fix" it. They discover in the ambassador's safe plans disclosing the location of the bomb, but find that Bailey has already triggered the bomb's countdown timer and killed Horton (after disclosing he also remembered how his family had been killed by people like Horton). When they are discovered by embassy guards, Bailey seizes Sarah and flees to the airport to escape the imminent explosion.  Frank, Marvin, Victoria, and Han, taking the active bomb case with them, give chase, but Marvin, in his attempts to disarm the bomb by cutting wires, causes the timer to speed up and count down even faster. Frank, holding the bomb case, boards the plane and confronts Bailey who releases Sarah and forcefully insists he take the bomb off the plane with her. They rejoin Marvin, Victoria, and Han and wait for death as Han's plane takes off. As it disappears high in the sky it explodes in an immense fireball. Frank reveals that he had covertly placed the bomb from the case into a compartment near the plane's exit and confronted Bailey with only a closed empty case. Han angrily tells Frank that Frank owes him "$30 million for the plane and $20 million for not killing you (Frank)".  The closing scene shows Sarah enjoying herself on a mission in Caracas with Frank and Marvin.

Red River Ode
 In 1918 a black chain gang prisoner is running through an open field, presumably after escaping his confinement. When nightfall arrives he builds a fire and, using his sickle, he burns off his tattooed prison number, 48073. After taking refuge in a forest, he builds himself a small hut out of brush and branches to wait until he feels it's safe to leave. Soon thereafter he begins to hear noises that are uncommon with his natural surroundings, but ignores it.  After some time of waiting in the woods he sings to himself an old chain gang song:  ''Oh lord, I wonder if I'm ever gon' make it back home.'' ''Oh lord, it must have been the Devil that pulled me here.'' ''More down than out.''  ''Oh lord, I'm gon' be back home.'' ''Comin' back home one day 'for long.'' ''Away from here.''  ''If I woulda listened to my dear old mother,'' ''but she's dead and gon'.'' ''Oh lord, if I ever make it back home'' ''I'll never do wrong no more.''  Later, after failing at hunting wild animals, the prisoner is drinking nearby spring water out of a can he had kept with him from prison. He looks into the can to see it covered in blood, causing him to vomit and throw the can to the ground. After he coughs and vomits, he notices the can is no longer covered in blood and cannot find traces of any in the area. He immediately returns to his hut to find that it has been destroyed by a tree which had fallen over it. He then starts work on repairing it, only to faintly hear the words "Oh lord" in his voice sing back to him through the wind.  The following night he is awoken by strange and loud noises as well as the barking of [[beagles]]. He hears [[I'm Always Chasing Rainbows]] by [[Charles W. Harrison]] in the distance that increases in volume as time passes. He runs away, but can't see where he is due to the darkness and eventually hides behind a tree and falls asleep after the noise settles.  Waking up the next day, the prisoner searches the woods for evidence of dogs or whatever he can find to settle his confusion about the preceding night. After searching for a while, he hears clicks and breaking twigs in multiple directions accompanied by faint mocking voices and whispers. In his frustration, he punches a nearby tree and cries out in pain. The barking of beagles slowly rises and rises, only to fall silent immediately when the prisoner looks up to see what he heard.  That night he stays awake by his fire, sickle in hand. After hours of silence he finally hears the song that played the night before. He decides to run out of the woods and escape the forest. He runs for hours until the sun comes up, never once finding a way out of the forest. As he grows tired and weary and subsequently more lost and confused, he comes upon a figure, a [[vagrancy (people)|vagabond]], in the woods hanging dead from a tree. The words ''You can't have me'' are written in blood across the vagabonds shirt. The prisoner is in shock as his surroundings shift and he is now in a different part of the woods and the hanging body is gone. The wind blows and he hears his voice singing through the trees:  ''Oh lord, I ain't ever gon' make it back home.''  He looks off into the distance in shock.

The Returned (2013 film)
 In the 1980s, a zombie plague spreads worldwide and causes the deaths of an estimated 100 million people.  An unprecedented amount of research goes into finding a cure, but the resulting medicine requires daily doses to be effective.  If the infected miss even a single dose, they quickly and irrevocably degenerate to a feral zombie state.  As the formula can only be extracted from dead feral zombies, there are constant rumors that the supplies will run out.  Infected humans, called "the returned", are subject to discrimination and violence from bigoted and fearful uninfected humans.  Kate, a physician who cares for the returned and fundraises to support research to develop a synthetic medicine, has been stocking up on [[black market]] doses of the treatment, fearful that it will run out soon.  Her husband Alex, a music teacher, became infected when he attempted to assist a man who he thought was having a seizure.  Alex comes out as returned to his best friend Jacob, who readily accepts him.  When protestors become violent, and the government begins to set up quarantine camps, Jacob and his wife Amber invite Alex and Kate to stay with them outside the city.  Alex narrowly avoids both an attempted murder and police searches.  When Kate's source turns up dead, and evidence points toward Amber, Kate instructs Alex to check on their supply of the treatment.  Alex finds a single dose and a note from Jacob that apologizes for taking the rest, as Amber has become infected.  With only one day left to live as a human, Alex becomes desperate to find a new source.  Kate returns to the city and reveals her dilemma to the hospital chief, who gives her the hospital's entire stash.  However, the parent of an infected child attempts to steal the container, and in the ensuing fight over it, all the contents are destroyed.  Distraught, Kate returns empty-handed and comforts Alex, who has chained himself to the wall. Alex slowly experiences the symptoms of the change and demands that Kate shoot him in the head. Kate, who had a traumatic experience in her past, when her mother became infected, is reluctant to oblige him, but she kills him off-screen once he turns. As Kate returns to the city to settle her affairs, the hospital chief excitedly tells her that researchers have created a synthesized treatment. Kate falls to her knees in grief.  In the final scene, some months later, a pregnant Kate prepares to assassinate Jacob and Amber at a book tour. The sequel to this film is set to debut September 3 2018

Riddick (film)
 [[The Chronicles of Riddick#Plot|Five years after Kyra's death]], Riddick has become increasingly uneasy in his role as Lord Marshal of the Necromonger fleet. His refusal to swear into the Necromonger faith has caused dissent among his subjects and [[assassination]] attempts by his subordinates. After the latest attempt on his life, Riddick strikes a deal with Commander Vaako: the location of Furya and a ship to take him there, in exchange for Vaako succeeding him as the next Lord Marshal, so that he can achieve what he calls [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]]. Led by Vaako's aide, Krone, Riddick and a group of Necromongers arrive on a desolate planet. Realizing that it is not Furya, Riddick kills most of his escort when they attempt to assassinate him. In the chaos, Krone causes a [[landslide]] and buries Riddick alive.  Riddick emerges from the rubble with a broken leg, which he sets and splints while fending off native predators: [[vulture]]-like flying animals, packs of [[jackal]]-like beasts and swarms of venomous, [[scorpion]]-like water-dwelling creatures called Mud Demons. Needing time to heal, Riddick hides himself within some abandoned ruins. After he's fully healed, Riddick notices a vast [[savanna]] beyond some rocky cliffs, but the only passage through is impeded by several muddy pools infested with Mud Demons. He begins injecting himself with Mud Demon [[venom]] in order to build an [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] and constructs improvised [[melee weapon]]s, as well as raising and training an orphaned jackal-beast pup. He kills the Mud Demons and reaches the savannah. After finding a dormant mercenary station, Riddick notices a series of approaching storms, and concludes they will unleash an unidentified threat. Riddick activates an emergency beacon at the station, which broadcasts his identity to mercenary groups within the area.  Two ships promptly arrive in answer to the beacon, the first a group led by a violent and unstable man named Santana, and the second a better-equipped team of professional [[mercenaries]] led by a man named Colonel R. "Boss" Johns. Riddick leaves them a message promising they will all die unless they leave one of their ships and depart the planet on the other. Rubio, Nunez and Falco are killed by Riddick during the first night, forcing a reluctant Santana to cooperate with Johns. Riddick later steals [[Node (networking)|power node]]s from each of the teams' ships and approaches Johns and Santana to strike a deal for their return. However, the conversation turns into an ambush: Johns' second-in-command, Dahl, shoots Riddick with several rounds of horse tranquilizer, and Riddick's jackal-beast is shot and killed by Santana.  Back at the Station, Johns interrogates Riddick about the fate of his son, William J. Johns (the mercenary from ''[[Pitch Black (film)|Pitch Black]]''). When the storms reach the station, Riddick's threat is revealed as thousands of Mud Demons emerge from hibernation underground, awakened by the rainwater, and besiege the station, killing Lockspur and Moss. Johns agrees to release Riddick in order to locate the hidden power cells. Santana attempts to kill Riddick, who is worth twice as much dead as he is alive. Riddick, with only one leg free, beheads Santana with his own machete, something he had promised to do. The group then releases Riddick.  They fight their way to the ship, with Vargas being killed. Johns, Santana's man Diaz, and Riddick leave the ship together on the hover-bikes to retrieve the power nodes. During their journey, Diaz knocks Johns' bike over the side of an embankment, causing him to crash. He is then picked up by Riddick. After they reach the power nodes, Riddick reveals Johns' son's [[morphine]] addiction, as well as a 'spineless' attempt by William Johns to utilize a child as 'bait' for the creatures on the world they were stranded on ten years prior. Diaz attempts to kill Riddick and Johns. Riddick fights and kills him, but a dying Diaz damages the only working hover bike, having already sabotaged the other.  Riddick and Boss Johns fend off a seemingly endless horde of Mud Demons while running back to the station. Riddick is severely wounded. Johns takes both nodes and abandons Riddick. Riddick begins to fight a futile battle against the advancing Demons. Just when it seems he is about to be killed, Johns arrives in one of the ships and shoots the creatures while Dahl descends to rescue Riddick. Giving him the other ship, Johns asks Riddick where he intends to go, before deciding he is better off not knowing. Riddick praises Johns for being a better man than his son and departs into deep space.  In the theatrical version, this is the end of the film, while in the extended version, there is an additional scene which takes place aboard the Necromonger capital ship where Riddick kills Krone and finds out that Vaako has crossed the threshold into the Underverse, seen as a large hole in space surrounded by gas. Riddick looks out the window as he is told that Vaako has gone to achieve transcendence, where he is both dead and alive.<ref name="bloody-disgusting1"></ref><ref name="movie-censorship1"></ref>

In 1966, the prepubescent Aila (Miika Whiskeyjack) lives with her father Joseph (Glen Gould), mother Anna ([[Roseanne Supernault]]) and younger brother Tyler at the fictional Red Crow Reserve, a [[Mi'kmaq]] Indian reserve. Aila's parents consume drugs and alcohol to cope with the abuse they suffered at St. Dymphna's residential school. Tyler is accidentally killed by Anna during a [[Driving under the influence|drunk driving accident]]. The grief-stricken Anna commits suicide while Joseph takes the blame and is imprisoned.   The film fast forwards ten years later to 1976.

To avoid being sent to St. Dymphna's school, Aila uses the proceeds from the drug money to bribe the corrupt and abusive [[Indian agent (Canada)|Indian agent]] Popper ([[Mark Antony Krupa]]), who runs the school. In flashback scenes, it is show that a younger Popper (Sheamas Graham) was bullied by several Mi'kmaq youths including Burner.

However, Popper catches up with them and knocks Joseph down with a rifle butt. Popper attempts to rape Aila but is shot dead by the local resident boy who freed Aila. To protect the young boy and his daughter, Joseph takes the fall for killing Popper.

Rigor Mortis (film)
 Formerly successful actor [[Chin Siu-ho]], star of ''[[Mr. Vampire]]'', becomes depressed and suicidal when his wife leaves him.  He moves into a dilapidated apartment building, where he meets Uncle Yin, the building's long-time, friendly supervisor.  Yin performs a welcoming ceremony, and Chin insists that Yin take a gratuity saying that, "It'll become necessary,".  After listening to a recorded message left by his young son, Chin attempts to hang himself.  His action draws the attention of twin ghosts who haunt the apartment, and they possess his body.  Yau, a retired vampire hunter, bursts into the room, cuts down the noose, and exorcises the spirits from Chin's body.  Alerted by the commotion, his neighbors gather at the doorway before Yau disperses them.  Later, Chin visits Yau's restaurant, where Yau explains that he has taken up cooking [[glutinous rice]], an ingredient used in fighting [[jiangshi]].  Chin thanks Yau for saving his life, but Yau tells him to save his gratitude for a time when he can save Chin's life without the threat of suicide.  Chin then meets several of his neighbors, including Yang Feng, a traumatized woman with mental instability and her albino son, Pak. The audience is also introduced to seamstress Auntie Meiyi and her husband Uncle Tung.  Later that night, in a dream, Tung tells Meiyi that he must leave her for several days and requests that she wait for him.  In reality, Tung has fallen down the stairs and died.  Black magic practitioner Gau discovers the body and preserves it for Meiyi, who requests that he resurrect her husband. They begin the process of preserving and gradually resurrecting Tung's corpse while keeping it concealed in her bathroom.  Chin later discovers that Yin has been providing shelter for Yang and Pak, who are connected to the ghostly twins.  Yin explains with the aid of a flashback, that in life, the twins were students being tutored by Yang's husband in apartment 2442. There, he assaulted and raped one of the sisters and upon discovering the brutal rape, the other twin stabs Yang's husband to death. After a scuffle, the final image depicts the dead tutor surrounded by the corpses of the twins; one dead on the floor next to him, the other hung from the ceiling fan. After hearing this, Chin attempts to seek help from Yau in permanently ridding the apartment of the twins, but Yau refuses and claims to simply be a cook now. Before leaving Yau's apartment, Chin remarks that if he truly was just a cook, he wouldn't have kept all the exorcism memorabilia from his Father, notably the large, round talisman mounted on the wall.  Chin then turns to Gau, and the two summon the twins who proceed to possess Chin once again.  Hearing the sounds of Gau and Chin fighting, Yau investigates and joins the fray.  Together, Gau and Yau are able to exorcise the ghosts and bind them into a sturdy cabinet.  Yau rebukes Gau for his use of Chin as bait and advises him to burn the cabinet.  Gau promises to do so, and they leave Chin to recover.  Unsatisfied with her husband's lack of progress, Meiyi seeks further help from Gau, who counsels her to continue waiting.  Gau eventually relents and suggests an alternative to the crow's blood she has been feeding Tung every night: the blood of a virgin. While they are discussing their options, Yin arrives to investigate the disappearance of Tung.  Afraid that Yin suspects the truth, Meiyi murders him by bashing his head in.  Later, Yau requests that she watch over Pak for a bit.  When Pak requests to use the bathroom, she hesitates only briefly before seizing the opportunity and locks him in the room with Tung. While the child is horrifically murdered, Meiji stands on the other side of the door, tears streaming down her face.  In a cut scene, the talisman in Yau's room activates, signaling the presence of a powerful evil. Now risen as a jiangshi, a disfigured Tung haunts the apartment complex. His first victim, a mortally wounded Gau reveals to Yau that he planned to use Tung & the twins to help extend his life, but Meiyi let Tung loose.  Distraught, Yang searches the apartment building for her missing son.  When she finds the rattling cabinet, she assumes he is inside and hastily she opens it, unintentionally and unknowingly releasing the twins' ghosts.  After searching a bit more she encounters Pak, now a specter. Filled with rage and sorrow, she slits her left wrist to lure out the jiangshi. She attempts to destroy him with a makeshift weapon, but ultimately, Tung kills her. Moments later, Chin shows up with a Molotov cocktail and sets Tung aflame, seemingly defeating him.  However, the twins arrive and quickly possess Tung's corpse.  Now more powerful, he easily impales Chin and leaves him for dead.  Chin manages to free himself despite being heavily injured and finds Yau. He begs that Yau give him enough strength for one last fight.  Initially reluctant, as it might risk Chin's life, Yau relents and sets a trap for Tung.  With his vampire hunting tools, Yau weakens Tung enough for Chin to finally destroy him.  As Tung slowly crumbles to ash, Meiyi joins him by slitting her throat.  Chin and Yau, wounded by the battle, both collapse.  In the final sequence, it is shown what would have happened had there been no supernatural elements. Chin is again depicted moving into the apartment complex, but it is less run-down, and the residents are less eccentric: Yin does not interact with him, Yang and Pak are depicted as happy and friendly neighbors, and Meiyi is a widow who is shown admiring a picture of Tung.  Chin successfully commits suicide, and an ineffective Yau discovers him too late to save him.  At the morgue, Chin's son who is actually an adult and not a child as previously depicted, identifies the body to the medical examiner, Dr. Gau.

The Rivalry: Red v. Blue
  ''Red V. Blue'' is a documentary about the instate rivalry between the [[University of Kentucky]] and the [[University of Louisville]], the two most prominent universities in the state of [[Kentucky]]. The universities are located in the state's two largest cities, respectively the second-largest city of [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] and the largest city, [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and are separated by 75 miles of [[Interstate 64 in Kentucky|Interstate 64]]. But this is the least of their differences.  The close geographic proximity of the schools to each other has bred an [[Kentucky–Louisville rivalry|intense rivalry]], a rivalry made even more contentious by the national success of both college basketball programs. The two schools have won a combined 11 NCAA Division I basketball championships between them (University of Kentucky has eight championships and the University of Louisville has three). However, the rivalry between the [[Kentucky Wildcats|Wildcats]] and the [[Louisville Cardinals|Cardinals]] runs much deeper than geographical proximity.<ref>[http://www.wkyt.com/wymt/sports/sportsovertime/headlines/Red-V-Blue-documentary-showcases-states-biggest-rivalry-238303511.html#.UsNbunLOn3I.facebook 'Red V. Blue' documentary showcases state's biggest rivalry]</ref>  Unlike many of college basketball's other great rivalries, such as [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] [[Carolina–Duke rivalry|and]] [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], or [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball|Purdue]] [[Indiana–Purdue rivalry|and]] [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]], the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville do not play in the same conference and have only one scheduled meeting a year. Theirs is a rivalry that is not born simply of familiarity or from battling year after year for the conference crown; it starts and ends with basketball bragging rights in a state that is more religiously devoted to basketball than to almost anything else.  Kentucky and Louisville basketball teams met for the first time in 1913. But for the following 70 years they rarely played each other. But then, a somewhat improbable matchup in the 1983 NCAA Division 1 Tournament, Elite Eight stage between the No. 2 ranked [[1982–83 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Cardinals]] and the No.12 ranked [[1982–83 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Wildcats]] sent the Bluegrass State in to a frenzy. Fans from both schools refer to this post regular season clash between the two storied programs in 1983 as the "Dream Game." In the game itself, after regulation time ended with Kentucky tying the game at the "buzzer," Louisville went on to dominate the overtime and ran out as comfortable 80–68 winners. This was the defining moment in this rivalry. The result of this game lead directly to the start of the "Battle for the Bluegrass" annual series between the two schools that November. But it took the best personal efforts of the then Governor of Kentucky [[John Y. Brown, Jr.]] to put these two universities, separated by 75 miles of freeway, back on the basketball court.

Believing her only living twin son to be blessed, Mali refuses to kill it, and so she and Taitok keep it a secret from her husband, Toma (Sumrit Warin).  Seven years later, the living twin named Ahlo (Sitthiphon Disamoe) learns that a second dam is being built, so Toma takes Ahlo to see the dam, where it's revealed in a presentation video that the people of Ahlo's village will have to be relocated due to the valley they live in will be flooded between the two dams. So Ahlo and his family move through the woods while taking his boat with them. With the help of a ploughing buffalo, they manage to get the boat half way up the hill, only for the ropes to snap, sending the boat crashing into Mali, killing her. Furious, Taitok reveals to Toma that Ahlo is a twin and that "he should have died".  After burying Mali, Ahlo and his family ride a bus to their new village, which Taitok doesn't much like due to the running water and electricity that replaces their "traditions".

The next day, Ahlo tells Kia about his tribe's tradition about being a cursed twin. When he accidentally desecrates a sacred shrine, Ahlo, Toma and Taitko have their house and belongings burnt in retaliation. Along with Kia and Purple, they all sneak out of the village in a cart filled with undetonated bombs from the war or [[Unexploded ordnance|UXO]].  They all journey for days and eventually arrive at Purple's village, they call Paradise, with no other inhabitants. Ahlo and Kia run off into the bushes to play, but Ahlo almost sets off a bombie in the event of smashing fruit that Kia threw to him. Toma proposes moving again due to the land being surrounded by these dangerous bombs (which explains why there are no other inhabitants). While journeying for yet another home, Ahlo and company cross paths with a parade of travelers, where he hears an announcer mention a rocket competition that gives out cash prizes. While settling down, they are met by the village chief who tells them that the purpose of the contest is to launch them into the clouds in which they'll explode and produce rain. Believing this could break his curse, Ahlo announces his intentions to build a rocket and enter the contest to earn the money for them to buy a new home, but Toma and Taitko won't allow him, due to his bad luck. Ahlo nevertheless still decides to build his own rocket and runs off.  While walking through the woods in search of things to build his rocket with, Ahlo comes across another unexploded bomb, but its hard casing proves to be usable for a rocket, but blows up seconds after Ahlo hits it with a rock; he survives. Later, Ahlo manages to get Purple to help him build the rocket. Purple takes Ahlo to a bat cave to collect bat droppings that, according to Purple, can be used for blasting up the rocket. Inside the cave, Ahlo comes across a woman who considers him to be an evil spirit, causing him to run out of the cave screaming.  The rocket festival begins the next day. While some people are launching their rockets, Ahlo is still in the woods trying to put his together. He grinds the bat droppings into powder, but tests it out on a few mini rockets, to no avail, so Ahlo tries urinating on the bat dropping powder (advised by Purple, who said that can make it work better). In the contest, Toma launches his rocket, named Lucky, but lets go of it too soon and launches it poorly. A champion rocket named The Million is launched afterwards which successfully reaches the clouds. Ahlo brings his rocket in, which he calls The Bat, but the announcer tells him that kids aren't allowed to launch. Ahlo asks Toma to launch it, but Taitko doesn't allow him to, believing that The Bat will blow everyone up because of Ahlo's bad luck. Nobody else volunteers to do so and Ahlo then runs off. Toma decides to launch it anyway. Kia catches up to Ahlo and tells him what his father is doing, and so he runs back to the contest, thinking the rocket will kill Toma, and shouts his apology over the loud roaring of the rocket. The Bat is launched properly this time and it reaches the clouds. The Bat then surprisingly explodes inside the cloud, causing it to rain. Ahlo wins 10 million kip and is now no longer considered cursed.

Shibu and the other convicts beats the cops and Shibu jumps out of the train with Akash in tag.  Meanwhile, not so far away is a village called Poomala, which is on the [[Kerala]] - [[Tamil Nadu]] border. Thommichan ([[Lalu Alex]]) is the only prominent and wealthy man in the village and is respected highly by the townsfolks. He manages to get two priests to come and reopen their church (But the men were saying that they cannot come. Thommichan misheard it as they will come). He begins to start the preparations to welcome them.  As fate has it, Akash and Shibu reach Poomala. They end up reaching the church and they find themselves surrounded by the townsfolk. Soon, they realize that the people have mistaken them to be priests. The men begin to masquerade as priests to avoid being captured. Akash becomes Fr.Paul and Shibu becomes Fr.Sebastian aka Sebu.  The men find luck on their side as their doings end up having a positive effects and strengthening the belief of the townspeople. Some examples include the time when Shibu causes the old and unused church bell to become good again while he was trying to steal it. Another example is when they are to cure the insanity of the mother of Mathukutty, a tailor and friend. The woman attacks them and unknowingly hits a socket and gets electrocuted, which cures her. But the event leaves Geevarghese, a preacher who does not like the new priests to unknowingly get shocked and become insane.  The men constantly hear the people telling that 'the men came even after knowing everything'. The duo have no idea what the people mean by that. They ask Achankunju, the sexton, about the truth and he tells the truth.  A priest named Fr.Rodriguez was the priest of the church years ago. A girl fell in love with him and committed suicide after revealing the truth to him. When the townsfolk heard the news, they came to question Fr.Rodriguez, who by then had hung himself. It is said that his ghost has been killing all the priests who come to the church and perform rituals during the Perunal or holy day.  Akash and Shibu become scared and plan to escape. Moreover, Akash finds out that he knows Thommichan's daughter Eleena ([[Nivetha Thomas]]) and she knows who Akash is. Akash was a magician who was a friend of Eleena. He was arrested for cheating and robbery. She at first threatens to expose the men but later forgives them after knowing the deeds they did.  The men's attempts to flee end up failing as they circle back and end up back in Poomala. Finally, Shibu plans to steal some ornaments and escape. But Akash opposes leading to a fight. Shibu locks him in a room and runs away, but Achankunju frees Akash (initially believing that it was a ghost). Akash finds that Shibu has not run away and they reconcile.  Later, they perform the ritual where the priests are said to die. Akash tells that the Fr.Rodriguez is the cause of the curse and moves to destroy his gravestone. But just before he makes his move, he seemingly bleeds and dies. When the townsfolk blame Fr.Paul, Fr.Sebu insults Fr.Rodriguez. This invokes Pappichayan (T.G.Ravi) an elderly photographer who is highly respected, and he shouts that the church should be destroyed and a new church in Fr.Rodriguez's name should be built.  Just then, the seemingly dead Fr.Paul gets up and reveals that he faked his death to reveal the truth to the townsfolk. He reveals that Pappichayan is actually the father of Fr.Rodriguez. He blames the town for killing his son and has been killing every priest who comes to the church. He poisons a food item (Vayanayappam) which the priests eat during the ritual, thus making it look like a curse or clueless death. It is revealed that Shibu saw Pappichayan poisoning their Vayanayappam the night he tried to run away with the loot. This prompted him to return and reveal the facts to Akash. To avoid exposing Fr.Sebu, Fr.Paul lies that Fr.Sebu had a vision in which he saw the truth and the townsfolk blindly believe them (owing to the fact that the townsfolk believe the priests have mystical powers). Pappichayan is subsequently arrested.  Sometime later, the priests ask the townsfolk to close their eyes for prayer. When everyone is praying, the men escape. While running, Akash sees Eleena, who tells him to keep running. But they soon are caught by the police. The police inspector tells the men that he knows what they did in Poomala and as a reward, their punishment will be reduced. Akash smiles and winks at Eleena, as the cops take him and Shibu.  It is shown that the people of Poomala still have not learned the truth about the priests and consider them to be god's angels. The end credit scenes shows two men in Santa costumes celebrating [[Christmas]] with some elderly women. The men are later revealed to be Akash and Shibu, who have once again escaped.

Ruby Red (film)
 The movie opens with a young man and woman being chased by a group of hooded men intent on killing them or taking a device that they are carrying. As they are surrounded, the man Paul reassures his companion that Gwendolyn will be safe, that Grace will protect her. Just as the men are about to kill them, Paul and the young woman activate the device and disappear in a swirl of energy.  We fast-forward sixteen years to the day before Gwendolyn's "Gwen" Shepherd's sixteenth birthday. Gwen belongs to a very snobbish aristocratic London family. Most of the family members dress as if it were the nineteenth century, and they don't believe in associating with "commoners." This makes them look down at Gwen, because Gwen and her mother Grace and brother Nick are the only "normal" members of the family.   The family is gathered at her grandmother's London castle giving a party to honor Gwen's cousin Charlotte, who is one day older than her. The family has always regarded Charlotte as something very special, as she had inherited a genetic mutation that for some secret reason makes her extremely valuable. Gwen's great-aunt Maddy says that the gene is a hereditary ability to travel back in time, inherited by only one female per generation, but Maddy's obsession with the supernatural makes Gwen not take her information very seriously.  At the party, Charlotte is even more snooty than usual and taunts Gwen that she will never get a date for the school ball. Gwen is attracted to the über-handsome Gideon de Villiers, but he brushes her off and only has eyes for Charlotte. When Charlotte suddenly suffers from dizzy spells and everyone makes a big fuss about her. Charlotte's mother has her wrapped in a special dress and Gideon rushes her off to the mysterious secret society. Great-aunt Maddy tells Gwen more about the Order of Count Saint Germain and the time travel gene. Gideon apparently is a carrier of the same gene. Charlotte is inducted by the Guardians into the Order. They think she is the "Ruby," the long-prophesied last time traveler.   Shortly thereafter, Gwen also starts having fainting spells and begins seeing ghosts. She goes out to get some fresh air and literally stumbles into the nineteenth century. The only person she tells about this brief leap in time is her best friend Leslie, who quickly recognizes that Gwen must be the one who inherited the time travel gene, instead of Charlotte. Gwen makes several more uncontrolled leaps in time and begins to learn about a conflict between her family and the members of the Order. Gwen finally tells her mother Grace about her time travels, who recognizes that she is the Ruby and immediately brings her to the Order to get help in controlling her time travel.  There, Gwen is not believed. Her aunt, Charlotte's mother, thinks that this is a desperate attempt to be the center of attention, and the Order's guards, in turn, fear a conspiracy, since decades ago Grace helped the previous time travelers, Lucy and Paul, escape. But most importantly, Gideon de Villiers, the male gene carrier of her generation, also known as Diamond, clearly does not want to work with Gwendolyn because he and Charlotte are close and they have been training together for years for their mysterious "mission." Only Mr. George, a formerly close friend of her deceased grandfather, and Madame Rossini, who makes the authentic costumes for the planned time travel, are friendly and understanding toward her. Charlotte is also extremely upset about being replaced by Gwen.  Eventually it is confirmed that Gwen is the last of a total of twelve time travelers, the so-called Ruby. But Gwen has doubts about the Order and the mission and the Chronograph, with which the Order can control the time traveling of the twelve travelers. Apparently Lucy helped steal the Chronograph because she was afraid of a terrible power it held. Gwen still is unsure what exactly is going on, but at the Order, she is given an unlimited spending account, and Gideon is warned to keep an eye on Gwendolyn, and is also warned against any love affairs between the two time traveling families. Gwen overhears him say that she is definitely not his type.  Due to the theft of the previous chronograph by Gwen's cousin Lucy, blood samples have to be collected from all of the formerly living carriers to finish a second device. But Gideon was unable to collect blood from Lady Tilney, Gwen's great-great-grandmother, as she knows Gwendolyn's name and will only cooperate with Gwendolyn. When Gideon and Gwen visit Lady Tilney in 1912, Lucy and Paul suddenly appear, warning Gwendolyn of the dangers of finishing the Chronograph and of the Count's plans to sacrifice her life to achieve his goals. Gideon overpowers Paul and the butler and runs away with Gwen. Back in the 21st century, Gwen takes Gideon out to a "common" restaurant for some Indian food, which is a new experience for him.  Back at headquarters, only Gwendolyn believes in Lucy and Paul's sincerity, while the Guardians are convinced of a plot by the Florentine Alliance that has been fighting the Count of Saint Germain for centuries. Falk de Villiers, grandmaster of the lodge, wants to control Gwen and is worried about her curiosity, but Gideon starts having some twinges of doubt. Charlotte taunts Gwen with her close relationship with Gideon. Gwen breaks the Order's vows of secrecy and shares about her experiences with her friend Leslie. Charlotte recruits a teacher at the school, who is a secret member of the Order, to stop them. Gideon picks Gwen up at the school with a limo, which impresses her classmates.  Gwen goes to meet with the Count of Saint Germain in 1782. He is able to read minds but is not impressed with Gwen and will not answer her questions. The Count wonders what the Ruby's special magic is. Gwen does not know. When she talks about the future to his companions, he chokes her Darth Vader style and warns her not to break his rules. Gwen questions Gideon about his blind obedience to the Order even though he knows little about their goals.   On the way back, their carriage is attacked in Hyde Park. During the fight, Gwen saves Gideon's life, and he is forced to reevaluate how he sees her. Gwen wants to run away from the Order but Gideon says they can't because the Order "owns" them. Ultimately he decides to search with her for answers. He kisses her as thanks for saving his life, which Charlotte observes from a window.  At night, they sneak into the Order's archives to find an ancient prophesy about themselves, but the secret documents were transferred to a bank years ago. Using a note from Gwen's grandfather, they convince Mr. George to help them travel to 1942 to find the documents. In 1942, they read the prophesy about how Gwen's death as the Ruby (a.k.a. "the Raven"), bleeding out in the snow, will bring the circle of the twelve to completion. The last part of the prophecy is torn off and missing. Security guards break in, and in trying to escape, Gwen falls many stories to the ground from the top of the observatory tower. After being unconscious for some time in the snow-covered courtyard, Gwen wakes up in a pool of her own blood. The Count then comes in spirit form to confront her. Meanwhile, Gideon is thrown into the dungeon. The ghost of a little boy whom Gwen has been seeing throughout the movie appears and helps keep Gwen discover that Lucy's talisman she has been carrying is actually a key to help her get into the building and stay alive.  Again in the present, Gwen is found unconscious from hypothermia. Falk de Villiers quotes the prophecy of her icy death and tries to prevent any efforts to save her life. But Gideon defies this instruction and carries Gwen in the doctor's room. When she recovers, he promises her to always take care of her.  Gwendolyn goes to the big school ball wearing her cousin Lucy's dress and being accompanied by Gideon. She discovers from a family photo that the little boy she has been seeing is her grandfather's dead younger brother, and she concludes that her ability to see ghosts could be the special "magic of the raven." At the ball Gideon and Gwen share a kiss while a ghost dances nearby. The film concludes with Paul and Lucy escaping again from another group of men who are chasing them.

At the drivers' meeting, Hunt argues that Lauda would benefit by having one fewer race in the season. The drivers vote to go ahead with the race. All drivers except [[Jochen Mass]] start the race with wet weather tyres, which becomes a costly tactic due to most of the track quickly drying up. They all pit to change tyres during the second lap, but halfway through the third lap, a suspension arm in Lauda's Ferrari breaks, sending the car flying into an embankment before it bursts into flames and is further hit by other cars. After being pulled out of the inferno, he is airlifted to the hospital with third-degree burns to his head and face and internal burns to his lungs. For six weeks, Lauda is treated for his injuries while he watches Hunt dominate the races in his absence. Despite his doctor's orders, he decides to drive his Ferrari at the [[1976 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] to finish fourth while Hunt fails to finish the race.  The 1976 season comes to a climax at the rain-soaked [[1976 Japanese Grand Prix|Japanese Grand Prix]]. Hunt's late rally in Lauda's absence has pulled him within three points of Lauda. At the end of the second lap, Lauda returns to the pits and retires from the race, considering it too dangerous and opting to stay with Marlene instead of risking his life again on the track. This gives Hunt a chance to win the championship if he can notch a podium finish (third or better). After facing stiff competition under gruelling conditions, tyre problems and a hand injury due to the gear shifter knob breaking, Hunt finishes third, narrowly giving him enough points to win the championship. He spends the rest of the year with fame, sex and drugs, while Lauda takes an interest in flying private planes. At a private airfield in [[Bologna]], Lauda suggests to Hunt that he focus on the next racing season, but later on realises that Hunt no longer has anything to prove. Hunt continues to race until his retirement in 1979, and becomes a motorsport broadcast commentator until his death in 1993 at the age of 45.

Sadako 3D 2
  Takanori Andō ([[Kōji Seto]]) is waiting while Akane Ayukawa is giving birth to their daughter. Seiji Kashiwada's landlord sitting in a garden reads Kashiwada's letters and mutters that the girl is born. Another woman is accessing her laptop in her room when her husband calls her; she is suddenly possessed by a force from her laptop who forces her to commit suicide by stabbing her eye with a knife.  Five years after the events of [[Sadako 3D|the previous film]], Takanori and Akane's daughter, Nagi ([[Kokoro Hirasawa]]) is cared for by Takanori's younger sister, Fuko ([[Miori Takimoto]]); Takanori himself is now working at Asakawa General Hospital since Akane's death by childbirth, distancing himself from Fuko and Nagi as he blames Nagi for Akane's death.  Fuko is certain that something is wrong with Nagi, as she distances herself from her friends, likes to draw strange imagery, and is always present near people who committed suicide. She consults with her psychiatrist, Dr. Fumika Kamimura ([[Itsumi Osawa]]), but she only states that Fuko's anxiety comes from the fact that she has not moved from her mother's suicide years ago, whose death she could not prevent. While playing at a park, one of Nagi's friends, Yuna, teases her about Akane's death. Moments later, she is found dead in the nearby river. Fuko becomes even more anxious as more deaths start to occur, from Nagi's babysitter to a train full of people, which Nagi had foreshadowed in her drawings she drew during her psychological test with Dr. Kamimura. She also says that Dr. Kamimura, as well as everyone else, will die.  Detective Mitsugi Kakiuchi ([[Takeshi Onishi]]) is assigned to investigate the case. He questions Detective Yugo Koiso ([[Ryosei Tayama]]), who is disabled following his own investigations of a similar case five years before. Koiso tells Kakiuchi that the suicides are linked to Sadako Yamamura, who almost possessed Akane as her vessel so she might be reborn in the world. Seconds later, a force pushes Koiso's wheelchair through a set of stairs to his death.  Kakiuchi finds the security camera recording before the train accident and spots Nagi looking at the camera. He tries to question Takanori about Nagi and Akane, but he refuses to disclose anything other than Akane's death. As he hurries up ahead, he accidentally drops his trash bags, revealing bundles of black hair. While Fuko is cleaning Takanori's room, she finds a locked up wardrobe that contains a photo of Takanori, Akane, and baby Nagi, as well as several letters for Takanori from Seiji Kashiwada asking Nagi's well-being.  Fuko visits Kashiwada ([[Yusuke Yamamoto]]), the latter awaiting his execution for his murder of young women five years before. Describing himself as Nagi's "fan", Kashiwada reveals that Nagi is not Akane's child, but Sadako's, and that the only way to stop Nagi is for Fuko to kill herself or to kill Nagi. On the way home, Fuko receives a call from Dr. Kamimura asking her to meet her, but finds that she has been possessed, and while escaping from her attack, Fuko relives her experiences of seeing her mother's suicide and becomes cursed.  At home, Fuko experiences nightmares of Nagi and Takanori attacking her. She contemplates killing Nagi by throwing her into the sea, but decides not to. She meets Takanori and, after urging him to help Nagi, he shows Fuko that Akane ([[Satomi Ishihara]]) is still alive, albeit in a comatose state. He tells Fuko that since Sadako attempted to be reborn through Akane in the first film, Akane has allowed herself to be possessed by Sadako so she can fight her from the inside. Eventually, Akane became pregnant and delivered Nagi, but she can never reunite with her mother again lest Sadako be reborn. Takanori also reveals that Nagi is not responsible for the deaths.  The next day, Fuko discovers Nagi is missing, while Takanori finds her roaming in the Asakawa Hospital. He is attacked and brutally beaten by Kakiuchi, who wants to kill Nagi and Akane to stop the curse, revealing that his wife (the woman killed in the beginning) had died from the curse and he himself is also cursed. Nagi escapes and reunites with Fuko, who allows Nagi to reunite with her mother. However, Akane is shot before she could reach Nagi by Kakiuchi, who promptly commits suicide. As the whole room is flooded by blood pouring from Sadako's well, Nagi is taken by Sadako, but Fuko manages to save her.  Several days later, Fuko and Nagi have a picnic at a meadow, while Kashiwada's landlord, still sitting in the garden, reads Kashiwada's last letter before his execution. The film ends with the camera recording that Kakiuchi watches, which reveals that Sadako's child is not Nagi.  
The Sacrament (2013 film)
 Patrick, a fashion photographer, receives a letter from his sister, a recovering addict named Caroline, that invites him to visit Eden Parish, a utopian, drug-free community founded by a religious leader.  When Patrick investigates, he discovers that they have moved to a new undisclosed location only accessible by helicopter.  Intrigued by the mystery, Patrick's co-workers, reporter Sam and cameraman Jake, suggest a feature documentary on the topic.  The trip goes well, but the helicopter pilot warns them that he will leave with or without them the next day; they promise to be prompt.  Issues first arise when they meet the guides at the airfield.  Expecting only Patrick, they are taken aback by a film crew; they contact Father, the leader, who authorizes their entrance.  At the commune itself, armed guards delay the entry of the film crew.  Feeling uneasy, Jake and Sam begin to regret the trip, but Patrick is able to smooth things over when his sister appears.  Caroline enthusiastically welcomes them and apologizes for the misunderstanding.  Caroline leaves with Patrick, and Jake and Sam are given their own cabin.  After settling in, the two attempt to find members to interview.  Several of the people open up to them and tell stories of how Father has saved them and given them new-found hope.  The commune's nurse, Wendy, reveals that the commune has a well-stocked medical center funded by donations from the members, who sold off all their possessions.  Privately, the filmmakers express their skepticism but admit that the members seem happy and have accomplished much.  Caroline arranges an interview with Father, and Sam prepares a list of questions.  However, Father will only agree to do the interview during a public meeting.  Father, an older Southerner, greets them warmly and at first answers the questions openly.  However, his answers become more evasive and vaguely threatening.  Near the end of the interview, Father raises the subject of Sam's pregnant wife, which Sam had mentioned earlier to Wendy.  Put off-guard, Sam fumbles and loses control of the interview, and Father politely but dominantly cuts it short with roaring applause from his followers, who proceed to engage in a party.  During the party, Savannah, a young, mute girl, passes a note requesting help to Sam.  When the filmmakers inquire further, they discover a dissident group that wishes to leave, alleging abuse and brainwashing.  Jake does not want to get involved, but Sam insists that they help despite the fact that the helicopter can not fit them.  When Sam and Jake attempt to locate Patrick, they find that he has been taken aside for a threesome, and an inebriated-seeming Caroline explains that they need Patrick's money.  Growing increasingly distrustful of Father and the commune, Jake and Sam anxiously wait out the night, unable to sleep.  In the morning, they find that the dissidents have become outright rebellious.  Sarah, Savannah's mother, insists that they at least rescue her daughter, and Jake returns to the helicopter to delay its take-off.  The pilot flatly refuses to help, but gunshots cut the conversation short.  Jake flees into the forest and circles back to the helicopter; the injured pilot tells him to get the others.  At the camp, Sam attempts to break up a fight, and a guard attacks him.  Caroline angrily denounces him, and he is taken hostage.  Father convenes the commune and forces everyone to take cyanide-laced drinks.  Anyone who refuses is shot dead.  When Jake returns to the camp, he finds almost everyone dead except for roving, armed guards.  Patrick, also held hostage, panics when Caroline injects him with a syringe, and she holds him as he dies.  When Jake finds her, she refuses to leave the camp, saying that she has nothing left, and she self-immolates.  In another cabin, Jake finds Savannah and Sarah hiding; Sarah herself kills her daughter to spare her from execution, and  guards shoot Sarah dead while Jake hides.  When Jake finally confronts Father himself, he finds Sam bound to a chair.  Father commits suicide, and the two filmmakers flee back to the helicopter, where they escape.

Samar (2013 film)
 The film opens with Sakthi ([[Vishal Krishna|Vishal]]), son of a forest ranger, beating up a gang that illegally cuts precious trees to earn money. Sakthi is a jungle trekker who spends his time bringing groups of tourists on trips into the jungle.  Almost immediately the story changes track and introduces Sakthi’s girlfriend Rupa ([[Sunaina]]). The lovers soon part ways citing compatibility issues where Rupa complains that Shakthi is not the loving boyfriend she wanted. Sakthi's character is as such that he does not remember even a single detail in their love life that Rupa deems important. Rupa tells Sakthi that he does not seem to have the time for a girlfriend and that he does not even care to do so. Rupa further aggravates the situation by asking Sakthi to close his eyes and tell her the colour of the dress she was wearing right then, but Sakthi finds that he could not. Grieved, Rupa leaves Sakthi, saying this was his character and that he would not change.  After three months, Sakthi still had not recovered from his break-up. However, he receives a courier from his girlfriend saying that she misses him, and a flight ticket to Bangkok where she resides now. Sakthi is overjoyed and leaves for Bangkok. Being his first trip to a foreign country, Sakthi seeks help from his beautiful co-passenger Maya ([[Trisha Krishnan|Trisha]]). They end up becoming friends and Sakthi tells Maya about his lady love.  In Bangkok's [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]], Sakthi and Maya part ways, and Sakthi makes his way to the Buddhist Temple where Rupa had written in the letter that she would meet him at. Although he waits for hours, Rupa doesn't turn up. At night, IPS Officer Muthumaran ([[Sampath Raj]]) checks on him, saying that he wasn't allowed to stay at the temple at night. Upon learning that Sakthi is a Tamilian just like himself, he offers him a place to stay while Sakthi finds his girlfriend. However, Muthumaran does imply that he does not trust women and that Sakthi should not get his hopes up high that Rupa will come looking for him. Another day, in a case of mistaken identity, Sakthi gets caught up in the middle of a shootout between two gangs, one intent on protecting him and the other seemingly hell-bent to riddle him full of holes. As the gang protecting Sakthi gain the upperhand in the firefight, they whisk him away to a posh hotel in a luxury car. Sakthi is confused and doesn’t understand why he was dragged off.  A magazine in the seat next to him in the car attracts his attention and to his shock, Sakthi sees an exact look-alike on the cover of the magazine. It turns out that his [[doppelgänger]], remarkably also named Sakthi, is a multi-millionaire tycoon who is adored by many and targeted by a few in Bangkok. He doesn’t know how to prove his identity as everything stands against him. Things get bizarre as Trekker Sakthi has been forcefully dropped into the role of Tycoon Sakthi and situations seem to prove him as someone he was not.  In the hotel, Trekker Sakthi argues with the Tycoon Sakthi's personal assistant Manohar ([[John Vijay]]) about his true identity. He takes out his passport and shows it to Manohar. An amused Manohar gives the passport back to Trekker Sakthi and asks if it was true that he was merely the son of a forest ranger, why would he have multiple visas of so many countries, which was expected in a businessman's passport. To his horror, Trekker Shakthi finds that his ordinary, rarely travelled Indian passport has inexplicably turned into a Thai passport with visas to several countries like Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Sakthi enlists the help of Maya, who brings him to a branch of [[Bangkok Bank]] to recover his details, hoping there would be a discrepancy somewhere to help Trekker Sakthi prove he was not Tycoon Sakthi.  In a turn of events, when Trekker Sakthi signs his signature to access the Tycoon's bank account balance hoping that his different signature might be proof enough, the bank's security system shows that his signature was an exact match – and that he had a little over half a billion US dollars in his account. At this juncture, even Maya starts to suspect that both Sakthis are the same person. Sakthi gets further and further mangled in more trouble with his assumed identity.  After a long cat and mouse game, Sakthi spots Manohar again, not in a business suit as before, but as a pimp in the streets. Sakthi gives chase and beats him up enough to find out the truth – that he was being played by two ruthless, psychotic businessmen watching his every move through hidden cameras, who have orchestrated all the bizarre situations Sakthi had found himself in before Manohar reveals the names he gets shot and falls down in the hole. Shakthi is blamed for the murder and the police do not believe his situation. Shakthi comes to know that Rupa had never written the letter. Two business tycoons Rajesh Arunachalam ([[Manoj Bajpai]]) and John Frederick ([[J. D. Chakravarthy]]) happen to be friends from childhood, born in rich families. They play a game creating problematic situations intentionally for unsuspecting people choosing randomly placing bets on them to determine whether they survive or not.  In present, both villains bring a person posing as Maya's boyfriend Rohit ([[Narayan Lucky]]) to provoke the anger of Sakthi so that he would show his anger towards Maya. Sakthi plays the same game back at the villains with Maya, by pretending to slap and kill her (two villains think that Maya is really dead). Maya stands on a road where villains were travelling and they think she is a ghost, they panic, lose control of the car and become unconscious. Next day, Rajesh and John find themselves staying in a suite owned by them and a news broadcast shocks them – to the whole world, John and Rajesh are dead and their funeral is taking place. They run away and end up before Shakthi and Maya. Joseph Kuriyan ([[Jayaprakash]]), Muthumaran, and Jayakumar ([[Sriman (actor)|Sriman]]), the people who were involved in the game arrive there, and the film ends with Shakthi and Maya walking away from the seaside while the sound of a pistol is heard which indicates that both villains are killed.  
Safe Haven (film)
 A terrified woman, Katie, flees her house in [[Boston]], having been in the possession of a bloody knife. After taking shelter with a neighbor, she is at the bus station trying to flee town. She buys a bus ticket with her hair now cropped and bleached and stops in the small town of [[Southport, North Carolina]]. At the general store, she introduces herself as Katie Feldman. After getting a job as a waitress, and renting a small house on the edge of town, Katie befriends her neighbor, Jo. She meets Alex Wheatley, a widowed father of two young children, Josh, who has a strained relationship with him, and Lexie, who operates the local general store.  Alex soon gives Katie a bicycle so she won't have to walk.  It's not too long before Katie and Alex start a relationship, and she becomes like a mother to Josh and Lexie. Meanwhile, Kevin Tierney, a Boston police detective, prepares wanted posters for a woman named "Erin" which describes that she is wanted for [[first-degree murder]]. Alex sees Erin's wanted poster in the police station and notices the picture bears a striking resemblance to Katie. He confronts Katie with the information, causing a huge fight. They break up, and Katie moves out of her house.   As Katie is about to leave town, however, Alex intercepts her and says that he has fallen in love with her. Katie returns his love, and decides to stay in Southport. She tells Alex that she fled to Southport to escape her [[domestic violence|abusive]] and [[alcoholic]] husband. They got in a fight, and she stabbed him in self-defense before she fled south.   Meanwhile, Kevin is suspended for creating the wanted posters, whereupon it is revealed that he is Katie's (Erin's) abusive and alcoholic husband. Enraged, he breaks into Katie's former neighbor's home back in Boston and finds the phone number to the Southport restaurant where Katie works. Arriving just in time for the town's [[Fourth of July]] parade, a severely intoxicated Kevin sees Katie kissing Alex, which enrages him. That night, Katie has a dream that she is standing on the docks watching the fireworks when Jo comes up and tells Katie that "he" is here.  Katie wakes up in the convenience store next to a sleeping Lexie when Kevin suddenly appears and confronts her, demanding that she go back with him.  She refuses and tells him to leave. Kevin pulls a gun and pours gasoline all over the store, with the intent to burn it down.    When he hesitates, Katie buys time by faking sympathy for him and agreeing to return home with him. When he lets his guard down, she pushes him into the water; however, a firework spark lands on the gasoline, igniting a fire that engulfs the store.  Alex sees the burning store, quickly makes his way across the harbor by boat, and saves Lexie. Meanwhile, Katie tries to fight off Kevin; during the struggle, the gun goes off and kills Kevin, ridding her of him forever.  In the aftermath of the fire, Alex recovers several letters which were written by his late wife Carly before she died. The letters were prepared ahead of time for memorable events such as Josh's eighteenth birthday and Lexie's wedding day. Alex gives Katie a letter with the words "To Her" on the envelope; the letter thanks the recipient for making Alex happy. Enclosed with the letter is a photo of Alex's late wife, whom Katie is astonished to discover was actually Jo. This means that Jo was Carly, in the form of an angel, who led Katie to her husband, Alex.

Gautham Kumar spends his time in testing his fortune by buying lottery tickets and using gadgets which bring luck but sadly both end up giving nothing to him. His friends who are four kids live along with him in the slum colony. Once they ask him to show a 1000 rupee note out of curiosity to which Gautham Kumar agrees. The next day the [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]'s cash cartridge is being refilled and Gautham Kumar requests the officials to show a 1000 rupee note to the kids. They accept and show a note. Meanwhile, a gang of thieves come and rob the ATM. Gautham Kumar catches the criminals and handovers the money. But however since the [[CCTV]] footage shows that Gautham Kumar's request was the reason for it, he is posted to a dumping yard where he would work for nearly 12 hours.  The night he returned from his duty, a heavy rain drenches the colony and the roof in his room fall down. From the roof, he finds a Diary, an old empty bag on which "Pushkalavathi Jewelers, [[Peshawar]]" is printed, a Garuda locket, two magnifying lenses and a small stone with a design. He opens the diary and starts reading which is narrated by his grandfather Satyanarayana Varma ([[Suman (actor)|Suman]]). On the day of India-Pakistan, partition activists were attacking rich men and were looting them. After finding no resort to hiding, Satyanarayana Varma packs all his Jewelry and Diamonds and rushes out to a cave which is rumored to be a king's escape runway. After reaching the spot, he rests at a place keeping his bag on a door of an inlet. A bag with Diamonds falls into one of the Birds attached thus opening the inlet and the bags entering the inner space. He tried hard to get it back but removes the bird from there and falls in an abyss. But however he survived. Now there was a promissory note that 900 Diamonds of his would be inherited by his Grand Son. Gautham Kumar sets to Pakistan with the help of Sreenidhi ([[Taapsee Pannu]]), an ardent Hindu devotee who wishes to visit the [[Hinglaj Mata]] temple in Pakistan.  There Gautham Kumar and Sreenidhi along with Indian Security contractor Khayamat Raju ([[Ali (actor)|Ali]]) reach the Hinglaj Mata Temple. There he finds his grandfather's name on a slab and also comes to know by two dwellers that Archaeologists searched about this person. He goes to the Archaeology Department where Thilavar is the new in charge after the brutal murder of Siddiqui and shows the empty bag to them and finds that the address would be in Peshawar. Meanwhile, Gautham Kumar sees the Garuda Locket sketch on the research papers and shows the locket to them. Thilavar offers him money, gold and many things in return for this locket as per Sultan's orders but Gautham Kumar neither accepts to take any one or all of them nor accepts to give away the locket with respect to his motto. He escapes from them and along with Sreenidhi and Khayamat Raju he goes away to a safe place. Meanwhile, Sreenidhi is made a prey to a [[Buzkashi]] game with a rule that the one who parks her in the goal would marry her. A masked Gautham Kumar joins them and after a stiff competition, he wins the match by parking her thus making her fall for him. They move to Peshawar to a local hospital where they join Khayamat Raju with fake injuries and rest there that night.  The next morning he starts searching in the streets of Peshawar Markets for his grandfather's address only to be kidnapped by terrorists. Then he is brought before Sultan who asks Gautham Kumar to submit the Garuda Locket to which he responds saying he wouldn't give it to Sultan or anyone as it is his. They torture him, trash him, injure him severely only to make him much determined not to give it to Sultan. So Sultan orders Thilavar and his men to take him away to Peshawar and kill him. In transit, Gautham Kumar kills most of them leaving Thilavar and three others and escaping to Peshawar in a Bus. He reaches to Hospital where he comes to know by Khayamat Raju that a girl kidnapped Sreenidhi and gave her address to meet her. He goes to the address and frees Sreenidhi. He then ties up the kidnapper with a rope only to know that she is Dr. Alam Siddiqui's daughter Zara whose ambition is to hand over the treasure of Kanishka to Pakistan Government as per her father's wish. Now, Gautham Kumar, Zara and Sreenidhi come to know that the Box containing the Map is in Sultan's house where Gautham goes along with Zara. There Gautham Kumar breaks the Power supply, kills a [[Jihadi]] and wears his dress and finds the Box.  However, the power is on now and Thilavar takes him to the living room where Sultan and his men are waiting. They dress him with a bomb with a piston to activate it. They remove his mask and find out that it was Gautham Kumar only to be threatened by him to leave him or else all would be destroyed along with the Box. He reaches out, ties the piston with a wire, carefully removes the bomb from his back with the help of Zara and both escape from there with the Box. They use the Garuda Locket and take the map which indicates a place near Hinglaj Mata Temple. The trio reaches there and according to the map there were 5 wheels to be arranged in a particular order. After arranging them correctly, the water in the well goes down with a spiral staircase leading to a huge old door. Sultan arrives at the spot and to save themselves, Gautham Kumar throws the map in the abyss thus making the trio the only source to reach the place. Gautham removes a metal flower from one of the wheels and all go into the door with some of them dying to fall into the abyss.  They reach an old bridge which starts breaking while all are in a midway. The bridge breaks into nearly 3 parts, one on which the terrorists are there, one on which Gautham is there and the last on which Zara, Sreenidhi and Sultan are there. To sustain on the bridge, Sultan kicks Zara into the abyss with the flow of water and she is pronounced dead. Gautham connects the two bridges with the help of a rope and all of them including Sreenidhi and Sultan enter the next phase. The next phase is the way to the inlet where the Bird used to be there. Using two metal flower arrangements, a way is made due to movements of levers and wheels and all go to the inlet. Gautham Kumar keeps the Bird there and a circular door with a small hole appears. The metal flower of the previous wheel is arranged there as a key and all of the theme enter the next phase walking through a deep tunnel behind the circular door. They enter another room with a drum surrounded by nearly hundreds of metal chains surrounded in a circular curtain fashion with sharp metal weapons and they start rotating round as they are sound-sensitive. Gautham after severe struggle enters the middle chain, removes the [[Trident]] lock making a metal ball fall on the drum. Due to opposite vibrations, the chains restore their position. They enter the last phase by a circular staircase.  Gautham, Sreenidhi, Sultan, Thilavar and terrorists less than 10 enter a room with a door away from their position nearly a 10 meters. The tiles are arranged with a Landmine system where some creatures are painted. If one would stand in the wrong place they would be killed by the sharp arrows projected from the mouths of sculptures on both the walls. Gautham arranges the trident in a platform due to which the land mine system is deactivated and the mouths of the sculptures are sealed by metal plates. Everyone go toward the room and a fight starts between the terrorists and Gautham. While most of the terrorists die one accidentally kicks the trident once again reverting the changes. Thilavar and Gautham are on the sculptures and at the right time, Gautham attacks Thilavar with a war equipment thus deviating him from the place and resulting in his death due to the arrows. Gautham then risks reaching Sultan who threatens to kill Sreenidhi and attacks him. By the time Sultan raises a sword on Gautham, Zara shoot's Sultan with a Gun and re-arranges the trident. She tells later that she fell in a place where there were no rocks and reached the other shore of the flow and reached the chamber through another stairway. The trio rejoices as they see the treasure in front of them. Gautham becomes the proud owner of 900 Diamonds of his grandfather and Zara fulfills Siddiqui's last wish by handing over the entire wealth to Pakistan Government after Gautham refuses to take any one single coin of it as it belongs not to him but to the Government of Pakistan.

Sarah Prefers to Run
 After performing well on her school's track team, Sarah (Sophie Desmarais) is encouraged to go to [[McGill University]] to train. When she brings up the idea to her mom, she tells Sarah they don't have the money to help her move. Sarah talks with her co-worker Antoine (Jean-Sébastien Courchesne) about wanting to go to Montreal, who is looking for a change of scenery. The both of them decide to move to Montreal and live together as roommates, with Antoine footing the bill for their move and helping her financially with the apartment. On their way to [[Montreal]], Antoine suggests that they marry in order to obtain financing available to young couples in university. Sarah shrugs him off initially, but eventually agrees to the idea, and the two of them get married.  Once at school, Sarah quickly becomes overwhelmed with the financial responsibilities of being enrolled in the running program. She meets a fellow runner named Isabelle and befriends her.   At a student party, while watching Isabelle singing karaoke, Sarah begins to feel her heart speed up. She is taken to the hospital by Antoine, where she learns that she has a heart condition that could prevent her from running. The doctor refers her to a cardiologist. During the cardiology appointment, she is told to wear a device that measures her heart rate and keep a journal of her physical activity.  On one of Sarah's nights off, she and Antoine hang out together at home. Over dinner, Antoine kisses her, and the two have sex. The following day, Sarah tells him that sleeping with him was a one time thing. Antoine later gets drunk and confesses that he loves Sarah despite not really knowing why, and asks for a divorce. He decides to move back to Quebec City, but tells Sarah that he will continue paying for their apartment for a few months until she can land on her feet.  Before a track meet, Sarah stands in the bathroom, looking at the heart monitoring equipment she is wearing. She decides to take it off and to continue running anyway.  
The Saratov Approach
 Elder Travis Robert Tuttle ([[Corbin Allred]]), an LDS missionary, finishes saying a prayer. He is with his companion, Elder Andrew Lee Propst (Maclain Nelson), being held hostage by kidnappers in Saratov, Russia. The two begin to make a plan to subdue one of their captors to try to escape.  One week earlier, in March 1998, the two missionaries are approached by a man named Nikolai (Nikita Bogolyubov), who asks them to teach him and one of his friends. They enthusiastically agree, take down his address, and plan a day to come by. That night, Propst celebrates having completed first full year on his mission, with one to go.  The next day, the missionaries go to Nikolai's apartment to teach. Propst realizes they forgot a copy of the Book of Mormon to give to Nikolai, but Tuttle convinces him to go and try to teach him anyway. The two arrive at Nikolai's apartment room. When Nikolai lets them in, Nikolai and another man, Sergei (Alex Veadov) beat them into submission and tie them up. Tuttle is frightened and emotional and tries to convince Sergei to release them, but Sergei gags the elders and he and Nikolai take them to their car and drive to a secret hideout.  Propst tries to calm a traumatized Tuttle while in the back of the car. The two are photographed while blindfolded with Sergei holding a gun to their head so they can send it to the United States to demand a ransom. After Tuttle and Propst are handcuffed to pipes in the room, their parents are notified by the church of their kidnapping. U.S. government officials refuse to pay Sergei's demanded ransom of $300,000. Propst's father receives a call from Senator Gordon H. Smith, who informs him that although he isn't working with the FBI or any other agency, he "is doing everything he can," frustrating Propst's father.  On the second day of their captivity, Propst wakes to Tuttle reciting sentences that usually are for teaching investigators. When Propst questions him about this, he replies that he plans on teaching someone every day. Sergei is gone during the daytime, but Nikolai remains in the house to guard them, usually watching television. He is more compassionate around the elders, even being convinced by Propst to let them be moved from the uncomfortable pipes to the mattress in the room. Afterwards, Tuttle confesses to Propst that he originally decided to go on a mission only to make his father happy, but after learning of how [[Christ]] willingly suffered and was crucified despite his own desires, he was glad he went.   When Sergei returns, he yells at Nikolai for moving the elders and then tells the two that he is not a patient man, and is frustrated that the ransom hasn't been paid. The elders realize that the ransom will not be paid, since it would encourage other criminals to start kidnapping many other missionaries for easy money. On the third day, Propst asks Nikolai about a tattoo that Sergei has on his hand. Nikolai reveals Sergei used to be a Russian Navy hero many years earlier.  Back in the U.S., the news of the kidnappings have spread throughout the country and the world, and the church and many other religions start praying for and honoring the two hostages. The Tuttles receive a call from Mark Larsen, a former missionary, who reveals he was also kidnapped as a missionary in Argentina years earlier. He explains that over the course of time, the elders will have more hope and faith and start to show compassion for their own captors. Sergei returns more frustrated than before, and tells the two elders to write their goodbyes. The Propst family receives a letter from the elders stating that they should not pay the ransom. An anonymous donor gives the Propst family a check for the random amount demanded, and they are conflicted on whether to pay or not.  On the fourth day, Propst manages to secretly unlock his handcuffs without Nikolai knowing. Tuttle and Propst devise a plan to overpower their captors and escape, bringing the movie back to the beginning scene. The two pray and prepare to execute their plan, but before Propst can do his part, he considers his role as a missionary and has compassion for Nikolai and Sergei, just as Larsen had related. He then tells Tuttle that they shouldn't try to fight their way out of captivity, and that God has already prepared a plan for them. The two elders put back together their cuffs and remain in the room.  On the fifth day, which falls on a Sunday, Sergei tells them their time is up and prepares to take Tuttle and Propst out of the building. Before doing so, Nikolai confides in the elders. He confesses his guilt for kidnapping them and tells them that the only reason he helped Sergei do it was because his girlfriend was pregnant and he didn't have enough money for a family. Sergei had convinced him to make easy money by joining him in kidnapping "rich Christians," but he had never intended for things to lead to their deaths. He also lets them know that the tattoo on Sergei's hand means "forever loyal."  Sergei blindfolds the two elders, who are calm no matter what the outcome will be, and drives them to a desolate and snowy field. As he prepares to kill them, he notices that the missionaries have drawn similar markings on their hands as his tattoo, giving him pause. He deserts the elders with Nikolai. Tuttle and Propst run away, finding a road and catching a ride to Saratov, overjoyed for their freedom. They arrive in Saratov in the middle of a church meeting, and have emotional reunions with their fellow members. Their families are informed that they have been freed, and that Nikolai and Sergei have been captured by Russian officials. Propst and Tuttle speak over the phone to their families, and then walk out of their church building at the end of the meeting. On-screen dialog informs that the elders decided to finish their missions and were sent to other undisclosed missions in Europe to do so.  
Sanitarium (film)
 The film is divided into three short stories [[Frame story|framed]] by Dr. Henry Stenson, a psychologist who is treating three patients with unique disorders. Each one is preceded and succeeded by Stenson giving a monologue about his interpretation, except for the last patient, whom he interviews directly. The second patient's story is additionally framed by a psychology student about to write a thesis by reading the patient's file.  === ''Figuratively Speaking'' === Gustav, an aged, disheveled doll artist, works for his old friend, Sam, who helps showcase his creations. He is assisted by the young Mateo, whom he is unaware has been drugging his alcohol with a [[psychoactive drug]] which soon drives Gustav into believing that his creations can talk. He is especially obsessed with a female doll whom he named Madeline, who talks him into killing Sam, his assistant, and also Mateo's lover, Isabelle. After Mateo discloses what he had done, Gustav commits suicide, but not before saying that Mateo can now own his creations. The segment is closed with the deranged Mateo opening a box containing Gustav's creations, as Stenson wonders which one is controlling which.  === ''Monsters are Real'' === A young boy, Steven, who has [[catatonic schizophrenia]], lives with his abusive father, who forces him to do household chores while he goes to a stripper club everyday. Steven feels stalked by a man clad in black with a black fedora. One day, while having his attention at a friend's pornographic magazine, the man stops him from leaving, revealing his monstrous face, but he suddenly disappears when Steven's teacher, the kind Ms. Lorne arrives and holds Steven responsible for the magazine. Suspecting that his father is abusive after seeing him rudely fetching Steven home while refusing to explain his neck bruise (actually caused by the monstrous man), she trails them. Before Steven is abused, the man manifests and stuffs him into a burlap sack before killing Steven's father. He also kills Ms. Lorne when she comes in, leaving Steven unresponsive by the time the police arrive. Dr. Stenson narrates the events afterward: Steven was transferred to the sanitarium where he remains a catatonic and hallucinating of the monstrous man well into his adulthood, yet he sometimes can see him smiling while looking at the sky.  === ''Up to the Last Man'' === Presented in an [[anachronistic]] order, the segment tells the story of a college professor called James Silo, who is also an avid conspiracy theorist of [[2012 phenomenon|the 2012 doomsday event]]. He believes that on 21 December 2012, the planet [[Nibiru cataclysm|Nibiru]] would collide with the Earth and to protect himself and his family, he built a bunker underground, containing a small bedroom and working room, [[Hydroponics|hydroponic]] culture to sustain food, and a heater. Throughout the segment, it became apparent that James' obsession had distanced himself from reality; his students began to leave his class until no one was left, dismissing him from his university. He ignored his wife, Allison, and sons Caleb and Kyle and spent his savings to build the bunker. Eventually, Allison decided to call the staff from the sanitarium to confine James, yet he managed to escape and began to live in the bunker for over 640 days, believing that he is the last man left and that his family are dead. What James does not learn until the end, however, is that he is the one who killed them after escaping from the sanitarium. In grief, James swallows a pill and opens the bunker to find Allison framed by a white light. She catches him when he falls, caresses him, and says that everything is alright. The segment is closed with the scene before James escaped from the sanitarium. While being interviewed by Dr. Stenson, he states his belief that everything is an illusion and that "they" are laughing at him.  A [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]] shows Stenson discovering James having escaped the sanitarium and left his doomsday timer under the pillow, followed by the first scene of the segment: James waking up to his 640th day in the bunker.  
Samhita (film)
 Revati Sathe is a [[National Film Awards|National Award]] winning documentary maker who is approached by producer Shirin Dastane to direct a film based on a short story ''Darpan&nbsp;– The Mirror'' written by Tara Deuskar. It was Shirin's husband Dinkar's wish to direct a film on this story but being paralysed since a decade is unable to fulfill his dream. Shirin narrates the story in short to Revati stating that it is a story of a woman's surrender. The story is of king Satyasheel whose step-mother puts him in a wedlock with her niece Maalvika. The king however finds his love in a court singer whose reflection is formed in his soul's mirror and she surrenders to the king in love. Revati accepts the project as a challenge from her routine documentary making and sets to write the script with help of the original writer. Deuskar, the original writer contradicts with Shirin and calls it a story of oppression and begins narration. ''Darpan'' starts in 1946 at the palace of the princely state of Herwad where on the occasion of Satyasheel's son's [[thread ceremony]] singer Raina-bi from [[Banaras]] arrives and presents her singer daughter Bhairavi. Impressed by Bhairavi's soulful singing, Satyasheel falls in love with her. While Maalvika is a feminist and avid reader of English literature, she cares nothing about the increasing closeness of the two. On one occasion, Satyasheel takes Bhairavi on a hunting trip and they spend night together while Maalvika is on Europe trip. The following day Satyasheel also leaves for Europe and Bhairavi assuming it as desertion and leaves to Banaras. Upon return, Satyasheel is heart-broken and loses interest in administration. Years later, he attends a meeting in Bombay related to the [[Privy Purse in India|privy purse privileges]] and accidentally meets Bhairavi and brings her to the palace along with her 7-years old daughter Nisha who has a birthmark on her face just like that of Satyasheel.  In present day, Revati is struggling with a divorce from her husband as she wants to pursue her career, Hemangini is finding it hard to adjust with the daughter of her lover and Shirin lives with a sorrow of not having her own kids for keeping her promise to Dinkar's family after he took her as his wife in his second marriage. All the four ladies, Revati, Hemangini, Shirin, and Deuskar have different endings of the film in their mind. While Shirin's end involves separation of all three characters, Hemangini believes that they all would stay together. Revati brings in different end suggesting that Satyasheel stays with Bhairavi and queen Maalvika on the other hand takes the young Nisha to Europe and looks after her well being. It is hinted that author Deuskar is Nisha, the real life  daughter of Satysheel and Bhairavi. The film ends with Hemangini settling her issues with her lover's daughter, Dinkar dying, and Revati deciding to not divorce Ranveer.  
Saving General Yang
 The film is set in the early Northern Song dynasty, AD 986, of northeastern China. Former [[Northern Han]] general and the patriarch of the Yang clan Yang Ye pledges allegiance to the new Han Chinese-ruled Song regime after Northern Han's fall. Years later Yang's seventh son, Yang Yansi, participated in a martial arts tournament with his father's rival Pan Renmei's son Pan Bao in his sixth brother Yang Yanzhao's place to win [[Later Zhou]]'s former princess Chai Meirong's (who is Yang Yanzhao's childhood sweetheart) hand in marriage, which ended in the latter's death. The following morning Yang and Pan meet with the emperor about the issue; Yang executes 30 whiplashes to his young sons as punishment. Later, Song's border stations are burned, signaling an invasion from the Khitan-ruled Liao regime.  The Khitan army hopes to take its revenge on the Yang Clan and their followers for a past defeat that killed a Khitan general ten years previously. It was noted that the leader of the invading Khitan army is Yelü Yuan, son of the deceased Khitan general. Due to politics and Pan Bao's death, Pan Renmei is awarded with 50,000 troops to repel the Khitan army. As punishment, Gen. Yang is given a lesser task--to lead the charge and be the scout. When the two armies meet, Pan Renmei's lack of experience and inept leadership causes chaos among the Song army, and the Khitan forces emerge with a decisive victory. All the while Gen. Yang is trapped behind enemy lines in an abandoned town in front of Wolf Mountain. The Khitan army surrounds the town, allowing no one to leave. Pan, however, refuses to send troops to rescue Yang as revenge. This leaves Yang Ye's wife, She Saihua, devastated as she sends her seven sons to rescue him. It is later revealed that this is exactly what Yelü Yuan wanted, and the sons fall into his deadly trap.  Led by the eldest son, Yang Yanping, the seven brothers--including the two youngest, who unlike their brothers have never seen combat--set out with a small band of Yang Clan's elite soldiers to fight through an army of thousands to reach to the Wolf Mountain. When they finally arrive in the town, the Khitan army starts bombarding it with catapults and unleashes a fierce attack. The seven escape with their father, but are the only ones of the clan to survive; all the soldiers with them are killed. In the escape the father is wounded with a poisoned arrow. and he ultimately kills himself. The sons decide to bring their father's body home for a proper burial and to allow their mother to see her beloved husband one last time.  Before sending off the seven sons, She Saihua visits a fortune teller, who gives her a slip of paper saying: "Seven will set off, six will return". By the end of the film, Yang Yansi dies after Pan's archers fill him full of arrows under his orders after he escaped from Wolf Mountain, and Yelü Yuan personally hunts Yang Ye's surviving sons and kills five of them. However, Yang Yanzhao alone defeats and kills Yelü in combat, seemingly proving the prediction wrong. It turns out, though, that the message was correct; what it actually meant was that Yang Yanzhao, who was son #6, was the one who would return and have a greater destiny than his siblings. He returned with his father's body, the brothers' weapons and Yelü Yuan's severed head. Although four of Yang Ye's sons' bodies were recovered, two had never been found. After his father's and brothers' funerals, Yang Yanzhao marries Chai Meirong. His victory over Yelü Yuan redeemed his father's failure to stop the Khitan army, and the [[Empress Xiao Yanyan|Khitan empress]] had to halt her assault on the Song empire due to the loss of her general. Because of the sons' courageous actions, Yang Yanzhao rises to his late father's position as general and the Yang Clan developed a legendary reputation in China.  
Saving Lincoln
 Director [[Salvador Litvak]] and his writing partner, Nina Davidovich Litvak, based their screenplay on their extensive research into Lincoln's friendship with Lamon. ''Saving Lincoln'' charts their relationship from their initial meeting to Lincoln's Presidency. Lamon was a tall, boisterous Southerner who liked to drink whiskey, tell jokes and stories, play the banjo, and wrestle. Despite some pronounced differences between the two men, they shared a fondness for telling jokes and stories, and both felt slavery should be eliminated. Lamon often served as Lincoln's private confidant.  The movie jumps from their initial meeting to Lincoln's presidency and the repeated attempts that were made on his life. Many well-known incidents are recounted, including the plot to kill Lincoln in Maryland, while he was traveling to Washington, D.C. after his first election&nbsp;– Lamon worked with [[Allan Pinkerton]], who founded the famous Pinkerton Detective Agency, to thwart that plan. Other events include the time a bullet went through Lincoln's hat while he was riding his horse late one evening&nbsp;– he blamed it on a hunter firing an errant shot, but Lamon saw it as a sign that Lincoln was in mortal danger and needed even tighter security. Lamon was said to sometimes sleep by Lincoln's bedroom door, a striking image that appears in the film.  Themes in the story involve Lincoln's anguish over Civil War casualties, his conflicts with members of his cabinet, and the death of the Lincolns' son Willie, which drove Mary Todd Lincoln to the depths of despair. Such situations complicate Lamon's efforts to keep Lincoln safe.  
Saving Mr. Banks
  In 1961, the financially strapped author [[P. L. Travers|Pamela "P. L." Travers]] reluctantly travels from her home in [[London]] to [[Los Angeles]] to work with [[Walt Disney]] at the urging of her agent, Diarmuid Russell. Disney has pursued the [[film rights]] to her ''[[Mary Poppins]]'' stories for twenty years, having promised his daughters that he would produce a film based on them. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts because she fears what he would do to [[Mary Poppins (character)|her character]]. However, she has not written anything in a while and her book royalties have dwindled to nothing, so she risks losing her house. Still, Russell has to remind her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations—no animation and unprecedented script approval—before she agrees to go.  Travers' difficult childhood in [[Allora, Queensland]], [[Australia]], is depicted through flashbacks, and is the inspiration for much of Mary Poppins. Travers idolized her loving, imaginative father, Travers Robert Goff, but his chronic [[alcoholism]] resulted in his repeated firings, strained her parents' marriage, and caused her distressed mother to attempt [[suicide]]. Goff died at an early age from [[tuberculosis]] when Travers was seven years old.  In Los Angeles, Travers is irritated by what she perceives as the city's unreality and the inhabitants' intrusive friendliness, personified by her limousine driver, Ralph. At the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], Travers meets the creative team that are developing ''Mary Poppins'' for the screen: [[screenwriter]] [[Don DaGradi]], and music composers [[Richard M. Sherman|Richard]] and [[Robert B. Sherman|Robert Sherman]]. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view she also holds of the jocular Disney.  Travers' working relationship with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, given the nature of the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the estranged father of the children in Mary Poppins' charge, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, they grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to her and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.  The team realize Travers has valid criticisms and make changes, though she becomes increasingly disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking to understand what troubles her, Disney invites Travers to [[Disneyland]], which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character, and the addition of [[Let's Go Fly a Kite|a new song]] and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins working with the team; however, when Travers discovers that there is to be an animation sequence, she confronts Disney over his broken promise and returns home.  Disney learns that Travers is actually her [[pen name]], taken from her father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff, and she's actually Australian, not British. This gives Disney new insight into Travers, and he follows her to London. Arriving unexpectedly at her door, Disney tells her that he also had a less-than-ideal childhood, but stresses the healing value of his art. He urges Travers to not let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. Travers relents and grants Disney the film rights.  Three years later, in 1964, ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' is to have its world premiere at [[TCL Chinese Theatre|Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in [[Hollywood]]. Disney has not invited Travers, fearing how she might react with the press watching. Prompted by Russell, Travers shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches ''Mary Poppins'' with a lack of enthusiasm, particularly during the animated sequences. She gradually warms to the rest of the film, however, becoming deeply moved by the depiction of George Banks' personal crisis and redemption.

Several months later, Ja'Marcus ([[Snoop Dogg]]) and D'Andre ([[Mac Miller]]) are walking in the [[Humboldt County, California|Humboldt County]] woods in California in search of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] plants to steal. After stealing one and fleeing, they take shelter in a [[The Cabin in the Woods|cabin in the woods]]. Upon entering they see three strange creatures, later confirmed to be Sheen's children, and turn them in for the reward. The feral children are placed in isolation at a child development research center for a few months until they are deemed well enough to be returned to familial custody. When Sheen's brother, Dan Sanders ([[Simon Rex]]) and his wife Jody ([[Ashley Tisdale]]) come to collect them, they are told they can have them if they agree to stay in a large suburban middle-class home fitted with security cameras. Jody is reluctant to take the kids at first but soon adjusts to having them. In an attempt to bond with their new children, Jody auditions for a ballet performance, [[Swan Lake]], and is cast in the lead role as the [[Black Swan (film)|Swan Queen]].  Meanwhile, a continuing pattern of bizarre [[Paranormal Activity (film series)|paranormal activity]] in their new home makes them investigate further. They eventually learn from the children that the attacks on their home are by "[[Mama (2013 film)|Mama]]", the mother of the children, who is under a curse and is trying to get them back so she can sacrifice both herself and the children. Maria, the couple's Hispanic live-in maid, is frightened and keeps experimenting with various rituals, Catholic and otherwise, to ward off the evil spirits in the house.  During the day, Dan is frustrated with the modest progress of his test subjects at a primate intelligence research facility; ironically, Dan is not bright enough to realize that one of the chimpanzees, [[List of Planet of the Apes characters#Caesar|Caesar]], is now actually much smarter than he is.  Jody and Dan, with the help of Jody's close friend Kendra Brooks ([[Erica Ash]]), who Jody met at her ballet class, must quickly find a way to lift the curse and save their family. Along the way, they seek the assistance of psychic [[Insidious (film)|Blaine Fulda]], who turns out to be a complete fraud, and a dream extractor named [[Inception|Dom Kolb]] ([[Ben Cornish]]), who helps them understand that the solution to their problems lies in the mysterious [[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Book of the Evil]]. However, Jody and Kendra fail to see what the book is capable of, oblivious to four friends continuously becoming possessed and reviving in the cabin. They wreak havoc when either of the two read the two passages of the book; one that unleashes demons, [[Klaatu barada nikto|"gort klaatu barada nikto"]], and the other that revives them from possession. When "Mama" takes the children to a cliff to sacrifice them, Jody fails to lift the curse with the book, but does manage to knock the evil spirit into Ja'Marcus and D'Andre's pool containing a live shark, which then devours her.  Realizing the love for her adopted children is all she needs in life, Jody gives the part of the Swan Queen to Kendra, who performs the dance in the style of a [[stripper]]. The performance is heavily applauded by an audience that includes Jody, Dan, the children, and [[Mabel Simmons|Madea]]. The story's narrator is revealed to be Caesar, who then informs the audience that the humans should enjoy the time they have on earth and says that [[Rise of the Planet of the Apes|apes will one day take over the world]].  In a [[post-credits scene]], Sheen wakes up, with Dom Kolb sitting beside him, from a dream extraction, i.e. the whole movie was a dream. After Kolb informs that Sheen will be sleeping with Lohan, a car crashes into the room, killing Sheen.  Lohan is revealed as the driver; she gets out of the car, says to Kolb "You were driving" and throws him the keys, blaming the accident on him.

Scooby-Doo! Mask of the Blue Falcon
 Scooby and Shaggy take the gang to a [[comic book convention]] called the "Mega Mondo Pop! Comic ConApalooza" (featuring people dressing up as many [[Hanna-Barbera]] characters) to enter a costume contest as their favorite comic book superheroes, Blue Falcon and [[Dynomutt, Dog Wonder]]. Fred is eager to see the new and darker Blue Falcon film, produced by Jennifer Severin, starring Brad Adams as the new Blue Falcon. At the convention center, they meet Hank Prince, the owner of a comic book store Shaggy visits regularly, and his nephew, Austin. They also find the actor of the original Blue Falcon show, Owen Garrison. They eagerly approach Garrison to get his autograph, but instead they listen to their favorite celebrity ranting about how the studio is planning to remove all the original Blue Falcon shows for the upcoming new Blue Falcon movie.  Later, the gang watches the [[trailer (promotion)|trailer]] of the upcoming Blue Falcon movie. During the screening, a monster (who Shaggy and Scooby identify as [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Mr. Hyde]], a villain from the original Blue Falcon television show) appears and unleashes a swarm of [[bat]]s which terrorize the public. The gang offers to help investigate the situation.  The next day, the gang returns to the convention to wait for another Mr. Hyde attack. The gang meets Jack Rabble, a former battle bots champion who makes a living signing autographs. Fred, Daphne, and Velma suspects Garrison is to blame, but Shaggy and Scooby refuse to believe their idol is the culprit. They then show the gang there are other suspects through surveillance footage taken around the convention. They first show the others a recording of Severin boasting how the Mr. Hyde incident has been increasing publicity for the Blue Falcon movie. The second footage has Adams talking about how he dislikes his role as the new Blue Falcon and hopes that Mr. Hyde will draw the public’s attention away from him giving him a chance to quit.   They also found out from Austin that the Mr. Hyde attacks are based on original Blue Falcon episodes and that Mr. Hyde uses green ooze that turns people into monsters in his next appearance.  Meanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy flee into the storage rooms where they find Mr. Hyde’s secret lair. Mr. Hyde chases them onto a big [[Frankenstein Jr. and The Impossibles|Frankenstein Jr.]] balloon, which he uses to fly across San De Pedro. Mr. Hyde unleashes his green ooze on the entire town and at city hall, oozing Scooby, Shaggy, and the mayor. Angered and humiliated by this assault, the mayor fires the gang.  Later on, the gang watch a news report and learn that the premiere of the new Blue Falcon movie will now be held at the baseball stadium. The gang heads back to the convention center, and Austin manages to acquire entry for them. With Jack Rabble’s help, Fred, Velma and Daphne find Mr. Hyde’s hideout and discover that Mr. Hyde has surveillance cameras of the whole convention center and the baseball stadium. From there, they see a giant Mr. Hyde rampaging in the stadium.  Meanwhile, as they seek something to eat, Scooby and Shaggy see people fleeing away from the stadium, causing them to run into the stadium and find the giant Mr. Hyde chasing Austin. Scooby regains his superhero mentality and rushes to confront Mr. Hyde. Scooby and Shaggy manage to rescue Austin, but they are booted into the air by the giant Mr. Hyde. Fred, Velma and Daphne arrive and manage to bring down the giant Hyde. They find Garrison in the giant robot, suggesting that he was Mr. Hyde all along. However Garrison claims that someone knocked him out and placed him inside the robot.  Scooby and Shaggy witness the real Mr. Hyde stealing an armored vehicle. Scooby pursues Mr. Hyde and causes the vehicle to crash into the giant Mr. Hyde robot. Mr. Hyde then unleashes his Hideous Hyde Hound on Scooby. Garrison, while wearing the original Blue Falcon uniform, saves Scooby, destroys the Hideous Hyde Hound using the Falcon Car, and stops Mr. Hyde from escaping.   The gang unmasks the real Mr. Hyde, who turns out to be Jack Rabble. Rabble explained that he was in a RC combat league but was kicked out when one of his robots went haywire and destroyed the arena. It was during his autograph career when he devised a plan of revenge. He built the Mr. Hyde robot to attack the convention to force the movie premiere into the stadium. He then put Garrison's knocked out body in the giant Hyde robot to frame him in the stadium attack. The attack would then also force a detour for the armored truck he was targeting for it was carrying more than $5,000,000 from the entrance fees for the convention.   Impressed by the action following Jack Rabble's arrest, Severin makes a sequel to the new Blue Falcon film with Garrison as the original Blue Falcon (and the father/mentor of the new one) and Scooby-Doo as Dynomutt.

Upon arrival, they learn that the opera house which the show will be held in is being terrorized by a [[Erik (The Phantom of the Opera)|Phantom]], who is intensely lauding one of the finalists to win, Christine, a spoiled girl whose noisy parents are no more polite than her. Fred and Daphne also befriend one of the finalists, Emma Gale, a violinist. Not to be left out, Scooby and Shaggy decide to show Pimiento a juggling act, which they are betting will take the contest by storm. However, after Pimiento states his belief that ‘juggling stinks,' throughout the film, the two continually approach Pimiento and show him numerous terrible impromptu acts.  Not long after checking in for the talent show, the Phantom appears in the opera house and Fred, Daphne and Velma attempt to catch him using the surveillance cameras, but are unsuccessful due to the Phantom’s ability to seemingly appear in multiple places at once. While being chased briefly by the Phantom, Shaggy and Scooby notice the Phantom had a strange lemon scent and afterwards, the gang split up to search for clues. Fred and Daphne meet the owner of the opera house, Mel Richmond. They learn from Richmond that a Phantom once terrorized the opera house thirty-five years ago when it was a disco.  The dress rehearsal commences the next day. Fred and Daphne meet Emma’s parents, who are hoping to get the prize money to save their home from bankruptcy. During the dress rehearsal, the Phantom sabotages most of the finalists’ acts,  leaving Christine, Emma, and Fred and Daphne as the only contestants left. Due to these attacks, Fred and Daphne decide to use themselves as bait to lure the Phantom out. The gang manage to track down a Phantom, only to find it is the original Phantom from the 70’s, a man named Steve Trilby. Steve admits to the gang that he vandalized the opera house during the 70’s, due to his hatred over disco music, but that now he only goes into the opera house to get food. The gang return to the stage to find the Phantom setting fire to the opera house. With the help of Steve, they catch the Phantom, who is revealed to be Mel Richmond. However, the gang learn that Richmond isn't the Phantom they are after when they hear the Phantom threatening to destroy the place unless Christine wins.  Later that night, using Emma as bait, the gang manage to capture the Phantom, who turns out to be Christine’s father, Lance. Afterwards, however, Shaggy and Scooby find out that Ottoman is also the Phantom, when they see him putting on lemon-scented hand sanitizer. They rush to Ottoman’s office and find a magazine about the Soap Diamond, which is on display at a mineralogical center nearby. They quickly realize Ottoman ordered all the police to patrol the opera house so that the mineralogical center would be unguarded. They rush to the mineralogical center and find Ottoman running out of the building. Ottoman trips and drops the Soap Diamond, which Scooby catches. Ottoman pursues the gang toward a drawbridge, where Fred tricks him into jumping into a barge filled with garbage, by replacing the diamond with a dog bone. Ottoman is arrested and the gang goes back to the opera house, after being informed that Fred and Daphne are doing a tie-breaking performance against Emma.  The gang arrives back in time for Fred and Daphne to do their tie-breaker performance. The performance takes them in the lead of the voting chart, however, when they realize what it would mean if Emma lost, they decide to tell some of Shaggy and Scooby’s cheesy jokes, which enables them to lose enough votes, allowing Emma to win. At the end of the show, Velma plays the footage which shows Pimiento putting on the Phantom costume. Pimiento admits that he used the Phantom to boost the show’s ratings. After Pimento is taken away, Steve wraps up the show. 
Scooby-Doo! Mecha Mutt Menace
 Fred has entered the Science Expo in Houston, Texas with a monster trapping project involving magnets, a trampoline, and a sticky net. A girl accidentally gets caught in the trap but is quickly freed by Fred. She catches Fred's eye (much to Daphne's dismay) and identifies herself as Melanie Staples, daughter of NASA Scientist Ned Staples. The gang checks out her father's demonstration where he unveils a large robotic dog, "Mecha Mutt", equipped to travel over Mars terrain.   Suddenly, Mecha Mutt goes rogue and starts firing lasers out at the audience. Security goes after the robot leaving a perplexed Dr. Staples to face anxious reporters who blame the malfunction on the "Space Specter". Melanie explains to the gang that the Space Specter is an old legend about a ship that lost control while piloting through some space mist. A spirit attached itself to the ship when it landed on Earth and now anytime something goes wrong at NASA, they blame the supposed specter. The group splits up to talk to the other two people who worked on Mecha Mutt besides Melanie's father.  Fred, Daphne, and Melanie talk to Lab Assistant Irv, who has a desk covered in food wrappers and sticky hands. Irv claims to have no idea why the machine went crazy having done a diagnostic test on it just before the demonstration. He laments being too busy to date before the trio take leave. Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby encounter a large mechanical dog on their way to Dr. Devon Albright's office. They find out Dr. Albright was the original creator of the Mecha Mutt technology and she's bitter that the more famous Dr. Staples was put onto her project to raise more funds.   Shaggy and Scooby go off and find vacuum sealed space food in a different room ‒ as well as Mecha Mutt. They're chased into a large wind tunnel room and get trapped inside before the industrial fan blows them all up. Velma, Fred, and Daphne find them and turn off the fan but not before Mecha Mutt escapes. Melanie soon joins them and Velma discovers the controls to the wind tunnel are sticky. When they confront Irv, he denies leaving the room and security footage backs up his claim. Velma and the others ask Dr Albright to lend them her prototype dog rover to find Mecha Mutt and Scooby and Shaggy get roped into piloting the dog rover.  On the rooftop, it's robot dog versus robot dog when Shaggy and Scooby find Mecha Mutt. After a fight with missiles and rocket boosters, the two machines crash into a magnet-wielding crane and Mecha Mutt is destroyed. Velma identifies Melanie as the culprit behind Mecha Mutt's rampage. Melanie admits that she did it because her famous father always neglected her and she wanted to step out of his shadow to prove she was just as brilliant as him. In the end, Fred wins second place in the Science Expo and Shaggy and Scooby end up finding more than just astronaut food when they end up accidentally launched into outer space.

Scorpion in Love
   
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013 film)
  Walter Mitty is a [[Negative (photography)|negative assets]] manager at [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]] who daydreams of adventures and has a crush on a coworker named Cheryl. Mitty works with photojournalist Sean O'Connell, whose images are highly regarded. O'Connell has sent Mitty his latest negatives and a wallet as a gift in appreciation of Mitty's work. O'Connell believes  negative #25 captures the "quintessence of life" and that it should be used for the cover of the [[Life (magazine)#As a monthly (1978–2000)|magazine's final print issue]] as it converts to online status. The negative is missing, however, and Walter is forced to stall for time with corporate transition manager Ted Hendricks, who is handling the downsizing. While viewing the other negatives outside ''Life'' offices, Cheryl approaches Mitty and suggests that he think of the negatives as clues to Sean's location. They look at three of them, including one of a person's thumb with a unique ring on it, and another of a curved piece of wood. A third picture of a boat leads Mitty to determine that O'Connell is in Greenland. Mitty promptly flies there to find him.  A bartender in [[Nuuk]] explains that O'Connell left on a ship. To find him, Mitty would need to go on the postal helicopter, and the pilot is drunk. Mitty recognizes the pilot's thumb with the unique ring and realizes he is on the right track. He at first declines to fly with the intoxicated pilot, but imagines Cheryl singing "[[Space Oddity]]", gains a new confidence and boards the helicopter. Nearing the ship, Mitty learns the helicopter cannot land upon it. Misunderstanding the pilot, instead of jumping into a dinghy boat nearing to catch him, Mitty aims for the main vessel and misses and falls in the ocean. He splashes down into ice-cold, shark-infested waters, losing a box of ship-to-shore radio components before being brought aboard.  Mitty learns that O'Connell departed the ship earlier. The crew offers him some [[clementine cake]] O'Connell left behind; Mitty discovers O'Connell's destinations in the wrapping paper. The itinerary directs Mitty to Iceland, where O'Connell is photographing the volcano [[Eyjafjallajökull]], and he arrives at the local village of [[Skógar]] near the volcano using a [[Longboard (skateboard)|longboard]], and notices O'Connell on the plane flying near the volcano. An eruption forces Mitty to flee, and as there is nothing left for him to do, he obeys a text message recalling him to New York.  For failing to recover the negative, his first failure in a long career with the magazine, Mitty is fired by Hendricks. He learns that Cheryl, who was let go earlier, seems to have reconciled with her estranged husband. Mitty returns home discouraged and visits his mother, throwing away the wallet he received from O'Connell. To his surprise, Mitty recognizes the curve of the piano in his mother's house while looking at the last photograph. When asked, Mitty's mom mentions having met O'Connell. She had told Mitty before but he was daydreaming and failed to hear her.  Mitty discovers O'Connell is in the [[Himalayas]], and finds him photographing a rare [[snow leopard]]. When asked about the negative, O'Connell explains that the message on the gift wrapping to "look inside" was literal; the negative was in the wallet. Unfortunately, Mitty had interpreted this message as a direction to look inside the tissue paper in the box containing the wallet, and it could also be interpreted as referring to the inscription stamped into the leather inside the wallet. When pressed to reveal the image on the negative, O'Connell dismisses the question and joins in a high-altitude football (soccer) game with some locals. Mitty flies to [[Los Angeles]] but is detained by airport security during a misunderstanding (mainly stemming from his having traveled through Yemen to Afghanistan). Mitty calls the only person he knows in Los Angeles: Todd Maher, a representative at [[eHarmony]] who has kept in contact during Mitty's adventures.  While helping his mother sell her piano, Mitty recounts his story but mentions he does not have the wallet anymore. His mother says she always keeps his knickknacks and gives him the wallet that she retrieved from the trash. Finding inside the wallet a small manila envelope the size of a single-frame 35mm negative, an emboldened Mitty delivers it to ''Life'' magazine, tells management that it was the photograph O'Connell wanted for the final issue, and berates Hendricks for disrespecting the staff that made the magazine so honored before walking away from the office, humiliating him in front of his recently hired staff.  Mitty reunites with Cheryl, emboldens himself enough to tell her outright that he has been thinking about and inspired by her, and learns that Cheryl's ex-husband was only at her house to repair the refrigerator. Mitty tells Cheryl of his adventures and admits that he still does not know what negative #25 shows. Mitty and Cheryl see the final issue of ''Life'' at a newsstand, with its cover dedicated to the staff. It is accompanied by the photograph from negative #25, showing Mitty sitting outside of the ''Life'' building, examining a [[contact sheet]]. Mitty and Cheryl continue their walk down the street holding hands.

 Rachel, a reporter, is surprised when her roommate, Greg, arrives earlier than expected.  Greg explains that his unsupportive ex-girlfriend has kicked him out, and he needs a place to stay while he works on his thriller screenplay.  Both Greg and Rachel have been drawn to a small town in [[the Berkshires]] that is said to have been plagued with repeated cases of [[ergot poisoning]].  Greg wants to write a story about an insular town with a dark past, and Rachel believes that ergot poisoning can explain the accusations of witchcraft in the [[Salem witch trials]].  However, Rachel's questions upset the townspeople, who are tired of discussions about the town's history.  Encouraged by Greg's faith in her, Rachel continues to dig deeper and ask more questions.  Eventually, she meets Paul, a friendly townsperson who is willing to speak about the town's history, rumors of ergot poisoning, and a vague conspiracy that involves the town's elders.  Paul urges Rachel to be careful, as there are dangerous secrets in the town that people will kill to protect.  Unconvinced, Rachel proceeds with her investigation, only to find Paul dead.  When Greg disappears, Rachel becomes increasingly worried about her own safety.  Her fears are realized when Joe and Jason, local townspeople who have stalked and harassed her, seemingly attempt to kidnap her.  She sees Jason intentionally infect younger townspeople with ergot poisoning, and Jim, a friend of Paul's, shows her evidence that the town keeps these sick people imprisoned as suspected witches.  Jim promises to show her further evidence of coverups and cult activity, and Rachel contacts her editor to receive more time to investigate these claims.  Dubious of her reports, Rachel's editor insists that she stick to the original story and observe the deadline; instead, she works with Jim to expose the cult.  When Greg suddenly reappears, she angrily accuses him of abandoning her and explains the danger that they are in.  Greg attempts to calm her and suggests that they get dinner; Rachel reluctantly agrees.  While she prepares, she sees Greg go through her research and hand it off to Joe.  Hurt by this betrayal, she locks Greg out of the house and asks her skeptical editor to contact the police.  Undeterred, Rachel continues her investigations, and Jim takes her on a tour of the house where the town's cult keeps kidnapped victims of ergot poisoning.  Before she can do anything to help them, she runs into Joe, who chases her down.  Greg helps Joe hold her as Jason injects her with a syringe.  Rachel once again tearfully accuses Greg of betrayal and falls unconscious.  In the next scene, flashbacks reveal that Rachel has been suffering from ergot poisoning: Paul and Jim are hallucinations, Joe and Jason are concerned townspeople who have been trying to help Rachel, and Greg has agreed to take her to a specialist in New York.  On the way to New York, Jim appears to her one last time, asking for her help, but she swallows a pill that causes him to disappear.

Silent Witness (2013 film)
 Tycoon Lin Tai's daughter Lin Mengmeng becomes the murder suspect of her father's fiance Yang Dan. Her defense lawyer Zhou Li and prosecutor Tong Tao gains in-depth understanding through cross examinations in court.  In the first act, when Yang Dan's personal chauffeur, Sun Wei, was examined by Zhou Li, she lured him to confess that he was actually the one that killed Yang Dan. This allegedly happened after Lin Mengmeng had fled the scene after knocking Yang Dan's down with her red Cayenne SUV. Zhou Li got him to confess through  a series of question that got him to also confess his wife was having an affair with Meng Meng's father, Lin Tai. Everything seems logical at that time and the court and media were satisfied that the chauffeur Sun Wei was the killer.  However, Tong Tao, who had been going after Lin Tai ever since he was called to bar as a legal prosecutor, found something to be amiss. He got his staff to verify that Sun Wei was terminally ill with brain cancer and hence surmised that Lin Tai must have bribed Sun Wei and got Zhou Li to lead everyone to believe Sun Wei was the killer.  In the next court session when Lin Tai was examined, Tong Tao and his staff got an anonymous email that claimed that the sender had video evidence of the murder of Yang Dan. The video was sent over just as Tong Tao and his team came into court for the cross examination of Lin Tai. But the video self-deleted, hampering it from being presented in court. Tong Tao immediately asked for a recess on the pretext that he had new evidence to reorganise and present to the court. When the court session resumed, Tong Tao took an aggressive stance to cross examine Lin Tai, and used the infidelity of Yang Dan to spite Lin Tai, insinuating that Lin Tai was made a cuckold by Yang Dan. Surprisingly, this tactic worked and in his agitated state, Lin Tai shouted that he was actually with his daughter in the SUV at the day of the murder. While his daughter had knocked down Yang Dan, it was Lin Tai that got off the car and pushed Yang Dan against the wall, and her head went onto a nail, which killed her. The whole court was in uproar. Lin Tai was hence detained. His daughter, Mengmeng was also released, having been acquitted of her crime.  Nearing the trial of Lin Tai, Zhou Li revealed to the audience that her team was the one that had gotten hold of the video and had sent it to Tong Tao's team. This video was in turn given to her team via an anonymous source. As she was comparing this video, which was shot at an angle different from the security camera feed that was overlooking the scene, she noticed that the movement of Sun Wei's leg was inconsistent. This led her to believe that the video was shot after the murder had happened. She immediately asked her staff to investigate whether Lin Tai had carried out a massive renovation job within the last few months and also whether he had purchased a lot of second-hand vehicles. Her line of query turned fruitful and led her to a deserted factory in the Su Province. She transgressed into the factory and discover the interior had been modelled after the carpark where the murder of Yang Dan had happened. This confirmed her hunch that Lin Tai shot the video in the aftermath of the murder to stage the idea that he was the one that committed the murder instead of his daughter.  Tong Tao also has his suspicion when he revealed the court footage of Lin Tai confessing the murder of Yang Dan. Lin Tai, at that time made reference that he would not allow himself to be convicted by Tong Tao in front of the "Dragon Back Wall". Unable to fathom what this meant, Tong Tao visited Lin Tai's hometown and spoke to an old villager. The old person explained the significance of the "Dragon Back Wall", telling the story of how, in ancient China, the local dragon king took the place of his dragon son that had committed grave atrocities, and gave himself up to the heavenly warriors that were there to punish the young dragon son. The local mountain where this allegedly happened was hence referred to as the "Dragon Back Mountain". When Tong Tao was returning to town, he received a call from Meng Meng and the audience was led to note that the call was from Meng Meng, who supposedly called to confess her father's plot to save her. The story ends here, leaving the audience a strong sense that Lin Tai had been acquitted, as well as experiencing the power of fatherly love.

The Smurfs 2
  In preparation for her birthday celebration, the Smurfs read the story of [[Smurfette]], how she was created by [[Gargamel]] to destroy them, only for [[Papa Smurf]] to rescue her and turn her fully into a Smurf. Meanwhile, she is having nightmares about reverting to her original form and betraying her fellow Smurfs by turning them over to Gargamel. The Smurfs are preparing a surprise party, but as Smurfette tries to find out what her fellow Smurfs are planning, none of them are saying a word. She takes this to mean that everyone has forgotten her birthday.  In [[France]], Gargamel is now a celebrity, amazing people with his sorcery, but he sees that he is running low on the Smurf essence that gives him his magic powers. With his new creations, evil Smurf-like creatures called the Naughties, named Vexy and Hackus, Gargamel plans on opening a portal to the Smurf village by using the [[Eiffel Tower]] as a conduit so that he can kidnap Smurfette and, through her, get Papa Smurf's secret formula for creating Smurfs. However, as the portal he created is not big enough for him to go through, Gargamel sends Vexy through to the portal to grab Smurfette and bring her to [[Paris]].  The Smurfs witness the abduction of Smurfette and inform Papa Smurf, who uses his magic to create [[crystals]] that allow several of his Smurfs to travel directly to Patrick Winslow's residence in [[New York City]] in order to get his help to rescue Smurfette. Papa originally intends for Brainy, Hefty, and Gutsy to use the crystals, but through an accident, Clumsy, Grouchy and Vanity use them  instead. Papa and the three Smurfs arrive in the apartment right after the celebration of Blue's fourth birthday where they meet both the Winslows' young boy and Patrick's stepfather Victor Doyle, a man who is a constant embarrassment to Patrick. The Smurfs soon discover where Gargamel is, and so they and the Winslows set off for Paris in order to find him.  After their arrival in Paris, Patrick and his wife Grace work together with Victor to distract Gargamel during one of his performances while the Smurfs sneak backstage in order to find Smurfette, only to discover what Gargamel is planning. At the same time, Smurfette escapes from her prison, and Vexy and Hackus chase after her. Upon her return to Gargamel's hotel suite with the Naughties, Gargamel presents her with a tiny dragon wand as a feigned act of kindness. Smurfette still refuses to give Gargamel the formula until she sees that the Naughties are dying due to a lack of Smurf essence. Faced without an alternative to save them, Smurfette writes the formula down and Gargamel uses it to turn the Naughties into real Smurfs. Immediately after they become Smurfs, Gargamel puts them into his Smurf-a-lator so he can carry out the rest of his plan.  Meanwhile, Patrick, Victor, and the Smurfs work together to rescue Smurfette. The Smurfs are soon captured and put into the Smurf-a-lator, powering Gargamel's large-sized dragon wand. Patrick and Victor arrive just in time to destroy the Smurf-a-lator, causing the formula to be destroyed in blue pixie dust that in turn vanquishes the secret formula. Gargamel has gained enough power to use his new wand against the Smurfs and their allies. Vexy and Hackus team up with the Smurfs against their former master and use the new wand to blast him away. He then falls onto the [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], where he accidentally brings a stone vulture to life, which then throws him to the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] where fireworks then set off, sending him in the air. Vexy and Hackus bid farewell to the Winslows and return home with the rest of the Smurfs.  In two post-credit sequences, Gargamel and Azrael are pulled into the portal, sending them back to their castle, and they later have a fight.

The Smurfs: The Legend of Smurfy Hollow
 As the story begins, Hefty, Clumsy, and Panicky are out in the forest at night with a cart full of smurfberries that has a broken wheel. Unable to fix the wheel, the three of them sit together around a campfire roasting smurfberries when Clumsy has the idea of telling a ghost story to pass the time. Narrator then joins the three Smurfs to tell his own kind of ghost story.  In Narrator's story, the Smurfs gather around for Papa Smurf to announce the Smurfberry Harvest contest in which the Smurfs who collect the most smurfberries will be awarded a medal. Brainy shows up at the gathering wearing multiple medals that he has won over the past years, gloating about how he's going to win this year's medal as well. As the Smurfs collect their buckets and then go out into the forest to pick smurfberries, Gutsy follows Brainy to find out where he's been getting all the smurfberries for winning the contest. He discovers that it's in a place called Smurfy Hollow, an area where the legendary [[Headless Horseman (Legend of Sleepy Hollow)|Headless Horseman]] resides, where there's a secret patch of smurfberries growing plentifully. Gutsy decides to give Brainy a scare by creating a shadow figure of the Headless Horseman, which sends the bespectacled Smurf running in fear. However, while Gutsy uses this opportunity to collect the smurfberries in the secret patch, Brainy finds himself walking into a trap set up by the evil wizard Gargamel.  By the time the contest ends and the Smurfs have appeared with their buckets for Papa Smurf to judge the winner, Gutsy shows up with a bucket overloaded with smurfberries and thus is declared the winner. However, Suspicious Smurf begins to wonder where Brainy is, since he hasn't shown up with his bucket of smurfberries. Realizing that he may be found out for cheating, Gutsy goes out into the forest alone to find Brainy, but is soon joined by Smurfette, who finds out from Gutsy that Brainy is in Smurfy Hollow. They both go together and find Brainy in a cage trap set up by Gargamel, only to soon join him in cage traps of their own. Azrael, who was prowling the forest by himself, is soon alerted to the Smurfs' presence and goes to get his master to inform him of the captured Smurfs.  Gutsy, Brainy, and Smurfette work on a plan to get themselves out of their cages, and soon Gutsy swings his cage repeatedly until it bumps into Brainy's, which then bumps into Smurfette's, and the cages continue to bump into each other until Gutsy's and Brainy's cages break, freeing them. However, Smurfette is still stuck in her cage, and Gutsy and Brainy try to figure out how to get her out of there when Gargamel appears with Azrael, and so they go into hiding while the evil wizard opens the cage to deal with the one Smurf that is still captured.  But soon the five of them have a new problem to deal with—the presence of the Headless Horseman, who rides around looking for his next victims. They start running for their lives toward the covered bridge, which legends say is the only thing that keeps the Headless Horseman trapped in Smurfy Hollow. But as the Smurfs see that they would not get to the covered bridge in time to escape from the Headless Horseman, they hitch a ride on the back of a bat and fly to the top of the covered bridge, safe from the spectral rider's grasp. Gargamel and Azrael soon reach the bridge that the Headless Horseman cannot pass through, and safe inside the bridge, the evil wizard taunts the ghost, who then responds by throwing a flaming pumpkin that causes the floor beneath him and his cat to break, sending them down the river and over the waterfalls.  With the three Smurfs returning safely home, Gutsy and Brainy begin to apologize to each other for what they did, with Gutsy admitting that he was jealous about Brainy always winning and Brainy admitting that he was selfish in keeping the secret patch of smurfberries all to himself. Glad to see that two of his little Smurfs have learned their lesson, Papa Smurf proceeds to reward Gutsy with the medal, but Gutsy decides to give it to Brainy instead, who then insists that Gutsy should have it, and so the two Smurfs fight over who should get the medal when it flies out of their hands and lands looped around Lazy's neck, thereby declaring him to be the winner. As the Smurfs gather around the stage to see Gutsy and Brainy dance with each other, Papa Smurf goes out into the forest to thank the Headless Horseman, who turns out to be a goat that he used his magic on to make him appear as a ghost.  With Narrator Smurf's ghost story now over, Hefty claims that he wasn't scared, but finds himself jumping into Narrator Smurf's arms at the sound of a bat screeching. Panicky sees that they are now surrounded by bats, which scares all four Smurfs and sends them running back to the village.  
Slum (film)
   
Snowpiercer
 In 2014, an attempt to counteract [[global warming]] through [[climate engineering]] backfires catastrophically, causing an [[ice age]] and [[mass extinction|extinguishing]] nearly all life; only animals that can adapt to sub-zero temperatures and the inhabitants of ''Snowpiercer'' remain. ''Snowpiercer'' is a massive train, powered by a [[perpetual motion]] engine, traveling on a circumnavigational track created by the Wilford transportation magnate. By 2031, elites inhabit the extravagant front cars while the "scum" inhabit the tail in squalid and brutal conditions. Under watch by Wilford's guards, they are brought only gelatinous protein bars to eat.  Conspiring with his mentor Gilliam ([[John Hurt]]) and second-in-command Edgar ([[Jamie Bell]]), Curtis Everett ([[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]]) plans to lead the tail passengers in a revolt that will take them all the way up to the engine. Mason ([[Tilda Swinton]]) and armed guards come to take two small children, Andy and Timmy. Andy's father Andrew ([[Ewen Bremner]]) attempts to fight back, but is punished by Mason by being forced to put his arm into the extreme cold outside the train, effectively amputating it. Enraged, Curtis initiates their plan the next time they are to be fed. On realization the guards' weapons are empty, Curtis and the tail passengers easily overrun them and take the security and prison cars. Curtis releases security expert Namgoong Minsu ([[Song Kang-ho]]) and his [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] daughter Yona ([[Go Ah-sung]]) from the prison car so he can disable the locks between cars, offering them a hallucinogenic drug called Kronole as payment. They take the car where insects are ground up to make their protein bars, and Gilliam suggests that if they take the subsequent water supply car, they will control any negotiation with Wilford. Instead, they are ambushed by a mass of masked men with hatchets led by Franco the Elder ([[Vlad Ivanov]]) under Mason's orders.  After a bloody battle, Curtis sacrifices Edgar to win the fight. Mason is taken captive and Curtis, Namgoong, Yona, Tanya ([[Octavia Spencer]]), Andrew and Gilliam's bodyguard Grey ([[Luke Pasqualino]]) continue on with her as a hostage.  They travel through several luxurious cars and arrive at a classroom, where the teacher ([[Alison Pill]]) expounds to the children and the rebels on the greatness of Wilford and the "sacred engine". While distracted by the celebration of the New Year marking one circumnavigation of the globe, the teacher ambushes them with a gun (bullets weren't actually extinct, but were rumored to be), killing Andrew before Grey kills her. Further back, Franco and Mason's soldiers use the same distraction to kill the rebel army and many of the tail passengers. Franco executes Gilliam, and Curtis kills Mason in revenge. Curtis' group continues forward, followed by Franco, leading to a violent fight in a sauna car during which Franco kills Grey and mortally wounds Tanya before Curtis and Namgoong seemingly kill him.  At the gate to the engine, Namgoong reveals that he plans to use the highly flammable Kronole as an explosive to blow a hatch to the outside, as he observed signs the world outside is thawing and may be hospitable. Curtis confesses to him that shortly after boarding the train, the tail passengers resorted to cannibalism to survive, and he is haunted by his part in it. He was nearly ready to kill infant Edgar when Gilliam offered his own arm instead. After years of disdain for Wilford, Curtis seeks to learn what Wilford's intentions were. Meanwhile, Franco is revealed to have survived and makes his way toward the engine.  Wilford's assistant Claude (Emma Levie) emerges from the engine, shoots Namgoong, and invites Curtis inside where he meets an aging Wilford ([[Ed Harris]]). Wilford reveals to Curtis that his revolution was actually orchestrated by himself and Gilliam to reduce the population and maintain the balance of the sealed ecosystem, and subsequently orders the elimination of 74% of the remaining tail passengers. He explains the importance of using fear and chaos to maintain a necessary order and leadership on the train. After letting Curtis experience being alone for the first time in seventeen years, Wilford asks Curtis to replace him. Curtis appears ready to accept, when Yona runs in and pulls up a floorboard, showing Curtis that small children from the tail section, including Andy and Timmy, are being trapped as replacement parts for "extinct" machinery; the tail section only serves to provide this resource to the engine. Curtis subdues Wilford and sacrifices an arm to save Timmy from this work, though Andy refuses to be saved.  Namgoong revives and finally kills Franco as Yona lights the fuse on the Kronole. However, the door to the engine short-circuits and doesn't close, forcing Curtis and Namgoong to tightly embrace Yona and Timmy, protecting them from the blast. The explosion triggers an avalanche that derails the train. Yona and Timmy, apparently the only survivors, emerge from the wreckage and see a [[polar bear]] in the distance – proof that life exists outside the train.  
Snitch (film)
 College student Jason Collins is video-chatting with his childhood best friend Craig Johnson. Craig discusses a box of drugs that he is attempting to move and attempts to persuade Jason to let Craig ship the drugs to his house, offering him a share of the profit. Despite Jason's reluctance, Craig texts him the tracking number for the package. A courier delivers Craig's package to the Collins's house. Jason signs for the package and brings it to his room, discovering that it contains a large amount of pills in a bag, as well as a tracking device. [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] officers arrive and break into the house; Jason flees but is chased down by Agent Cooper.  While at a barbecue, John Matthews, Jason's estranged father and owner of a [[construction]] company, is called by his ex-wife Sylvie about Jason being arrested. John and Sylvie meet and have a tense discussion while waiting to speak to Jason. An investigator speaks with them, saying that Craig set Jason up in a [[sting operation]] to reduce his own sentence after being caught. Jason's charges carry a [[Mandatory sentencing|minimum]] of 10 years in [[prison]] and Jason is denied bail. He is put in an interview room with, John, Sylvie, and the investigator, who pressures Jason to inform on one of his own friends for trafficking in order to reduce his own sentence, as Craig had done.  Using his connections, John arranges to meet with local [[United States Attorney|US Attorney]] Joanne Keeghan, who is running a very aggressive anti-drug campaign. Keeghan agrees to reduce Jason's sentence if John will inform on a drug dealer, but states that he'll receive little help from her and that the risk will be all his. John visits Jason in prison, observing from facial wounds that Jason has been abused by other prisoners.  Agent Cooper leads a [[task force]] which will monitor any dealings John arranges to use as evidence for an arrest. John searches through his employee records and finds that Daniel James, a new employee, has two prior distribution convictions. Daniel is currently leading a clean life to avoid a [[Three-strikes law|third strike]]. John offers twenty thousand dollars if Daniel will simply introduce him to a dealer; Daniel agrees, though he is unaware that John is acting as an [[informant]]. Daniel introduces John to Malik, an extremely dangerous, high-ranking local drug dealer, who also has two strikes. Explaining that his construction business cannot stay afloat in the current economy without a supplement to its revenues, John offers to run nearly limitless amounts of drugs at almost zero risk in his [[Cargo#Road|freight trucks]]. Malik agrees under the condition that John and Daniel drive the initial run themselves.  John and Agent Cooper arrange for several [[Telephone tapping|wire taps]]. John drives to the pick-up point near the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican border]] when a rival [[gang]] ambushes the pick-up, but John manages a daring escape, impressing [[cartel]] [[Boss (crime)|kingpin]] Juan Carlos "El Topo" Pintera, whose men fight off the hijackers. John then makes the deal, delivering the drugs to Malik while under surveillance by Agent Cooper. Malik mentions a meeting with cartel members higher than himself; Cooper, hoping to catch the higher priority targets, does not move to arrest Malik as agreed. Keeghan claims Cooper did the right thing and reneges on her promise to reduce Jason's sentence, unless John cooperates in the second meeting. John, outraged, demands in turn that Jason be released when the job is completed. Daniel learns of John's arrangement with the DEA and is furious, saying that the cartel will kill John, Daniel, and their families if the truth comes out. John and Daniel send their families into hiding.  John meets with Pintera, who wants him to run nearly $100 million in drug profits into Mexico and offers to make John a member of the cartel's inner circle if he succeeds. Keeghan relishes the prospect of arresting such a high-profile dealer, but Cooper has a change of heart and tries to talk John out of doing the run, suspecting the cartel will kill him afterward. John devises a plan to free himself and Daniel from both the government and the cartel. During the run, John is able to escape Cooper's surveillance. At the same time, Daniel raids Malik's house, killing his guards and mortally wounding him. Before dying, Malik reveals Pintera's cell phone number to Daniel. John calls Cooper and has him track both his new cell phone and Pintera's phone, effectively giving Cooper both the money and the kingpin at once. The cartel realize John is an informant and he leads them on a highway [[Car chase|chase]] and [[shoot-out]] before escaping. Cartel members and the money are seized by Cooper's men. Pintera is surrounded by federal agents and surrenders without engaging in a gun battle because his young son is with him. Jason is released the next day. John and his family go into the [[witness protection]] program and he leaves Daniel the large Federal reward check that John received for the capture of Pintera.

Wei is amazed and disgusted by the messy condition of the male dormroom, except one bed and corner that is uncannily neat and clean. Lao Zhang explains that this spot belongs to their disciplined and hardworking roommate, Chen Xiaozheng. Laozhang exits for a moment to find his DVDs, leaving Wei alone in the room. Wei sees a near finished building model on the table and curiously starts fumbling with the parts. At this moment Xiaozheng comes back and angrily yells out, "What are you doing?" Startled and swinging around to see yelled, Wei knocks the model off the table. Xiaozheng manages to save his model by shoving Wei out of the way, who falls in a mess to the floor. Enraged in humiliation, Wei angrily demands an apology from Xiaozheng, but Xiaozheng coolly replies that he has nothing to apologize for and that it was her fault for touching his model. From this moment, Wei becomes determined to repeatedly humiliate and bring trouble to Xiaozheng until she gets the apology she believes she deserves. Through her attempts Wei comes to the startling realization that in fact, she likes Xiaozheng. From Lao Zhang and Weijuan, Wei learns that Xiaozheng comes from a poor family and was raised by a strict mother, hence his aloof and disciplined personality. Wei declares her interest in Xiaozheng, then openly, relentlessly, and shamelessly stalks Xiaozheng to get his attention, much to his annoyance.

Wei asks Xiaozheng why he is always so serious about everything, to which Xiaozheng replies, "I don't know what your attitude towards your life is, but my life is like a building that can only be built once, so I cannot afford any margin of error, not even a centimeter's width." Due to his family's modest financial circumstances, Xiaozheng feels that he needs to do anything and everything he can to ensure the best possible professional future for himself.  Eventually graduation comes upon Wei and Xiaozheng. At the on-campus recruitment and interview fair, Wei hopes she and Xiaozheng can find work at the same institute thus remain together. Unbeknownst to Wei, Xiaozheng has applied to and obtained a graduate fellowship to study architecture in America. When Wei finally learns of his plan, she confronts Xiaozheng to ask why she was the last one to know. Xiaozheng attempts to explain with difficulty that he could not tell her because he was afraid of hurting her and reiterates that he can not make any mistake in his life, he then apologizes, saying that he had to make this choice of leaving her to make a better future for himself.  A few years into the future, Wei has now become a mature professional who excels in her work, much different from her bygone youthful days. One day she suddenly encounters Lin Jing. Jing explains that he left abruptly because he learned his father was having an affair with Wei's mother, so he could not face Wei. He never went to America, but avoided contact with her except for once when he went to look for her, but found her with Xiaozheng. Now however, he wants to come back and rekindle their friendship and, if possible, romance. At this time, Xiaozheng also returns from America, now as a renowned and accomplished architect. Though he has everything professionally that he was determined to get, Xiaozheng finds the life that he has gained empty and crippled. He deeply regrets letting go of Wei, seeing it as the only time he walked with his back straight, and also wants to rekindle their relationship. However, Wei on their first meeting firmly rejects Xiaocheng. Not long afterward, Ruan Guan is killed in a car accident when trying to meet her university boyfriend for one last time before she getting married to another man.

Afterwards, Xiaocheng and Wei meet once more at the aquarium to reminisce.

Soodhu Kavvum
  Friends Kesavan, Sekar, and Pagalavan meet Das, a middle-age man who does low-profile kidnappings for a living with his girlfriend Shalu. Because they are broke, the trio decide to become his assistants. Das follows five rules of kidnapping (which he spells and writes as "kednaping"), the first of which is to avoid kidnapping people from political backgrounds. One day, they kidnap a boy and successfully obtain ransom money from his father Nambikkai Kannan. Nambikkai's contractor brother has been arrested for attempted bribery by State Minister Gnanodayam, a disciplined politician who plays by the book. Impressed with Das' kidnapping skills, Nambikkai asks him to kidnap Gnanodayam's son Arumai Pragasam as revenge and offers to pay Das up to 2 Crore.  The next day, the four men set out to kidnap Arumai but are astonished to see him be kidnapped by another group. They kidnap Arumai from the other kidnappers and discover that the first kidnapping was [[Fake kidnapping|staged by Arumai himself]] to extort money from his father. Arumai manages to convince Das and his men to collude with him to obtain ransom money from his father. The group demand 2 crore from the minister and receive the money.  An argument over splitting the cash arises between Arumai and the rest during which their van loses control and falls from a bridge. Arumai runs away with all the money. The minister seeks the assistance of [[Encounter killings by police|encounter]] specialist Bramma, a brutal and merciless policeman to hunt down the kidnappers. Arumai returns to his house and hides the money in his room. Das devices a plan to kidnap Arumai again to retrieve the money. They accidentally meet Arumai and successfully kidnap him again. But Das lets Arumai go free, after making him promise that he should not tell anything about them to the police. Arumai also promises to return their share of the money. Bramma learns that Arumai staged his own kidnapping and uses this information to threaten Arumai into testifying against the Das gang.  Arumai tells the court that the Das gang did not kidnap him. They are acquitted. Enraged, Bramma takes the gang to a remote location and brutally beats them and raises his department gun to kill them. Instead of shooting them with the officially issued gun, he goes out and retrieves from his police jeep an illegal homemade gun that he had seized from a crook. When he inserts it behind his back in his pants, the rusty gun misfires into Bramma's buttocks, allowing Das and others to escape. Arumai's father breaks in and takes the money bag to the chief minister, who provided the ransom money. When he opens the bag, the minister is shocked to find it filled with newspapers instead of cash. Arumai had transferred the cash to another bag and gives the Das gang their share.  The chief minister calls Arumai to his office and asks him to stand as a candidate in the upcoming general elections in lieu of his father, who never brought much income to the party due to his refusal to be corrupt. The Chief minister praises Arumai's shrewdness and believes he can rake in substantial income of 300 cr in 5 years for the party, as a young minister. Arumai wins the elections, becomes MLA and immediately gets a minister post and appoints Sekar and Kesavan as his personal advisers, while Pagalavan becomes an actor. Das continues his kidnapping business with a new band of young men. They kidnap a woman who looks exactly like Shalu, belatedly realising that she is Shalini Gupta, a minister's daughter; Das has broken his first rule of kidnapping again.

Space Pirate Captain Harlock (film)
 In the future, mankind has discovered a way to travel [[faster than light]] and has [[Space colonization|built colonies]] on thousands of planets. With humanity fading and the resources of the universe [[Resource depletion|starting to dwindle]], some five hundred billion humans began the long journey back home, to Earth. However, humanity has outgrown its capacity to repatriate that many people and thus began the "Homecoming War;" where the many factions of humanity battled for a stake on Earth. The war was long and bloody. It did not subside until an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] universal government by the name of the '''Gaia Sanction''' declares Earth a sacred planet, and thus forbidden for humanity to repopulate.  To prevent various factions of humanity from immigrating back to Earth, an elite wing of the Gaia Fleet was tasked to defend Earth: The Deathshadow Martyr Fleet, led by Harlock. With the assistance of his scientist friend, Tochiro Ōyama, Harlock helped to save a dying advanced alien race called the Nibelung. In return for their help, the Nibelung gave Harlock their advanced technology and helped create the four Deathshadow-class ships with [[dark matter]] engines to defend Earth. Harlock's ships were unstoppable and he successfully defended Earth from humanity's influence, until the Gaia Sanction broke their own rules.  A peace treaty was created to prevent future bloodshed from various factions of humanity, however, it was under the condition that the diplomatic elite would be allowed to immigrate. Unfortunately, this didn't sit well with Harlock as he felt it was a betrayal of what he believed in.  He also saw in this the hypocrisy of the Gaia Sanction. Enraged, Harlock broke rank, opened fire on the immigrants, and turned his guns upon his own fleet. With only the ''Arcadia'' now under his command, the ship was badly damaged, Tochiro seemingly killed, and they were being boarded. In a high-risk gamble for survival and protection of the Earth, Harlock asked Miime (Nibelung observer and engineer of his ship) to unleash dark matter upon the Earth to protect it from humanity. Sadly, the gamble was made at a terrible cost and the other three Deathshadow-Class ships were destroyed.  The dark matter was uncontrollable and it decimated the Earth and life was no longer sustainable. Engulfed in dark matter, the ''Arcadia'' managed to survive the incident, but returned out of the dark clouds forever changed. Harlock's body had been immortalized and Tochiro's consciousness seemingly lived on in the ship's computer, giving the ''Arcadia'' its reputation of being a cursed ship. Vowing to atone for his sin, Harlock is now a rogue pirate with a personal mission to turn back the hands of time.  100 years has passed and Captain Harlock remains at large. Gaia had covered up the real condition of Earth, with a giant [[Holography|holographic]] [[optical camouflage]], to maintain their power. With his own crew of rogues, Harlock has taken 100 detonators from the Gaia Sanction in attempts to "start over." Admiral of the Gaia Fleet, Isora, got his younger brother, Yama, to help him take down Harlock. Several years earlier, Yama became angry after his mother's favorite flower dies, and accidentally destroys the whole greenhouse. The accident paralyzed Isora in that it had decimated their mutual childhood love, Nami. Nami was critically injured to the point of death, but survives only with the help of a medical pod. However, through their advanced technology, she's able to live and interact with the brothers as a living hologram. Desperate to make restitution to Isora, Yama agreed to infiltrate the Arcadia and its crew to stop Harlock's schemes. However, things became complicated.  Yama successfully infiltrated Harlock's crew, but unknown to him, Harlock and Miime always knew he was a mole. During a mission to install the 99th dimensional oscillator, Yama learned from Kei (crew member) that Harlock's plan to "start over" is by opening the time nodes to alter history and create a better time line. The mission turned awry when they realized they landed on a giant worm and Harlock came to rescue Yama. It was then Yama was about to execute Harlock, but in a life and death situation, Yama decided to cooperate with Harlock so both could survive.  Thus they escaped the planet. Back on board the ''Arcadia'', Harlock gave his gun to Yama, telling him to use it against him after freeing himself of the bonds tying him down -- if he still wants to kill him later. Yama's undercover identity was never exposed to the rest of the crew.  Harlock's words convinced Yama to follow Harlock's plans, causing Yama to defect.  The Gaia Sanction learned of Harlock's intentions of heading towards Earth and they permitted Isora to use the Kaleido Star System, a superweapon used to destroy [[Neutron star|neutron stars]], to stop Harlock. Harlock then used hologram projections of the ''Arcadia'' to disguise his movements and evade the Gaia fleet near [[Pluto]]. He is eventually spotted near [[Saturn]] and Isora takes the 2nd Fleet and the Kaleido Star System to stop him. The ''Arcadia i''s seemingly destroyed by the Kaleido Star System, but it turns out to be another hologram. The real Arcadia, hidden in an Asteroid, then reveals itself in the fleet's rear and destroys most of the 2nd Fleet before ramming into Isora's flagship, the ''Oceanus'', to take them hostage. Once at Earth and past the great illusion, the crew was horrified at what has become of their Earth. It was during this time that both Isora and Miime divulged the origins of Harlock and the true nature of "starting over": Harlock intends to unlock the Nodes of Time to destroy the current universe and rebirth a new one -- Genesis.  Shocked by the truth, Yama now sides with Isora and even the ''Arcadia'' itself starts moving away from Earth. Yama then helps Isora and the crew of the ''Oceanus'', held captive on the ''Arcadia'', to escape and take over the ''Arcadia''. With the ship and crew imprisoned, Isora confronts Nami for informing Yama of his tactical plans (which was used against him in the earlier battle) and her love for Yama. Nami wanted to release the hatred and anger within Isora and realized the source of his torment wasn't because of Yama, but because of her. Nami tells him she only loved Yama, which enrages Isora to the point of pulling the plug to her life support pod. As Nami is dying, she admits that she lied to Isora and she always loved him.  Isora makes up the excuse that Nami used a compromised system to record a hologram message for Yama, which caused her life support pod to malfunction and gives Yama the hologram message that she recorded. Yama doesn't believe Isora, but the guards hold him back as the hologram message plays after dropping on the floor. Haunted by Nami's death, Yama returns to the decimated Earth only to find a sign that life still thrives there when he discovers a meadow of white flowers.  The Gaia Sanction planned a public execution for Harlock and his crew; they are to be destroyed within the ''Arcadia'' by a large particle machine. However, the execution was halted when Yama appeared and released the crew of the ''Arcadia''. In the process, he also destroyed the particle machine. Yama told the crew that he was wrong, but so was Harlock; now he wants to show the crew something he found on Earth. While still having trust issues with Yama, the crew had no choice but to follow his lead for freedom. At Harlock's cell, Yama reveals what he had found on Earth. The flower meant that Earth is trying to recover on its own and it might be the "starting over" that Harlock wanted. Emotionally touched at the significance of this miraculous find, Harlock believes he's found his "freedom". Harlock intends to expose the truth of Earth and escapes with the ''Arcadia''.  Near Earth's proximity, the Gaia Fleet intercepts the ''Arcadia''. Using its advanced speed and firepower, the ''Arcadia'' evaded destruction and successfully destroyed the hologram emitters that falsely portrayed Earth. Yattaran (crew member) managed to hack through Gaia's networks for Yama to reveal the truth to humanity, but also conveyed a message of hope that life would continue. The exposed truth of Earth's condition took away any leverage the Gaia Sanction had over its reign. Desperate to contain the situation, the Imperial Father (leader of Gaia) decided to vaporize Earth with a powerful [[Particle-beam weapon|particle cannon]] called the Jovian Blaster. Isora realized the Earth would be destroyed as the Arcadia was too close. Therefore, he decided to ram the Arcadia with the Oceanus and push it away from Earth. Both ships then boarded each other and there are many casualties on both sides.  Yama then confronted Isora on the ''Oceanus''<nowiki/>'s bridge, the two fought and Isora shot at Yama's face, causing him to lose his right eye and have a scar similar to Harlock. Isora almost killed Yama, but Harlock shot him from behind and mortally wounds Isora. It was then Isora warned them about the Jovian Blaster and Harlock remarked that Isora was the only one who remained faithful to Earth. Harlock then asked Miime to unleash the full dark matter energies of the ship. When the Jovian Blaster fired, the Arcadia created a powerful shield that distorted the blast. Plus, the ''Oceanus''<nowiki/>'s ramming had moved the Arcadia so that the Jovian Blaster missed the Earth. Yama later took Isora on board the Arcadia. As he was dying, he explained that he saved Earth because it had the flowers that Nami and their mother loved. After getting a glimpse of the flower, Isora died in Yama's arms while the Arcadia crash-landed on Earth.  Once on the planet, Harlock dropped his 100th detonator. Harlock pointed his gun at Yama and remarked that the Earth will eventually recover, but it will likely re-spark another Homecoming War; but, Harlock suggested they could prevent it by unraveling the Nodes of Time. However, believing that this world is a gift from Nami and Isora, Yama didn't want the world to end and similarly pointed his gun at Harlock. Harlock liked his answer and he gave the detonator to Yama and gave him the power to end humanity and the universe if another disaster like the Homecoming War happens again. Harlock, with high self-esteem, remarks that so long as mankind exists, so will the myth of how Captain Harlock resented the government, destroyed the Earth once, and almost ended the Universe, for all of eternity. Yama was given an eye-patch and he accepted the legacy of being the next Captain Harlock. As Gaia's fleet confronts the Arcadia again, the crew wakes up, seemingly healed by the dark matter power plant, and the Arcadia takes off and escapes into space, leaving the meadow of white flowers behind.

Special 26
 The story of the film opens on 18 March 1987, where a walk-in CBI interview is taking place, held by the characters of Akshay Kumar and Anupam Kher. The film then goes into flashback.  Ajay Singh ([[Akshay Kumar]]) calls a local police station to obtain more manpower for a CBI [[Police raid|raid]]. He speaks to SI Ranveer Singh ([[Jimmy Sheirgill]]) who agrees to send the required number of support officers. Ajay, with accomplices P.K. Sharma ([[Anupam Kher]]), Joginder ([[Rajesh Sharma (actor)|Rajesh Sharma]]), and Iqbal ([[Kishor Kadam]]), meet the support officers and conduct the raid.  Following the successful raid at a minister's house, it's revealed that Ajay and Sharma are fake CBI officers, along with their two accomplices. They then move to different parts of the country where they belong to and merge into their everyday lifestyles. Ajay's love interest, Priya ([[Kajal Aggarwal]]), an about-to-be-married teacher, is introduced here. The crew meets again in [[Chandigarh]] at the behest of Sharma for his daughter's wedding.  Ranveer with his senior officer meet the minister of the earlier raid, who reveals that he doesn't want the news to appear in the public domain because he wants to protect his image. The senior officer suspends Ranveer with his colleague Shanti ([[Divya Dutta]]) for being irresponsible.  CBI officer Waseem Khan ([[Manoj Bajpayee]]) lives with his wife ([[Neetu Singh (born 1990)|Neetu Singh]]) and child in New Delhi. He apprehends a criminal named Gupta, which gives an insight into his character. A disgraced Ranveer meets Khan, and they join hands to apprehend Ajay and his fellow criminals.  Meanwhile, the next raid planned by Ajay is conducted on a traders' business in [[Burrabazar|Bara Bazar]] in [[Kolkata]] posing as officers from the [[Income Tax Department]]. Following the more difficult but successful raid, Khan insists that this should be reported in the newspaper, despite nobody coming forward to report it themselves, as [[black money]] is involved. Upon seeing this in the newspaper, Ajay and Sharma decide to conduct their "big job," a final raid in [[Mumbai]].  After the second income tax raid, the story briefly focuses on Ajay and Priya, with the latter's marriage being planned. She insists to go with Ajay for the final job, but he tells her to meet him at the airport at 4 pm on the day.  Meanwhile, Ranveer finds information about Sharma, and Khan orders [[Telephone tapping|wire-tapping]] his phone. When Sharma is talking to Ajay on the phone, Khan procures several details about them, including the names Joginder, Iqbal and 'Ajju' (Ajay's nickname). As a result, under Khan's orders, officers track the crew to Mumbai to a hotel where they're staying. They plan to raid and hence rob a big jewellery store.  Ajay, followed by a CBI officer, goes to a newspaper to advertise for "50 dynamic graduates" with details of an interview. Khan embeds his officers among the candidates and they are selected. Khan finds out the details of the training process, which includes a mock raid. It is stated that, on the day, the candidates will be trained and then led out for the mock raid in the afternoon. However, no details about the raid have come to light.  To find out more, Khan and Ranveer go to the hotel and force their way into Sharma's room. He divulges the information about the raid, following a threat of violence. He also mentions that Ajay is taking revenge on the CBI for not appointing him. Khan orders Sharma to ensure everything proceeds as normal.  On the day of the raid, Khan takes charge of the jewellery store and replaces the goods with fake jewellery, with the originals being moved to a nearby workshop. He is given constant information about the activity of the crew and recruits. Ajay informs the recruits that he will come in a different vehicle to them. Sharma leaves with the recruits in a bus, but leaves the bus at police headquarters, saying that he will arrive with Ajay. He also states that nobody should leave the bus until they arrive and that he is going to verify the paperwork for the raid at the Police HQ. In reality, he goes to meet Ranveer Singh. With Ajay, a raid of the workshop is carried out. Ajay then goes and meets Priya, who is ready for departure at the Sahar International airport.  Meanwhile, at the jewellery store, Khan is informed that the raid was conducted at the workshop and all jewellery in the workshop along with the jewellery that were moved were stolen. Khan works it all out for himself, realizing that Ranveer was part of the gang and he wasn't a real police officer and they were set up right from the beginning. Khan starts laughing loudly and applauds the entire robbery plan and execution. Later, Khan receives a [[money order]] for Rs. 100 that Ajay had taken from him with the message that he could not steal the honest earnings of an officer. The film ends with Khan being told over the phone that the CBI has information about the perpetrators. At the same time we see Ajay Singh and P.K. Sharma enjoying a [[cricket]] match happily at the [[Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium]] with their wives.  
The Spectacular Now
 Sutter Keely ([[Miles Teller]]) is a charming and popular 18-year-old who is partying and drinking his way through senior year in high school. When his girlfriend Cassidy ([[Brie Larson]]) decides he's a lost cause and breaks up with him, she starts seeing Marcus ([[Dayo Okeniyi]]), the School President and an athletic star. Sutter goes home and writes a college application supplement, in which he says that his biggest hardship in life has been getting dumped by his girlfriend the day before. He then goes out and gets drunk.  He wakes up on the front lawn of Aimee Finicky ([[Shailene Woodley]]), a girl in his year whose name he doesn't know. Aimee is about to do her mother's paper route, which she does every morning, though she gives most of the money to her mother to pay the bills, which Sutter protests at being unfair. Sutter does the paper route with her and they have a good time. He sits with her at lunch and asks her to tutor him in geometry, which he is failing, and learns she is smart, funny and into sci-fi and comics. Sutter goes home and deletes the supplement he wrote about his life's biggest hardship, abandoning it for the time being. Sutter invites Aimee to a party, where he introduces her to some Sci-Fi fans and then asks Cassidy to have a drink with him, but Marcus arrives to pick her up. Sutter and Aimee go for a walk and get drunk from his hip flask. Aimee confesses she has never been drunk before, never had a boyfriend and doesn't think she can go to college because she has to take care of her irresponsible mother. Sutter tells her she is not responsible for her mother, she is beautiful,and the boys at the party liked her. Sutter then kisses her.  The next morning Sutter wakes up hungover and realizes that he asked Aimee to prom the night before. Avoiding his college application, Sutter IMs Cassidy, who invites him over. They get drunk in her room, reminisce and Sutter says he's happy with his life living in the moment. Cassidy say she needs more than a moment; she needs a future, which Sutter can't do. Marcus, who is jealous of the way Sutter and Cassidy have fun, confronts Sutter, who reassures him that Cassidy doesn't want him anymore, but perhaps Marcus could lighten up sometimes.  Sutter has been avoiding Aimee and her friend Krystal ([[Kaitlyn Dever]]) warns him not to hurt her. Sutter takes Aimee to dinner at his sister Holly's ([[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]), who's married a wealthy lawyer and become a housewife. At dinner Aimee talks frankly about the death of her father from an opiate overdose and her dreams of a perfect marriage. Sutter and Aimee become more serious. Aimee invites Sutter over to have sex. Afterwards Sutter confesses that his mother kicked his father out when he was a child and has forbidden him from seeing him, even though he'd formerly lied and told her his father was an air force pilot. Sutter and Aimee make a pact to stand up to their mothers. Sutter buys Aimee a hip flask as a gift for prom, so they can drink together. Aimee is too shy to dance, so Sutter dances first with Cassidy and they're the center of attention, but then he drags Aimee onto the dance floor for a slow dance. The night goes well and Aimee tells him that she is going to college in Philadelphia where her sister lives, and can help her find an apartment and job in a bookstore. She asks Sutter to come with her and go to junior college there.  Sutter gets his father's ([[Kyle Chandler]]) phone number from Holly and arranges to meet up to see a baseball game, like they used to, and takes Aimee along. His father has forgotten about their plans and instead takes them to a local bar, then ditches them when he picks up a woman at the bar. He asks them to get the tab and meet him back at his motel, but when he fails to show up they find him back in the bar drinking with his mates, so they head home. Aimee attempts to comfort Sutter by telling him she loves him, but Sutter, angry and drunk, snaps at her. After almost causing an accident, he tells her he's no good for her and forces her to get out of the car. Aimee, crying and not paying attention to the road, is clipped by a passing car. Aimee has only a broken arm and immediately forgives Sutter for the incident, despite the fact that he had never driven her while sober. Meanwhile, Sutter is failing geometry, as he has always been bad at it and no longer has Aimee to tutor him.  At graduation, Sutter opens up his diploma and reveals that it is blank, implying that he failed senior year and did not technically graduate. After graduation, Sutter refuses to drink with Aimee from her flask. Cassidy informs Sutter that she is going to California with Marcus. He suggests he might pay a visit to them but Cassidy says it's a bad idea and she's trying to do things that are healthy for her. She hugs him goodbye and tells him he will always be her favorite ex-boyfriend. His boss, Dan ([[Bob Odenkirk]]), tells him he has to let go of some staff. He wants to keep Sutter on, because he is great with the clients, but only if he stops turning up drunk. Sutter says he can't promise that and quits.  Sutter then drives past Aimee, who is waiting for him by the bus to Philadelphia, leaving her heartbroken. He heads to a bar and explains to the barflies that it was for Aimee's own good. He drives home drunk, totals his mailbox, and gets in an argument with his mother ([[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]). He says he saw his father and he's just like him. His mother says he isn't like his father at all because he has a kind heart. Sutter reassesses his life and finally completes the personal statement for his college application, even though he knows it's way too late. He confesses that his biggest hardship is himself. Afraid of failure and getting hurt, he has tried to shut out everything and everybody, so while his life might not be "harder than normal," he has made it so with his own actions. While living in the now is okay, there will be another "now" the next day, and he will make sure his "nows" add up to something. He drives to Philadelphia and finds Aimee as she is leaving class. He looks up at her hopefully. She suppresses a smile when she sees him.

Spiders 3D
 Debris from a destroyed Soviet space station (where experiments were taking place on huge mutant spiders) fell toward Earth, crashing inside the tunnel of a New York City subway station. The film cuts to the subway station, where Jason Cole, a New York Transit subway supervisor, works. When the debris from the space station crashes into the tunnel, an alarm goes off and the authorities, afraid of a possible disease outbreak, begin evacuating passengers from the station. Jason's coworker Jimmy  descends into the subway tunnel to investigate the area, telling Jason that he believes the debris is the remains of the Russian spacecraft. Jimmy feels something bite his leg, and suddenly starts to stumble, falling on the third rail, electrocuting himself.  Jason's ex-wife Rachel, who is a coroner with the New York City Dept of Health, discovers a cluster of large, strange-looking "insect eggs" inside Jimmy's body.  She saves the eggs in a canister for further study.   Meanwhile, at the site of the spacecraft crash, men in hazmat suits investigate for radioactive material.  The find a piece of debris and bring it to a Russian doctor working on-site, who says it is "nothing to worry about."  The authorities declare the area "clear" and safe for reopening the subway station. except for Rachel, saying there are "waste disposal issues". One man says they'll do their best to fix it by rush hour. The debris is said to be from the soviet union.  Back at the subway station, rats have infested the tunnels. The smell has gotten so bad that the subways were shut back down. Pest control is brought down to the source of the problem, an abandoned subway cart. Near it they find several bodies of homeless men, covered in webs filled with eggs. One of the men is then attacked by hundreds of spiders, which swarm his body.  The authorities quarantine the area, reroute the subways to go around it, and jam cell phone service in the area. They tell the public that there is a "virus outbreak". Men in hazmat suits capture the spiders and put them in a large cage. Back at the morgue, a Dr. Darnoff, working in cooperation with the Russians, examines Jimmy's body and the eggs. He explains that Jimmy's body contained the queen spider egg, which is always implanted in the first host, which was Jimmy. Darnoff explains that 20 years ago, a spacecraft was discovered under the ice.  They took the genes from the aliens found in the craft, and injected it into many different creatures, but spiders were the only ones with the structure to carry the gene and survive. He then explained that the queen spider can weave an infinite supply of lightweight, bulletproof material that will give the nation that controls it a military and industrial advantage. A U.S. Army colonel, Jenkins, who is revealed to be also working with the Russians, tells his men to kill off the people they quarantined. Darnoff tries to save the people by telling Jenkins killing them is longer necessary, since they already have the queen spider egg.  However, Jenkins tells the Darnoff to mind his own business.  The doctor also reveals that if they do not get the queen egg to the nest the spiders are building to protect her, she will die in 12 hours.  Investigators see Rachel's report on the eggs found in the bodies and quarantine her apartment with her daughter Emily inside, saying she is "infected". They try to quarantine Jason as well, but he escapes. When tests are done on the eggs Jason brought to Rachel, it is found that they have no bacteria on them. Which is unusual because "everything on earth has bacteria."  Two men, apparently also working for Darnoff, manage to grab Rachel's purse which contains the canister holding the queen egg, from her car as she leaves her underground garage.  Rachel calls Jason, who tells her to leave her car, as they are now being hunted by the Russians and their cohorts.  Meanwhile, the spiders grow to giant proportions and begin to come up to street level from the subway tunnels.  Jason and Rachel head towards their apartment to rescue Emily.  They travel underground to avoid capture using the subway tunnels that Jason is familiar with, meeting huge and vicious spiders who attack them.  However, they manage to fight off the spiders and reach the apartment, but learn through texting that Emily left and is hiding in a toy store.  Jenkins moves out to capture the queen to acquire her webbing. Darnoff advises him not to, as she is still dependent on the other spiders, but Jenkins ignores him.  Just then, the queen emerges from the ground and eats the doctor, who was in awe of her beauty.  Jason and Rachel make it to the toy store. When they don't find Emily, Jason calls her but receives no answer. They hear her yelling and climb down to the tunnels to find her. They run into more spiders along the way and barricade a door to escape them. They find Emily and begin tearing at the webbing. They climb up a ladder that leads to the streets but Jason stays behind to fight off the queen who is coming for them. Jason begins breaking the eggs along the walls, which angers the queen. It chases him into a subway train, which it can't fit in due to its size. Jason finds the train's controls and drives it into a tunnel where the spider won't fit. He exits the train after sending it backwards through the tunnel, where the spider is waiting at the opening. The train crashes into the spider and at the same time, smashes gas pipes on the wall, starting a huge fireball that kills the spiders below ground, including the queen.  Jason, Rachel and Emily reunite on the street, where soldiers load dead spiders into a huge truck.  As the final scene slowly fades, a mutant spider is seen crawling across a broken traffic signal, and the film ends.

Star Trek Into Darkness
  In 2259, Captain [[James T. Kirk]] is removed from command of the starship [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']]  for violating the [[Prime Directive]] after exposing the ship to the primitive inhabitants of the planet Nibiru in order to save them, and Spock, from a cataclysmic volcanic eruption. Admiral [[Christopher Pike (Star Trek)|Christopher Pike]] is reinstated as commanding officer with Kirk demoted to the rank of Commander and first officer. Commander [[Spock]] is transferred to another ship. Shortly after, the [[Section 31]] installation in [[London]] is bombed by renegade Starfleet operative John Harrison. Harrison attacks Starfleet Headquarters in a [[List of Star Trek Starfleet starships ordered by class#Shuttlecraft|jumpship]] during an emergency meeting about the situation, killing Pike and other senior officers. Kirk disables the jumpship, but Harrison transports to [[Klingon#Homeworld|Kronos]], homeworld of the hostile [[Klingon]]s.  Admiral Alexander Marcus reinstates Kirk and Spock to ''Enterprise'' with orders to kill Harrison using a new long range stealth photon torpedo. Chief Engineer [[Scotty (Star Trek)|Montgomery Scott]] objects to allowing untested torpedoes on board the ship without knowing their specifications; when he is overruled, he resigns. Kirk assigns [[Pavel Chekov]] to replace Scotty. En route to Kronos, ''Enterprise''s warp capabilities become disabled. Kirk leads a team with Spock and [[Uhura]] onto the planet in a small landing craft, where they are ambushed by Klingon patrols who order them to land. Uhura leaves the landing craft to talk to the Klingons. They decide to kill Uhura, but Harrison kills them. After the battle, Harrison demands that Kirk tell him the number of torpedoes on board the ''Enterprise'', surrendering when Spock tells him.  Dr. [[Leonard McCoy]] and Marcus's daughter, Dr. Carol Marcus, open a torpedo at Harrison's behest, revealing a man in cryogenic stasis. Upon further investigation, all the other experimental torpedoes are revealed to similarly contain cryogenically frozen humans. Harrison is taken to the ship's brig, where he reveals his true identity as [[Khan Noonien Singh|Khan]], a genetically engineered superhuman awoken by Admiral Marcus from centuries of [[cryonics|suspended animation]] to develop advanced weapons. Khan reveals that Marcus sabotaged ''Enterprise''s warp drive, intending for the Klingons to destroy the ship after it fired on Kronos, creating an act of war by the Klingon Empire. Khan also gives Kirk a set of coordinates. Kirk contacts Scotty on Earth and asks him to investigate. Scotty discovers the coordinates lead to a covert Starfleet facility near Jupiter.  ''Enterprise'' is intercepted by a much larger Starfleet warship, USS ''Vengeance'', commanded by Admiral Marcus. Marcus demands that Kirk deliver Khan, but ''Enterprise'' flees to Earth to expose him. After ''Vengeance'' disables ''Enterprise'' near the Moon, Carol reveals her presence aboard the ship. Marcus forcibly transports Carol to ''Vengeance'' before ordering ''Enterprise''s destruction. Kirk offers Khan and himself for the lives of his crew, but Marcus rejects Kirk's offer, revealing he never intended to spare them and ordering ''Vengeance'' to attack. ''Vengeance'' suddenly loses power after being sabotaged by Scotty, who infiltrated the ship. With transporters down, Kirk and Khan, with the latter's knowledge of the warship's design, [[space diving|space-jump]] to ''Vengeance''. Spock contacts his older self, who warns that Khan is ruthless and untrustworthy and that Khan's older self was only defeated at a terrible cost. After capturing the bridge, Khan overpowers Kirk, Scott and Carol, kills Marcus, and takes control of ''Vengeance''.  Khan demands that Spock return his crew in exchange for the ''Enterprise'' officers. Spock complies but surreptitiously removes Khan's frozen crew from the torpedoes and arms the warheads. Khan beams Kirk, Scott and Carol aboard ''Enterprise'', but betrays their agreement by attacking ''Enterprise''; however, ''Vengeance'' is disabled when the torpedoes detonate. With both starships caught in Earth's gravity, they plummet toward the surface. Kirk enters the radioactive reactor chamber to realign the warp core, sacrificing himself to save the ship.  Khan crashes the ''Vengeance'' into downtown [[San Francisco]] in an attempt to destroy Starfleet headquarters. Khan escapes the wreckage so Spock transports down in pursuit. McCoy discovers that Khan's blood has regenerative properties that may save Kirk. Spock pursues Khan through the city and is about to kill him, but Uhura stops him. Khan's blood revives Kirk. One year later, Kirk speaks at ''Enterprise''s re-dedication ceremony. Khan is sealed in his cryogenic pod and stored with his compatriots. The ''Enterprise'' crew embarks on a five-year exploratory mission.  
Stalingrad (2013 film)
 The film opens in Japan in the wake of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 earthquake and tsunami]].  As emergency personnel work to reach some victims trapped underground, one rescuer tries to keep the victims calm by telling the story of how he came to have five fathers, all killed during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|the Great Patriotic War]] (World War II).  The trapped victims are young German students and the rescuers are Russian.  In 1942, after the initial attack on Stalingrad, a small group of Russian soldiers take cover in a large five story residential building that happens to provide cover for a Russian crossing point on the [[Volga River|Volga river]]. Five of these soldiers become the five fathers in the story: Polyakov ("Angel") who had become embittered when his wife and daughter were killed in an air raid; Chvanov, whose hatred of the Germans comes from their cruel treatment and methodical murder of his family; Nikiforov, a talented [[tenor]] singer before the war, who had become a cruel and vicious fighter; Sergey, drafted into the war as a spotter; and Captain Gromov, a veteran and hero who leads the group after finding them.  The soldiers encounter a young girl named Katya, living alone in the building after her family had been killed. As they spend the next few days together, the soldiers grow fond of her, and she of them.  Germans encamped near the crossing are led by [[Hauptmann]] Kahn; a highly decorated, but disillusioned soldier who falls in love with a Russian woman named Masha, who resembles his late wife. She at first detests him, but soon begins to reciprocate his love, although they cannot speak each other's language.  [[Oberstleutnant]] Henze arrives to take command of the Germans. He chides Kahn both for his attraction to Masha, as well as his failure to eradicate the Russian soldiers. Henze decides to set an example by rounding up the Russian civilians living in the bombed out buildings, then burning a woman and her daughter alive. This enrages the Russian soldiers who ambush the Germans, killing several, but losing several of their own men in the process. The Germans and Russians then retreat to their own shelters to wait the others out. One afternoon, Chvanov teaches Katya how to aim her gun at a German washing himself at a water faucet and startled, accidentally shoots him, which causes retaliation that injures Chvanov.   During one of his visits to Masha, Kahn promises to take her to safety when the time comes. On her 19th birthday, Katya is presented with a handmade cake from the soldiers, with a song by Nikiforov, whom she had earlier recognized as a famous singer. She is then given the gift of a bathtub filled with hot water, a luxury no one has experienced since the siege began.  Sergey takes Katya to his old lookout spot, located in a building not occupied by either the Germans or the Russians.  The two spend the night together, unknowingly creating the narrator of our story.  After Polyakov ricocheted an artillery shell into the German complex, Kahn is ordered to begin the attack on them; he takes Masha to an abandoned building, hoping to save her from the coming fight. As she begs him to stay with her, she is shot by Chvanov for being a collaborator, enraging Kahn. Nikiforov is taken captive by the Germans, where he manages to brutally stab Henze before being killed himself. Henze's death puts Kahn back in charge.  German reinforcements arrive with [[Panzer IV|tanks]] that have the range to take out the Russian soldiers and their building. They open fire, fatally injuring Chvanov. Kahn and his soldiers attack, shooting Polyakov to death. Kahn then finds Gromov on the second floor trying to use a radio. The two of them shoot each other several times before collapsing. Sergey reaches them and uses the radio to order an air strike on their building, which is being overrun by German soldiers. Katya watches with a broken heart as the building is leveled, leaving no one inside alive.  Back in the present day, the Germans are freed from the building. The girl to whom Sergey (who had been named after his biological father) had told his story seeks him out, and they share a moment of understanding before he is driven away.

Steins;Gate: The Movie − Load Region of Déjà Vu
   The film takes place in August 2011, one year after [[Steins;Gate (TV series)|the events of the anime series]]. After going through a painstaking journey across multiple 'World Lines' due to the invention of 'D-Mail', text messages that can be sent to the past, Rintaro Okabe has assumedly landed in the "Steins Gate" World Line, in which he was able to prevent the deaths of both Mayuri Shiina and Kurisu Makise, as well as prevent a future ruled by [[CERN|SERN]] due to the invention of a time machine that no longer exists. On August 3, Kurisu arrives in Japan for a press conference and reunites with all the members of the Future Gadget Laboratory. Meanwhile, Rintaro starts having intense side effects from his time travels, seeing visions of alternate Worldlines. The next day on August 4, a mysterious visitor shows up at Kurisu's hotel, telling her to remember three things: a cell phone, a microwave oven, and SERN. Later that day, as Kurisu is talking to Rintaro about how her own instances of déjà vu may be similar to Rintaro's 'Reading Steiner' ability to remember things from other World Lines, Rintaro suddenly disappears before Kurisu's eyes. Furthermore, no one else seems to remember Rintaro ever existed, with Kurisu barely retaining a faint memory of someone.  A week later on August 11, as Kurisu finds a fork that Rintaro left behind and remembers the words the stranger left her, she learns Itaru "Daru" Hashida had for some reason hacked SERN, suddenly giving her the urge to build a Time Leap machine. Using the machine, Kurisu leaps back to the night of August 3, where she observes Rintaro disappearing and reappearing from existence, with everyone's memories of him changing accordingly. She is then contacted by the visitor from before, revealed to be Suzuha Amane, who came from the future using a time machine Kurisu built. She explains to both Kurisu and Rintaro that all the memories of World Lines Rintaro had visited is overloading his Reading Steiner, causing him to fluctuate between the current world line and the "R" world line, the only other world line where neither Mayuri nor Kurisu die. Suzuha states the only way to save him from vanishing completely is to use a time machine to travel to the past, but Rintaro ostensibly refuses, as he feels neither time machines nor time leap machines should exist and doesn't want Kurisu to go through the same suffering he went through, saying he would rather disappear to allow her and Mayuri to live in peace. He instead urges Kurisu to forget about him, leaving her with a kiss.  As Rintaro disappears once again the next day, Kurisu breaks down in tears before grudgingly deciding to accept his wish and try to forget him. Later, on August 13, as the Future Gadget Lab gets word that it might have to close up, Kurisu is once again approached by Suzuha, who tells her that she is not being honest with her own feelings, eventually convincing Kurisu to go with her in her time machine. In order to keep Rintaro in the Steins Gate world line, he must be implanted with a powerful memory that helps distinguish it from other world lines. The two travel back to June 30, 2005, where Kurisu attempts to talk with the young Rintaro, only to result in him getting into a car accident instead, leaving her too afraid to attempt another trip to the past. Back in the present, Kurisu discovers Mayuri and the others also possess faint memories of Rintaro, which are soon awakened when she does an imitation of his persona, Kyouma Hououin. Encouraged by everyone's feelings, Kurisu returns to the past, this time succeeding in her mission by implanting the concept of Kyouma Hououin into Rintaro's mind and giving him his first kiss, which led him to take on his 'mad scientist' persona to protect Mayuri. With this, Kurisu manages to bring Rintaro back to the Steins Gate world line and the movie ends with Rintaro asking Kurisu if she will return his first kiss to him. Smiling, Kurisu says "Never".

The Buddies then begin noticing that the rings have given them powers; Super strength, physic abilities, super speed, super elasticity and invisibility. The puppies, which Budderball dubbed "Super buddies", decided to use these new powers to help Fernfield and start by saving an ungrateful cat from a tree, but accidentally damaging sheriff Dan's police car.

Superman: Unbound
 Offering herself as a hostage, Lois Lane is caught in an aerial confrontation between her terrorist captors and the unpredictable [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] before [[Superman]] arrives to save the day. Soon after, knowing Superman's civilian identity, Lois attempts to get Clark Kent to make their relationship public despite his fear of the consequences, but their argument is halted by a ''[[Daily Planet]]'' staff meeting before Kent leaves after being alerted to an approaching meteor. Intercepting it, Superman learns the meteor is actually a robot that he promptly defeats before activating its beacon and taking it to the [[Fortress of Solitude]]. With help from a fearful Supergirl, Superman learns the robot is actually a drone controlled by a being named [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], a Coluan scientist who subjected himself to extensive motor, skeletal and cybernetic enhancements, turning him from a human like, thin, and hairless being to a muscular, red eyed giant with computer like components and enhanced physical abilities comparible to Superman's. Supergirl, horrified at seeing Brainiac, reveals from her experience with the monster. Brainiac seized and miniaturized [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]'s capital city of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]] prior to the planet's destruction with her father and mother attempting to track him down before they mysteriously lost contact with Krypton. She is now worried that Brainiac will do to the world what he did to Kandor.  Fearing more drones would come, Superman flies through the galaxy with a Kryptonian spacecraft in an attempt to track down Brainiac before finding his drones attacking a planet. Though he attempts to stop them, Superman witnesses Brainiac capture the planet's capital like he did with Kandor before firing a Solar Aggressor missile to consume the planet in its exploding sun. The explosion knocks Superman unconscious and he is brought on board Brainiac’s skull shaped, tentacled ship. Coming to in the examination room, he fights his way through the vessel before he discovers a room full of bottled cities prior to being attacked by Brainiac. At this point, confirming that he spared Krypton because of its eventual destruction, Brainiac is shown that he has been collecting information on all the planets he visited and uploading it into his neural core before destroying them. Using Superman's spacecraft and his telepathic abilities, Brainiac discovers  that he has been living on Earth. Brainiac decides to chart a course to Earth while sending Superman into Kandor. Inside Kandor, his strength waning due to the artificial red sun, Superman meets his uncle [[Zor-El]] and aunt Alura. They explain that Brainiac was instructed to learn all that is knowable about the galaxy. Being a cyborg, Brainiac interpreted his directive literally and realized that he could not achieve this goal because life keeps changing. His knowledge of one world would become out-of-date as soon as he moved on to the next world. Brainiac therefore destroys civilizations after studying them so that they cannot change further, thus leaving him with a literally complete and up-to-date knowledge of them.  Superman formulates a plan and escapes Kandor using the subjugator robots. From there, Superman disables Brainiac's ship and takes Kandor with him back to Earth. At that time, Lois learns from Supergirl why Superman left and alerts the Pentagon of a possible invasion by Brainiac, who eventually repairs his ship and arrives in Metropolis.  Despite everyone, including Supergirl, doing their best to fend his drones off, Metropolis is encased in a bottle and both Superman and Supergirl are captured. Having hooked Superman up to his ship, Braniac reveals that Earth offers nothing to him, tortures Superman by overloading his mind with data to obtain Kandor and attempts to destroy the planet. However, telling his captor what Earth means to him, Superman breaks free and then frees Supergirl and convinces her to stop the Solar-Aggressor from hitting the sun. Remembering Zor-El's words about Brainiac's ideals, Superman knocks him out of the ship and they crash into a swamp. As he fights Braniac, Superman forces the cyborg to experience the chaos of life itself outside of the safe, artificial environments he has created. Eventually, the combined mental and physical strain takes its toll on Brainiac and he combusts and is reduced to ash and molten machinery. After restoring Metropolis, taking Kandor to another planet to restore its normal size and establishing a Kryptonian colony where they can rebuild, Superman makes his love life with Lois as Kent public with a marriage proposal.  In the post-credits Brainiac's remains that are placed in the Fortress of Solitude glow indicating that Brainiac still has some degree of his power.

A kid takes the Idol from the ground and presents it to his friend who in turn presents it to her daughter in law. That man sells this Idol to a Goldsmith at [[Alappuzha]] of [[Kerala]] for 6,000. That Goldsmith sells it to another rich man at [[Mangalore]] of [[Karnataka]] for 37,000. He in turn sells it to another rich man at [[Shimoga]] of Karnataka for 1,90,000. This idol is sold to another rich man at [[Bellary]] of Karnataka for 0.5 million. Th idol is sold to a millionaire at Thiruchanur of Tamil Nadu for 2 million which in turn is sold at [[Madurai]] for 6 million which reaches to a Trader at [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] for a value of 11 million.  The story then shifts to four lives Surya ([[Nikhil Siddharth]]), Bhanu ([[Pooja Ramachandran]]), Ravi ([[Sathya (actor)|Sathya]]) and Swati ([[Swati Reddy]]). While Surya, Bhanu, Ravi are pick pocketers who rob people together, Swati is a Journalist whose parents left for USA for a short duration. Swati buys a Yellow color Vespa vehicle which is stolen by Surya while being chased by a person as Surya and Ravi rob him. After giving complaint to the Police, Swati finds Surya riding her Vehicle. Surya, after being stopped by Swati, represents himself as a Software Engineer working at HP who bought this vehicle from a Third party. Surya and Swati become friends and Surya later introduces Bhanu and Ravi to Swati as his colleagues in HP. Mean while Giri (Ravi Varma) goes to buy the Idol from the Trader on behalf of Durga Prasad ([[Ravi Babu]]), a criminal whose obligation is to deliver the Idol to a Minister in order to get exonerated from all his cases and joining politics. Giri kills the Trader, takes the Idol and goes to Durga's house and gives him the money he sent for and tells that the trader was dead and the Idol is missing.  Later Durga gives the same Money Bag to his personal Lawyer and finds Blood Stains on the Bag. He sends his henchmen to trace Giri and get the Idol from him. However Giri keeps the Idol in the Hand Bag of Swati when he hits Surya and Swati when they were riding their Vespa vehicle and notes the vehicle number. At Swati's home, Chotu, a kid who is a friend of Surya, steals the Idol from her hand bag and gives it to Surya. Surya along with Bhanu and Ravi approaches Shankar ([[Jeeva (Telugu actor)|Jeeva]]) via Jogi (Praveen), who is entitled for a commission of 10% of the sale price. Shankar decides to sell it for 50 million but Ravi foolishly reveals in a hurry that they are lucky to get 0.5 million. They go to Swati's house that night and celebrate terming salary hike as the reason. Next morning Durga goes to Swati's home, searches her handbag, kills Giri in front of them and demands them to tell the whereabouts of the Idol. During the Journey to Shankar's house, two professional killers (Jogi Krishnam Raju and Jogi Naidu) threaten them to vacate the car as they are in a hurry to escape from the police. At this point the trio and Swati flee to Swati's friend Dolly's house.  Shankar sells the Idol to two Africans (Alex and Elves) who approached Shankar via Jogi. There one of the African gets tempted after he sees Vijji (Shravanthi), a close person of Shankar. Jogi is insulted by Shankar by denying to give his commission after the African party left away. Jogi is humiliated by this and calls the trio to meet him the next hour. There Jogi asks Surya to get Shankar's purse before he reaches the place of Consignment where the price would be transferred by showing a 10 Dollars note given by the African Duo. If the note is brought, it would be shared among the trio and Jogi in equal ratio. The trio successfully get his purse without his knowledge and tear the note into two equal halves, one with Surya and one with Jogi. Surya then comes to know that Swati is kidnapped by Durga and he requires the Idol in an hour in order to set Swati free. Thus Surya calls Shankar and comes to know by him that the Idol is in Novotel after he gave his half note. Jogi then calls Shankar to bring 50 million if he needs the other half to Novotel. Meanwhile, Vijji seduces the African, ties his hands with a tight shirt and gets the locker code and flees away with the Idol. Surya after trashing the other in the same way comes to know about the Locker code, goes to the room only to find an empty locker and being chased by the African Duo with Guns in their hands.  At the cellar of Novotel Shankar gets his half note and shows the 50 million cash in a bag. In no time the trio, ignorant of the presence of the bag in the car, get into it along with Vijji and go away. Shankar chases them in his car, Jogi chases them in his friend's car, the African Duo chase them in a car which they get by threatening the owner of it to vacate. Bhanu snatches the Idol from Vijji and leaves her away on the road. Surya is summoned by Durga to Dog House to give the Idol and take Swati away. The cars of Surya, Shankar, Jogi, African Duo, Minister reach there and all of them enter the Dog House. The Professional Killers, who robbed Durga's car in the past are employed by the Minister to kill Durga, reach there and wait outside for the right time. Here, Surya is aimed by Shankar by a Gun who in turn is aimed by Jogi with a Gun. Jogi is aimed by the African Duo who are in turn aimed by Durga. Durga is aimed by a Gangster who in turn is aimed by Durga's henchman. The Minister who enters at this point is aimed by Shankar with his second gun, forming a nearly completed circle.  The killers enter the room and in a chaos, every one is killed except the trio, Swati, Durga and one of the Africans. The African and Durga shoot each other fatally and the trio along  with Swati flee away with the Idol. In the journey to home, Swati declares her love for Surya to her mother in his presence. Meanwhile, the tyre gets punctured and the trio get down to check the tyre. But in the car's Decklid they find the bag containing 50 million. The trio jump in joy while Swati is ignorant of this and remains normal.

Syrup (film)
 A young man named Scat comes up with a new idea for a drink after he drops his drink and swears, calling it 'FUKK'. He goes to Addison Cola Company where he maneuvers a meeting with a formidable marketing executive, Six, by triggering the fire alarm. While mediocre, she tells him that she and her team will polish it before it is presented to the board. During the meeting, the board shows some resistance but Six informs them that Scat is willing to give up trademark provisions for a mere two million. Scat then realizes he has not reserved the trademark and scrambles to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|Patent and Trademark Office]] only to find out that his roommate, Sneaky Pete, stole his idea and registered it earlier that morning.   Success befalls Pete as 'FUKK' becomes the highest selling energy drink in the nation. Embittered, Scat goes back to his ordinary life but is later recruited by Six to help her come up with a new ad campaign after she is booted off the 'FUKK' campaign and relegated to Addy Classics. Instructed to come up with a brilliant idea by Friday (only five days away), Scat moves in with Six and is unable to think of anything until only moments before the deadline. After shaking a vending machine in frustration and Six telling him that twelve people have died by being crushed by vending machines, he comes up with the idea of 'Wouldn't you die for a Fukk' advertising a cartoon where people die by being crushed by vending machines because they want the drink so badly. The ad is accepted and aired but a young teenager dies by being crushed by a vending machine and the ad is now considered insensitive and taken off air. Scat and Six attend the funeral and when Scat makes a speech, Six points out that all the mourners are actors that she recognizes from ads. Scat quickly realizes that Sneaky Pete created this fake death to get their ad to fail, and he quickly pulls out the fake body from the coffin and holds it up for all to see.   Scat is fired while believing that Six remains at the company. In reality, Six quit when Addison refused to keep Scat, now working at a shoe store. After a brief stint as a rickshaw driver, Scat is hired by a rival company and Six is also poached. As Scat and Six are being hired Six drops a name tag from her work, possibly revealing a glimpse of her real name (appearing to be Elizabeth), before she quickly covers and retrieves the name tag. The two must come up with a new drink idea and after talking about their attraction for each other, Scat comes up with the idea of 'Average KOK'. He presents this as a drink to the board and also thinks of a different drink just called 'KOK' that they give to celebrities. The normal 'KOK's are numbered up to 100 and each number represents a celebrity and the celebrity deems who can drink their numbered drink. After the frenzy for the drink that they can't have, Scat and the company decide to make the drink go public but not before the suicide of a teenager who killed himself after not being 'cool' enough to drink his lucky number 17's corresponding drink. After confirming that this time the death is real, Scat goes on TV to apologize but ends up pointing out that drink sales have never been higher even after the death and that people, like him, 'have a dream'. Scat walks along watching himself on the TV displays and Six finds him. Scat tells her his real name is 'Michael' and asks for her real name. They kiss, but Six insists that "Six" is her name. Scat says, "It's been a pleasure doing business with you, Six," and walks away.

Margus has delayed leaving until he can harvest his lucrative tangerine crop. Ivo, a carpenter, is attempting to make enough wooden crates to hold all the unpicked tangerines, but doesn't reveal his reasons for staying.   Two [[Chechen people|Chechen]] mercenaries fighting alongside the [[Abkhazians|Abkhaz]] separatists show up and demand food from Ivo before leaving peacefully. However, they get into a firefight with [[Georgians|Georgian]] soldiers in front of Margus' house, leaving only one alive from each side. Ahmed (Giorgi Nakashidze), the surviving Chechen, and Nika (Mikheil Meskhi), a Georgian volunteer, are both gravely wounded, and Ivo brings them into his home to nurse them back to health.  While both vow to kill each other once they have the strength, Ivo secures a pledge from each to not enact any vengeance under his roof. A great deal of tension ensues between the two enemies as they begin to recover over many days in the same tiny house. Slowly, the two begin to recognize the humanity and honor in each other. Under the moral tutelage of the senior and wise Ivo, the two move from hatred and antagonism, to respect and camaraderie.   When Abkhaz soldiers come to the house, Ivo convinces Ahmed to tell them that Nika is also a fellow Chechen, but whose head wound has left him unable to speak.

That night, however, shelling hits the village, destroying Margus' property.

They are about to execute him when Nika shoots them from the house with a machine gun. In the firefight Margus is killed. Ahmed and Nika partner to fight the Russians, but Nika is shot dead by a wounded Russian before Ahmed finishes off Nika's killer.  Ivo and Ahmed bury Margus and Nika.

Back at home, Judith and her mother Sarah get into an argument, which leads to Sarah slapping Judith and leaving. Judith refuses to talk to Brice about their argument and goes to take a shower. She later leaves him to be with Harley.  Janice fires Judith after finding out about her and Harley's plans, and the two have a falling-out. Brice discovers Judith is having an affair and heads to Harley's party. Brice drags Judith outside and begs her to return to him, but Judith chooses to stay with Harley. Brice goes over to Melinda's place where she comforts him and encourages him that things will get better. Judith returns to the apartment she shared with Brice to pick up a laptop and becomes surrounded by her mother and church members' prayer circle. Sarah grabs Judith, trying to prevent her from leaving. Harley knocks Sarah down and forces Judith to leave. At Harley's, Judith is outraged by his treatment of her mother and after a heated argument, Harley begins to beat her after she attempts to leave.  Brice has dinner with Melinda.

Cut back to present day, the marriage counselor has finished the story and Lisa wonders how the story ends. The marriage counselor tells her that Judith contracted HIV as well, but not Brice. Lisa thanks the marriage counselor and decides to stay with her husband.  The marriage counselor (revealed to be an older Judith) then goes to the pharmacy to get her medicine from Brice. After they speak, a woman and a little boy walk into the pharmacy, revealed to be Brice's new wife and child, making it clear things didn't work out between the two. Judith then walks out of the pharmacy and heads to church, to meet with her mother as the credits start rolling.  
Tarzan (2013 film)
  65,000,000 years ago, a mountain-sized meteor, bristling with unknown energies, crashed into the Earth in what is now the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] in [[Mexico]], with a major chunk of the object landing in [[Central Africa]]. The impact and resulting ecological catastrophe causes the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|extinction of the dinosaurs]].  In present day, wealthy industrialist John Greystoke has been funding an expedition into the jungles of [[Africa]] to locate the meteor, now a legend, and harness its unique energy as a solution to the looming energy crisis. Despite the best efforts by scientist and adventurer James Porter, the expedition is a failure, and John is preparing to leave Africa with his wife, Alice, and their son, John Jr. As their pilot takes them over the jungle, the family sees a lone male [[mountain gorilla]] journeying to find a new family. The huge ape makes a display of threat at the passing helicopter and continues on his way.  Not far away, the rogue, Tublat, comes across a troop of his fellow gorillas, led by a silverback male named Kerchak. In a fight for dominance, Kerchak defeats the rogue and begins to return to his mate, Kala, and their newborn child, only for Tublat to deal him a fatal blow by smashing a huge stone over Kerchak's head. Kala and the others can only look on in horror as Tublat asserts his control over the family.  On a course that takes them over a semi-active volcano, the Greystokes' helicopter's instruments begin to go haywire. As the pilot struggles to regain control, they find themselves over the resting site of the meteor, now a mountain in the heart of the jungle and guarded by [[baboon]]s. Landing to investigate, John explores a cave that leads him into the heart of the mountain, where he discovers rock formations that glow with a pulsing red light. Using his pickax, John attempts to collect a sample for study, only to cause a chain reaction that awakens the nearby volcano. Despite their best efforts to escape, the helicopter crashes, and only John Jr. is spared. Johnny is discovered by Kala, who has recently lost her child to Tublat's regime after he falls to his death into the [[valley]], and taken back to her nest, where the kindly she-ape nurses him back to health. Befriending three young gorillas, Johnny is adopted into the troop and discards his former identity, choosing to be called "Tarzan", a name he made up meaning "Ape with no fur".  As the years pass, Tarzan grows up learning the ways and skills of the jungle animals, such as [[monkeys]] and a [[leopard]]. By the time he is a teenager, his senses and reflexes are honed to such a point that he can catch a striking viper with one hand.

One day, after venturing further than his friends are willing to go, Tarzan catches sight of a group of humans in a jeep. In the years since the Greystokes' disappearance, Dr. James Porter has continued to fund his expeditions by acting as a jungle guide for wealthy tourists. On this particular trip, he is joined by his daughter [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], who is spending her summer vacation with him.  During a routine photographic safari, the Porters' latest clients' son wanders away from the group and unwraps a candy bar, unwittingly attracting the attention of a large, dinosaur-like flightless bird. Jane saves him by attracting the bird's attention but it soon chases her, along with others of its kind. Jane manages to escape, only to be bitten on the arm by a [[Viperidae|viper]] nesting in the bushes. Tarzan, infatuated with the young woman, scoops her up and carries her to a shelter, watching over her all night. The next day, still woozy from the snake's venom, but very much alive, Jane stumbles back into her father's camp. With only vague, fever-dream images of Tarzan in her mind, Jane cannot truly explain her rescue and chalks most of it up to a bad dream. Still, as she and her father drive away, Jane whispers a good-bye to her rescuer and leaves one of her bandages behind. Tarzan picks it up and carries it back home.  Confused and frustrated by exposure to humans after so long, Tarzan becomes inconsolable. He ignores the company of Kala and his gorilla friends and leaves the troop's territory. His wanderings eventually bring him back to the sight of the helicopter crash, where long-forgotten memories come flooding back to him. Tarzan finds a meteor stone which his father had taken as sample. Tarzan builds a shelter out of branches and bamboo around the crash and makes it his retreat, gathering anything interesting he can find it from the wreck, including his father's hunting knife.  As the years continue to roll by, Tarzan, now a man, returns to his retreat to find Tublat nosing around. Using a combination of his father's hunting knife and intimidation, Tarzan chases the silverback away and sets about putting his hideaway back in order. Unknown by Tarzan during his rummaging, Tublat activated the helicopter's emergency beacon. The transmission is received by Greystoke Energies in [[New York (state)|New York.]] William Clayton, [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the company since John and Alice's disappearance, knowing what his former employer was looking for, sees only a chance to make money. When the office is visited by Jane Porter, now a young woman working for a conservation group, Clayton plays on her hopes, promising to fund her group if she will accompany him and his assistant to Africa to speak with her father.  It is only in Africa where Clayton's true nature is revealed: cold, cruel, and calculating. He is willing to threaten the very lives of the Porters in order to get what he wants and has no care for what might happen if the meteor is disturbed. Disgusted by his callousness, Jane leaves the party and wanders into the jungle where Tarzan all but immediately finds her. Astounded by seeing her rescuer again after all the years in between, Jane begins to travel with Tarzan, who helps her survive the various dangers of the jungle until they reach his refuge. Tarzan, as a mark of love, chips off a piece of the meteor rock and gives it to Jane, when she realizes the meteor was never a legend and it really is hidden in the jungle. When the rest of the group tracks Jane down to Tarzan's hideaway in a helicopter, Clayton is shocked to find the Greystoke heir alive and well, and thus a threat to his power. Clayton opens fire on Tarzan and Jane with a high-powered rifle, attempting to kill Tarzan. Fleeing for their lives, Tarzan and Jane are forced to enter a mysterious valley, which has come under the effects of the meteor's unique energies for millions of years, causing bizarre mutations in the local flora and fauna. Ordinary jungle plants become dangerous predatory monsters. After using his knife to defeat one of these beasts, before the monster nearly eaten Jane, Tarzan and Jane find their way into a twisting labyrinth of caves that goes on for miles, finally finding their way into the heart of the meteor itself. Here, Tarzan discovers his father's long abandoned pickaxe from all those years ago, and utters a single word, "Greystoke". It is here where Jane realizes Tarzan's true identity as John and Alice Greystoke's son and heir. She asks how Tarzan has survived alone in the jungle all these years, to which the wild man replies that his family took care of him.  Back in the gorilla troop's nesting ground, Kala continues to worry over her son. Just then, one of Tarzan's friends gallops up to her and alerts her to Tarzan's homecoming and the fact he has apparently taken a mate during his time away. Tarzan happily embraces his friends and family and introduces Jane to Kala, who is overjoyed at her son's choice in a female. Unfortunately, the happy reunion is cut short by Tublat, who is enraged at Tarzan's return. Finally having enough of Tublat's selfish and bullying behavior toward the family, Tarzan challenges him for the right to lead, and willingly forgoes his knife. At first, Tublat dominates the fight with his brute strength, but Tarzan demonstrates quick thinking and catches the tyrant by surprise, bringing Tublat to the flat of his back, defeated. Rather than kill the rogue, Tarzan allows Tublat to live with his humiliation and exiles him from the troop. His long-time enemy defeated, Tarzan ascends to the high rocks overlooking the nesting grounds and beats his chest, letting out a loud, long cry of victory (the famous [[Tarzan yell|ape man cry]]). That night, under the stars, Jane and Tarzan admit to their love.  Jane and Tarzan discover that Dr. James Porter's base camp has been transformed into a virtual armed base by an army of [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] Clayton has brought. Jane realizes that her father will not stop unless he finds her, and that in turn might endanger Tarzan, Kala and the gorilla family's entire home. She decides to head back. Clayton sees Jane heading back to the camp and notices the stone Tarzan gave her. Tarzan watches the events unfold from a distance and shows up, sensing danger as Clayton and his men hold Jane at gunpoint. Clayton knows almost immediately that he is talking to the heir of Greystoke Energies. Kala, who followed Jane and Tarzan, runs in to protect them, much to Tarzan's horror, and gets shot by Clayton, falling unconscious. Tarzan is attacked from behind and locked in a cage.  On regaining consciousness, he sees Kala lying on the ground motionless. Luckily, Tarzan's gorilla friends locate him and free him. Tarzan picks Kala up and moves into the jungle where he treats Kala's wound, leaving her under the protection of his friends. Tarzan, now determined to put an end to Clayton's discovery, reaches the mountain where the meteor is hidden. Clayton, meanwhile has moved all his resources up the mountain and has rigged the place with explosives, not realizing that the resulting chain reaction could cause another mass extinction. Jane and Dr. James Porter are tied to pole and left there to die. Tarzan starts killing the henchmen and frees Jane. James decides to stay back and cut the wires leading from the detonator to the explosives, stating someone has to stay behind. As Jane and Tarzan come out of the cave, Clayton holds them at gunpoint. Tarzan summons his jungle friends with a loud cry. In the ensuing battle between mankind and wildlife, the meteor awakens the nearby volcano as it did 15 years ago and the mountain begins to give way. Jane and Tarzan escape, but he throws a huge rock at Clayton's helicopter, bringing Clayton and his crew down to their deaths. Jane and Tarzan return to the nesting ground and reunite with the family. They are overjoyed to see Kala recovered from the gunshot. Tarzan and Jane vow before the troop to continue to protect their jungle home, and all its hidden secrets, from any who would exploit them. James Porter is shown to be alive and well, having recovered a large chunk of meteor rock from the cave-in to continue his research.

That Girl in Pinafore
 The story was set in the 1990s. Secondary school student, Jiaming (Daren Tan) was coping with both his O-level examinations and his parents' bar business, the Dream Boat. He and his mates Cao Gen (Seah Jiaqing), Hao Ban (Kenny Khoo) and Xiao Pang (Kelvin Mun) were studying. When a dare to get the numbers of two nearby girls, Jayley and Hayley Woo, went awry, the boys ran away. Jiaming bumped into the twins' friend, May (Julie Tan), while doing so, consequently dropping his Xinyao booklet.  After receiving their O-Level results, Jiaming decided to drop school, having already retained for two years, while the rest of the boys moved on. Coincidentally, they were placed in the same Junior College as the three girls they had met earlier. On the first day of school, the boys started a short-lived pornographic magazines business and were suspended from school for a month's time. Meanwhile, Jiaming visited the junior college to hang out with his friends and was attracted by a familiar music tune into an empty school assembly hall. There, he discovered May playing the song on the piano from the [[Xinyao]] book that he dropped earlier. He confronted her to repossess his book but was interrupted by three school bullies, whose leader said that May was his. Jiaming left the scene after a conflict with the bullies. Eventually, he met up with his three friends and learned about their suspension.  The boys became aware of [[Xinyao]] singing contest with a winner's purse of $5000. Jiaming suggested that they join the contest and they form a band. After their own auditions, the boys bumped into the girls, who had tried their luck in the contest too but lost out because of technical difficulties. They decided to work together with the boys, forming a collaborative band. Subsequently, they were asked to perform at and advertise the Dream Boat.  During a gig later on, Jiaming was hounded by a pack of bullies, headed by James (Xavier Ong), for his close relationship with May. They were eventually chased away and the performance goes on as per normal, until May unexpectedly collapsed because of a heart defect. May's mother banned her from seeing Jiaming after the incident but the warning was ignored and their relationship becomes stronger. They got romantically involved, as do the other guys and ladies. Xiao Pang receives Chinese tuition from his driver's daughter Liyana, and they become close. All is well until May announced that she was leaving for the United States.  May skipped school during her birthday and was joined by the boys. Upon realising her daughter's truancy, May's mother detained her in the house and confronts Jiaming, harshly warning him to stop seeing May. Jiaming and his friends had been repeatedly calling her, but her mother refused her to pick up the phone. On the night before leaving for the United States, May ran in the rain to flag a taxi to get to Jiaming's house. Jiaming spent the next few hours with her, and sent her off at the airport together with his friends, as her mother handed her her backpack. Before May entered the departure gate, she whispered to her mother that going to United States to study would be the last time that she would ever listen to her.  Jiaming visited May once in the United States with money pooled together by his friends, and after returning, he and his friends performed during the finals of the Xinyao competition. Months later, May died, and Jiaming, together with his friends, went to mourn her death. However, May's mother gave Jiaming a slap on his face, and drove them out.  18 years later, in the present day, Cao Gen sold cars while Hao Ban owned a kopitiam. Xiao Pang became a dentist and was blessfully married with Liyana and they have 2 sons. Jiaming went on to further his studies in English Literature and became a teacher. He also got married and named his first born, a girl, in memory of May. On the 18th death anniversary of May, Jiaming went to columbarium to offer flowers as his annual practices. There he met an American Chinese girl, Rachel Anderson (Naomi Yeo), who was born and stayed with her foster parents in United States. She identifies herself as May's daughter whom May gave birth to just before she died and she had come to Singapore to find out more about her mother.  Jiaming began to tear during their conversation, realising that Rachel was the surprise (Their fruit of love after he visited her in US) May promised him during an overseas call just months before she died and that May's mother forbids him to mourn at May's funeral probably because he gotten her pregnant out of wed-lock with May's insistence to carry on with the pregnancy despite the toil it could take on her weak heart. May's mother subsequently gave Rachel away to foster parent adoption in the US. After hearing from Rachel that she was living well with her foster parents, Jiaming decides not to identify himself as her biological father or May's boyfriend, so as not to disrupt her lifestyle.     Rachel invited Jiaming to her performance at a bar the next day, and Jiaming invited his old friends to watch her perform. On the day of the performance, Xiao Pang brought Liyana and his two sons along, and Rachel sang a rendition of "The Narrow Stream Flows For A Long Time".

These Final Hours
 The film takes place in [[Perth]], and begins ten minutes after an [[Impact event|asteroid has collided with earth]] in the [[North Atlantic]], leaving approximately twelve hours until the subsequent global [[firestorm]] reaches [[Western Australia]]. James and his lover, Zoe, are having sex for the last time at her beach house, where she reveals that she is pregnant with James' child. Wishing to block out all feelings and avoid what's coming, James berates Zoe for sharing her news and leaves for "the party to end all parties".   After having his car stolen, he comes across two men who have kidnapped a young girl and are planning to rape her. James kills them, and rescues the girl. The girl, named Rose, explains that she was separated from her father in [[Malaga, Western Australia|Malaga]] en route to her aunt's house in [[Roleystone, Western Australia|Roleystone]]. Without enough petrol, and wishing to get to his party, James instead plans to leave her with his sister and her children. But upon arriving, he finds his sister and her husband dead in the shower, and three crosses marking what appear to be his nieces' graves, in what is an apparent [[murder suicide]].  Other attempts at locating Rose's dad, or someone to leave her with, have sobering results, and James eventually heads to the party with Rose in tow. The party is overflowing with people, a game of [[Russian roulette]] is being played, and an orgy is going on inside the house. James is noticeably uncomfortable and appears to want to leave. James meets with the host of the party, Freddy, whose sister is James' girlfriend, Vicki. James leaves Rose in the pool to speak with Vicki. In a reversal of the earlier scene with Zoe, James attempts to share a serious moment with Vicki, only for her to berate him for bringing her down with his news.   Vicki shows James a bunker built underneath Freddy's garage, which obviously does not have sufficient food, protection, or space for the miraculous survival Vicki envisions. James tells Vicki and Freddy that they will all die, even with the bunker. Freddy's reaction to this statement informs Vicki that her brother had known this all along. James accepts that his death is inevitable and cannot be blocked out, and commits himself to reuniting Rose with her family.  Meanwhile, outside, a drug-affected woman follows Rose, claiming that she is her daughter, Mandy. When James finally comes back outside to find Rose, she is hallucinating and vomiting after being coerced into taking an [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy pill]], with the woman leaning over her. James tries to leave the party with Rose, causing the woman to scream that he is kidnapping her child. Freddy holds James at gunpoint, before Vicki calmly takes the gun and shoots the woman, telling James to go.   James drives Rose to his estranged mother's house, with whom he reconciles whilst Rose recovers. She gives James petrol and Rose some old clothes, and the pair leave for Rose's aunt's house. Upon arrival, nobody seems to be home, but James finds the bodies of Rose's family, including her father, outside in what seems to be a [[mass suicide]]. Although hysterical at the news of her father's death, Rose insists on seeing him. James comforts her and brings her his body, and they lay him by a pond with flowers as she tells him that her dad wanted them to be together for the end. James then confides in Rose about his relationship with Zoe and her pregnancy, which leads him to realise his love for her. Rose convinces him to make amends with her while he still can. He heeds her advice, and the two share an emotional farewell before James leaves. His car overheats on the highway as the firestorm approaches, and he runs for the rest of the way. He finds Zoe on the beach, watching the approaching firestorm. She is initially hostile towards James, however the two quickly reconcile and confess their mutual love. The pair then embrace, and turn towards the ocean as they are consumed by the firestorm.

Thor: The Dark World
 <!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS!  PLEASE SEE THE TALK PAGE BEFORE ADDING ANY DETAILS—THIS IS THE CURRENTLY ACCEPTED REVISION OF THE PLOT  --> Eons ago, [[Bor (comics)|Bor]], father of [[Odin (comics)|Odin]], clashes with the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark Elves|Dark Elf]] [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]], who seeks to unleash a weapon known as the Aether on the nine realms. After conquering Malekith's forces, including enhanced warriors called the Kursed, on their home world of [[Svartálfar|Svartalfheim]], Bor safeguards the Aether within a stone column. Unknown to Bor, Malekith as well as his lieutenant [[Kurse|Algrim]] and a handful of Dark Elves escape into suspended animation.  In present-day [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] stands imprisoned for his war crimes on Earth. Meanwhile, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], alongside warriors [[Fandral]], [[Volstagg]], and [[Sif (comics)|Sif]], repel marauders on [[Vanaheim]], home of their comrade [[Hogun]]; it is the final battle in a war to pacify the [[Asgard (comics)#The Nine Worlds|Nine Realms]] following the reconstruction of the [[Bifröst]], the "Rainbow Bridge" between realms, which had been destroyed two years earlier. The Asgardians soon learn that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random.  In London, astrophysicist Dr. [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] and her intern Darcy Lewis travel to an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared, disrupting the laws of physics around them. Separating from the group, Foster is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether. [[Heimdall (comics)|Heimdall]] alerts Thor that Foster has moved beyond his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. When Thor finds Foster, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard. Odin, recognizing the Aether, warns that the Aether will not only kill Foster but that its return heralds a catastrophic prophecy.  Malekith, awakened by the Aether's release, turns Algrim into a Kursed and attacks Asgard. During the battle, Malekith and Algrim search for Foster, sensing that she contains the Aether. Thor's mother [[Frigga (comics)|Frigga]] is killed protecting Foster, and Malekith and Algrim are forced to flee without Foster. Despite Odin's orders not to leave Asgard, Thor reluctantly enlists the help of Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Svartalfheim, where they will use Foster to lure and confront Malekith, away from Asgard. In return, Thor promises Loki vengeance on Malekith for killing their mother. With Volstagg and Sif stalling Asgardian soldiers and Fandral assisting their escape, Thor, Loki, and Foster head to Svartalfheim.  There, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Foster, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded while killing Algrim. Thor, cradling Loki in his arms, promises to tell their father of his sacrifice. Afterward, Thor and Foster discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite in London with Lewis and Foster's mentor Dr. [[Erik Selvig]]—who was briefly institutionalized due to the mental trauma he suffered during Loki's attack on Earth. They learn that Malekith plans to restore the Dark Elves to dominance by unleashing the Aether at the center of the Convergence in [[Greenwich]]. Thor battles Malekith through various portals and across multiple worlds until one portal separates them, leaving Malekith unopposed on Earth. Thor returns in time to help his mortal comrades use their scientific equipment to transport Malekith to Svartalfheim, where he is crushed by his own damaged ship.  Thor returns to Asgard, where he declines Odin's offer to take the throne and tells Odin of Loki's sacrifice. As he leaves, Odin's form transforms into Loki, who is alive and impersonating Odin.  In a mid-credits scene, Volstagg and Sif visit the [[Collector (comics)|Collector]] and entrust the Aether to his care, commenting that with the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Tesseract]] already in Asgard, having two [[Infinity Stones]] so close together would be unwise. As they leave, the Collector states his desire to acquire the other five Stones. In a [[post-credits scene]], Foster and Thor reunite on Earth, while somewhere in London, a frost monster from [[Jötunheimr|Jotunheim]]—accidentally transported to Earth during the final battle—continues to run amok.  
The Three Musketeers (2013 film)
 In 1625 France, a poor young nobleman named d'Artagnan leaves his parents in [[Gascony]] and travels to [[Paris]] to join the [[Musketeers of the Guard]]. At an inn in [[Meung-sur-Loire]], an older man derides d'Artagnan's horse. Insulted, d'Artagnan demands a duel with him. The older man's companions beat d'Artagnan unconscious with a cooking pot and a metal tong that breaks his sword. His [[letter of introduction]] to [[M. de Tréville|Monsieur de Tréville]], the commander of the Musketeers, is stolen. D'Artagnan resolves to avenge himself upon the man (later revealed to him as [[Comte de Rochefort]], an agent of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who is in Meung to pass orders from the Cardinal to [[Milady de Winter]], another of his agents).  In Paris, d'Artagnan visits de Tréville at the headquarters of the Musketeers, but the meeting is overshadowed by the loss of his letter, and de Tréville politely refuses his application. He does, however, write a letter of introduction to an academy for young gentlemen, which may prepare him for recruitment at a later time. From de Tréville's window, d'Artagnan sees Rochefort passing in the street below and rushes out of the building to confront him, but in doing so he separately causes offence to three of the Musketeers, [[Athos (fictional character)|Athos]], [[Porthos]], and [[Aramis]], who each demand satisfaction; d'Artagnan must duel each of them in turn that afternoon.  When the three friends learn that d'Artagnan is a virgin they refuse to fight him. At this point, Cardinal Richelieu's guards appear and try to arrest d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers for illegal dueling. Although outnumbered, the four men win the battle. D'Artagnan seriously wounds Jussac, one of the Cardinal's officers and a renowned fighter. After learning of this event, King Louis XIII appoints d'Artagnan to des Essart's company of the King's Guards and gives him forty ''[[pistole]]s''.  D'Artagnan falls in [[love at first sight]] with the pretty, young and married Constance Bonacieux. She works for the Queen Consort of France, [[Anne of Austria]], who is secretly conducting an affair with the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]]. The Queen has received a gift of diamond studs from her husband [[Louis XIII]].  Anne gives the diamonds to her lover as a keepsake. Cardinal Richelieu, who wants war between France and England, plans to expose the tryst. He persuades the King to demand that the Queen wear the diamonds to a soirée that the Cardinal is sponsoring.  Constance tries to send her cowardly husband to London, but the man is manipulated by Richelieu and does not go. D'Artagnan and his friends intercede. En route they are repeatedly attacked by the Cardinal's henchmen, and only d'Artagnan and Planchet reach London. Before their arrival, d'Artagnan is compelled to assault and nearly kill the Comte de Wardes, who is a friend of the Cardinal, a cousin of Rochefort, and Milady's lover. Although two of the diamond studs have been stolen by Milady, the Duke of Buckingham is able to provide replacements while delaying the thief's return to Paris. D'Artagnan is thus able to return a complete set of jewels to Queen Anne just in time to save her honor.  He receives from her a beautiful ring as an expression of her gratitude. Shortly afterwards, d'Artagnan begins an affair with Madame Bonacieux. Arriving for one of their assignations, he notices signs of a struggle and discovers that Rochefort and M. Bonacieux, acting under the orders of the Cardinal, have assaulted and imprisoned her.  D'Artagnan retrieves his friends, who have just recovered from their injuries, and brings them back to Paris.  D'Artagnan meets [[Milady de Winter]] officially, and recognizes her as one of the Cardinal's agents from Meung, but this does not deter him. D'Artagnan becomes infatuated with the beautiful lady, but her handmaiden reveals that Milady is indifferent toward him. Entering her quarters in the dark, he pretends to be the Comte de Wardes and trysts with her. He finds a ''[[fleur-de-lis]]'' branded on Milady's shoulder, marking her as a felon. Discovering his identity, Milady attempts to kill him, but d'Artagnan eludes her.  He is ordered to the [[siege of La Rochelle]]. He is informed that the Queen has rescued Constance from prison. In an inn, the musketeers overhear the Cardinal asking Milady to murder the Duke of Buckingham, a supporter of the Protestant rebels at [[La Rochelle]] who has sent troops to assist them. Richelieu gives her a letter that excuses her actions as under orders from the Cardinal himself, but Athos takes it from her. The next morning, Athos bets that he, d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis, and their servants can hold the recaptured St. Gervais bastion against the rebels for an hour. They resist for an hour and a half before retreating, killing 22 Rochellese in total. They warn Lord de Winter and the Duke of Buckingham. Milady is imprisoned on arrival in England but seduces her guard, Felton (a fictionalization of the real [[John Felton (assassin)|John Felton]]), and persuades him to allow her escape and to kill Buckingham himself.  On her return to France, Milady hides in a convent where Constance is also staying. The naive Constance clings to Milady, who sees a chance to avenge herself on d'Artagnan.  Milady fatally poisons Constance before d'Artagnan can rescue her.  The Musketeers apprehend Milady before she can reach the protection of Cardinal Richelieu. They bring an official executioner, put her on trial and sentence her to death. After her execution, the four friends return to the siege of La Rochelle. The Comte de Rochefort arrests d'Artagnan and takes him straight to the Cardinal. When questioned about Milady's execution, d'Artagnan presents her letter of pardon as his own. The Cardinal laughs at this arrogance, but he is impressed with d'Artagnan's wilfulness. Secretly glad to be rid of the treacherous Milady, the Cardinal destroys the letter and writes a new order, giving the bearer a promotion to lieutenant in de Treville's company of musketeers, leaving the name blank. D'Artagnan then offers the letter to Athos, Porthos, and Aramis in turn, but each refuses it proclaiming d'Artagnan the most worthy among them..

  After the events of [[Tom-Yum-Goong]], Kham ([[Tony Jaa]]) has resumed a quiet village life with his "brother"/elephant, Khon, back in Thailand. Within the village, lives a local oddball that loves playing with electrical devices, named Job. He has lived there along with Kham and the villagers for some time and has earned the trust of the locals. Unknown to him, he's an agent of an arms dealer known as Mr. LC ([[RZA]]). A fan of Kham's exploits five years ago, LC had Job keep tabs on Kham without his knowledge. Things would change for Kham when a merchant, Suchart Vilawandei (Adinan Buntanaporn), wanted to buy Khon, but Kham refused to sell Khon. Suchart gave his business card to Kham in case he changed his mind about selling Khon, however, things would go terribly wrong after Kham was invited by the villagers to eat with him.  While hanging with the local villagers, Kham felt something was wrong and double-backed home to find Job seemingly beaten and Khon missing; Suchart had taken Khon. Using the business card Suchart left earlier to him, Kham went to Suchart's home to get answers, but only to find Suchart killed moments earlier before he could confront him. Kham started a ruckus and stormed into Suchart's home to find his body, while trying to understanding what had happened, Suchart's two twin-like nieces, martial artists Ping-ping ([[Yanin Vismitananda|Yanin "Jeeja" Vismitananda]]) and Sue-sue (Theerada Kittiseriprasert) realized he's dead and believes Kham to be responsible. The two attacked him, but he evaded and escaped; the authorities was alerted of the murder and the police gave chase.  While running from the law, Kham managed to encounter Mark. Because Mark knows Kham is not a killer, Mark faked being assaulted and allowed Kham to escape. Later on, Kham would secretly meet with Mark in attempt to understand the situation. Mark himself is in Thailand due to his personal work for Interpol, involving a recent terrorist plot between East Katana and West Katana having peace talks in Bangkok. Little that both knew that Khon's kidnapping and the peace talks are all related.   The twins had found Kham and attacked him, but so did a biker gang. Kham fought through the biker gang and faced a small group of LC's fighters. LC himself is a great admirer of martial arts and accumulated his own personal group of fighters, which he has ranked them by numbers to deem the strongest. He had his second strongest, No. 2, take on Kham; the twins were also interfering. No.2 killed Sue-Sue, leaving Ping-Ping to grieve. While Kham fought No.2, Kham lost the fight as he had a needle stuck to his neck because of Ping-Ping. No.2 realized he only won the fight because Kham was handicapped and took him before LC.  It was at LC's base that Kham found his elephant and also discovered Job was a traitor. They tied a specially made remote electrical device to ensure obedience as every time Kham would be shocked, so would Khon. LC wanted Kham to join him, but Kham only wanted Khon back. With the device tied to both Kham and Khon, Kham knows Khon is simultaneously shocked as well; he was forced to obey LC to help him assassinate a political figure related to the peace talks. LC also took the chance to brand Kham on his chest, listing Kham as his No.1 fighter.   Mark was suspected of foul play by other Interpol agents. After he failed to capture Kham, he was told to go home. However, Mark found Kham and helped him remove the electrical device off his back. Mark also encountered Ping-Ping. He took her to the coroner to examine her uncle's body, it was there the medic explained Suchart was killed by three powerful combo punches, the same method of killing that happened to Sue-Sue; Ping-Ping realized Kham wasn't the killer, it was No. 2.   At a country temple, LC, Job, No.20, and Kham are all there to help war profiteers to assassinate both leaders of Katana to insight war to sell more weapons. Kham infiltrated the temple and fought against all of LC's men and No. 2; Kham and Ping-Ping teamed up to fight against their mutual enemies. Ping-Ping wanted to personally kill No. 2 for her uncle, but she failed; she ignited an entire floor filled with gasoline in attempts to burn No.2, but No.2 merely avoided the explosions and fire to find Kham.   Meanwhile, Kham fought one level below Ping-Ping and the ignited gasoline has turned the entire lower floor into a room of fire. Taking advantage of the fire, Kham set his own shoes on fire to use it to defeat his enemies; they in turn copied him. Kham then fought No. 2 again, this time at lowest section, the train tracks. The two fought right over a live rail and took advantage of the electricity to shock each other while fighting in light-saber effect mortal combat; Kham knocked out No.2 and confronted LC. To Kham's surprise, LC is highly trained and marked himself as No.00. The fight was short-lived as both men fell from a high place, LC was knocked out.  It was during this time Kham recovered and found Khon. He told Mark that there's a bomb threat; Mark tried to explain to his superiors there's a bomb at the temple, but they wouldn't listen to him. Mark decided to scream out to everyone there's a bomb and it scared everyone away. Kham came and found Job, the two found out that Khon's tusks were cut down and replaced with prosthetic tusks, rigged to explode. Kham tried to find a way to save Khon, but LC and No.2 interfered.   No. 20 loved LC and wanted him to stop, but LC couldn't accept defeat and choked her to death. No. 2 recovered enough to help LC take on Kham in a two on one fight. Because Kham was holding Khon's tusks to prevent them from falling out and exploding, it was a severely handicapped fight. With the help of both Ping-Ping and Mark, No.2 was defeated and LC was killed after Kham released the tusks and hard-kicked LC away. The explosion vaporized LC and knocked both Kham and Khon over the cliff and into the ocean; both the man and the elephant survived. There was no official ending to everything that happened. The fates of surviving characters were up to viewer presumptions.

The intruders wear masks cut from Liam’s large stuffed animals, which identify them as Mr. Mouse, Pig Lady, Little Rabbit, and Little Monkey.  When Cory wakes, Mr. Mouse tortures him with a car battery.  Mr. Mouse produces Liam and forces Cory to tell his son that he does not love him. Liam is emotionally devastated, screaming while Little Rabbit drags him away. Mr. Mouse exclaims "He is part of our family now". He then duct tapes a plastic bag over Cory’s head and leaves him to suffocate.  Back at the Morgan house, Sarah is pursued by Pig Lady.  Sarah eventually escapes and is able to drown Pig Lady in a forest creek following a struggle.  Cory manages to break free of his restraints. He finds Liam and reassures his son that he only said horrible things because of the torture. Little Monkey interrupts their reunion by confronting Cory with a pitchfork. Cory unmasks Little Monkey and discovers that she is actually a brainwashed Mary Bronson. He knocks her out and escapes into the forest with Liam.  Mr. Mouse captures Sarah. Cory hears her screams and tells Liam to wait while he returns to rescue his wife. Sarah electrocutes Mr. Mouse with the car battery and flees outside with Cory.  Little Rabbit emerges with a rifle and fatally shoots Cory. Sarah finds Liam and runs with him through the trees while Little Rabbit fires his gun in pursuit. Little Rabbit finds Liam and hesitates to shoot him. Sarah appears and tells the killer to pull the trigger on her instead, Little Rabbit does this but the gun is empty. Following another struggle, Sarah ultimately subdues Little Rabbit.  After processing the crime scene, a police officer takes Mary Bronson away in a squad car while an ambulance takes Little Rabbit.  When her windshield is damaged, the police officer stops her car and is beaten to death with a rock by Mr. Mouse. Mr. Mouse retrieves his mask from an evidence bag and gets behind the wheel as Mary expresses that she knew he would come for her, he replies with 'We must find you a new mother' (implying Pig Lady was going to be her "new" mother). Mary asks about the father. He replies with 'The father will be coming'. Meanwhile, Little Rabbit unshackles himself from the gurney, unmasks himself and grabs a scalpel as he prepares to murder the ambulance driver.

Trance (2013 film)
 Simon (McAvoy), an art auctioneer, becomes an accessory to the theft of a painting–[[Francisco Goya|Goya's]] ''[[Witches' Flight|Witches in the Air]]''–from his own auction house. When a gang attacks during an auction, Simon follows the house emergency protocol by packaging the painting. The gang's leader Franck (Cassel) then takes the package from him at gunpoint. Simon attacks Franck, who delivers him a blow to the head that leaves him with amnesia. When Franck gets home, he discovers that the package contains only an empty frame. After ransacking Simon's apartment and trashing his car, the gang kidnaps and unsuccessfully tortures him. But he has no memory of where he has hidden the painting. Franck decides to hire a hypnotherapist to try to help him remember.  Franck makes Simon choose a hypnotist from a directory, and he chooses an American named Elizabeth Lamb (Dawson). As a first hypnotic exercise, Simon recalls where he put some car keys. Elizabeth exposes the gang's plan to have her hypnotize him, and demands partnership. In a next hypnotic episode, under gang supervision, Simon remembers that, shortly after the blow to his head, he awoke alone. On finding the stolen painting hidden in his suit, he left the art gallery. Distracted by a phone text message, while crossing the road, he was hit by a red car. The female driver tried to take him to hospital. Simon, in a kind of [[Amnesia|memory fugue]], believed the woman was Elizabeth, recalling that she had made him forget her. The gang tries violently to force Simon to remember where he put the painting, and that ends the hypnotic episode. When asked by Elizabeth about how he met Franck, Simon confesses that he has a gambling problem. Franck helped him pay his debts in exchange for his help in stealing the painting.  [[File:Witches Flight Goya.jpg|left|thumb|[[Francisco Goya|Francisco Goya's]] ''[[Witches' Flight|Witches in the Air]]'' (1798), the painting stolen in the film. In reality it is part of the collection of the [[Museo del Prado]].]] To help Simon recover from the violence, Elizabeth stays overnight in his apartment. In the morning, Simon dreams of Elizabeth's having used a brain-scan behaviour-conditioning technique to erase an obsession that he had for her. Elizabeth tells Franck about that.  [[File:Goya Maja naga2.jpg|right|thumb|[[Francisco Goya|Goya's]] ''[[Nude Maja]]'' (''ca''. 1795), a painting Simon discusses in the film.]]For the next step to recover the painting, Elizabeth tells Franck that she will sexually seduce Simon. Simon's feelings for Elizabeth recur, gently this time. At the same time, Franck and Elizabeth have unanticipated sex, and she steals his pistol from his bedside drawer. Nate, a gang member, sees them together and warns Simon, who confronts Elizabeth with it. She responds by touching his erotic mindspot, related to Goya's ''[[Nude Maja]]''.  Remembering where the painting is, Simon goes with Franck and his associates to reveal the location, but overhears their plan to kill him. He calls Elizabeth and tells her that the painting is in a red car in a certain car park, and unable to leave Franck's apartment, he returns and kills the gang members instead. After shooting Franck, Simon wakes up: this was all dream, and he still is in Elizabeth's apartment. Elizabeth takes the car keys and goes to get the painting, leaving Franck's revolver for Simon. While searching for Elizabeth, Simon finds Franck in her apartment. Nate and his associates intercept Elizabeth and bring her there. Franck takes Simon to get the painting, and as he kisses Elizabeth, she secretly passes three bullets into his mouth. On the elevator, Simon stops Franck with a fire extinguisher, and then with the revolver, now loaded with the three bullets. In the apartment, Nate prepares to rape Elizabeth. Heading back into the apartment, Simon shoots the three gang members. He takes the car keys from Elizabeth, and loads the revolver with the remaining three bullets. He takes Elizabeth to get the painting, and she tells him to let Franck come with them. With Franck driving, Simon leads them to a parking garage where the painting is.  They collect the red car and drive it to a safe warehouse. During the trip, Elizabeth reveals that Simon was previously a client of hers. He had a gambling addiction he wanted to fix. They started an affair, and she found his erotic mindspot. However, he became obsessed with her, and eventually abusive. Fearing for her life, she re-directed the hypnosis to make him forget her. This led him back into his gambling addiction, which as previously stated, caused him to go in debt and to try to pay it off by stealing a painting, with the help of Franck. Simon recalls that, after the heist, when he was hit by the red car and mistook the female driver for Elizabeth, he strangled her.  At the warehouse, in the car's trunk, Elizabeth finds the painting and the body of the female driver. Simon, having at last remembered his past and wanting to forget, douses the car in fuel with Franck zip-tied to the steering wheel, sets it on fire and tells Elizabeth to run away with the painting. She runs away but promptly returns driving a truck which she drives into Simon, pinning him against the other car, and ultimately sending Simon, and the car Franck is trapped in, into the river.  Franck manages to escape, while it is implied that Simon is killed. The scene cuts to Franck swimming in his apartment while thinking of the event. He gets out of the pool and receives a package. He opens the package and finds an iPad that plays a video of Elizabeth talking about the painting, which is now hanging in her apartment. She reveals that when she hypnotized Simon to make him forget her, she also hypnotized him to go back into his gambling addiction and then try to steal a painting to pay off his debt. When this happened, he would instead give the painting over to Elizabeth. This explains why Simon took the painting away from Franck at the beginning and the text message he received before being hit by the car, which is revealed to be from Elizabeth telling Simon to deliver the painting to her. Elizabeth tells Franck that he can search for her and try to find her, but also gives him the option to forget the entire ordeal, and a button for an app called "Trance" appears as the video ends. Franck is shown debating whether to press the button just as the screen cuts to black.

Trap for Cinderella
 20-year-old Micky ([[Tuppence Middleton]]) regains consciousness in a hospital after suffering severe burn injuries requiring [[reconstructive surgery]], and she's still suffering from [[amnesia]]. She is shown photographs of friends and relatives, but she can't recognize anybody. The doctors tell her she lives in [[London]] and her parents died in a car accident when she was 9. Her aunt, Elinor ([[Frances de la Tour]]), took care of her ever since, but had died sometime before Micky's accident.  Micky is discharged from the hospital, having recovered from her injuries but not regained her memory. Her aunt's [[personal assistant]] Julia ([[Kerry Fox]]) is now her guardian and takes Micky home. A boy named Jake ([[Aneurin Barnard]]) tries to contact her, but Julia intercepts the call and tells him that Micky is not ready to meet her friends. Later, Julia tells Micky that Jake was her boyfriend. Micky sees some photos of a friend of hers, Domenica "Do" Law ([[Alexandra Roach]]). Julia also informs Micky that when she turns 21, she's bound to inherit Elinor's entire estate.  Among the photographs, Micky finds an envelope sent by Jake. While Julia is distracted by a call, Micky takes a cab and goes to the address on the envelope, which turns out to be the office of James Chance, Elinor's lawyer as well as Jake's employer. Leaving the office before Chance could warn Julia, Micky runs into Jake, who invites her to his apartment. Jake explains they had broken up the last time they met before the accident. Not remembering anything of their past relationship, Micky bonds with Jake and they have sex. Jake gives her the keys and address to her old flat. When Micky asks Jake about Do, Jake reveals that Do died in the fire, and he's surprised Micky was not informed.  At her apartment, Micky finds Do's suitcase which contains her letters, clothes and a diary. Micky reads the diary, learning from it the details of her friendship with Do. The two of them were close childhood friends who used to vacation together with their families at Elinor's house in the South of France. They casually reconnected as adults after a long gap. Since they had last met, Do's parents had passed away, with her father committing suicide. During their childhood, Micky had accidentally almost caused Do to drown in the swimming pool; Micky ran away scared, Do followed her and they saw something, which caused Do's father to take his family away.  While Micky's reading Do's diary, Julia enters the apartment and addresses her as Do, which confuses Micky, pushing her to leave. She checks into a hotel and instinctively signs the registry as Domenica Law. Micky continues to read the diary, chronicling the period that saw the girls spending more and more time together after they first reconnected. Micky had Do move to her apartment, and Do started obsessing over her, becoming jealous of Micky's relationship with Jake. After Jake and Micky broke up because of her interference, Do revealed to Micky that she was love with her but an angry Micky didn't reciprocate. During this time, Do was also in correspondence with Elinor, receiving a check from her but sending it back.  Micky starts to think that she could really be Do and not Micky. She visits Julia in the morning and demands an explanation. Julia reveals that she had asked Micky and Do to visit Elinor on her deathbed in France. Julia had also privately told Do that she had read her letters to Elinor. The girls went visit Elinor, who was too sick to talk. They stayed at Elinor's house, where they used to vacation. Do called Julia up in London, who reminded her she could never be with Micky the way she wanted to, and that Micky had already ruined her life by reporting to Do's mother what the two girls had seen that day Do almost drowned: that Do's father and Elinor were having an affair, which is the reason Do's father committed suicide.  Julia then joined the girls with the news that Elinor had expired. Do finally agrees to Julia's plan: to set the house on fire and kill Micky, then go to [[Switzerland]] and undergo surgeries to make her look like Micky. The plan worked, but Do damaged her face and lost her memory after jumping from a window. After hearing all this, Micky seems to finally accepts she is actually Do. Soon after, however, she's confronted by Serge, a local barman who says she still owes him. Serge recounts how he had overheard Do and Julia planning to kill Micky, allowing Micky to escape the trap. Hearing this triggers Micky's memory and she realizes she's still actually Micky, while Do really died in the fire, in spite of Micky's attempt at saving her despite everything. Micky gives Serge her expensive car to buy his silence.  Later Micky meets up with Julia, who's been to London to read Elinor's will and found out Elinor left everything to Do because she felt her affair with her father had ruined Do's life. Upon realizing that Micky is the one who survived, Julia attacks Micky but Micky manages to drown her in the swimming pool.  
The Trials of Cate McCall
 Cate McCall is an [[alcoholic]] lawyer who is in recovery, on probation, and estranged from her family. In order to regain custody of her young daughter and be reinstated to the bar, she accepts the ''[[pro bono]]'' appeal of a woman, Lacey, who has been convicted of murder. Aided by her assistant, Cate pulls out all stops to prove Lacey's innocence, as well as work on her own alcohol and work addictions. Cate becomes obsessed with the case, neglecting arranged time with her daughter while she successfully gets Lacey's conviction overturned. When Cate finds out that Lacey is guilty, she starts drinking again, causing her to further neglect her daughter. Cate returns to her old job at a high-profile law firm, and purposefully torpedoes her own client's case in the middle of a trial. Cate then takes multiple illegal actions to put Lacey back in prison. Cate gives evidence to the prosecutor who can convict Lacey, then conspires with the prosecutor; the two of them agree to keep it a secret so that she won't be disbarred, which would deny him the ability to use the evidence that he should not have. Cate does not recuse herself from Lacey's trial &ndash; though she does blackmail the original judge, who previously ruled in Lacey's favour, to recuse himself. The prosecutor, exercising prosecuterial misconduct, does not recuse himself from the case either. Cate's overt acts of fraud, conspiracy, blackmail and misconduct enable her to get Lacey re-convicted. Cate's reward for her illegal actions is to be granted shared custody of her daughter.

Transformers Prime Beast Hunters: Predacons Rising
 Not long after [[Megatron]]'s demise and the restoration of [[Cybertron]], the Autobots celebrate as [[Optimus Prime]]  promotes [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] to warrior class. The festivities end, however, when Optimus sets out on a journey to find the [[Spark (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|AllSpark]], the source of new life on Cybertron, and takes [[Wheeljack]] with him to find it so that new Transformers can come into being. [[Ultra Magnus]] is left in charge in Prime's absence to hunt down the missing [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] and [[Starscream]] with the other Autobots. Meanwhile, on Earth, at the bottom of the ocean, Megatron's consciousness is reawakened by [[Unicron]], who seeks to destroy his arch-enemy [[Primus (Transformers)|Primus]], the very core of Cybertron, and requires Megatron's body to do so. Unicron reformats Megatron's lifeless husk into a perfected body with new upgrades, before heading to Cybertron. In the meantime, Ultra Magnus and [[Smokescreen (Transformers)|Smokescreen]] continue to search for the fugitive Decepticons in the Sea of Rust, but are soon attacked by the [[Predacon]]s [[Sky Lynx|Skylynx]] and Darksteel. After a brutal fight, Magnus is severely damaged and Smokescreen is barely able to save his life and make it through an emergency space bridge with him. The damage is so critical that the Autobots are forced to call in [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] from [[Earth]] for assistance while the Autobots deduce that the two new Predacons must be creations of Shockwave. Meanwhile, Shockwave and Starscream are revealed to have restarted "Project: Predacon" and plan to create an army with Skylynx and Darksteel being their first creations.  Set on finding answers, Bumblebee leads Smokescreen, [[Bulkhead (Transformers)|Bulkhead]] and [[Arcee]] to track [[Predaking]], who has taken refuge near the grave site of hundreds of ancient Predacon bones, and ask his help in finding his two new brothers. However, Predaking refuses, having not forgiven the Autobots for destroying his brethren on Earth. Bumblebee, after asking the imprisoned [[Knock Out (Transformers: Prime)|Knock Out]] for any ideas on locating the fugitives, he leads the Autobots to Megatron's old fortress [[Darkmount]] located in the Decepticon capital called Kaon to find answers, but they are soon confronted by Unicron in Megatron's body. The Autobots believe Megatron returned before Unicron corrects them. Unicron battles the Autobots, who are outmatched and are forced to the lower levels where Bulkhead, Arcee, and Smokescreen almost fall into a smelting pit. However, time bought by Bumblebee allows the Autobots to escape through a Ground Bridge portal. Unicron, enraged by his failure in his weak form, decides that he needs a greater weapon.  Meanwhile, in the [[Theta Scorpii]] asteroid belt, Optimus and Wheeljack arrive in Ultra Magnus's ship where the AllSpark - which itself is pure energy stored in a container of [[Alpha Trion]]'s creation - is adrift. Optimus heads out to find it, but is soon troubled with a plasma storm. Despite Wheeljack's insistence to turn back, Optimus keeps going and eventually retrieves it, though their ship is damaged by an asteroid, and they set course of Cybertron. Meanwhile, the Autobots try to contact Optimus from the former Decepticon flagship [[Nemesis (Transformers)|''Nemesis'']], but the asteroid damage destroyed their transmitter, making the contact only one way. With Optimus not available and Ultra Magnus wounded in action, Bumblebee assumes temporary leadership of the Autobots.  Elsewhere, Predaking starts investigating and finds the area where the two Predacons fought Magnus and Smokescreen, realizing that the Autobots were telling the truth and begins searching for Skylynx and Darksteel, but is found by Unicron. Megatron within, who seeks to have his body back, deceives Unicron into talking to him, withholding Predaking's betrayal to him. Predaking, believing Unicron to be Megatron, immediately attacks him, but Unicron turns the tables and quickly beats him down before reading his mind and finding the bone yard. Unicron then puts Megatron under eternal suffering for his deception. Meanwhile, Shockwave, Darksteel, Skylynx, and Starscream find the Predacon bone yard, but are soon confronted by Unicron, who they assume is Megatron until he clarifies who he is once more. Darksteel and Skylynx charges at Unicron for conflict, but he easily defeats them. Unicron then uses the power of Dark Energon to resurrect the Predacons into undead [[List of Decepticons#Terrorcons 2|Terrorcons]]. They end up scaring Starscream away before attacking Shockwave, who holds them off before being overpowered. Meanwhile, the Autobots detect Megatron's signal through Unicron, and also detect the Terrorcons, which are headed for the Well of All Sparks, the most direct route to Primus himself.  Bumblebee decides to lead a counterattack with Bulkhead, Smokescreen, and Arcee on the ''Nemesis'', while Ratchet stays back at Kaon with Ultra Magnus. However, Starscream sneaks aboard the ship, and frees Knock Out and the few captive Vehicon troops, and tries to retake the ship, intending to use it to flee Cybertron. As Bulkhead and Arcee kill the Vehicon troops, Starscream is about to neutralize Bumblebee using the Immobilizer, only to be betrayed and ironically, knocked out by Knock Out, who once again tries to join the Autobots and is accepted this time. Meanwhile, Predaking arrives at the bone yard where he finds Skylynx and Darksteel, who reveal the remains of their fallen brethren are resurrected by Unicron. Predaking orders them to help him reclaim the remains, but they refused, resulting in a brawl with Predaking as the winner. Not long after, the brutally mangled and scarred Shockwave arrives and suggests that they help the Autobots instead, who then leaves to parts unknown.  At the Well of All Sparks, Unicron's undead army arrives, but the ''Nemesis'' confronts and attacks them, and the Predacons soon join them. After a brief firefight, the ''Nemesis'' is shot down just above the Well, which gives an imprisoned Starscream a chance to escape. As Unicron charges their way, the Predacons join the Autobots in an alliance. Predaking, Skylynx and Darksteel attempt to fight off the Terrorcons using their fire-breath, only to be forced into the Well with them. At that point, Optimus and Wheeljack return, but Unicron shoots the ship down, although both survive, with the wounded Wheeljack getting rushed by Bulkhead and Arcee to help him. Optimus briefly engages Unicron, and tries to snap Megatron out of his possession, but to no avail. Unicron eventually gets the upper hand and prepares to kill Optimus. However, Bumblebee uses the Polarity Gauntlet to stop him while Optimus attends to the AllSpark. Bumblebee eventually loses his strength as Unicron overpowers him, before following Optimus and shooting him down. Unicron is about to destroy the Allspark, only to find the container empty when opening it. Realizing too late that it was a trap, Unicron is rendered helpless as his Anti-Spark is pulled into the device, sealing him inside it forever. With the link to Unicron severed, all of the Terrorcons are destroyed, and Megatron regains control of his body. However, as Starscream returns and tries to talk him into re-igniting the war, Megatron reveals that his time under Unicron's control has soured him towards tyranny, and so he no longer wishes to be a Decepticon. When Starscream presses the issue, Megatron angrily disbands the Decepticons altogether, and flies off to start a new life. Starscream then flies back to Darkmount to take control of the Decepticons once again by reviving the cause in his name, only to be confronted by the Predacons, intent on getting revenge for their abuse (his, Darksteel's and Skylynx's fates are revealed in the sequel series, ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'').  In the aftermath, Optimus reveals to the Autobots that he emptied the AllSpark into the Matrix within him, but can no longer be separated from either, requiring him to sacrifice himself to completely restore Cybertron. The Autobots try to dissuade him, but Optimus states that the Matrix cannot be restored again, and that the age of Primes is over, but recognizes each Autobot - even Knock Out - as a Prime in their own right before taking off into the core as the Autobots watch. As Optimus plunges into Primus, millions of sparks of all the deceased and unborn Transformers emerge from the Well, including Prime's own spark. The film's final moments mirror Optimus' last words, as he states that his sacrifice will mark a new beginning rather than the end to anything - "simply put, another transformation".

The Truth About Emanuel
 Emanuel is a seventeen-year-old young woman who is still wracked with guilt over her late mother who died giving birth to her. She meets a boy on the train on her way to her job at a medical supply shop named Claude, with whom she becomes romantically involved. Emanuel is also living at her small home in Los Angeles with her father and her step mother, to whom she is anti-social with because she isn't anything like her mother and tries to accuse her of thinking she is a lesbian, as per her name being Emanuel, as her parents believed she were going to be a boy, as a way to justify her bitterness to her step mother.  The next night a woman named Linda moves into the neighborhood as Emanuel's new next door neighbor and Emanuel is shocked when she notices that Linda looks just like her late mother. When Emanuel discovers that Linda is in need of a babysitter for her newborn baby, Emanuel – despite her dislike of children – agrees, claiming she'll need the extra money for her souvenir collection, but it's only because she wants to get to know more about the woman who looks like her dead mother. When Linda agrees to allow Emanuel to babysit her child, her interests are shattered when she discovered that the "baby" is actually a doll, and Emanuel believes Linda is mentally disturbed. But as Linda and Emanuel develop a friendship, Emanuel tries to hide the fact that Linda's "baby" is really a doll from others by not letting people near the "baby." But that task becomes increasingly harder when her best friend/co-worker Arthur from the medical supply store befriends Linda when she goes in to purchase a baby nasal aspirator, and agrees to substitute for Emanuel as the babysitter when Linda makes mention of being invited to Emanuel's birthday dinner and needing a substitute babysitter the night of the dinner.   Before the dinner, Emanuel's father tells her the story of her birth and her mother's death. This is something she makes her father do every year on her birthday, and she corrects his telling of the story several times.  In the kitchen, while cleaning up the dishes, Emanuel's step mother explains to Linda that Emanuel is troubled  and might be misinterpreting Linda's fondness for her (thinking that Emanuel has lesbian tendencies towards Linda). When saying goodnight to Claude, after the birthday dinner, Emanuel treats him rather harshly when he brings up that he's agreed to landscape for Linda. Emanuel thinks that he's following her everywhere because they met on the bus, he has been to her home a couple of times, and now he would be around while working for Linda. Claude tells Emanuel that she won't have to see him anymore and leaves.   Emanuel agrees to babysit when Linda goes on a date with Arthur. When Arthur and Linda return from the date, Linda suggests that Arthur go upstairs with her to see the baby, who Emanuel says is sleeping. Emanuel begs for Arthur not to go upstairs to see the baby but after Linda calls him up again, he heads upstairs and realizes right away that the baby is not real. Linda seems to finally realize that Chloe is a doll and begins to panic about where her baby is. Assuming that Emanuel must have replaced Linda's real baby with a phony one, they call Emanuel several times and ask her where Chloe is. After she tells them Chloe is in her crib, Arthur shows her that the Chloe that is in the crib is a doll, not a real baby, and demands to know where Linda's baby is. While Linda yells and threatens to call the police, Emanuel begins to have an emotional meltdown and takes the doll, resulting in her fainting. As she faints, she has a vision in which she holds tightly onto Chloe while water floods into the room.   Emanuel swims out of a window in the room into a deep body of water, still holding the Chloe doll. Emanuel swims for a bit and then sees her dead mother swimming a short distance away. The Chloe doll springs to life and swims to Emanuel's mother, who embraces the baby and swims away. Confused, Emanuel hears her name being called and swims away until she awakens on a gurney with her father and a police officer present. She is then taken to the hospital. When the officer asks Emanuel about the circumstances regarding the baby's disappearance, she claims the baby got away from her in the water and went to Emanuel's mom and that they both swam away.   Once out of the hospital, Emanuel visits Claude at his job and makes up with him.   Linda's husband  is found, and he comes to town and explains to Emanuel and her parents that after spending a lot of money and time trying to conceive, they finally had a baby. The baby died, and with the autopsy results being inconclusive, no one knew what happened, but Linda blamed herself. After the funeral, which Linda would not attend, she began using a doll to replace her dead baby. When her husband tried to have her institutionalized, she disappeared with the doll, and he filed a missing person's report. Now that Linda has been found, she is being held in a psychiatric hospital, where she can only be visited by family. Her prognosis is not good.  Emanuel later asks her father for permission to go see Linda, but only for him to harshly tell her to end her obsession with Linda because she nothing like her mother.  Going against her father's bitter advice, Emanuel breaks into Linda's house and steals the doll. She then, with Claude's help, sneaks into the psychiatric hospital where Linda is being held and sneaks into Linda's room, where she tells her that her baby died from drowning, as Emanuel saw in her vision. When Linda asks Emanuel what happened to her baby, Emanuel describes the vision omitting the part about her own mom, as a way to explain Chloe's death. Emanuel then sneaks Linda out of the hospital and brings her to the cemetery where her (Emanuel's) mother had been buried. Because of how ironic it is that Linda's daughter is dead, and physically never was alive, and that Emanuel's mother died giving birth to her, Emanuel tearfully digs a makeshift grave over her mother's tomb and buries Chloe in it. The movie ends with the two women laying in the dirt, watching the stars in the night sky.

Directed to the basement to help dig a tunnel, he almost causes its collapse as he panics over the fate of his girlfriend Julia, who was staying at his apartment at the time of the catastrophe. When they break through to a neighboring building, he meets Enrique, who tells Marc that they can talk later. A flashback reveals that Marc, working as a computer engineer, faced possible termination by Enrique. Afraid of losing his job, Marc resists Julia's desire to have children. The following morning, Marc watches a video of a teen who commits suicide because his father could not understand or believe in his acute agoraphobia.  In the present, three months after the unspecified event, Marc and Enrique discuss leaving the building together. Enrique, who has a working GPS device, requests that Marc not tell the others about it; Marc reveals that he has stolen supplies formerly owned by Rovira, a dead coworker. Enrique is initially dismissive of Marc's scavenged supplies and declines to partner with him, but Marc blackmails Enrique into helping him search for Julia. The two set out into the subway system, where a young pickpocket steals the GPS device. After a chase and fight over his possessions, Enrique kills Javier, the pickpocket's fence. Although worried that Enrique will continue without him, Marc is relieved to find that Enrique is willing to continue their partnership.  Another flashback shows that Marc's neighbor has not left the building for months. At work, Rovira, revealed to have been covertly living in the office, is forced to leave. Once thrown out, he convulses; when dragged back in, the convulsions end, but he still dies from the trauma.

In the present, Marc grows frustrated with Enrique's refusal to reveal why he wants to go to the Olympic city with a bag full of seeds. When they believe they have reached Marc's apartment building, they blast their way in with explosives. There, they learn that Julia, now pregnant, is not in the building.  Flashbacks depict a growing trend of agoraphobia called "the Panic", a pandemic of unknown origin; sufferers die if forced to leave shelter.

At a church, a bear nearly mauls Enrique to death, but Marc manages to kill it. While the two eat the bear, they bond over their pasts and fears.

After a brutal fight watched by many, including Lin in the hospital, Fai ultimately emerges victorious (by taking advantage of his easily dislocated right shoulder), and Lin is so excited over the victory that he leaps out of his wheelchair, cured.  With his newly earned fortune, Fai pays off his loans and meets Peidan one last time, while also continuing to visit Peidan's mother. He later meets a now recovered Lin, and the two joke about the injuries that they have each endured in the ring.  
Unforgiven (2013 film)
  Shortly after the start of the Meiji period, a former samurai under the [[Edo Shogunate]], Jubei Kamata, flees from government forces on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. Jubei kills his pursuers and disappears, but remains infamous as “Jubei the Killer”.  Years later, in a frontier town, two brothers, Sanosuke and Unosuke Hotta, disfigure a sex worker. The local lawman, Ichizo Oishi, lets the brothers go with only minor chastisement instead of dispatching them to [[Sapporo]] to face justice. The other sex workers gather together the reward for a bounty on the two brothers. This draws several bounty hunters, including Kingo Baba, an old associate of Jubei. One of the bounty hunters, Masaharu Kitaoji, arrives with his biographer. Armed with swords, he draws the attention of Oishi, who demands he hand over his weapons as they are banned in the town. Confronted by lawmen with firearms, Kitaoji has to accept, but is then beaten and humiliated by Oishi. The following day, Oishi throws him out of the town, but the biographer, Himeji, stays behind to write about Oishi instead.  Kingo tracks Jubei down to a small farm where he lives in poverty with his two children. Although reluctant, Kingo convinces Jubei to help him earn the bounty by killing the two men. On the way, they are joined by Goro Sawada, a brash young half-[[Ainu people|Ainu]] man who claims to have killed five men already. When the trio arrive at the frontier town, Oishi finds and recognises Jubei at the inn. He taunts, beats, and scars Jubei, but doesn’t kill him. Kingo and Goro are upstairs with the sex workers and escape unharmed. After recuperating with the help of the sex workers, the three men track down one of their targets and kill him. Jubei delivers the killing blow after Kingo is unable to do so himself. After this, Kingo admits that he doesn’t have the stomach for killing. Handing Jubei his rifle, he leaves the other two men to collect the bounty. Jubei and Goro return to the town to kill the other Hotta brother. Jubei sends Goro in to kill the man while he uses an outhouse. After a scuffle in which Goro is unable to get a fatal shot with his pistol, he stabs the Hotta brother with an Ainu knife. Although Jubei and Goro escape, Oishi’s men are able to track down Kingo, who is killed after a night of torture.  Jubei learns of his friend’s death when one of the sex workers delivers the bounty. Sober for years, he drinks the last of Goro’s liquor and returns to the town to exact revenge. Before he leaves, he orders Goro and the scarred sex worker, Natsume, to deliver his share of the bounty to his children and look after them. Jubei returns to the inn and a battle ensues between him, Oishi, and the posse Oishi had put together to hunt down Jubei and Goro. Despite being wounded several times, Jubei is able to kill Oishi and several of his men, and the survivors flee. He orders Himeji, who witnessed the battle, to write about what he saw. However, Jubei knows that the Japanese authorities would be particularly harsh if they found out that Goro, who is half-Ainu, had been involved in the killing of two Japanese men. He therefore demands that Himeji leave Goro and the Ainu out the account, and threatens to kill the writer if he mentions them.  Having returned to Jubei’s farm, Natsume explains how she might be willing to settle down there with Goro, looking after Jubei’s children. She is hopeful that one day, Jubei might return. He is last seen walking alone, in the snow, somewhere in Hokkaido.  
Underdogs (2013 American film)
 Bobby Burkett ([[Logan Huffman]]) is a promising quarterback for a struggling high-school football team. Vince DeAntonio ([[D.B.

The inventor gets sued by his employer over the intellectual property rights to a new space heater design, and must struggle to keep his invention.

The story climaxes in a charity football game between the rival teams, which serves as a rallying point for the inventor's family, the school, and the community.  
Upstream Color
 The film starts with a man (mentioned in the credits as the "Thief") who appears to be harvesting a type of larva for the unusual effects it has on the human mind when ingested.  At a club, Kris ([[Amy Seimetz]]) is [[taser]]ed and kidnapped by the Thief. He drugs her with a strange capsule, inducing a sort of [[hypnotic susceptibility]], which causes an extremely [[Suggestibility|suggestible]] mental state that the Thief then exploits. He uses an elaborate set of distractions, such as getting her to create a paper chain where each link features a transcription from the book ''[[Walden]],'' in order to distract her while performing his mind control. He eventually manipulates her to liquidate her [[home equity]] and steals a valuable collection of rare coins. Through hypnotic suggestion, Kris is prevented from consuming solid foods. She is only allowed to drink small portions of water at regulated intervals, which she is compelled to perceive as extremely refreshing and delicious. The capsule administered to Kris contains a live larva found among the leaves of the Thief's special, blue-tinged orchid flowers&mdash;a larva that presumably is infected with a [[nematode|roundworm]] that subsequently infects Kris's system. She is released from her suspension of hunger by the Thief, presumably to trigger the onset of roundworm growth. Kris binges ravenously and falls asleep in soiled clothes. She awakes in her home to find one of several large roundworms visibly crawling under her skin. She unsuccessfully attempts to remove them by using a kitchen knife.  Later, a pig farmer and avid field recorder&mdash;the "Sampler"&mdash;draws Kris to his farm using [[infrasound|infrasonics]], which attracts the worm. The Sampler silently sets up a transfusion through which he transfers the worm from Kris's body into that of a young pig. Kris then awakens in an abandoned SUV on the freeway with no memory of these recent traumatic events. Upon arriving at her disordered house, she quizzically notices blood on her sheets and floors and considers calling the police. She realizes she has no information to tell them and stops dialing. After cleaning up, she heads to work where she is promptly fired for her unexplained absence. A trip to the grocery store reveals to Kris that her personal funds are gone, evidently stolen by the Thief.  A year later, Kris meets a man named Jeff ([[Shane Carruth]]) on a train and unknowingly connects with him, seemingly on a telepathic level. Kris and Jeff meet several times, before finally spending the night with each other, and afterward realize they both retain identical stitching scars from the aforementioned, forgotten, transfusions. The two of them soon realize that they both had similar experiences; Jeff lost his job as a broker due to shifting company funds around to cover for money stolen from him and attributes the incident to drug abuse. At the same time, it is made clear to the audience that a parallel exists between the emotions Kris and Jeff have been feeling and two pigs, one of which is the host to Kris's parasite. As an example: Kris mistakenly believes herself to be pregnant at the same time her pig counterpart is actually pregnant. Upon consultation with a doctor, she is diagnosed with having had [[endometrial cancer]] that was successfully removed. The supposed cancer, she is told, is no longer a threat to her body, but it has rendered her infertile and she is unable to conceive.  The Sampler finds that the pig containing Kris's worm has now given birth to piglets. He throws the piglets into a burlap sack and tosses them into a river. This event coincides with Jeff and Kris feeling an extreme sense of loss and frustration, and both act as if something terrible is happening to them; Jeff spontaneously picks a fight with two of his co-workers while Kris frantically searches as if she'd lost something. The two, in their panicked state, reunite and travel to Kris's house, where they gather supplies, including a gun, and make camp in her bathroom's tub, expecting the worst. Meanwhile, the sack of piglets is seen rotting away and a blue substance bursts from the piglets' open wounds, filling the surrounding waters, from which orchids have emerged. The orchids eventually turn the same color blue and are collected by farmers, who sell the plants in the neighborhood where the Thief operates.  These events seem to mark a change in the state of things. Kris and Jeff begin to remember each other's personal histories as their own. Jeff discovers Kris mumbling the text of ''Walden'' while swimming. It is while performing this ritual that Kris comes to sense things that the Sampler has sensed, and it is this moment that the two start to piece together what happened to them both. In a dreamlike sequence, Kris, Jeff, and the Sampler all sit down at the same table in a bare, white room where Kris reveals to the Sampler that she is aware of him; the Sampler collapses from an apparent heart attack. The scene then cuts suddenly to a parallel shot back at the pig farm, where Kris shoots and kills the collapsed Sampler. Kris and Jeff collect a box of written records revealing others who were similarly drugged, and the two summon these other past victims to the farm by sending them copies of ''Walden.'' The farm is thereafter remodeled and the pigs are better cared for; as a result, no more pigs are drowned, the orchids in the river no longer turn blue, the Thief is deprived of the roundworms for his drug. The film ends with Kris cradling a baby pig, as if for the moment, at peace.

V/H/S/2
 The film is presented as an [[anthology]] of short horror films, built into a [[frame narrative]] which acts as its own short horror film. Each short film is linked together with the concept of found footage (each segment is from the VHS tapes found in the first film).  ===Tape 49/frame narrative=== : Directed by [[Simon Barrett (filmmaker)|Simon Barrett]] A college student's mother requests that a private investigator, Larry, and his girlfriend, Ayesha, also a private investigator, look into the disappearance of her son Kyle. After breaking into Kyle's residence, they discover a large stack of VHS tapes and a laptop that is still recording a video. On the laptop, Kyle discusses the VHS tapes, saying where he got one of the most recent ones, and Larry tells Ayesha to watch the tapes while he inspects the house. As Ayesha watches the first tape, a figure peers out from the shadows, and watches her.  Ayesha calls Larry into the room, and they discuss the tapes' legitimacy. Larry tells Ayesha to continue viewing the tapes, which Kyle's video explains must be watched in the proper order "to affect you".  Larry re-enters the room and finds Ayesha in a hypnotized state with her nose bleeding. After being woken, Ayesha says she has a migraine. Larry leaves to find medicine, and a seemingly entranced Ayesha watches another tape. From the shadows, the figure crawls out and watches her.  Upon Larry's return, he discovers Ayesha has killed herself with a gun. A VHS tape with the word "WATCH" written on it in lipstick, lies beside her. Larry picks up the tape and anxiously watches it.  Confused, Larry watches the webcam footage and sees Kyle explain that he and his mother want to make their own tape; Kyle then attempts suicide on-camera by shooting himself through his jaw, but seemingly survives, even though his lower jaw is completely shattered, and runs off moments before Larry and Ayesha enter the dorm. As Larry watches it, an undead Ayesha suddenly rises and attacks him. In self-defense, Larry breaks her neck and rushes into the other room as Ayesha chases after him on all fours. Larry hides in a closet and shoots Ayesha in the face when she finds him. Larry hears a strange gurgling sound and explores the closet only to find Kyle hiding in the back, revealing that Kyle has been hiding in the closet the whole time. Kyle lunges at Larry and strangles him to death. Afterwards, Kyle gives the camera a "thumbs up", revealing the plan his mother and he came up with being a success, before turning off the camera.  ===Phase I Clinical Trials=== : Directed by [[Adam Wingard]] After a car accident, Herman receives an ocular implant with a camera to replace his damaged right eye. The doctor warns that he may experience "glitches" because the implant is still in an experimental stage, and Herman notices a young red-haired woman staring at him on the way out of the hospital. That night at his home, he is haunted by a man and young girl, both of whom appear dead. Herman calls the doctor to demand that he remove the implant, and spends the night locked in his bathroom.  The next day, the red-haired woman, Clarissa, appears at his door, asking him if he is starting to see dead people. She reveals that she was born deaf and had an implant installed in her ear, which allowed her to hear but also gave her the ability to hear dead people. Herman suggests that if he has the implant removed the ghosts will go away but Clarissa explains that removing the implant will just keep Herman from seeing the ghosts, not send them away. She then asks if Herman has ever hurt anyone but he doesn't answer. Suddenly the ghost of Clarissa's "creepy" uncle appears behind her. She seems unaffected by this saying that he wasn't a very nice guy. She then explains that the ghosts become stronger when one pays attention to them, so they have sex in an effort to ignore them. Later that night, the ghosts of the dead man and young girl appear and an unseen force drowns Clarissa in the outdoor pool. Running back through the house in an effort to escape the ghosts, Herman again locks himself in the bathroom and uses a straight razor to cut out his ocular implant.

Adam finds Lena placed on an altar but is unable to save her as a horned demon (which resembles [[Baphomet|The Baphomet]]) tears its way out of her body. As Adam attempts to flee, he is attacked by the previously deceased cultists and schoolchildren, including Joni and Malik, who have all turned into zombie-like ghouls. As he finally managed to get outside and get into the car, he drives off, only to be rammed by the demon. As he crawls out of the car, the demon looks down on Adam before calling him "Papa". The revelation that the demon is in fact his child drives Adam hysterically insane and he starts laughing. Shortly thereafter, the camera malfunctions.  ===Slumber Party Alien Abduction=== : Directed by [[Jason Eisener]] Young brothers Gary and Randy attach a camera to their [[Yorkshire Terrier]] dog, Tank, to create videos at their lake-side house.

Very Ordinary Couple
 The film follows young bank clerks Lee Dong-hee ([[Lee Min-ki]]) and Jang Young ([[Kim Min-hee (actress, born 1982)|Kim Min-hee]]) who have just broken up with each other. They work at a local branch of [[Standard Chartered Korea|Standard Chartered]], and their seemingly nasty split turns scandalous in the office. After going through a period of irrational behavior, including physical fights and Young’s impulsive one-night stand with a mutual colleague at work, the two decide to give their relationship another try. Once again, they are madly in love.  The real story of the film begins as the two begin to date again, in spite of their shared doubts and fears. As the second honeymoon phase ends, the same problems ― those that had led to their initial break-up ― surface: the boredom, the trust issues, and the mutual dishonesty about what they really want. The hot-tempered Dong-hee seems like he needs an anger management class, while Young tries to avoid conflicts by telling small lies ― unaware of how lies, regardless of the motivations, can destroy trust.  Above all, the couple's shared experience of the break-up gradually makes them insecure about their relationship. This eventually leads to a suffocating disaster: Dong-hee tries very hard to pretend that he is interested in the things Young suggests doing, only to please her and save their relationship ― although he'd really rather sleep in than go to an amusement park on his day off. Young, on the other hand, gets extremely self-conscious of everything she tells Dong-hee, as she is worried that she will upset him off by "saying something wrong" ― just like how she did before the first break-up.  There is a sadness that fills the screen as the two desperately try to save their relationship, pretending nothing is wrong and trying to believe that things will work out in the end. "I will be good to her," Dong-hee repeatedly says in the film. "I’ll try harder to make this work."  But watching them forcing on a smile while obviously annoyed by each other’s company, the audience can instinctively tell that the two will soon part ways ― in spite of their genuine efforts and affection for each other. The movie reaches its climax as the two flawed characters realize that they've messed it up again, that they can no longer be in denial, and there are some things in life that cannot be controlled no matter how hard they try.<ref></ref><ref></ref>

The subplot, however, explores a relationship between a woman & a girl; Rekha, the protagonist, is a sex worker who tries to rescue Nandhini, a twelve-year-old girl, from the clutches of prostitution. The journey takes us through the brutality and the hypocrisy that surrounds us, which we deliberately choose to ignore—broken homes, abuse, unfulfilled dreams, manipulation, blackmail, threat, hopelessness and paranoia. It's a dog-eat-dog world where nothing is as simple as it appears.  Rekha, an aging prostitute, is seen selling herself to old and low level people in order to eke out a living. During one of her sessions, she meets with her old pimp Singaram, who informs her that he needs her help to bring in a virgin, prepubescent girl for one of his major clients, Periayyah, an unnamed, wealthy liquor baron of India.  She refuses in the beginning and accepts reluctantly, after he agrees to split the profts with her.  Singaram takes Rekha to meet with her old pimp and ex-lover Dorasingam, who is now bedridden and furious at Rekha for leaving him. However Rekha convinces him to deliver the girl to her, on the condition that the girl be returned the very next day. After picking up the girl Nandini, Rekha travels with Singaram to get the girl ready for the night. Even though she tries to develop a bonding with the girl, Nadini shies away, avoiding to talk to Rekha. Although Rekha does not tell Nadini about what is going to happen to her, she is constantly tormented by her actions and feels responsible for the girl.  Everything goes according to Singaram's plan and Rekha accompanies the girl to Periayyah's mansion. Perriayyah takes the girl upstairs and starts to tie her up. As the girl prostests, Perriayyah is seen taking up a razor blade, when suddenly Rekha breaks into the room and a struggle ensues, in which Perriayyah is killed. Rekha and Nandini escape the mansion and go on the run.  Singaram is then visited by the henchmen of Chinnayyah, Periayyah's son. They question her about the girl he sent and threaten him to find them within a day. An intimidated Singaram approaches Lankesh, a rouge detective with an eye for details. Lankesh agrees to help Singaram to track down the girl for a sum. In his search of Rekha's apartment, he discovers a photo of her friend taken in Srirangam, and concludes that the two are headed there.  As this happens, Dorasingam's men spot the girl and Rekha on a train. They decide to kidnap her, but their attempts are thwarted and the two escape to Srirangam and meet with Devanayagi, Rekha's old friend. While on his search Chinnaiyyah and his men kill Dorasingam while also killing a man that knew about his fathers bad habits  Lankesh with Singaram tracks down the house in which Devanayagi lives, and takes Rekha and Nandini out while calling Chinnaiyah to the area, so he can have his revenge against them for killing his father.  Chinnaiyah arrives with his men but orders them to kill Singaram and Lankesh instead while giving money to Rekha to live her life onwards. The reasoning behind this is when Chinnaiyah was in school, his father took a classmate of his and ended up raping and killing her. Disgusted with his fathers actions, Chinnaiyah decides to look for the person that killed his father and give them hope   Cast

While travelling, he tries to come to terms with his experiences by making a detailed record of their stories, and decides to visit those places himself.  The film's director, Scud, explained that the idea for the film "originated from my own thoughts about suicide. One time, I had thought about walking into the central Australian desert until I am exhausted and die in a miserable way. These thoughts caused me to think about similar people in this situation." He continued that "All of the episodes are independent of each other and the stories are based on real experiences which some of the actors appearing in the film have gone through. Having an international cast and locations around the world is appropriate because depression and suicide are universal themes".<ref name=ScreenDaily /><ref name=CIFF />

Alas, the Lebanese have stolen the recipe for their country. So two half-brother taboulistani shepherds are sent to France by their president to promote their country.

A journalist helps them to go to Paris.  
W.M.D.
 The Iraq War remains one of the most controversial U.S. overseas engagements of past 30 years. The instability it wrought on the region gave rise to ISIS and a host of other problems to Iraq and surrounding countries. And yet the primary rationales for going to war-- WMDs and Saddam Hussein's links to Al Qaeda, have been proven false. Streets across America now have an endemic problem of veterans with PTSD, leading to violence, suicide and homelessness.   In an alternate 2007 reality, a group of disgruntled soldiers stationed in Iraq kidnap the visiting U.S. President, and interrogate him using the same techniques they were trained to inflict on Hussein's old cohorts and other terror 'suspects'. Their purpose is to extract from the president the real reasons for the Iraq invasion, as they know by now the stated reasons were bogus. The soldiers have a very limited amount of time to complete this fateful mission though, as the full force of the United States military is deployed to extract the President from captivity no matter what the cost.

While alone, Ricky is met by a talking [[Rook (bird)|rook]], who turns into an ''[[Alexornis]]'' named Alex. He tells him of a story set in the [[Cretaceous]] period 70 million years ago. Patchi is the smallest in a litter of ''[[Pachyrhinosaurus]]'' hatchlings, and is often bullied by his older brother Scowler. Their father Bulldust is the leader of a ''Pachyrhinosaurus'' herd. Alex, who is Patchi's mentor, tries to help Patchi impress a female ''Pachyrhinosaurus'' named Juniper, but her herd migrates south without him.  Bulldust moves his herd south as well, but when they try to pass through a forest, they are forced to flee when a fire erupts. Taking advantage of the chaos, a pack of carnivores, led by a ''[[Gorgosaurus]]'' named Gorgon, attacks the scattered herd. They kill the rest of Patchi and Scowler's family, with Gorgon personally killing Bulldust. Afterwards, Patchi's herd combines with Juniper's as they continue their migration. Gorgon's pack attacks them again; in the ensuing panic, Patchi, Scowler, and Juniper fall into the river and are swept downstream to the ocean, with Alex following them from above. At a beach, Scowler follows a herd of ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' to find food, callously leaving Patchi and Juniper behind. The two make their way through a forest and eventually are able to find their herd and Scowler.  After years of making the same [[Animal migration|migration]] from north to south and vice versa, an adult Scowler becomes the herd's new leader, and chooses Juniper to be his mate, much to Patchi's disappointment. Scowler recklessly leads the herd onto a thinly frozen pond, and Patchi is able to lead the majority of the herd to safety. Enraged and believing Patchi to be usurping him and also trying to take Juniper from him, Scowler goads Patchi into a battle for leadership of the herd. Scowler quickly wins and disowns Patchi, ordering Juniper and the rest of the herd to leave him behind. Despondent and heartbroken, Patchi tries to allow predators to eat him, but Alex convinces him to die for something worth dying for as Bulldust did.  Reinvigorated by the advice, Patchi returns to the herd, only to find them under attack by Gorgon and his pack again. As Gorgon overpowers him in battle, a repentant Scowler orders Patchi to save himself and lead the herd to safety. Instead, Patchi leads them in driving off Gorgon and his pack for good, saving Scowler. Scowler reconciles with Patchi and then concedes leadership of the herd to him, and Patchi goes on to have eggs with Juniper, one of which hatches and Alex asks for it to be named after him. In the present day, moved by Alex's story, Ricky returns the ''Gorgosaurus'' tooth to Zack and Jade, who have unknowingly discovered Gorgon's skull.

On the way to the beach house, Trent asks Duncan to rate himself on a scale of one to ten; Duncan rates himself a six while Trent tells him he thinks Duncan is a three. They arrive at the beach house and are greeted by the neighbors: the gregarious, hard-drinking Betty, her children Susanna and Peter, and married couple Kip and Joan. Later that evening, Duncan and Susanna have an awkward conversation from their adjacent porches.  Duncan discovers a small [[Step-through frame|girl's bicycle]] in the garage of the beach house and uses it to begin exploring the town.

Duncan meets the park's colorful, rag-tag group of employees: Caitlin, Lewis, and Roddy. Several kids at the water park speak reverently of a legendary pass in the tube slide, wondering how it could have been done. Owen hires Duncan for odd jobs at Water Wizz.  Outside the park, Duncan is continually neglected by his mother, Pam, who indulges in drinking, staying out at night, and smoking [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] with other adult vacationers. At a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] cookout, Susanna sees that he is upset about this and invites him to go hunting for [[ghost crabs]] with her and Peter, where she talks about her absent father and helps Duncan to open up. Later that night, Duncan witnesses Trent and Joan kissing by the side of the house, but does not reveal what he saw.

When Duncan arrives back at the beach house, Pam tells him they are leaving with Trent and Steph. Betty and her kids arrive to say their goodbyes. Susanna finally kisses Duncan. When Trent stops for gas on their way out of town, Duncan jumps out of the station wagon and runs to Water Wizz, followed by his mother, then Trent and Steph. Duncan tells Owen and the other employees that he has to leave and tells Owen to follow him. He takes Owen to the Devil's Peak slide, and Duncan becomes the first person to ever pass someone in the water slide while the rest of the park watches. After finally introducing Owen to his mother, Duncan says goodbye to everyone at the park. Owen tells Pam she has a great kid, and introduces himself to Trent as "a good friend of the three".

We're the Millers
 A small-time cannabis [[Illegal drug trade|dealer]], one David Clark of [[Denver]], Colorado, is robbed of his money and weed stash; some of which he owes to his wealthy [[drug lord]] supplier Brad Gurdlinger. After David is brought to him, Gurdlinger forces David to smuggle a "smidge" of [[marijuana]] from [[Mexico]] as a solution to clear his debt. Realizing that one man attempting to get through customs is too suspicious, he hires his [[stripper]] neighbor stage-named Rose, a teenage [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]] and petty thief named Casey, and his eighteen-year-old neighbor Kenny, to pose as a [[deception|bogus]] family called "the Millers." When the Millers reach the compound, they find out that the amount of marijuana they were picking up is not "a smidge" but actually two tons. Because of the extra load of the marijuana on the [[RV]] that they are driving, one of the [[radiator]] hoses breaks while going up a steep incline. A family they had met at the border, the Fitzgeralds, consisting of Don, Edith, and their teenage daughter Melissa, catch up to them and tow the Millers' RV to a garage. En route to the garage, David learns that Don Fitzgerald is a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent after finding his badge and gun in the glove compartment.  The marijuana turns out to be stolen from Pablo Chacón's [[Drug cartel|cartel]] where Gurdlinger had David pose as an agent of Chacon. The next day, when the Millers return to the garage to collect the RV, the mechanic is found tied-up and gagged with duct tape in his office and Chacón and his [[henchman]] One-Eye are waiting for them and prepare to execute the family. They immediately tell Chacón that they are not a real family and that they did not know they were stealing from him. Rose is given a chance to prove that she is a stripper by dancing, and when she gets close, turns a steam vent onto Chacón, allowing the Millers to escape in the RV with Kenny behind the wheel. Due to Kenny's erratic driving, the RV veers off the highway and a [[Mexican redknee tarantula]], hiding in a bowl of fruit, crawls up Kenny's leg and bites his testicle.  Kenny has a severe [[Allergy|allergic reaction]] to the bite, and the Millers head to the hospital near a carnival for [[4th of July]] celebrations. This further delays the delivery of the smuggled [[contraband]]. During their wait, David and Rose begin to bond and Rose reveals her real name to be Sarah ("with an H"). The two of them scold Casey for leaving with a strange boy, Scotty P; which leaves Casey feeling amused and happy for the attention she didn't receive from her real parents, who neglected her.  David renegotiates with Gurdlinger for a fee of $500,000 on the condition that it arrives that night. When Kenny is finally released from the hospital, David rushes him to the RV in a wheelchair and accidentally tips him over. In the ensuing argument, David inadvertently reveals how much he is getting paid, in comparison to how little he offered to pay each of the others. Casey, Sarah, and Kenny are left in disgust by the revelation, and so David leaves them behind at the local carnival.  Shortly after leaving, David regrets abandoning them after hearing [[Waterfalls (TLC song)|"Waterfalls" by TLC]] on the radio and returns to the carnival. Casey confides in Scotty about how she felt like she was actually part of a real family. Scotty tries to sexually harass Casey, but is thwarted by Sarah and Kenny. David then arrives at the carnival, begging them to come back with him and offering each a full share of the profits. On their way to the RV, they encounter Edith and Melissa. In the ensuing conversation between the Millers and the Fitzgeralds, Kenny blurts out that they are smuggling cannabis. One-Eye appears and is about to shoot everyone, but Don comes out of his motor home and knocks him out cold. Chacón then appears from around the corner, with Melissa held at gunpoint and is about to kill them all; but is momentarily distracted by  firework display. David and Kenny then subdue him while he is distracted. Melissa and Kenny (with a newfound confidence) kiss, as do David and Sarah. Don arrests Chacón, but lets the Millers leave.  David delivers the drugs to Gurdlinger, who tells him he is late and that their deal is off, but then admits that he had never intended to pay him at all. DEA agents interrupt the meeting, arresting Gurdlinger, revealing that David grassed them up. Don, the agent in charge of the raid, tells David that he will have to be placed in the [[witness protection program]] until the trials of Gurdlinger and Chacón are finished. He then adds that anyone who was a witness to the crime will be put into protection, which pleases David. The Millers are then seen together in a suburban house with several marijuana plants growing in the back garden.

Later, the sheriff tells Frank Parker that his wife, Emma, has died. Consumed by grief, Frank does not show up to identify the body but instead sends his two daughters, Rose and Iris.

Rory, too, has trouble keeping the family's past. Eventually, Rory wanders into his father's shed and finds a young woman held hostage.

She is grim and resolute.  Barrow, whose daughter previously went missing, becomes suspicious when he finds a bone fragment in a creek. Though Sheriff Meeks brushes off his concerns, Barrow is able to convince Deputy Anders to investigate. Anders finds more evidence in the creek, only to be confronted by Iris, on whom he has a crush. Iris leads him to a secluded spot, and Anders confesses his feelings for her. Confused and overwhelmed with guilt, Iris breaks into tears. As Anders comforts her, they begin to have sex, but Frank finds them and kills Anders. Disgusted, he tells Iris to return home.  Frank orders the girls to stay in their bedroom, and they form a plan to escape. Frank prays alone in his room, muttering that they have kept their tradition and will be joining their mother soon. While Frank recites prayers, Rose takes the car keys. When Frank prepares dinner, he takes a jar full of powder and adds it to the soup. As the children set the table, Rose notices white powder residue and realizes Frank is planning to poison them with arsenic. She unsuccessfully attempts to alert Iris, then knocks Rory's bowl on the floor to prevent him from eating. Before Frank can react, Barrow, whose research has turned up evidence that the Parkers may have engaged in cannibalism, arrives at the home and confronts Frank, demanding to know what happened to Anders and his daughter, whose hair ornament he sees Iris is wearing. Frank stalls for time as he reaches for his pistol, and Iris jumps in front of Barrow to protect him. Frank accidentally wounds his daughter, and Barrow shoots Frank.  Frank survives and knocks out Barrow. Rose and Rory flee the house in a panic, and they take refuge with Marge. Frank breaks into Marge's house and kills her, then convinces Rose and Rory to rejoin him. Back at Frank's house, he again urges his children to eat. When he tells Rose that she looks like her deceased mother, Rose bites into her father’s neck, tearing away a chunk of his flesh, while Iris stabs her father through the hand.

This turns out to be a ruse, to teach Bobo and Klara what's it like being forced into something you do not want to do.  At school, Hedvig avoids Bobo and Klara; they think that this is because she regrets having her hair cut and is angry at them.

Lewinsky learns that Sternwood's son, Ruan, has collapsed on an aircraft runway while travelling under an alias and has been hospitalized. Ruan had made a call to an Iceland landline number before he collapsed, so the police intend to go to Iceland to find Jacob Sternwood, but Lewinsky has no faith in this idea. The police ignore Lewinsky's doubts; they go to Iceland and surround Sternwood's property but he escapes, leaving behind a booby trap bomb which kills several policemen. Lewinsky suggests that Ruan's location be made public to draw Jacob out of hiding, and offers to stay in the hospital with Sarah to await Jacob's appearance. Jacob goes to the hospital to confirm his son's situation and manages to leave without being caught. Ruan dies shortly afterwards but it is decided not to reveal this on the off-chance that Sternwood will return to try to free his son. Lewinsky decides to find the security guard who had retracted his statement, thinking that Sternwood may have forced him to do so. The security guard refuses to help. Meanwhile, Sarah follows Warns to the container yard to look for evidence but is intercepted by Warns who kills her.  Bartnick is contacted by Sternwood. Bartnick arranges to meet Sternwood at a club to tell him who shot Ruan.  Geiger, having tapped the phone call, informs Lewinsky about the meeting. Lewinsky goes to the club to anticipate Sternwood's arrival but Bartnick and Warns are already there working together and Lewinsky is caught in a trap. A gunfight follows between Lewinsky, Bartnick and Warns, and Sternwood, during which Bartnick is fatally shot by Sternwood. Sternwood decides to protect Lewinsky, apparently as a result of their previous encounter when Sternwood had shot Lewinsky, however after the gunfight Lewinsky attacks Sternwood but is overcome by him then Sternwood demands to be taken to see his son. Lewinsky complies without revealing that Ruan is dead, and takes Sternwood to the hospital mortuary. Sternwood is at once heartbroken and incensed by the realization that his son is dead. Whilst at the hospital mortuary Lewinsky discovers that Sarah is dead when he comes across her body on a stretcher.  Sternwood and Lewinsky now confront Warns at his house. Warns is told that his collaboration with Geiger is known, along with the details of the gunrunning trade. A shootout ensues resulting in Warns being taken prisoner and forced to contact Geiger to arrange a meeting at "The Punch", a section of the container yard. Lewinsky and Sternwood force Warns to go with them to the meeting. When Geiger arrives they ambush him. Lewinsky blames Geiger for Sarah's death and accuses him of complicity in the arms deal among other criminal dealings. Geiger admits "turning a blind eye" on many occasions. Suddenly armed military contractors from Kincade make their presence known by opening fire which is followed by another gunfight during which Lewinsky kills Warns and Sternwood shoots Geiger dead. Lewinsky and Sternwood now face each other and Lewinsky raises his gun, but recalling the earlier time when Sternwood deliberately did not kill him, allows him to flee then presents himself to the arriving police.

One night, young Paul's father puts him to bed after he is awoken by a fight in a van outside. He tells young Paul how to survive in the world; To always beware of strangers, to always be loyal, and to be a "lion" and avoid following others in his actions. The next morning, whilst walking his dog, Paul witnesses an armed robbery at a local [[off-licence]] by the Banks brothers, infamous local hooligans of a crime family, who afterwards harass young Paul and murder his dog.   During his teenage years, Paul is making his way to a party, when his father spies him carrying a knife, and convinces him to drop it. Later, the Banks brothers crash the party, threatening Paul and wrecking the house. In a fit of rage, Paul goes back to retrieve the knife, and returns to the house to find two of the Banks brothers sexually assaulting his girlfriend. He stabs both of them (albeit not killing them) and flees to his older sister's house, where she berates him for the violence, as their older brother is serving life in prison for murder. Paul tells her he enjoyed the violence, as it made him feel in control.  In prison, Paul arranges for one of the Banks brothers in prison to be killed, and fights his associate and friend Bob in order to be both thrown into solitary confinement as an alibi. The prison warden lectures him about his overconfident attitude, and tells him he'll be imprisoned again after he leaves three days later. Paul is released and is taken home by childhood friends Jimmy and Johnny, refusing an invitation to a party for Paul by Glasgow godfather Arthur Thompson. Paul recalls his father telling him to steer clear of Thompson, calling him "The Devil incarnate."  Paul struggles to reconnect with his wife Anne Marie, arguing with him for fear of him being imprisoned or killed. Later, Paul goes to the local pub to meet with Arthur Thompson, and encounters his obnoxious, cocaine addicted son Junior "Fat Boy" Thompson.  When Paul meets with Arthur, the godfather praises Paul for the hit in prison, and gives him a job. At this point, Paul recalls his childhood, when he had witnessed Arthur executing a man at gunpoint. Later, young Paul and his friends take the dead man's money from his wallet, which the police eventually confiscate and interview young Paul and his parents about the murder. Later, Paul's father tells him to never tell anyone secrets such as what he had allegedly seen that day.  Paul and Anne Marie attend a Hogmanay party held by Arthur and his wife Rita. To Junior's scorn, he talks to Paul in private about how Junior was scammed for £50,000 worth of drugs, and tasks Paul with retrieving the drug money. Later that night, whilst on her way home, a car bombing kills Arthur's mother and leaves Arthur hospitalised. Arthur orders Paul and associate Tam to find the culprits. They are informed that the Banks brothers were responsible for the attack. Notorious gangster Tam "The Licensee" McGraw (John Hannah) makes it clear that they have his support on retaliation. Meanwhile, Anne Marie becomes pregnant, to which Paul is overjoyed.  While Paul and Junior are on a job, an attempt on the sighted Banks brothers' lives goes awry when Junior says he is unarmed, however Paul later sees that Junior was, in fact, armed. Junior later reveals to Arthur his jealousy of Arthur praising Paul, sparking his rivalry. Later that night, Arthur green lights a home invasion massacre of the Banks family. Junior's rivalry with Paul escalates when he attempts to kill the Banks' mother and wife, which Paul intervenes in by holding Junior at gunpoint. During a debt collection job, Tam and Paul witnesses Junior slash a father's face in front of his children, which shocks and disturbs Paul due to Anne Marie's pregnancy.  Paul expresses his wishes to leave Glasgow to Anne Marie as a result of the slashing incident, saying that he has become what he had always hated, and that he wishes to turn his back on crime. Junior is later seen to be secretly working with McGraw to assassinate Arthur, and to have Paul imprisoned. While Paul is serving an eighteen month sentence for possessing a weapon, McGraw has Paul framed for sanctioning a hit attempt on Arthur. As a result, Paul vilifies the Thompsons. After serving his sentence and meeting his son, Paul is told by Anne Marie that she no longer loves him.  In an effort to draw out Paul, Junior has Paul's father beaten up in an alley. McGraw tells Paul he supports him in his wish for vengeance on Junior. Later, Junior, whilst on a cocaine binge, is brutally executed by Paul outside Arthur's home. Paul is arrested and remanded in custody for Junior's murder. With Paul in jail, Arthur sanctions the murder of Jimmy, Johnny, and associates Bobby and Joe, in joint effort with McGraw. Paul learns of McGraw's betrayal, and threatens him, saying that he will take revenge when he is released. Paul is eventually acquitted of Junior's murder, and makes a public statement of how he resents Arthur and explains how he was being framed as a police informant. Final scenes show McGraw escaping assassination and boarding a flight to [[Tenerife]], but despairs as he notices Tam and Bob sitting behind him on the plane.

What the Fish
 Sudha Mishra is an irate divorcee who begrudgingly entrusts Sumit, her niece’s fiancé, with the responsibility of taking care of her house while she is way visiting her son.

When she returns a month later to her [[Vasant Kunj]] house, everything seems to be in order until she opens the bathroom door and discovers a wailing woman who runs out of her house.  The rest of the film follows the events that lead up to this encounter and the madcap events that take place in her house while she was away. The narrative moves back and forth between a recap of the previous events and the present, in which Sudha narrates an increasingly dramatized account of what she believes was an encounter with a spirit locked in her house. The possession of her house changes hands several times between a lineup of characters that include an eloping couple, a womanizing property broker, a cross dressing boxer and a family from [[Manipur]] before Sumit finally gets her house back in shape for her return. The title of the movie alludes to the multiple times that her fish Mishti dies and gets replaced by the occupants of the house.<ref></ref>

 Bruce is a snowplow driver in a small remote town in [[Quebec]]. While driving drunk during a snowstorm, Bruce fatally strikes a pedestrian. After Bruce panics and hides the body in a snowbank, he drives deep into the woods in a stupor and falls asleep. When he wakes, he finds that the vehicle has become stuck. Stranded in the freezing cold without supplies, he initially sets off to find help but returns to the snowplow when he sees no nearby signs of civilization.  Left with nothing but his own thoughts, Bruce practices his statement to the police. During the imaginary conversations, he becomes overcome with emotion when told that his victim had children.  As Bruce wrestles with his guilty conscience, flashbacks reveal that the dead man, Paul, was Bruce's  houseguest. Leaving a convenience store and coming across Paul in his vehicle attempting to commit [[Carbon monoxide poisoning#Suicide|suicide by inhaling vehicle exhaust fumes]], unplugging the hose, Bruce starts conversation with Paul, admiring his vehicle and eventually commandeers the vehicle, driving around casually with Paul, developing a casual friendship, though Bruce becomes frustrated when Paul takes advantage of his hospitality and requests a loan.

When Paul notices Bruce's collection of highly realistic [[ocular prosthesis|ocular prostheses]], Paul claims his proficiency with [[web design]] to Bruce and offers to set up an online presence to sell the collection. Bruce declines the offer and says that he can not bring himself to sell his wife's crafts.  In the present, Bruce leaves his snowplow once again after he runs out of gas.  After a long trek, he finds a restaurant, where he learns from the newspaper that both he and Paul have been reported missing.  After stocking up on supplies, he returns to his snowplow. When his supplies run out again, he investigates the area further and finds a large house near a frozen lake.  He breaks into the shed and steals supplies, then hides there overnight when the owners return.  In the morning, Simone, the owner's daughter, discovers him, and he frightens her.  He apologizes to her father, Eric, and retreats into the woods.  Later, when Eric and his friend go into the woods to look for him, Bruce injures his ankle while he hides.  Frustrated and unable to hobble back to civilization, he camps out on Eric's land and engages in more imaginary conversations with the police.  Further flashbacks reveal that Bruce caught Paul stealing; he was pursuing Paul when he accidentally struck him.  Paul seemingly smiles as the snowplow hits him, which causes Bruce to wonder if it was a second suicide attempt.  Bruce also implicates the snowplow itself in the accident and becomes increasingly hostile toward it.  This culminates as Bruce dumps his remaining gasoline on the snowplow and lights it on fire.  When Bruce's ankle heals, he breaks into Eric's shed again and steals a snowmobile.  He digs up Paul's body and disposes of it in a frozen lake, but he is caught in the act.  The witnesses flee, and Bruce returns to his own home, where he becomes increasingly paranoid. When he realises that two men are looking for him either the police or accomplices of Eric, Bruce attempts to hide in the snowplow banging his boot and attracting attention but they pass away. Bruce attempts to repair the snowplow but his expertise is limited. Bruce is obviously beginning to starve as he attempts to eat tree bark and is numbingly bored as the area around the snowplow becomes increasingly worn down. In the last moments, the winter gets milder but the cold quickly returns. The film’s epilogue is Bruce voice of thought; with two life observances: "every guilty person is his own hangman", "...and each new day will be better"; concluding with, "Goddamn, it's freezing."

Max and Sammy decide to follow them and take pictures so he can have his revenge. They take a short cut through the woods on their bikes, where they kiss for the first time.  In the meantime, Zach and his friends arrive at Open Hearth and throw stones at the house. One of the stones hits the window, and they are not sure whose stone it was. They see a shadow moving inside the house and run back to the camping area. There they get drunk and have sex with their partners.  Max and Sammy find the house and throw stones at it. Max's rock hits the window, and they run after seeing the Witch. Later that night Julie hears a whisper and finds a teddy bear which belongs to Amanda outside the camp. The four decide to check out the woods to find the kidnapped girl. They come near the abandoned house of the Witch and hear a child crying from inside. Julie decides to go in despite the warning from her friends. Zach joins her in the search, and they find Amanda tied up in the basement with an apple in her mouth. They manage to escape into the woods with the witch in pursuit. Once at the campsite they are shocked to find Carter's truck missing and their tent and other camping gear are gone. With the town 10 miles away and the nearest ranger station 4 miles away, they decide to walk rather than wait for the Witch to catch them. Max shoots a video asking whoever finds the footage to burn the house down as the myth is real. The Witch then abducts Max while Sammy screams. Zach and his friends lose their way and wander in circles due to the Witch's magic. Zach finds Max's bike and decides to go into the house again to rescue his brother. The others go into the woods in search of the nearest rangers station. The Witch kidnaps Carter and his girlfriend Tracy while Julie and Amanda hide under the bush.  Zach finds Max in the basement and is knocked out by the Witch. Sammy reaches the nearby rangers station and calls the cops, who reject her call as a prank. She finally blackmails Deputy Karl, saying she will upload the photo which shows him smoking on duty if he doesn't show up. Enraged, Karl sets out to arrest Sammy. Back in the house Zach opens his eyes and sees Max, Carter and Tracy pinned to the walls with apples in each of their mouths. The Witch kills Carter and Tracy with a huge meat grinder and eats them both, thereby restoring her beauty. Zach manages to free his hands from the cuffs and tries to escape with Max. They manage to make it out of the house, but the Witch captures them again. In the meantime Karl arrests Sammy and takes her back to the police station, rejecting her pleas to save Max. He gets a message from another cop, Deputy Mahoney, saying the ranger in Speeder Station is dead, and he found Julie and Amanda. Karl realizes Sammy is telling the truth and drives towards Open Hearth, asking Mahoney to meet him there.  Karl arrives and goes inside, with Deputy Mahoney remaining to guard Sammy. The Witch kills Mahoney and attacks Karl inside the house. Sammy finds Max, and as she tries to escape with him, they find Zach on the table and save him. They find a bottle designed to capture the witch and decide to use it. The Witch runs away at first but then attacks them and start to drain their souls. They manage to burn her using the flamethrower given to Max by his grandpa, who is revealed to have been a witch hunter. When the police search the house later, they do not find any corpses.  The house is later torn down and turned into a children's park, and the film ends with the suggestion the Witch is still hunting children.<ref> Horrornews.net - Official News Site|accessdate = 2015-05-29}}</ref>  
Willow Creek (film)
 Set in [[Humboldt County, California]], Jim ([[Bryce Johnson]]) is a [[Bigfoot]] believer whose idea of a romantic getaway is to head deep into [[Six Rivers National Forest]] in [[Northern California]], video camera in tow, trying to shoot his own Bigfoot footage at the site of the [[Patterson–Gimlin film]]. That 1967 fragment of footage purporting to show a Sasquatch striding along a dry sandbar beside Bluff Creek became a key artifact in the [[cryptozoology]] community and Jim dreams of nothing more than setting foot on the actual location where it was shot. His long-suffering girlfriend Kelly ([[Alexie Gilmore]]) agrees to tag along for the ride, despite the fact that she thinks Bigfoot has about as much chance of being real as [[leprechaun]]s.  The two stop off first in [[Willow Creek, California|Willow Creek]], the Bigfoot capital of the world and home to an annual Bigfoot festival where various locals talk to Jim's camera, warning them to keep out of the woods, singing ballads about Bigfoot, and generally enjoying their 15 minutes in the spotlight while Jim and Kelly have a blast, cracking wise amidst all the touristy Bigfoot kitsch on display. At a restaurant, they notice a missing woman on a poster on the wall and make fun of it before dismissing it as an everyday occurrence.  When they strap on packs and head into the forest via a two-hour drive down a dirt road, they start to feel like they might be in over their heads, especially Kelly. Jim, as he approaches what he considers hallowed ground, is very excited.  That night they are awakened by mysterious sounds echoing through the woods, and whooping vocalizations that might be Bigfoot, but that might also be locals pranking them. The noises grow closer and less human-like and their imagination begins to wander when the noises become surreal and hits their tent. They become spooked and decide to leave the site at dawn.  Jim discovers a gray, bloody strand of hair he believes may be evidence of Bigfoot's existence. They wander in circles through the thick woods while hearing the same noises they heard the night before. They become frustrated and get lost by a river bank very similar to the river bank in the Patterson-Gimlin footage they sought to find the whole trip. A whooping, angry noise rustles the bushes behind Kelly scaring her into running.  As night grows in, they are confused and lost in the dark when Jim and Kelly encounter an overweight, naked woman (Laura Montagna) bearing a strong resemblance to the missing woman on the poster. An unseen creature attacks them, killing Jim and moving on to Kelly whose cries for help are heard in the distance. Her fate is ultimately unknown, but implied she is taken as a "forest bride" like the other missing woman used by Bigfoot to reproduce. The movie ends with three whooping vocalizations also heard in the distance that are similar to the ones belonging to Bigfoot.  
Winter in the Blood (film)
 The film is set in Montana. In what has been called "a tale of simple, raw struggle and survival among a small-town Native American community,"<ref name="olsen"/> Virgil First Raise, a Native American, returns home after waking drunk in a ditch to find that his wife, Agnes, has left him. He sets out on an [[odyssey]] to find her.  
Witching & Bitching
 The film opens with two men, José ([[Hugo Silva (actor)|Hugo Silva]]) and Tony ([[Mario Casas]]) robbing a [[pawn shop]]. Tony is unhappy that José has brought his son Sergio (Gabriel Delgado) along on the heist and is even unhappier that the child is participating with them, as this puts both him and them at risk. The robbery initially seems to go well and the group collects a large bag full of gold rings and jewellery, only for the robbery to turn sour and for several people to die in the resulting gunfire. The men hijack a taxi and stow its unwilling passenger in the trunk, then force the driver, Manuel ([[:es:Jaime Ordóñez|Jaime Ordóñez]]), to drive towards [[Spain]]'s border with the intent to flee to [[France]].   The group is followed by Sergio's mother and José's ex Silvia ([[Macarena Gómez]]) as well as two police investigators Pacheco ([[Secun de la Rosa]]) and Calvo ([[Pepón Nieto]]), who are following Silvia. The men end up in the [[Navarre]]se town of [[Zugarramurdi]] where they come across a group of cannibalistic [[Sorginak|witches]] led by Graciana ([[Carmen Maura]]), whose mother Maritxu ([[:es:Terele Pávez|Terele Pávez]]) tries to cook Sergio in her oven. They manage to escape the witches once but are forced to turn back when they realise that José has accidentally left the loot at the witches' house. They return but are swiftly captured by the witches with the exception of Sergio, who escapes but is ultimately re-captured by Maritxu. At this point José learns that Sergio will be used as part of an arcane ritual to Graciana's goddess and that the rest of them will likely be killed as part of the ritual.  Silvia, who has been following the men's trail throughout the film, manages to find the witches' house in time to see Sergio get carried into the house. She enlists the help of the cops (as she knew that they had been following her) and the three of them manage to break into the house, where they find a secret passage that allows them to witness a dinner party Graciana is holding for various witches that will be attending the night's ritual. The secret passage, which was in the ceiling, ends up to be too weak to hold the weight of Silvia and both cops, and the trio ends up landing on the dinner table. José, Tony, and Manuel end up escaping in the chaos, however Silvia and the two cops are captured, with Silvia turned into a witch with the use of tainted toad juice. The three men are then chased by the witches and are all eventually re-captured except for José, who survives only through the intervention of Graciana's daughter Eva ([[Carolina Bang]]), who had fallen instantly in love with him. She demands that he leave with her right away, forsaking all of the others, only for José to refuse to leave his son behind. Eva throws a fit, which sends José flying and he flees the scene. He ultimately ends up in an underground chamber in the house, where he comes across Eva's brother Luismi, who has been imprisoned for years. José frees Luismi, who then shows him the way to the ritual chamber. Along the way they free Eva, who had been buried alive by her mother for her betrayal. Eva professes her love for José, who turns her away because she is a witch and because everything is so chaotic.   Ultimately Luismi and José make it to the ritual chamber where they see Tony, Manuel, Pacheco, and Calvo get put in front of a fire to slowly burn to death. They also witness the emergence of Graciana's ugly goddess, a grotesque gargantuan woman resembling a [[Venus of Willendorf|fertility statue]]. The ugly goddess devours Sergio, who passes through the giant and emerges alive, much to the joy of the witches, who proclaim that he will lead them all to victory over mankind. José confronts the witches with the help of Eva, who manages to cause the goddess's destruction, and José manages to escape the chaos with Sergio, Eva, and the other men. The witches are all presumed to have died in the chaos caused by the goddess's death throes. The film ends with an epilogue that takes place at a school talent show one month later. José and Eva are shown to be a couple raising Sergio, who is growing into his powers. Everything seems to have ended happily, only for the camera to show that Silvia, Graciana, and Maritxu are all alive and are content to wait for the couple to grow discontent with their happiness and once again turn to the witches.

The Wolverine (film)
 In 1945, [[Wolverine (character)|Logan]] is held in a Japanese [[Prisoner-of-war camp|POW camp]] near Nagasaki. During the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]], Logan saves an officer named Ichirō Yashida by shielding him from the blast.  In the present day, Logan lives as a hermit in [[Yukon]], tormented by hallucinations of [[Jean Grey]], whom he was forced to kill to save the world. He is located by [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]], a [[Mutant (comics)|mutant]] with the ability to foresee people's deaths, on behalf of Ichirō, now the CEO of a technology [[zaibatsu]]. Ichirō, who is dying of cancer, wants Logan to accompany Yukio to Japan so that he may repay his life debt. In Tokyo, Logan meets Ichirō's son, [[Shingen Yashida|Shingen]], and granddaughter, [[Mariko Yashida|Mariko]]. There, Ichirō offers to transfer Logan's healing abilities into his own body, thus saving Ichirō's life and alleviating Logan of his near-immortality, which Logan views as a curse. Logan refuses and prepares to leave the following day. That night, Ichirō's physician Dr. Green (also known as [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]]) introduces something into Logan's body, but Logan dismisses it as a dream.  The next morning, Logan is informed that Ichirō has died. At the funeral, [[Yakuza]] gangsters attempt to kidnap Mariko, but Logan and Mariko escape together into the urban sprawl of Tokyo. Logan is shot and his wounds do not heal as quickly as they should. After fighting off more Yakuza on a [[Shinkansen|bullet train]], Logan and Mariko hide in a local [[love hotel]]. Meanwhile, Ichirō's bodyguard [[Silver Samurai#Kenuichio Harada|Harada]] meets with Dr. Green who, after demonstrating her mutant powers on him, demands he find Logan and Mariko. Logan and Mariko travel to Ichirō's house in Nagasaki, and the two slowly fall in love. Meanwhile, Yukio has a vision of Logan dying and goes to warn him. Before Yukio arrives, Mariko is captured by the Yakuza. After interrogating one of the kidnappers, Logan and Yukio confront Mariko's fiancé, corrupt [[Minister of Justice (Japan)|Minister of Justice]] Noburo Mori. Mori confesses that he conspired with Shingen to have Mariko killed because Ichirō left control of the company to Mariko, and not Shingen.  Mariko is brought before Shingen at Ichirō's estate when ninjas led by Harada attack and whisk her away. Logan and Yukio arrive later and, using Ichirō's X-ray machine, discover a robotic parasite attached to Logan's heart, suppressing his healing ability. Logan cuts himself open and extracts the device. During the operation, Shingen attacks but Yukio holds Shingen off long enough for Logan to recover and kill Shingen. Logan follows Mariko's trail to the village of Ichirō's birth, where he is captured by Harada's ninjas. Logan is placed in a machine by Dr. Green, who reveals her plans to extract his healing factor and introduces him to the [[Silver Samurai]], an [[electromechanical]] suit of [[Japanese armor]] with energized swords made of [[adamantium]]. Mariko escapes from Harada, who believes he is acting in Mariko's interests and frees Logan from the machine. Harada sees the error of his ways and is killed by the Silver Samurai while helping Logan escape.  Meanwhile, Yukio arrives and kills Dr. Green as Logan fights the Silver Samurai. The Silver Samurai severs Logan's adamantium claws and begins to extract Logan's healing abilities, revealing himself to be Ichirō, who had faked his death. Ichirō regains his youth, but Mariko intervenes and stabs Ichirō with Logan's severed claws. Logan regenerates his bone claws and kills Ichirō. Logan collapses and has one final hallucination of Jean, in which he decides to finally let go of her. Mariko becomes CEO of Yashida Industries and bids farewell to Logan as he prepares to leave Japan. Yukio vows to stay by Logan's side as his bodyguard, and they depart to places unknown.  In a mid-credits scene, Logan returns to the [[United States]] two years later and is approached at the airport by [[Magneto (comics)|Erik Lehnsherr]], who warns him of a grave new threat to the mutant race; and [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]], whom Logan previously thought was dead.  
World War Z (film)
   Former [[United Nations|UN]] employee Gerry Lane, his wife Karin and their two daughters are in heavy [[Philadelphia]] traffic when the city is overrun by [[Zombie (fictional)|zombies]] that are attracted to sound. As chaos spreads, the Lanes escape to [[Newark, New Jersey]] and take refuge in an apartment, home to a couple with a young son, Tommy. [[Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Deputy Secretary-General]] Thierry Umutoni, an old friend of Gerry, sends a helicopter that extracts the Lanes and Tommy to a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] vessel in the Atlantic where scientists and military personnel are analyzing the worldwide outbreaks. Andrew Fassbach posits that the plague is a virus and that development of a vaccine depends on finding the origin. Gerry reluctantly agrees to help Fassbach find the outbreak's source after it is made clear that the Lanes will be removed from the cramped ship if he is not of use.  Gerry and Fassbach fly to [[Camp Humphreys]], a military base in South Korea, where they are attacked on arrival by zombies. Turning to re-enter the aircraft, Fassbach slips, falls and accidentally shoots himself dead. After being rescued by the base's surviving personnel, led by Captain Speke, Gerry learns that the infection was introduced to the base by its doctor, who was ultimately incinerated by a soldier with a lame leg whom the infected ignored. A former CIA operative imprisoned at the base for selling weapons to [[North Korea]] (to help them fight the infection) tells Gerry to go to [[Jerusalem]], where he says a safe zone has been maintained by the Israeli [[Mossad]] since before the outbreak's official acknowledgement. As Gerry and his team return to their aircraft, Karin &ndash; worried about her husband after he misses their pre-arranged call time&ndash; rings his satellite phone, attracting zombies who kill several soldiers, with only Gerry and his pilot escaping.  In Jerusalem, Gerry meets Mossad chief Jurgen Warmbrunn, who explains that months earlier, the Mossad had intercepted an Indian military message claiming that Indian troops were fighting the ''[[rakshasa]]'', or "dead spirits". Israel had thereupon quarantined Jerusalem, erecting huge walls around it. Just as Jurgen shows Gerry that Israel is allowing survivors to take refuge in the city, loud celebratory singing from refugees prompts zombies to scale the walls and attack. Jurgen orders some Israeli soldiers to escort Gerry back to his plane. On the way, Gerry notices zombies ignoring an old man and an emaciated boy. Soon after, one of Gerry's escorts, a soldier who identifies herself only as "[[Israel Defense Forces ranks|Segen]]" (lieutenant), is bitten in the hand, which Gerry quickly amputates to stop her turning. Gerry and Segen escape on a commercial airliner as Jerusalem is overrun.  Gerry contacts Thierry, and the airliner is diverted to a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) facility outside [[Cardiff|Cardiff, Wales]]. When a stowaway zombie attacks on approach to Cardiff, Gerry uses a grenade to blow the infected out of the aircraft, which also causes the plane to crash. Gerry is injured, but both he and Segen survive. They proceed to the WHO facility, where Gerry loses consciousness. He awakens three days later and explains to the remaining WHO staff his theory, based on the people he has seen the zombies ignore: the infected do not bite the seriously injured or terminally ill since they would be unsuitable hosts for viral reproduction. He suggests that they test this by deliberately infecting somebody with a pathogen from the facility, but the pathogens are stored in a wing already overrun by zombies. Gerry, Segen and the lead WHO doctor go to get a pathogen. As they fight their way through, they are separated; Gerry continues to the pathogen vault while Segen and the doctor return to the main building. A zombie corners Gerry inside the vault, prompting him to inject himself with an unknown pathogen and open the vault, thereby testing his theory. The zombie ignores him, as do those he encounters while returning to the main building. Everybody rejoices at Gerry's success.  Gerry and his family are reunited in a safe zone at [[Freeport, Nova Scotia]]. A "vaccine", derived from deadly pathogens, is developed and issued to survivors battling the infected, acting as a kind of camouflage. The vaccine also helps survivors to reach quarantine zones. Human offensives begin against the zombies, and hope is restored. "This isn't the end," Gerry comments, "Not even close. ''Our war'' has just begun."  
The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)
 In 1987, [[Jordan Belfort]] procures a job as a Wall Street stockbroker for [[L.F. Rothschild]], employed under Mark Hanna, who quickly entices him with the sex and drugs fueled stockbroker culture and passes on his idea that a stockbroker's only goal is to make money for himself. Jordan soon finds his career terminated following [[Black Monday (1987)|Black Monday]] and takes a job at a [[Boiler room (business)|boiler room brokerage firm]] on Long Island that specializes in [[penny stock]]s. Thanks to his aggressive pitching style and the high commissions, Jordan makes a small fortune.  Jordan befriends his neighbor, Donnie Azoff, and the two found their own company. They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the "hard sell". The basic method of the firm is a [[pump and dump]] scam. To cloak this, Jordan gives the firm the respectable-sounding name of [[Stratton Oakmont]]. After an exposé in ''[[Forbes]]'', hundreds of ambitious young financiers flock to his company. Jordan becomes immensely successful and slides into a decadent lifestyle of prostitutes and drugs. He has an affair with a woman named Naomi Lapaglia. When his wife finds out, Jordan divorces her and marries Naomi. Meanwhile, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|SEC]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] begin investigating Stratton Oakmont. Jordan illegally makes $22 million in three hours upon securing the [[Initial public offering|IPO]] of [[Steve Madden (company)|Steve Madden]]. This brings him and his firm further to the attention of the FBI. To hide his money, Jordan opens a [[Swiss bank account]] with corrupt banker Jean-Jacques Saurel in the name of Naomi's Aunt Emma, who is a British national and thus outside the reach of American authorities. He uses the wife and in-laws of his friend Brad Bodnick, who have European passports, to smuggle the cash into Switzerland.  Donnie gets into a public brawl with Brad, and, while Donnie escapes, Brad is arrested. Jordan learns from his private investigator that the FBI is wiretapping his phones. Fearing for his son, Jordan's father advises him to leave Stratton Oakmont and lie low while Jordan's lawyer negotiates a deal to keep him out of prison. Jordan, however, cannot bear to quit and talks himself into staying in the middle of his farewell speech. Jordan, Donnie, and their wives are on a yacht trip to Italy when they learn that Aunt Emma has died of a heart attack. Jordan decides to travel to Switzerland immediately to settle the bank account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship is capsized in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine. Jordan takes this as a sign from God and decides to sober up.  Two years later, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, arrested in Florida on an unrelated charge, has informed the FBI on Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency. Now fed up with Jordan's lifestyle, Naomi tells Jordan she is divorcing him and wants full custody of their children. Jordan loses his temper and tries to run off with his daughter Skylar in his car, but he ends up crashing in the driveway. The next morning, Jordan wears a wire to work but slips a note to Donnie warning him. Donnie keeps the note and rats out on Jordan to the FBI. Jordan is arrested for breaching his co-operation deal. The FBI raids and shuts down Stratton Oakmont. Despite his breach, Jordan receives a reduced sentence for his testimony and serves three years in a minimum security prison. After his release, Jordan makes a living hosting seminars on sales technique.  
Words and Pictures (film)
 Croyden is an upscale college preparatory school in [[Maine]] that hires teachers for their advanced courses who are accomplished professionals.  Jack Marcus is a writer and poet who teaches the advanced writing class. He's a good teacher who inspires his students. He demonstrates how some carefully chosen words and phrases can stimulate the listener's imagination to produce vivid mental imagery. One particular grievance of his involves the way in which young developing minds have been hijacked by the tedious distractions of modern technical gadgetry. He seems to be afflicted with writer's block and hasn't come out with any original work in several years. He publishes the school's literary magazine, which the school administration is planning to shut down for budgetary reasons. He is a high-functioning alcoholic who chronically arrives late to work and is on the verge of being fired. He is divorced and has an adult son from his first marriage, but they have become estranged because of Jack's drinking and general irresponsibility.  Dina Delsanto is an artist who has just been hired to teach the advanced art class, which has the same students as Jack's writing class. Dina was a successful painter in [[New York City]], but she now has difficulty painting or even walking and engaging in daily activities because of severe [[rheumatoid arthritis]]. She can no longer fasten buttons, open medicine bottles or hold paint brushes. She moved to Maine, where her sister and her mother live, so that they can help her during the spells when her arthritis worsens. As a teacher, she is a perfectionist with no interest in her students' personal lives. She simply wants them to concentrate on creating the best works of art that they can. She shows them the difference between paintings that merely demonstrate craft and paintings that evoke feeling as well. She struggles to paint again by overcoming her physical limitations as well as her own artistic difficulties. She finally creates a good work of art and sets it aside to dry. She has, incidentally, professed a complete disdain for the spoken and printed word. She insists that artistically rendered images are the only worthwhile media for expressing "truth".  Jack's colleagues and friends perceive him as attention-getting, obnoxious and charming. Once he gets wind of Dina's personal philosophy, he provokes an argument with her over which is more important, words or pictures. Their students are drawn into the conflict with class assignments demonstrating the superiority of words over pictures or pictures over words. Dina agrees to have her students contribute their own works of art to Jack's literary magazine. They decide to have an assembly in which each side will put on a presentation arguing the case for words and for pictures. The school administration becomes impressed enough with all of this activity to retain his services as an instructor.  Jack pursues Dina romantically and ultimately succeeds. But, during his first night over, he gets drunk on her vodka and crashes headlong into her newest painting. He further confesses to [[plagiarizing]] a poem from his own son, a moral failing for which Dina is even more unforgiving. She throws him out and tells him she doesn't want to have anything more to do with him.  He confesses the plagiarism to the school board and hands in his resignation. He asks only to continue for the rest of the year and put on the War on Words and Pictures assembly program. The board grants him his request, and the movie concludes with a satisfying resolution at the aforementioned assembly.  
A Wolf at the Door (film)
 A mother and housewife named Sylvia goes to pick up her daughter Claudinha at school, and finds her missing. She is told by the teacher that she received a phone call from someone who claimed to be her, saying that she was sick and that a neighbor would come pick her up instead.  At the police station, Sylvia, her husband Bernardo, and the teacher are questioned for possible clues about who could have taken the girl. Bernardo reveals that he strongly suspects it was the work of a woman named Rosa, with whom he'd been carrying an affair for some time. Rosa is taken in for questioning. At first, she is reluctant to speak, and tells the police that she was blackmailed into taking the girl at the behest of a woman named Bete, whose husband was supposedly involved in an affair with Sylvia. This is exposed as a lie by the police after an investigation of the neighborhood reveals that no such woman exists, and after the police officer threatens her, Rosa confesses everything.  Rosa and Bernardo met a train station after the latter saw on her the train and followed her. Their affair begins passionately, but Rosa becomes upset when she discovers that Bernardo lied to her about being married and having a family. She tells him that she does not mind being his lover for the meantime, but begins to visit his wife and child, befriending her by pretending to be a mutual acquaintance of an old friend and presenting his daughter with gifts. Upon being told about this by his wife, Bernardo becomes enraged and fights with Rosa, abusing her and telling her never to seek out his family again. Rosa ignores this request, and tries to get back at him by paying a woman at a bar to phone him, pretending to be the wife of Sylvia's lover to try and sabotage their relationship. She also discovers that Bernardo has been rekindling his relationship with Sylvia anyway, and that it is likely that their affair is at its end.  During an argument about the future of their relationship, Rosa reveals that her period is late. Rosa complies with Bernardo's request to have a pregnancy test, which turns out positive. She tells Bernardo that he can resume his life without regard for what becomes of her, but that she is having the child no matter what. Some time later, Bernardo tricks Rosa into visiting a practitioner acquaintance of his, who drugs Rosa and performs an abortion against her will.  Devastated and unstable, Rosa tries to arrange one last meeting with Bernardo, but is rebuffed. She picks up Claudinha at school, and eventually takes her to an abandoned lot, where she pulls out a pistol from her purse, kills the child, and burns her corpse with gasoline. The film ends with a voiceover from the police officer describing Rosa's statement about the matter: she feels no remorse, and understands the full weight of her actions. She has no desire for an attorney, does not care about what will happen to her, and does not wish for anyone's forgiveness.

Despite Bulmer's pleas, Mick breaks his leg, stabs him with a [[bowie knife]] and places the fatally wounded officer back in the car before dousing it with petrol and setting it alight. Mick departs, leaving Bulmer to die in the resulting explosion.  A young German couple, Rutger (Phillipe Klaus) and Katarina ([[Shannon Ashlyn]]), hitchhike from [[Sydney]] to [[Wolfe Creek Crater|Wolf Creek Crater]] and camp nearby. In the middle of the night, Mick is driving by and sees their tent in the distance. He offers them a lift to a caravan park so they do not get charged for camping in a national park. When Rutger insists on declining his offer, Mick loses his temper and stabs Rutger in the back. He then ties down Katarina and prepares to rape her, but a wounded Rutger comes back and battles Mick. He is eventually overpowered and decapitated. Mick then informs Katarina that they’ll be spending "a fun couple of months together" before choking her until she falls unconscious. She later wakes up to see Mick cutting up Rutger's body to feed to his dogs. She flees into the bush and Mick pursues her in his truck.  Paul ([[Ryan Corr]]), an English tourist, is driving along the highway and stops for Katarina standing in the road. He picks her up, but Mick follows them. He shoots at Paul, but accidentally kills Katarina instead when Paul ducks under the shot, much to Paul's horror and Mick's dismay. Paul then drives off, dumping Katarina's body and covering it with just a sleeping bag at daybreak. He then reaches a highway, but realising he is off course and has low fuel, tries to flag down a truck in the distance. He soon realises that Mick is driving the truck, having killed the original driver. After a long chase, Mick nudges Paul's vehicle at a cliff side, sending it rolling down into a valley, then sends the truck hurtling down into Paul's vehicle which explodes as he barely escapes. Exhausted and dehydrated, Paul passes out near an outback cottage and is given food and shelter by elderly couple Jack ([[Gerard Kennedy (actor)|Gerard Kennedy]]) and Lil ([[Annie Byron]]). They plan to take Paul to the nearest town after he has eaten, but Mick finds the house, steals one of Jack's guns and shoots Jack and Lil dead. Paul then flees again, while Mick follows him on Jack's horse. He catches Paul hiding in the grassland and knocks him out.  Paul wakes up in Mick's dungeon, zip-tied to a chair. Mick is furious at Paul for his role in Katarina's death and prepares to torture him, but Paul pacifies him with his "English wit" by narrating bar jokes and leading Mick in drinking songs that he claims he learned at boarding school. Mick's torture for Paul consists of a ten question quiz about Australian culture and history, with a promise to free him if he answers five of them correctly. However, if Paul gets a question wrong, he loses a finger. Paul answers the first two questions and reveals that he is a history major. After he gets the next question 'wrong', Mick (incensed by Paul's knowledge) grinds off one of his fingers with a [[sander]] (the answer Paul provided was technically correct, Mick just had a different interpretation of it). During the next question, Paul tricks Mick into cutting his other hand free by deliberately answering incorrectly (and losing another finger), then grabs a nearby hammer and clubs Mick with it. He then flees through the tunnels, pursued by an injured Mick. Paul finds several decayed corpses of Mick's victims and a severely emaciated woman (Jordan Cowan) woken by him begs to be freed. Eventually he finds an exit, but notices a sheet on the ground directly in front of it. Lifting it up, he finds a [[Punji stick]] trap underneath and considers trying to jump over it. He hears someone coming and hides in a corner, assuming that it is Mick coming to get him. When the person who approaches walks past the corner, Paul then knocks the person into the trap with the claw hammer, killing them. But when he looks down to see what he thinks is Mick's corpse, he discovers it was just the woman he encountered earlier. Immediately afterwards, Mick finds and subdues Paul. After declaring himself "the winner" and lecturing how "It's up to my kind to wipe your kind out", Mick head-butts him unconscious.  When he wakes up, Paul finds himself on a footpath in a small town, dressed only in his underpants and with wounds across his body. He finds a note near him which reads "Loser", and he is soon discovered by the police.  A series of title cards reveal that despite reporting Mick to the police, Paul was held as a suspect in various unsolved murders in the Wolf Creek area. During the investigation, he suffered a complete mental breakdown and was deported back to the UK and placed in full-time care at [[Ashworth Hospital]], Merseyside. The film ends in a manner similar to the previous film, with Mick walking off into the outback with his rifle.

The androids capture Peter, but Gary is determined to finish the pub crawl. At the World's End, Andy confronts Gary; he realises that Gary recently attempted suicide and clings to his goal of completing the Mile due to his sense that he has not and cannot achieve anything else in life.  As Andy tries to stop Gary from drawing his final pint, they discover a hidden chamber and reunite with Steven. A disembodied alien entity, the Network, tells them that the android invasion has been responsible for the technological advances in [[telecommunication]] over recent decades as part of a first step to joining a galactic community. It offers them eternal youth by becoming androids, but they refuse. Gary persuades them that humanity is too stupid to join the aliens; exasperated, the Network abandons the invasion.

Andy's marriage has recovered, Steven is in a relationship with Sam, and android versions of Peter and Oliver have returned to a semblance of their former lives.

Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon
 In the [[East China Sea]] a Chinese fleet is attacked by a mysterious sea creature, destroying many ships and leaving the remainder severely damaged. Shortly afterwards, the young Dee Renjie ([[Mark Chao]]) arrives in the Imperial Capital [[Changan]], after receiving a recommendation to join the Ministry of Justice. In an attempt to appease the sea creature, the city officials have selected the beautiful courtesan Yin Ruiji ([[Angelababy]]) to be given to the monster. Empress Wu ([[Carina Lau]]), currently serving as the regent for the current emperor, charges Yuchi ([[Feng Shaofeng]]), a member of the Ministry of Justice, to investigate the sea monster attacks, threatening execution if he does not succeed in ten days. Shortly after arriving at the temple to be cleansed before the ceremony, Yin Ruiji is attacked by a group of bandits. The attackers are intercepted by Dee through [[lip reading]]. While Dee and the kidnappers are occupied, the unconscious Ruiji is taken by "the sea monster" but is rescued by Dee before the creature is able to escape. Upon arriving at the temple and defeating the last of the attackers, Yuchi has Dee arrested and sends Yin to Swallow House to rest and to protect her.  After being taken to prison, Dee catches the attention of medical assistant Shatuo ([[Lin Gengxin]]).  Dee quickly enlists his help to feign a dangerous illness for escape.  They immediately ride to Swallow House.  Meanwhile, at Swallow House, the sea monster visits the recovering Ruiji while writing poetry. It leaves a jade hairpin behind, reminding Ruiji that she gave that hairpin to her lover, Yuan Zhen. Yuan, in monster form, tries to write a message until a group of thugs attack the house. Dee and Shatuo arrives to fight off the thugs, while Yuchi is poisoned by bee stings and dragged into water. Rescuing Yuchi, Dee accuses Ruiji of hiding something, but is suddenly attacked by Yuan, who was hiding on the wide [[eaves]].  As they fight, Ruiji suddenly stabs Dee and threatens to kill herself with the hairpin to cause Yuan to flee.  The thugs return to their master, who kills one in anger at their failure. Dee confronts Ruiji again, who reveals her past with Yuan Zhen. As she produces the hairpin, Dee notices its faded colors. Yin also gives Dee the fabric Yuan was trying to write on.  Shantuo appears and tells them someone has been arrested for questioning.  A local mask maker is being tortured and Dee stops this, declaring that the masks were not made with local materials;  also, the thugs spoke the Dondo language, a people who live between the Fuyu Kingdom and the Tang Dynasty.  Fishing being their main trade, they are excellent swimmers and can stay underwater for long periods of time. Dee gives Yuchi the fabric, and they read the words 'Bird's Tongue', alluding to the imperial tea sold at Tranquility Teahouse, owned by Yuan Zhen. Dee also deduces that the thugs were not after Ruiji, but the creature Yuan. They immediately ride to Tranquility Teahouse.  Nobody is there when they arrive, so Dee deduces that there is a traitor in the police department who has informed the tea house workers to evacuate. Fortunately, Dee had left Shantuo a note to escape with Ruiji.  When they meet, Shantuo tells Dee that the substance that faded the hairpin was a dye mixed with pine oil, called 'Shaxi'. Only a few shops use it and only one beside Swallow House.  Dee, Shatuo and Ruiji visit an aggressive Yuan. They take Yuan, who has been acting psychotic to the imperial doctor Wang Pu. Wang Pu administers a sedative to Yuan and they all escape before Yuchi finds them. Doctor Wang Pu cuts open Yuan's head and stops Yuan's disease from worsening. Once Yuan wakes up he recalls how he was poisoned by Dondo leader using parasites during a meeting after he refused to give away the trade secret to his Bird's Tongue tea and soon after his skin started scaling turning him into a monster. Dee deduces that the Dondo spies have been adding parasites to the 'Bird's Tongue' tea drunk by all the Imperial officials in a conspiracy to kill the Imperial lineage of the kingdom. He sends a quick message to Yuchi who finds Dee's claims to be absurd. However, they set off to warn the Empress carrying an antidote prepared by Doctor Wang. The Empress does not believe Dee's theory but she agrees to test it out on a minister of the kingdom warning Dee that he will be decapitated if it doesn't work. The medicine does not work in 2 hours as Dee said and while he was about to be executed Shatuo and Ruiji jump in and plead to the Empress who remains unchanged. As Dee was about to be beheaded, the Empress is informed about the Minister who drank the medicine, who throws a fit as beetles come out of his mouth proving that he was poisoned by the tea. Empress Wu agrees that the medicine be given to the sick Emperor and once he is cured, everybody within the imperial administration gets the medicine.  Dee is made a minister to the dislike of Yuchi, however they both find the spy within the Da Lisi and while fighting him off, they encounter the sea monster. Yuchi saves a drowning Dee during the fight. Dee admits he can't swim and they fail to lure in the sea monster again. They question a recovering Yuan who says he was imprisoned at an island in the sea and that he released the sea monster raised by the Dondo rebels while escaping. Meanwhile, Empress Wu imprisons Ruiji since she hails from Fuyu Kingdom but Dee makes a bet with the Empress that if he kills the rebels in a day she should release Ruiji. Dee and Yuchi deduce that the rebels must be hiding in the Bat island based on the clues and set sail towards the island. They surround the island at night, a fight ensues and the head of the Dondo rebel is eventually killed. While returning from the island they encounter the sea monster which destroys two of the three ships. As Dee does not know how to swim, Yuchi helps him escape using a horse which can swim. Finally they shoot the sea monster and launch poisoned fish bait at it. The sea monster drags down the third ship but lets go as the poison takes effect and it dies. The Da Lisi return victoriously and Dee is awarded a prestigious mace by the Emperor. A cured Yuan and Ruiji flee the city in order to avoid conflicts on the advise of Dee.  In a mid-credit scene, the Emperor and the Empress offer Di, Yuchi and Shatuo a supposedly now non-poisonous tea; however, after they finish their bowls, the Empress asks for the antidote, revealing it was in fact poisoned and thus forcing the trio to drink urine like the entire court had to.

Yolki 3
 There is an addition to the Kravchuk family — Nastya receives two pups; thoroughbred female Yoko and mixed-breed male dog Pirate. Nastya's mother plans to take Yoko to London for a highly profitable dog breeding business right during the New Year. Nastya becomes indignant and informs everyone of this on social media. The news becomes viral. Pirate does not want to be separated from Yoko, but at the last moment he lets her go, thereby launching the "Boomerang of Good".  Nastya's mother, Elena, having the gift of "good", shares it with her client, Evgeniy, by helping build a children's [[petting zoo]]. Evgeniy, having received the "good", leaves home to help his friend Boris, who is in danger of losing an important contract and who, at the most crucial moment displaces his phone. Children of the two friends are left home alone (their wives are at the sauna). Boris buys a phone to contact the Chinese with whom he makes important deals. By mistake, they get on a bus going to a psychiatric hospital. Boris shares his phone with Fedor, one of the passengers. Fedor calls his twin brother, Tolik, with whom he has not talked for a long time and wishes to see again. Tolik, in turn, is on the plane along with Nastya's parents and Yoko.  Pirate can not stand the separation and runs away from home in search of Yoko. He runs to the airport and finds the plane where Yoko is inside. Tolik unsuccessfully tries to stop the plane which is to fly to London. Pirate manages to continue his journey by air with bribing a dog with sausage who is flying with his owners to London on the next flight.  From Yekaterinburg, Tolik reports the location of his brother to Natasha. Natasha shares the "good" with her friend Galya and persuades her to make peace with her husband, Alexander Korovin, and forgive his infidelity. Galya bestows the "good" to Korovin and her father, Konstantin Lvovich. Korovin is a friend of Professor Andrei Nikolayevich, who quarreled with his wife, Natasha, because he too was caught cheating. Konstantin Lvovich is a military commissar, who a year ago sent snowboarder Dima and skier Grisha to the island of Ratmanov. Konstantin Lvovich allows the old woman Manya and Olesya to fly to the island. Soon, Dima himself learns about this. Dima receives the "Boomerang of Good".  Meanwhile, Vika, creator of the social group "Boomerang of Good," is going to London to see her boyfriend, Sasha. But she is made to stay and visit her neighbor, Nikolai Petrovich, who in turn forces Vika to fly to London, because her lover is waiting for her. Vika's laptop remains in the apartment of Nikolai Petrovich, and he adds his poems in the form of status updates on the page. On the way to the airport, Vika tries to help passers-by hoping for the "Boomerang of Good", but she ends up being put behind bars on suspicion of theft, and her phone is taken away.  A different incident occurs with Senior Sergeant Alexei Kolesnikov, whose work is keeping an eye on the prisoners. His friend Denis, a traumatologist, learns that his school sweetheart, Masha, had come to Novosibirsk. To impress her, Denis asks Alexei, employee of a car dealership and father of Misha Kolesnikov, to take the most expensive Mercedes for a test drive. Alexei agrees, provided that he will follow behind and observe what is happening. When Denis and Masha drive in the car, an accident occurs, as a result of which Alexei goes to the hospital, and Denis's car is stolen. When Denis returns to the auto dealership, he sees that the robbers have returned the car, and Masha finds out about the deception.  Misha learns about the accident and returns Vika's phone back to her without realizing it. Vika calls Sasha and tries to explain what happened, but Sasha does not believe her. Nikolai Petrovich permanently deletes his popular group "Boomerang of Good" from the social network, as Vika no longer believes in its existence anymore. But at this moment Sasha notices Pirate on the streets of London and understands that Vika was right. He reports this on the social network and this becomes the most discussed news.  Nastya still has one more option: to call her uncle, snowboarder Dima. Dima calls his brother, Kolya, Nastya's father, and informs that Nastya can not stand the separation from her pets due to the fault of her parents. Kolya refuses to take part in Elena's plans and goes to the airport. There he sees on live TV that all flights have been canceled as a dog was found on the runway. It turns out to be Pirate. Kolya runs to the takeoff strip where Pirate is about to get shot by the guards. Elena watches the events live. Kolya reaches Pirate at the moment of the shot, and the bullet hits Kolya. Elena grabs Yoko and runs to the airport. There she finds her husband. Yoko "kisses" Kolya, and he comes to consciousness. Pirate and Yoko find each other. "The Boomerang of Good" returns to Pirate.  Boris and Evgeniy escape from the hospital and manage to return home to the arrival of wives. Andrei and Natasha reconcile with each other. Olesya meets her boyfriend Dima, and Manya goes skiing. A son is born to Misha and he congratulates his dad on becoming a grandfather. Masha finds Denis and remembers how much they were in love. Sasha returns to Moscow and finds Vika. Together they call Nikolai Petrovich and thank him for his help. Kolya and Lena call Nastya and report that they will soon return with Pirate and Yoko. Nastya gets new dogs too soon.  
Zanjeer (2013 film)
 ACP Vijay Khanna ([[Ram Charan (actor)|Ram Charan]]) is a brutally honest police officer who has been transferred yet again by the system for chasing the corrupt underworld goons. He is continuously disturbed by the killing of his parents years back. He keeps remembering a man in a black raincoat on a white horse and with a tattoo on his right arm killing his parents on Vijay's birthday for filing a case. Vijay was brought up by his uncle and was always absent on his birthdays. He is in charge of a case where the district collector has been murdered and burned to death. The key eye witness Mala ([[Priyanka Chopra]]) has seen the murder by Teja's ([[Prakash Raj]]) Gang and refuses to co-operate. Teja is the head of an oil mafia operation and doesn't want Mala alive. Vijay manages to convince Mala to give a statement which makes her perpetrators come after her. He gives her shelter in his house to protect her and she starts to like him while Vijay does not reciprocate the same. This includes her giving him a potato and egg for lunch at his office and then annoying him by celebrating his birthday. He shouts at her and she begins to cry. Vijay tells her that he did not want to celebrate because his parents were killed on the very day and reveals his past to her. He finally reciprocates her love as he realised that Mala is slowly becoming an important part of his life. He also encounters Sher Khan ([[Sanjay Dutt]]/[[Srihari]]) who is into buying and selling of illegal cars. Seeing Vijay's honesty and determination, Sher Khan turns over a new leaf and mends his ways to transform into a person who now only goes by the book. He has made Vijay a friend for life and will do anything to help him out. Vijay also encounters Jaydev a.k.a. JD ([[Atul Kulkarni]]/[[Tanikella Bharani]]), a reporter who had written bad comments about Vijay in the newspaper. Seeing Vijay's honesty and integrity, Jaydev becomes an admirer of Vijay and begins to give him all the information he has regarding the oil mafia. Meanwhile, Kataria ([[Bikramjeet Kanwarpal]]) the man who murdered the collector has been caught by Vijay. Kataria is revealed to be Teja's man and he reveals that they steal petrol and oil from container trucks, add [[kerosene]] in them and smuggle them around and outside the country. Vijay uses this information and puts Kataria in custody but the next day he is found murdered in custody. In the middle of this, Vijay also finds about a man Prashant Khanna, who was killed years back by Teja. Due to certain incidents which gave Vijay wrong informations about the oil mafia Teja is handling, Vijay is suspended till the investigation is done with. Now Vijay warns Teja that there are no seniors or rules that bind him and now Vijay will finish Teja in his own style. Slowly, Vijay begins to destroy almost all of Teja's oil refineries. But Mala says that all these activities that Vijay is doing can have dangerous consequences. One night, Vijay and Mala go to a restaurant for dinner where Vijay gets attacked by two of Teja's men in the bathroom. Vijay kills both the men and calls Teja and warns him that even if he sends the rest of his 198 men (it was earlier mentioned by Teja that he has 200 workers under him), nothing will happen to Vijay. A few days later, Sher Khan invites Vijay and Mala to a party. Later on, when they are returning home, they are attacked once again by ten of Teja's men. Vijay manages to lock Mala in a small room there and gets badly injured fighting them. He is almost killed but just in time, Sher Khan comes there, handles the rest of the goons and along with Mala, takes Vijay to the hospital. The next day, Teja comes there and criticizes Vijay saying that he is one who can only talk and doesn't have the guts to face Teja. After he leaves, Mala finally tells Vijay to finish Teja once and for all. That night Teja's men along with Bosco ([[Ankur Bhatia]]) kill Jaydev and the whole city begins to panic. Meanwhile, two sub inspectors who work under Vijay gives Sher Khan information that the night Kataria was murdered, an inspector, Saalwe had arrested a man for a petty case. But Saalwe did not record the case and so they suspect Saalwe and the man who he arrested had killed Kataria. So, using some of his informers Sher Khan finds Saalwe and Teja's trusted man Bosco ([[Ankur Bhatia]])   who was hiding himself and Saalwe in a colony. Then he puts them in front of the commissioner and they agree that they had killed Kataria by breaking his neck and they had done it on Teja's saying as he feared Kataria might leak all the information about his gang. The commissioner realizes Vijay's Innocence and claims Teja a wanted criminal. Out of fear, Teja runs away into an old mine with Mona ([[Mahie Gill]]), but Vijay manages to track him down. Teja manages to get Vijay at gun point and pulls his coat's sleeve back. Then Vijay notices a tattoo on Teja's arm and realizes that he is the very one who killed his parents. Then Vijay says that Prashant Khanna who Teja killed years back was Vijay's dad. Teja is shocked and reveals that Prashant had filed a case against him and so Teja had to kill Prashant. In a fit of rage, Vijay begins to beat Teja badly. Vijay then breaks Teja's arm and kicks him into a bundle of petroleum barrels and shoots the barrels, causing Teja to die in the blast. The government announces all the wealth to be given to Mona, who was also said to be in all of Teja's nefarious activities. The film ends with Sher Khan and Mala coming to visit Vijay at the station, Mala finally being able to cook some food for him and Vijay smiling at Sher Khan when he sees a drug mafia case coming on [[television|TV]].

The Zero Theorem
 Qohen Leth, an eccentric programmer who refers to himself in the plural, is assigned to "crunch entities" for a company named Mancom. Finding himself suffering [[existential angst]], Qohen constantly waits for a phone call, hoping that it might bring him happiness or the answers he seeks. When Qohen requests a "disability" evaluation, three company doctors determine that he is physically healthy, but require he have therapy from Dr Shrink-[[Read-only memory|ROM]], an [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] therapist designed to provide mental evaluation. Wanting to meet with "Management", Qohen attends a party held by his supervisor, Joby. Stumbling into an empty room, Qohen finds Management and requests to work from home, as he would be more productive and would no longer risk missing his call; Management simply notes he finds Qohen "quite insane".  Attempting to leave the party, Qohen is pressed into staying by Joby and, when Qohen starts choking on an olive, he is rescued by partygoer Bainsley. His request granted by Management, Qohen is informed he is to start working from home, and is shown a massive supercomputer dubbed "The Neural Net Mancive"; containing all of the entities crunched by workers, Qohen is required to order its data to solve the "Zero Theorem", a mysterious mathematical formula. Spending months as a hermit whilst working on the program, he is diagnosed with numerous conditions by Shrink-ROM, and begins suffering nightmares involving a [[black hole]].  Frustrated with his work, Qohen smashes his computer with a hammer, and is soon visited by Bainsley. Qohen confides in Bainsley that he believes he accidentally hung up a call that would have given him the [[meaning of life]], and has desperately been waiting for a call-back ever since. Qohen is then visited by Bob, the teenage son of Management. Bob repairs his computer, reveals Management is spying on him, and suggests that Bainsley is only interested in Qohen because she is paid to be. After Qohen insists he will cease working on the Zero Theorem, Bob promises to get him his call if he continues. Having received a [[Teledildonics|VR]] suit from Bainsley, Qohen interacts with her through virtual reality, which makes them both appear on a beach together. When Qohen asks if the sun in the horizon ever sets, Bainsley responds it is not programmed to do so. They soon kiss one another.  Visited again by Bob, Qohen, to his distaste, learns the Zero Theorem aims to prove life is meaningless through the [[Big Crunch]] theory. Digitally connecting to Bainsley again, Qohen is comforted by her, but when he denounces Management and suggests eloping together, she forcefully disconnects, damaging Qohen's suit. When Bob then takes his suit to repair it, Qohen connects to Bainsley unannounced, only to discover she is a [[Camgirling|webcam stripper]]. Bob returns with Qohen's suit, now repaired, and reveals his phone call is only a delusion, and admits his Dr. Shrink-ROM was only designed to identify his pathology rather than treat it. Qohen is visited by Bainsley, who apologizes for deceiving him, but claims she truly fell in love with him; despite Bainsley's offer to elope, which is encouraged by Bob, Qohen turns her down.  Qohen, discussing his problems with Bob, discovers Bob's health is radically declining. Caring for Bob, Qohen finds a hidden camera in his bathroom mirror, and begins to uncover and smash Management's cameras. Despite barricading his home, Management employees break in and take Bob away. Visited by Joby, Qohen is berated by him, as his actions got Joby fired. Qohen dons his now "repaired" virtual reality suit and connects to his computer, but is nearly electrocuted.  Appearing at the Neural Net Mancive, Qohen is greeted by an image of Management, who notes that Bob is hospitalized because of his declining health, which is due to a chronic illness. Management explains Qohen is now part of the Neural Net and, when Qohen asks questions about the meaning of his life, Management explains that there is none, and that he was never a higher power able to grant Qohen his call. Management explains that while the Zero Theorem would prove that everything is meaningless, the entire purpose of Mancom in "crunching entities" was to bring order to disorder, finding meaning in some form that he could sell. Management explains he chose Qohen to solve the Zero Theorem as he was its effective antithesis, since he had faith in finding meaning, waiting endlessly for his phone call. Management then disappears, apologizing as he no longer needs Qohen; angered, Qohen smashes the Neural Net, collapsing it and revealing a black hole inside. Smiling, Qohen jumps into it, only to appear back on the virtual beach. Resigned, calm and alone, Qohen stands in front of the sea and, after interacting with the sun, watches the sunset he causes. As the credits roll, Bainsley is heard calling Qohen, hinting that either Bainsley has joined him or he has conjured her up in his virtual world.

Zapatlela 2
 The film opens within the mansion of ''Baba Chamatkar'' ([[Raghvendra Kadkol]]). ''Kubdya Khavis'' has escaped from the prison and  secured the doll containing the soul of [[gangster]] Tatya Vinchu (shown in the previous film, [[Zapatlela]]) and orders Baba Chamatkar to revive Tatya Vinchu again. He admits that the diamonds worth 5 crore which are now worth 50 crores were stolen by him and Tatya but only Tatya knows its location. He plans to sap all the information and kill Tatya again. He also offers Baba half of the cost of diamonds in return for reviving Tatya. However, Baba refuses to commit the same mistake again. Infuriated, Kubdya tries to kill him using a ''trishul'' (a weapon which looks like a [[trident]]). However, Baba uses the same weapon to kill him. A drop of Kubdya's blood is accidentally transferred towards the doll, which resuscitates Tatya Vinchu. Tatya confronts Baba Chamatkar and forces him to tell how to migrate to a human form. Baba resists in the beginning and then falls unconscious. Tatya finds a book named 'Om Fat Swaha' and discovers that, to migrate to a human form, the victim (Tatya) must make use of the ''Mrutyunjaya Mantra'' on the person to whom he has confessed his true name. But now that the person (''Lakshya'', portrayed by [[Laxmikant Berde]] in [[Zapatlela]]) is dead, the same mantra can be used on his son. Tatya vows to find Lakshya's son and migrate into his body.  Meanwhile, at [[Shrirangpur]], a ''jatra'' (village fair) has been organized dedicated to the village deity. Aditya Bolke ([[Adinath Kothare]]) is a mechanical engineer without a job, and like his father, is thoroughly interested in [[ventriloquism]]. He lives with his grandmother ([[Madhu Kambikar]]). Aditya meets Megha ([[Sonalee Kulkarni]]), who is on a vacation and is a [[lavani]] dancer at her mother's ([[Vishakha Subhedar]]) theater within the fair. Aditya and Megha fall in love with each other. Meanwhile, Makarand/Makya ([[Makarand Anaspure]]) has set up his ventriloquist theater ([[puppet show]]) and wishes to make a healthy profit from this fair. He has created a doll which resembles Tatya Vinchu, after hearing the local legend, although he himself is skeptic about it.  Aditya frequently tries to meet Makarand and learn about ventriloquism, but is challenged by the theater's security guard ([[Deepak Shirke]]), and the chase often ends up funnily. Gauri Wagh ([[Sai Tamhankar]]) is a journalist and has arrived to Shrirangpur to cover a report on the fair. Meanwhile, Tatya arrives in the fair and identifies Aditya as the son of Lakshya. Gauri, in a small incident, discovers that the doll is, in fact, alive. Aditya accidentally gets hold of Tatya Vinchu, and after taking it home, discovers that the doll is alive. However, being an engineer, he thinks that the doll is battery powered.  Police Commissioner Mahesh Jadhav ([[Mahesh Kothare]]) investigates the death of Kubdya Khavis and is notified that Baba Chamatkar (who has passed into a coma after being confronted by Tatya), has revived. Baba tells Mahesh that Tatya has in fact been revived. Mahesh instructs the police at Shrirangpur to find the doll. He then travels to Shrirangpur and meets Inspector Sakharam ([[Vijay Chavan]], who has been portrayed as Sakhya Havaldar in the prequel). Sakharam tells him that the doll has been located (which is in fact the replica created by Makarand). The police destroy the doll in a bonfire.  On the last day of the fair, Makarand is confronted by Tatya Vinchu, who threatens him at [[knifepoint]] and takes him to Aditya's house. He confronts his grandmother, who runs to Inspector Sakharam and tells him that Tatya is on his way to Aditya, who is at a religious procession at the fair. Tatya makes his way to Aditya, who travels up the [[Ferris wheel]] to save himself. However, the wheel gets stuck up. Tatya climbs up to him and tries to recite the mantra on Aditya. However, Mahesh (who has been communicated by Sakharam) reaches in time and shoots Tatya between his eyebrows. Tatya falls down, and is picked up by Mahesh. However, Tatya uses Mahesh's revolver gun and shoots him in his arm. Tatya goes back to climb up and reach Aditya. Aditya picks up a coconut knife and severs Tatya's head. Mahesh finds Tatya's headless body and orders the police that the case is not closed until the severed head is found. In the end scene, Tatya's head is shown to be resting (yet alive) under Mahesh's car.

Zero Charisma
 Scott Weidemeyer (Sam Eidson) is an overweight, overbearing [[Tabletop role-playing game|table top role playing gamer]]. He has a pathetic job, his at-home life is often unbearable as he still lives with his grandmother. Worse yet, he's never had a girlfriend. He does have one saving grace: Every Thursday night is game night. Ongoing for three years Scott and his group of friends meet at his house to play a game he has made. But it's all thrown out of order when one of the players quits to save his marriage. Scott tries to refill the position, but after scaring off a potential replacement player due to his short temper, it seems as though it won't happen. However, by chance, he meets a charismatic [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] named Miles (Garrett Graham) at the local game shop and convinces him to join his game rather than the local ones.  Things seem to be going well, however Scott finds himself hating Miles, as he steals the spotlight during his role playing games, Miles often talking about his personal life which mirrors what Scott wishes his life was, not the least of which is having an attractive girlfriend and running a successful [[popular culture]] website [[blog]] .  Things take a turn for the worse when Scott's grandmother Wanda (Anne Gee Byrd) has a stroke. His mother, Barbara (Cyndi Williams), decides to visit, much to his dismay. Wanda has cared for Scott much of his life, after his mother (Barbara) abandoned him. Barbara also is engaged to her third fiance, Bob (Larry Jack Dotson). Scott again tries to run a smooth game night, but his mother disrupts it. Scott's attitude toward his mother's interruption deteriorates to the point she openly humiliates Scott in front of the group, forcing him to end the game early. At this point, the players decide to host the next game night at Miles's house, again to Scott's frustration. During that game night, Scott attempts to impress the group by declaring that [[The Matrix]] was written by him in junior high. When Miles points out several inconsistencies on his story, Scott becomes loud, defensive, unstable and goes to the bathroom to cry. When the game resumes, Miles decides to go off the story Scott planned and to kill off an important story [[non-player character]]. Scott attempts to cheat out of it but Miles's girlfriend catches him. The players then say Scott takes the game too seriously and it's no longer fun when he's the [[Dungeon Master|dungeon master]]. Scott has a meltdown and wants to leave the game, but his friends opt to stay and play with Miles instead, which further enrages Scott.  Back at his grandmother's house, Scott, still fuming from the night before, finds out his mother is attempting to sell Wanda's house to settle debt she has accumulated over the years. Barbara manages to convince Wanda to sell the house after offering her a comfortable retirement only a few blocks from Barbara's house in Arizona. An angry Scott (who was promised the house by Wanda) berates his grandmother and threatens legal action, at which point even she turns on him, telling him he needs to grow up.  Scott trashes his room, only to find a book written by his hero, Greg Goran (Dakin Matthews). He goes to the local gaming shop where Goran is making an appearance. At first Scott seems ready to own up to his actions, apologizing to the assistant manager, Pete (John Gholson), for his attitude in the past, as well as asking for his old job. However, when Goran says 'at the end of the day it's a game ... if your players aren't having fun, you're not doing your job.' Scott becomes outraged and takes it as a personal insult. He cusses out Goran and insults Pete and his girlfriend. Pete then tells the audience that Scott was fired for masturbating to [[hentai|hentai anime]] pornography on his laptop in the backroom while the store was being robbed. Publicly humiliated, Scott goes to Miles's house where he's having a party.  Scott gets drunk and interacts with several of Miles's friends. Dressed in D&D robes, his drunken slurs about medieval culture allows him to become the life of the party among the party goers. After seeing Scott in his own home, Miles calls Scott's best friend, Wayne (Brock England), and asks him to come get Scott (who seems surprised that he was not invited to Miles's party). Scott then publicly challenges Miles to a faux battle with crutches. Scott's antics are so popular with the party goers that Miles has to comply. Scott loses control and lashes out at Miles and hits him hard in the face. At which point Miles strikes him in the stomach which puts him on the floor. Wayne, who just arrived a minute early, decides to defend his friend, attacks Miles and manages to rip out some of his hair before being thrown to the floor (allowing Miles to show off his violent behavior to the party goers and to the shock of his girlfriend).  Miles, still enraged, calls Scott and his friends 'damn nerds' and tells them to get out (implying that Miles never cared about Scott's friends). Scott apologizes to Wayne for his past actions. In a small flash forward, Scott is employed at the retirement home where his grandmother is. Happier and more responsible,  he plays his game with a small group of seniors. In the final scene, Scott shows a sliver of improvement in his attitude toward playing while still clinging to his serious gaming nature.

While walking the beach and showing the photo of the deceased to beachgoers and fishermen, Sokhela and Fletcher stumble upon a gang by a set of colorful beach shacks at Surfer's Corner.  Meanwhile, Epkeen goes further up the sand dune to investigate another group of [[Coloured]] teens playing loud music and drinking. A Coloured girl starts dancing and grinding on Epkeen. She makes a quick move, takes his holstered pistol, and fires a shot at him. Unbeknownst to her, Epkeen instinctively keeps it unloaded, with a loaded magazine hidden in his pants pocket. Epkeen manages to get his weapon away from her and load it.  The group flee for cover and make an escape. All the while, Sokhela and Fletcher are questioning the gang by the beach shacks. When Sokhela goes into one of the shacks and discovers a cache of weapons, he instinctively draws his weapon.  However, the gang now have Fletcher at gunpoint. The gang makes Sokhela drop his weapon.  A gang member then impales Sokhela through his left ear and leaves him pinned to the side of the beach shack.  Another gang member takes out a [[machete]] and cuts off Fletcher's left hand at the wrist.  Sokhela and Epkeen eventually discover that a biological weapon was being researched in secret before being released onto the streets as a new form of recreational drug, and move to confront those responsible.  
Zombie Hunter (film)
 The film opens with a news report on "Natas", a strange drug which has been reported to induce zombie-like effects in those who consume it. The film then fast forwards in time, to an Earth mostly inhabited by zombies. The Hunter ([[Martin Copping]]) drives along a post-apocalyptic wasteland and meets a hostile "Death Angel". The zombie is reduced to purplish goo after Hunter rams his car at it. He proceeds to stop at a deserted filling station to fill his car's empty gas tank. Hunter enters the station's convenience store to check out any available supplies, but is ambushed by invading zombies. He eliminates them all after a gory battle and downs his sorrows by gulping a bottle of tequila. It is revealed that Hunter's daughter and wife have both died. Resuming his journey, Hunter unknowingly ventures into the turf of the survivors, who have not been infected by Natas. Thinking Hunter is a zombie, an unknown assailant takes a shot at him. Hunter survives nevertheless and is greeted by survivor Fast Lane Debbie (Jade Regier) upon regaining consciousness.  A flirty Debbie attempts to make out with Hunter but fellow survivor Alison (Clare Niederpruem) awkwardly walks into the room to hand him a can of cola, before coercing an annoyed Debbie to leave Hunter alone. Outside, Debbie accuses Alison of being a slut. The latter woman throws back the same insult and they start to quarrel. The audience is then introduced to Father Jesús ([[Danny Trejo]]), a pastor-like zombie slayer and leader of the survivor's colony. As the survivors assemble in a small room to have a meal together, a groggy Hunter joins the crowd and gets to formally know the other survivors. Alison and Hunter start to get romantically passionate with each other.  All is well until a wave of normal zombies and a monstrously large zombie somehow make their way into the survivor's camp. The survivors are able to fend off the normal zombies but the gigantic zombie is seemingly unstoppable to the point that even bullets do not faze it. Jesús rushes in to save them and is able to mutilate the hulking zombie with his axe by slicing off its arm. However, Jesús is unable to defeat him wholly and as a result, the zombie slices off his head. The remaining survivors scramble into a car and drive off to an airport in hopes of being able to find a working aeroplane to fly off with.  The zombies, unshakable, still manage to track them down. Consequently, all of the survivors, except for Alison, Hunter, and Alison's brother Ricky (Jason K. Wixom), are killed. Mustering their courage, they confront the zombies and begin shooting them. At last, only the giant zombie is left. Having run out of bullets, Hunter is impaled by the sharp-clawed zombie. Nonetheless, he miraculously finds the energy to detonate a grenade, wiping out the creature and destroying the rundown airport. Just as the bomb explodes, Alison and Ricky climb into a truck and drive off to safety.  Alison vows to always remember Hunter and his courageous deed, echoing that he had finally found what he yearned for — peace. In the aftermath of the explosion, Hunter is shown to be still alive. He explains that he feels cursed as the zombies never seem to be able to kill him and decides to take his own life before the credits roll.

Their father left the family because of his children's disease and now lives in [[South America]].  Because of her situation, she wants to die on her 23rd birthday at noon. Since euthanasia is illegal in Germany, Lea approaches a Swiss organisation which offers assisted euthanasia. She travels to [[Zurich]] without telling her family. She moves into a hostel where she gets picked up by Michaela Orff, an employee of the organisation.

When they arrive, Lea tells them of heir plans. Her grandmother Maria and her sister Rita are shocked, but accept her decision while her mother Lena strongly refuses to do so.

She quips about death several times, saying that she will "never be lovesick again, never climb stairs again, never fear suffocation again." When they return to the hostel and go to bed, Lea has a fit during which she coughs painfully and [[Shortness of breath|desperately gasps]] for air.  The next day, the family goes to the organisation after having breakfast.
